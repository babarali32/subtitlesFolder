1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,000
That's

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,120
kind of the.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,800
Yeah.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,200
They're going to start

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,760
early.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,960
So yesterday what you were doing.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,240
Let me just open up the notes for the
so that we can continue

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,680
from the same point doing of.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,160
So the last example which we were learning

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,440
was to do

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,360
a comment

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,080
in which sorry
we had to create two branches in parallel

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,680
and then merge them to single main branch.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,400
And in there we witnessed

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,720
another kind of merged

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,360
legislative need which get close to
the first one was fast forward.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,280
The second one we just discussed

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,480
that we did not know that
what kind of merge this was.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,880
Okay,
so let's get into a little bit of you

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
before we actually begin that of

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,680
let's see,

22
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:25,200
how much do you remember?

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,440
Okay.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,400
So this is the scenario
that we have right?

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,640
We created to run this planet one,
planet two.

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,640
Now tell me, guys,
if I want to merge, let it so and mean

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,920
what kind of merge strategy

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,040
is going to be used by here

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,560
the faster because it is going to check

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,960
that if see merge

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,360
manage created the branch
the last minute merges

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,280
right now
that is the last limit still see merge

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,280
it will say yes when use

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,200
last forever

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,840
most technique and in there

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,680
are see merge will start

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
finding do see six of other

38
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,280
now when you want to merge
that one with the main

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,040
this path are going to be possible. Now

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,720
no this time fast forward
is not going to be possible.

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,800
So what will happen

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:02,280
so there there may be some polarity.

43
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,960
Is it necessary
that we will be having a merge

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,640
try conflict.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,640
We will be having a conflict.

46
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,040
Is it necessary?

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,720
Yes. That's not necessarily.

48
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,160
Those of you are saying
that you only have a conflict.

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,760
No, it's
not that we will be having a conflict.

50
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,600
The right answer to this question
is that now

51
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,560
you will have to do a manual merge
or maybe you're just going

52
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,400
to choose another strategy of merge
with this, which is called

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,640
Three Minds are recursive merge,

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,400
but Anthony Ramos are recursive merge.

55
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,120
There may or may not be a conflict.

56
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,240
Conflict is like, you know,

57
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,120
another part of the story.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
It may be there.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,160
It may not be there
when there is a conflict.

60
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,320
We are going to do that too.

61
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,680
Okay.

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,640
So let's assume that none of the user

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,160
planet, one of planet to make changes

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,880
on the same lines of the food
anywhere in the project.

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,360
So tell me,
is there going to be any conflict

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:27,480
then?

67
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, There is going to be no conflict.

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
So this is going to

69
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,000
come in here.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,920
Okay. So what will happen
if there is no conflict?

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Let's say we are in the condition
of no conflict, so it will happen.

72
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,520
There should see five go.

73
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,760
What should happen? And you guys predicted

74
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,240
merge happen and what what

75
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:05,760
happens when a merge happens? Yes.

76
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,400
Now what will happen?

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,080
These two comments are going to get merged

78
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,600
and they will create a new

79
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,080
comet
which will have both DC five and six.

80
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:41,320
Cool.

81
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,680
And what class seven? What do you mean?

82
00:05:43,720 --> 00:06:19,120
That in one class?

83
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
This is not for class, this is for Comet.

84
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
Okay?

85
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,720
And it's not going to combine

86
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,320
classes
at this point to combine the both cause.

87
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,920
Okay, so

88
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,120
main class

89
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,640
will get to the poles of we want to do

90
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,640
if the codes are not on the same line,

91
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,400
it does not have a conflict.

92
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,960
It might be nine nine number then.

93
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:03,240
Yes, obviously it's going
to incorporate the code for both of them.

94
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,680
If the line numbers are conflicting, then
we will have to resolve that conflict.

95
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:16,320
Madam, does that answer your question

96
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:35,880
that you

97
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,640
were downloading right and then merge?

98
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,160
Okay.

99
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,040
Those of you who have questions,
I shall let some of some it up

100
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,840
in one statement because it gets out of me
to read it in bits.

101
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,960
So maybe I lose track.

102
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,080
So try to sum up all the question
and one step.

103
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,800
Okay guys.

104
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,520
So I will deal about this
recursive strategy, how it's working,

105
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,880
and I'll answer the question.

106
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,800
So if you have any, you just have them
prepare to discuss them.

107
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,240
I'm with you about this
if we have no conflict.

108
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,040
Okay, so let's discuss the case

109
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,920
when there is a problem.

110
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,840
Now let's sit that

111
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,200
in C5

112
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,800
there was a mean file

113
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,080
and you think there are all coming.

114
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,640
That's and let's say that in here
we have ab1

115
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:51,760
and also in C six we had up B one.

116
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,080
The user one of that one made some changes
on me and P one on line number

117
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,120
three and line number five

118
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,160
also the user to make some changes

119
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,280
in the main and P one on the line numbers

120
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:29,760
three and five.

121
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,080
Okay.

122
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,480
Now tell me that
when we are going to merge, C five

123
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:45,000
is going to be a conflict.

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Yes, because the same line numbers
have been changed in the same files

125
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,120
and did does not know that which one

126
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,520
is the updated one
and which one do you want to actually

127
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,080
assignment is that this is the updated way
you are updated.

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,880
So what's going to happen
A merge conflict is going to be a get

129
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,920
will not be able to resolve
this kind of conflict on its own

130
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,840
and it just going to ask you to
resolve it so it will open up

131
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,120
something like we witnessed yesterday.

132
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,240
These dots that you had had and

133
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,800
like this time with

134
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,760
I guess there was

135
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,040
mudslides or incoming side,

136
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,240
there is going to be one code
and there's going to be the other two.

137
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,280
You can either decide to keyboard
for that.

138
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,480
You see these lines

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,960
or you can decide to

140
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,320
simply get one of the two

141
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,760
that you're going to see.

142
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,320
And depending upon which code
you actually need.

143
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,080
So it's possible that you say, okay,
I want to keep the changes made by user

144
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,480
three and I don't want to have the changes
buttons one

145
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,000
So you can delete this line
and keep this line

146
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,880
for the one and choose to keep this line

147
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,000
and delete this one.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,040
That's your choice.

149
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,880
And once you have resolve the conflict,
you run the code, it's working fine

150
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,040
and you're sure about it.

151
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,280
Then what's going
to happen? You are going to

152
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,160
come at it.

153
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,160
So it gets merged

154
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,840
to resolve the conflict

155
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:46,320
and you merge.

156
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:59,720
Okay, so this one,

157
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
this is a clearly

158
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,640
unsupported recursive merge.

159
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
And this one also in this.

160
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,600
Like we have to just discuss
do one extra and course

161
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:25,360
that's it.

162
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,160
Okay, so now we are going to do something.

163
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,040
Examples.

164
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,360
So yesterday what we did, we actually

165
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,480
so this step we were done,

166
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,400
we merged our code of planet One

167
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,680
and applied to into our main branch
and we did that stuff

168
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,360
in our local repository right.

169
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,840
So all of you have crashed up
to that point.

170
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,080
I believe.

171
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,320
So we will be starting
from that point over and

172
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,080
I want you guys to open up

173
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,640
your GitHub accounts

174
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,920
of this.

175
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,120
So let's go to the zip screen,
which we had that

176
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,920
sort of system for.

177
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,720
Okay. So I'm going to

178
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,600
open up this

179
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,560
diagram
again that is going to redo this stuff.

180
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,000
Now, my showing you the map

181
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,280
to how you can proceed with merging

182
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,000
if you want to merge on

183
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:06,800
GitHub, then we start blank.

184
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,600
New exercise.

185
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,560
Mine was not working well yesterday.

186
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,040
How soon you can get the code
from my GitHub or anyone else

187
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,720
but doing this example over and over
again, it's not going to be possible.

188
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
I'm really sorry.

189
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
It's going to take a lot of time and

190
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,040
I cannot do that.

191
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,800
I have a lot of the new stuff
to teach you guys.

192
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,920
So if you want to have the code,

193
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,120
you can have my code, I can schedule

194
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,360
and I can
you help us get the pool to the method.

195
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,280
I talked to you
yesterday and then we can do

196
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,520
this.

197
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,360
Mention the steps.

198
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:54,520
If you remember.

199
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,080
So okay, yesterday what we did is that we

200
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,040
solved the conflicts on the local
and we pretend to be a team.

201
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,440
The WHO has downloaded the apple

202
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,120
known to Apple and checking the code
that if it's working fine.

203
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,120
Yes if it's that personality,
merge them locally.

204
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
Okay. Let's assume that he was successful.

205
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,840
We check the code and he has

206
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,720
done everything locally
and he wants to update them.

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,920
So what he's going to do,
if he wants to update the remote

208
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,920
from the local

209
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,080
and he has merged everything,
what should be

210
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,800
his next step?

211
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
Cool.

212
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,840
He already pulled up
so I will then he put plugin he's

213
00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:03,560
now doing updates on local right.

214
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,880
Yes comment and then he will push the pool

215
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,400
updates and the view.

216
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,960
Let me show you

217
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,280
get log of

218
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,120
the plans have been more successful.

219
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,840
It is our last commit

220
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,040
which was made on Saturday,

221
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,920
January 29 at this particular time.

222
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,000
So we did that actually.

223
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,520
Thank you for having my back over here.

224
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,480
The Yeah we have another

225
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,240
yes. Now

226
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,400
I have the option to push it

227
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,480
and update everything,
but we will not be doing that

228
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,560
because I want to teach you guys
another method of doing this on GitHub.

229
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Okay,
so now I'm going to open up the GitHub

230
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,960
and I'm going to show you guys
how you can proceed

231
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,720
with doing all the stuff on this

232
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,680
particular platform.

233
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,960
So right now I'm going to pretend
to be the person who worked on

234
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,280
Planet One.

235
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,760
Okay?

236
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,080
I was done working on slide one
and I'm sure that my code is correct

237
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,240
and I want someone to review it and merge.

238
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,800
So what should be my step?

239
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:59,080
What should I do?

240
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:27,400
Make upload request? Yes.

241
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,480
So simply click on all requests

242
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,720
and create a new request.

243
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
So my piece is going to be made

244
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,160
and I'm going to merge

245
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,880
my Planet one, including.

246
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,680
So I have selected base as me
and the one branch

247
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,600
which I want to merge this planet. One

248
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,880
at the non

249
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,080
nuclear class

250
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,760
I've just been made over here

251
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,600
and that at one point you

252
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,680
and then I said

253
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:35,840
create a pull request.

254
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,200
Okay, so

255
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,840
now what is there?

256
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,520
We can see that
these are the changes in both the

257
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,440
and both the branches.

258
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,800
So this is some additional code
that I have in Planet one

259
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,840
which is not going to be there
in my main works.

260
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,080
I can review that over here.

261
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,480
All right.

262
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,720
And I'll check it down in my

263
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,920
local computers.

264
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,760
Right now you are just using GitHub.

265
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,400
Okay, So I do not need to go into my local

266
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,440
review and I can have a reviewer
reviewer assigned.

267
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,040
But right now
you do not have any assigned.

268
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,480
I'll just assign syntax and badges myself

269
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,840
labels and I would say
it's an enhancement.

270
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,920
None, nothing else.

271
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,600
I want to sum it up
and I will just write the comment

272
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,480
that I have successfully

273
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,640
completed

274
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,520
the feature Planet one review

275
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,680
and please let us

276
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,440
okay, let me know what you guys

277
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,760
have done to do this one and then we'll be
proceeding together forward

278
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,000
then.

279
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,200
Now say create, upload, request

280
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,800
so as being the person
who will not like one, I have successfully

281
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:51,320
created a pull request.

282
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,080
Okay, now let's click on our A system

283
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:01,960
you give me.

284
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,880
Now you can follow me
after this particular

285
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
stuff that you have done.

286
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,520
We open up a pull request.

287
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Just if you want to do that,
you can simply do that

288
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:27,960
on GitHub.

289
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,400
Okay, so now what?

290
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,480
What is going to happen?

291
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,640
The team is going to have a look
at the requisite attributes.

292
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,520
You say that, okay, I got a pull request
so that let me have a look at that.

293
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,720
You'll click on that pull request

294
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,520
and then you'll see that
there's a pool request.

295
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,360
Say that we dropped
that one has been added successfully

296
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,760
will say, okay, let's have a look at it.

297
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,800
It'll click on it.

298
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,720
And he'll say, okay, let's have first
look at the files

299
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,120
to review the code with the.

300
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,400
He said that everything looks good

301
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,520
and then he'll go back to the conversation

302
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,320
and okay, wait, I'll go back to

303
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,040
the set.

304
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,600
A wait a second round.

305
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,960
Second has backstory, but I can select

306
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:56,520
was just in file changes.

307
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,720
And what is this?

308
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,080
Why is different file changes?

309
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,560
What do you mean by this?

310
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,920
I don't understand.

311
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,280
What is mine

312
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:25,440
different than yours? But.

313
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,840
Okay, so

314
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,480
like it's yours is also read.

315
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,200
It's not false.
It's just that the view is different.

316
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:48,600
Let me see if how to change the view.

317
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,040
You're showing everything in one thing
and that one's different.

318
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,920
Okay, so then you has that.

319
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,200
Yeah. Okay. Unified

320
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,400
and split.

321
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,600
Yeah. You can change the view.

322
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
Follow over here.

323
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,280
So don't get worried if it's unified.

324
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,560
Also, like, yeah, it makes sense to let's

325
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,480
have a look at unified one.

326
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
Exactly like it shows me now that

327
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,960
instead of this line,
this line is going to be present.

328
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,920
This is the addition of the lines.

329
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,520
And these are also addition

330
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:38,320
of the lines.

331
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,960
Okay.
Now let's get back to the composition.

332
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's move it out.

333
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,880
At this point, you guys find some error.

334
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,560
I've I've been lucky.

335
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,520
I found some error
and I do want to merge it right now.

336
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,560
So what I would say, I would say, hey,
I've found that

337
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,440
your work has some errors.

338
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,200
Can you please

339
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,520
resolve them

340
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,800
all? Let me know.

341
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,320
I'll just comment on it. Right.

342
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,040
So this is the

343
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,160
conversation that is going on.

344
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,360
This was the message.

345
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,280
And then I applied this message.

346
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,240
Now the plan one user
is going to have this message

347
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,120
on his previous right to view it
and it will sit.

348
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,480
Okay, well, let me correct the error.

349
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,080
After getting the error, he's
going to again update the message

350
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
and he will let the person know

351
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,760
that, yes, I have resolved it.

352
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,280
I was resolved the conflict or errors
or whatever was there.

353
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,160
Can you not try to pull it
on budget again?

354
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,720
Why not?

355
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,400
Sure I can do that right now.

356
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,840
Let's say he again.

357
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,840
You view the changes
and this time he said that,

358
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,280
okay, everything looks good.

359
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,240
Go back to the optimization, see

360
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:19,840
everything that's good.

361
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,440
Perfect.

362
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,520
Breaking sounds as my sound breaking. Nice

363
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,160
of breaking.

364
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,240
So let

365
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:36,960
all in.

366
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,760
Great.

367
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,400
So now, once
we have entered this comment message,

368
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,720
what we are going to do is to communicate

369
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,480
just to make sure that the conversation
is nice and good and everyone

370
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,040
who goes through it also gets to know
that what the progress is.

371
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,760
And then this is the point

372
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,120
where we will merge the branch
by clicking on this button.

373
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,000
It shows us that this branch
has no conflict with the base client.

374
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,120
It means that it will be merged
automatically.

375
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,920
Now, from the options
we have different kind of merge,

376
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,040
slash and merge, rebase and merge.

377
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,320
Okay. So what does this do?

378
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,680
Create a merge coming
all commits from this branch

379
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,680
will be added to the base,
but they are a merge come in but

380
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,080
it will take all the commits of the off
the child branch and put them in

381
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,000
the parent branch.

382
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,720
Squash and merge scratching
merge is going to basically

383
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,360
squash all the comments in the child
branch.

384
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,720
Make it one comment
and only add that particular company

385
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,400
commit in the baselines.

386
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,120
Right now
we will be just using create a most common

387
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,040
the first one you logically need
discretion merge and rebase

388
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,080
and once we are not going to be going into
that so

389
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,680
simply select it.

390
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,880
Our most common.

391
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,880
After that we will simply click

392
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,480
on Merge to request.

393
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,120
So this is the commit message
that is going to be placed.

394
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,560
This is our email address.

395
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,880
And then after that
you will simply click on confirm merge

396
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,840
and it's going to start merge.

397
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,480
Okay.

398
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,800
Well, the request
that says fully merged and close.

399
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,560
Now if I have a look at my request, it's

400
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,800
not going to be
there because let's resolve

401
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,880
we have merged it.

402
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:22,200
So this point,
do you guys have any questions?

403
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,560
Okay.

404
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,960
Let me show you on our system.

405
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,240
Okay.

406
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,680
Now we have read it one add.

407
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:37,680
If I have a look at the comments,

408
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,760
the feature update,
one has been added successfully

409
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,920
and then after that commit the most commit

410
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:50,840
that it's there to.

411
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,080
Okay.

412
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,440
Meanwhile, let's say
the planet two was also added

413
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,200
and this person who was working on

414
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,640
it also wants to merge in the main branch.

415
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,120
So what he will do again,
he will go to pool request

416
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,880
and he'll click on

417
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,960
create new request.

418
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,000
This time the base is going to be main,
but the other one

419
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,560
is going to be Planet two.

420
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,840
To do that, see that it shows
the message can automatically merge

421
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,120
because there is

422
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,520
a conflict now.

423
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,640
So it has already did

424
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,200
detected that.

425
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,680
But still we can create a pull request.

426
00:31:51,680 --> 00:32:00,080
So we will be creating
first upload request.

427
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,040
I have added the feature to

428
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,920
and then will create

429
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:24,600
the pull requests.

430
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,080
Last time it was joined
us that no conflicts.

431
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,840
The branch is able to merge, but this time
you get a message to this branch.

432
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,080
Have a conflict that must be resolved

433
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,960
and it's showing.

434
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,880
It's showing us the file
which says conflict.

435
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,480
So main Java has some politics right

436
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,920
now. Let's assume that this one request

437
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,120
of visible to are keenly

438
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,240
and he clicked on it
he said okay apply it to

439
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,840
is that I want to add this feature
to let me click on that

440
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,360
and then he'll say, okay, it is a conflict
and it wants to be resolved.

441
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,800
Okay, let's resolve it.

442
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,080
Simply click on resolve Conflict

443
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,440
and it's going

444
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,720
to open up the school in front of him

445
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:42,880
like this.

446
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,440
Now he needs to select that record.

447
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,920
Does he want to keep.

448
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,360
So this is the code

449
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,160
coming from the planet to merge and
this is the code which is already there.

450
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,560
They are both in conflict.

451
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,280
So in this scenario he will say, okay,
I need both of them

452
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,080
because they both are a unique feature,
so I need to move those lines

453
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,440
and we'll have both the codes

454
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,280
in his file menu job and after that

455
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,400
he will click on Mark as a result.

456
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,400
So resolve this conflict.

457
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,880
Let me know that
we are going to click on Mark as result

458
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,240
of the conflict.

459
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,920
Okay, now let's click on Mark as a result

460
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,360
of its results.

461
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,160
Now we are going to click on commit marks

462
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,360
just once.

463
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,400
Here is all the conflict.

464
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,680
Now we have to commit the merge,
so we click on commitments

465
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,800
to leave a message called Click
successfully

466
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,760
Resolve

467
00:35:46,920 --> 00:36:02,080
and ready to merge.

468
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,920
Well, we asked you got five of the lines

469
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,920
or different numbers
and that's why do not have a conflict.

470
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,040
Remember I told you guys that the conflict
is going to be there if

471
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,800
same goal is going to be there
on the same line

472
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:26,360
number.

473
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,240
Yeah.

474
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,240
Okay. Now

475
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
will say comments

476
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,000
and after making a command

477
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,280
will click on large pull request

478
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,280
and then can follow

479
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,960
certain rules.

480
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,280
Okay.

481
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,000
So my it's all set up.

482
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,920
I have successfully been like that too.

483
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,560
I can simply go to my
code now and I can see that

484
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,600
I have successfully merged it.

485
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,320
Let's have a look at comments.

486
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,200
So back to feature has been added
and then after that we have

487
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,600
let us commit, which is this one.

488
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,600
And if I show you
there have to just create at this point

489
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,080
it has the full code for planet

490
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,960
to kind of one.

491
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,080
Okay,
so that's how you do a merge on GitHub.

492
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,160
So it's your own choice
whether you want to do it on GitHub

493
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,480
or you want to do it on local,
that's that's personally dependent on you

494
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
in your work environment.

495
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,760
It's going to be I do
I will recommend that whenever you are

496
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,760
working on a project you want to merge,

497
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,240
just do it locally on your own system

498
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,920
because before merging,
I really want you guys

499
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,920
to be sure that the code is working
and there are no letters and then only.

500
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,760
So you cannot have
this approach also that you

501
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
don't do repository on your system.

502
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,840
Switch to that branch.

503
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,400
Updated check
whether everything is working fine.

504
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,240
Fine.

505
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,560
If yes, then you can simply come to get up
and resolve that conflict.

506
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,480
Result of move.

507
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,480
So that's how you are.

508
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,040
Okay.

509
00:38:47,040 --> 00:39:13,320
So to this point,
any questions that you may have?

510
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,920
Nothing that

511
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,560
and now we are going to discuss

512
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,640
a few more information.

513
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,440
I think we will go ahead and

514
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,480
the largest in the

515
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,720
what we don't even need to go to our ID
does all that you can do it and becomes

516
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,360
Yeah obviously like
just like we did on the remote right now

517
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:58,120
we did not have to go to our I think
we simply merged everything on the GitHub.

518
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,960
We did that
without using any of the stuff.

519
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,400
Okay.

520
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,440
So a little bit more
I'll teach you about GitHub.

521
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,720
If you click on inside

522
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,880
and then you click on what

523
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,200
here you can see

524
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,720
our is the workflow how they are

525
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,080
merging into mean, at which point

526
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,960
where they emerged

527
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,040
and have a view of that

528
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,880
by clicking on inside and then network

529
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,480
not done.

530
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,760
Today topics are almost ended,
but you still have some examples

531
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,200
that I'll let you a few more.

532
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,360
So Okay, so I'm going to say
but what do you mean was in GitHub?

533
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,520
Don't we need to pull that
most code to our local.

534
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:06,960
Okay.

535
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,320
So even when we have emerged in GitHub

536
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,440
and we still want to work on that project,
obviously

537
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,600
then we will pull that go into our logo

538
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:31,400
to update our local repository.

539
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:31,920
Okay.

540
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,880
And apart from that,
do do we download a new clone?

541
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
If you are on a

542
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,400
new system,
you do not have that project already.

543
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,520
Then you make a new clone.

544
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,320
But if you already have that project
then you do not make an import.

545
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,120
You simply pull it right? Yes.

546
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:29,760
I should go ahead.

547
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,960
I think your terminal
the only push left now

548
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,080
we do not need that
because we did it on GitHub.

549
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,400
Yes, exactly.

550
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,920
We did that on GitHub
and we would not need to push everything

551
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:52,880
from our local to remote
because we did have a GitHub.

552
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,440
Okay.

553
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,920
So yeah, this is let's do one thing
now, let's open up my funky one.

554
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,520
I'm opening up my funky folder
and doing a big bash.

555
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,720
You two.

556
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:14,760
I also recommend that
you guys do the same.

557
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,600
I open the funky

558
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,320
that we created yesterday and

559
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:26,360
I open up a big bash with you.

560
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,760
I do get more.

561
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:39,080
Just see the colors that are different.

562
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,200
Okay, so is my

563
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,120
local repository

564
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,680
of this particular user updated

565
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,680
that this
this repo updated to a more or not

566
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,280
the saying no.

567
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,960
And what's your opinion the rest of you

568
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,840
just to negate

569
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:41,480
how much you said yes so right.

570
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,800
You mean yes or no.

571
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:51,200
So I'll repeat my question.

572
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,480
I will repeat my question.

573
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,880
The question is that

574
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,400
the user funky

575
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,760
who was working on Planet One,
does it have the updated wrap,

576
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:10,680
which we just did some updates on?

577
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,080
No, it does not have it right because
this is the funky user who worked on

578
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,640
Planet One. I got to

579
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,280
ask that.

580
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,000
I give you that information.

581
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,280
The funky user. What about that one?

582
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,600
So it does not have the updated wrap.

583
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,840
So he needs to update his record.

584
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:40,440
So what he will do is get fetch.

585
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,440
He sees that

586
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,200
there are two updates.

587
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,680
The main and the planet launch.

588
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,200
So if he wants to update the main
branch, what

589
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,960
he's going to do

590
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,880
first to check out the mean

591
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,960
and then he ready to get

592
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:21,200
cool.

593
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,480
So after checking out Main and doing

594
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,640
Get cool, he is going to have

595
00:46:27,640 --> 00:48:09,840
the updated code.

596
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,520
So we to mention this also

597
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,280
in order

598
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:28,200
to update your local branch. So

599
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,400
and then just before the

600
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,760
the let's do the thing for user

601
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,720
junkie there is my user jump in this.

602
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,760
So I open up

603
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,960
and I open up the git bash at this point.

604
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:11,280
Now I also want him
to have the updated code,

605
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,440
so get

606
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,360
Jack out

607
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,520
me make sure that

608
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,760
that you are in the chunk
you want the check user

609
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,200
effect to see that
whether if he needs to update

610
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,760
yes he does need to update

611
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,200
and now get code

612
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,440
he all also now has the same updated code.

613
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:58,040
The update is that is zero. Okay

614
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,240
now let's start working on you require

615
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,760
let's do one more example

616
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,080
of the same stuff that we have done
already.

617
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,080
Let's start

618
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:21,840
merging.

619
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,120
Okay.

620
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,600
Let's assume now that there is a new
requirement requirement which says that

621
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,600
work on feature law.

622
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,120
And so he has to

623
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,320
work on one one

624
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,240
and funky has to work on

625
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,240
good, lawless, convoluted, convoluted.

626
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,960
What's the meaning of

627
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,520
file deletion like the Mathematica code

628
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:12,560
should work.

629
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,160
Yeah.

630
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,400
So get log is going to actually get you

631
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,560
a little bit confused over here

632
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:23,320
because it's going to show you it's random

633
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:31,640
and the only thing I would recommend
that you get from at

634
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,280
this point is the hats and the commits

635
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,480
that they are finding.

636
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,560
Apart from that,
I think if you get a log, one line,

637
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:51,480
it made me a little bit better picture.

638
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:51,760
Okay.

639
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,080
So now these are
this is a kind of better picture

640
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:02,400
for your file logs.

641
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,160
This is a little bit to.

642
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,560
But the most important thing in this

643
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,080
is that your origin slash made

644
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,400
is on this particular
kind of that's that's it.

645
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,640
This is your important
information that lead to

646
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,280
your original

647
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,160
planning to then
on this particular company.

648
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:31,400
But this log does not give us
very good information about

649
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,800
whether this commit
is included in our main branch or not.

650
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,560
This this information is not included
in with log

651
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,760
in order to have a good of logs.

652
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,960
I would recommend that
you go to your particular branch

653
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,560
on the GitHub and click
on this particular comments over here

654
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,120
and then you'll see
a nice and good history of the comments.

655
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,840
So whenever you want to have a look

656
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,240
at the logs in multiple branches

657
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,200
this go to GitHub and utilize whole.

658
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,960
It's a better

659
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,000
okay, so let's open up

660
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:22,280
the requirements
so you have to work on one one.

661
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,440
So let's pretend to be chunky now.

662
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,280
Okay. So junkie is there

663
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,840
Oak Island Chunky Score System.

664
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,000
So Junkie wants to add a new lonely one.

665
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,440
I'll open up the console.

666
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,840
You are looking at
what is going to be my very

667
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,080
first step

668
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,000
yet one

669
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,160
one, one.

670
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,360
And then check out of that one.

671
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,400
Check out one more

672
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,320
of this.

673
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,800
Basically drawing

674
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,240
a new

675
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,720
update

676
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,760
with me branch.

677
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:22,440
So this is our main branch,
which is no update.

678
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,280
So this is just one.

679
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,560
And we created a new branch to let us see

680
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,000
more and more

681
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,160
open up

682
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,920
our intelligent junkie over here
and how I switched to the branch.

683
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,160
I need to make sure of that.

684
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,360
Yes, I only need one for each.

685
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,800
Then I'll add and plus one more than one.

686
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:58,560
And our moon is going to have
some kind of attributes.

687
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,760
Let's call them color only for now.

688
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,480
And training.

689
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,080
This what

690
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,560
else does it have ready is

691
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,080
saying

692
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,640
like intensity

693
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,480
in our main branch.

694
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,920
Oh, that's some

695
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,960
features of that in

696
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:51,480
11.11 or

697
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,080
the new

698
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,760
one one

699
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,000
you guys

700
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,920
Not until this point.

701
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,480
Probably the next step is going
to be simply to commit this over here.

702
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,480
So get add dot get comment

703
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,640
dash AM and it'll make the commit
they're find that

704
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,280
one feature

705
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:46,200
as been added.

706
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,600
So I just made a comment
with all these features on one

707
00:58:52,880 --> 00:59:12,840
line to name it means so.

708
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,760
Okay so now

709
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,280
let's

710
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,720
pretend

711
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,240
to be working on

712
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,680
some funky
I to responsibilities to work out the move

713
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,840
to and make some changes in Sun

714
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,000
a bit. Sun.

715
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,600
I have an update.

716
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,520
Yeah I just it's not

717
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,760
so this is the responsibility of funky

718
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,000
left open up the

719
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,360
project for funky and I have it here.

720
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,720
Here it is.

721
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,400
So again, the first step is going to be
to open up the terminal for Funky.

722
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,800
So make sure that you are terminal

723
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,840
for funky and then

724
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,440
create a new branch.

725
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:32,000
That branch, let's call it

726
01:00:33,960 --> 01:01:08,040
what we want to.

727
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,240
So we are going to play

728
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,360
simply a new class named Mode

729
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,560
two and same features we had for than one.

730
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:38,400
We are going to add them over here.

731
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,400
Well, I have to be very honest with you.

732
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,840
We do have a way of doing that.

733
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,320
But I would like to,
if you that I never commend you to use

734
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,800
your get with ideas
and never rely on that.

735
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,000
And personally, I use that I have a don't
have my own system

736
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:06,000
figuring it.

737
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,240
Okay.

738
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,000
Now in our main mode, what we are
going to do we have to make some updates

739
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,120
regarding one
but this time and let's do one

740
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,000
less accidentally, let's say we press

741
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,320
or here we started

742
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:26,720
deletion or modal features.

743
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,880
We did not did this on purpose. That's it.

744
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,440
Just by mistake

745
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,240
on purpose.

746
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,720
We are in general purpose,

747
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,840
purpose.

748
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,160
Okay.

749
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,000
So these are changes that you need
and have.

750
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:38,480
Okay.

751
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,760
Now only one job is left
for this particular user.

752
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,720
You also needs to do some updates in Sun.

753
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:47,960
So what do you think?

754
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,000
Should those changes be done right now
or should you create

755
01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:05,440
a new branch for that?

756
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,280
Well, I should be totally dependent on you
that your own personal choice.

757
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,880
But obviously we are
we are seeing that we are assuming

758
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,560
this is a big project complex group.

759
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,000
So I want
honestly want to have a new branch.

760
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,720
No, I would like to on this front

761
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,520
for the update.

762
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,800
So simply say let's make our comment

763
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,840
bit at DOT,

764
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,200
get permission that I am

765
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,000
the new feature on to have been

766
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,840
and now I'm switching my terminals

767
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,800
that is now by now you guys should know
how to make your comment

768
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:41,520
once you have added that.

769
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,760
Okay so this one everyone is with me.

770
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:55,640
Are we all synchronize?

771
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:00,720
Okay, let's do one more thing for both
the users who worked on one

772
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:06,720
and two,
let's push these branches to guitar.

773
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,800
So for chunky

774
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:14,040
get push dash
you are region more than one.

775
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,040
I will press enter so if I have pushed

776
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,760
this bunch to the more and for funky

777
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,960
get push

778
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,520
that you do origin mode to

779
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:42,000
so both my branches are company

780
01:06:42,560 --> 01:07:03,120
and they are sent on GitHub.

781
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,160
Okay now we want to also work on

782
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,360
the update strike in this time.

783
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,440
So for that
for creating a new branch also.

784
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,320
So we should be create the new words from

785
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,280
this person
who was working on more diversity

786
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,280
creative, not from

787
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:42,480
us. Well,

788
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,640
it depends upon few conditions.

789
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,840
Well,
obviously it's pretty logical, right?

790
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,480
I would just let you know

791
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,800
the updates he wants to make are on.

792
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,920
So right.

793
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,080
He wants to make updates in some

794
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,320
of those updates.

795
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,680
But any just dependent on whatever he did

796
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:09,560
and see if

797
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:22,400
okay if they are very dependent on CAA
let's say by chance

798
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:33,000
they were dependent on CAA,
then he will be creating it for CAA.

799
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,040
But if they are independent
then he will be creating for

800
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,400
the file. That's six.

801
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:44,720
Is this clear to everyone?

802
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,400
I said now maybe is like kind of what
it to your already I guess

803
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,680
I'll agree so

804
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:03,200
as we are not dependent on CAA

805
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,760
the updates to be made in sun I'm
not dependent on what we didn't see it.

806
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,520
We will be creating a new branch
out of five guests

807
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,960
and six

808
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:30,960
sun updates.

809
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,160
So let's go to our user

810
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,800
who was working on to that.

811
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,520
Which one is that?

812
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,640
Yeah, that's funny.

813
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,000
So he was first
checked out to the main branch

814
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,760
and then he will create a new branch

815
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,800
name sudden update

816
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,120
and then he will check to this

817
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:08,960
an update.

818
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,520
Okay he is in and sun updates
now kept to minutes.

819
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,720
Read this one and let me know.

820
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,040
Oh you deleted your watch.

821
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,800
Just you have it on your remote right

822
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:43,960
that from your work
so let's open up our intelligent

823
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,600
and let's have a look at the

824
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,520
funky one.

825
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,440
Okay so

826
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,920
simply we'll go to our

827
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,000
solar system.

828
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,840
Maybe

829
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,200
and we will change the name from moon to

830
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,640
planets.

831
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,960
No, no, I'm sorry, son.

832
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,400
I'm just one sun. So let's see. Let's.

833
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,960
I want to change this. Time to end.

834
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,640
So that's one update that we did.

835
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,400
I also want to, in my name,
make this an integer,

836
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,720
that this temperature

837
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,120
best known in digital world.

838
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,280
So integer

839
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:44,840
being 17.

840
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,040
Okay.

841
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,160
So the updates that you need,
we can update the template.

842
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,120
Just string to end.

843
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:55,560
And then when we made the update
that we just

844
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,200
changed the temperature
and moved the and got it.

845
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:09,840
Come on.

846
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:22,640
Okay, you guys let me know
once you are done with this.

847
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,600
Okay? The next step is to

848
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:28,400
make a upcoming so get add dot

849
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,200
get comment

850
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,000
that share the updated

851
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:39,200
features of sun.

852
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:44,800
Then add.

853
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,080
Okay. Yeah. Good.

854
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,840
We made the comment
I'm going to show you on simulation.

855
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,240
We simply made a comment like this.

856
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,440
Pretty nice and simple.

857
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,960
It does from here.

858
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,280
And the name is nine

859
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,200
Learning

860
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:12,240
just like this.

861
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:17,320
Okay, guys, so let's come to the point
where are we going to merge

862
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,760
everything before that,
I want you guys to tell me

863
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,880
I need to push some of this to do mode
or to right.

864
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,360
So simply I'll go to my funky

865
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,520
head of said get push dash.

866
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,400
You are edge and

867
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,960
sun of the

868
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:44,280
Oh yeah do that to.

869
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,560
Okay now tell me,
do you want to resolve them on GitHub

870
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,720
or do you want to resolve these conflicts
on a local computer?

871
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:52,880
Make sure

872
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:05,320
that both are going to be just the same.

873
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,280
So let's choose one platform
and we can work over do

874
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,920
a branding

875
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:19,040
which was used more at work.

876
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:26,120
Well, if you are an experienced person
and you trust team, these are teammates

877
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:30,880
that they will be working time that
obviously you'll be using GitHub more.

878
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,800
Yes, that's right.

879
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,880
But if you are an inexperienced person
who does not trust your teammates,

880
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,120
then he is going to use the local one.

881
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,000
You need to download that check.

882
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,040
Go to my one
and then you will be doing all the stuff.

883
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,280
So at work, mostly GitHub is used

884
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,520
because they don't have time actually to.

885
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:59,400
You know, that's your logic and stuff
you don't do.

886
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:02,640
They don't do that.

887
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,600
Well, imagine in a company that

888
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,920
a person is no

889
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,320
checking your codes again and again.

890
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,040
Now we have leaders coming to you.

891
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,360
Hey, show me out, Show me a cool letter.

892
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,520
So this just doesn't work over there.

893
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,480
Everyone is responsible for their role.

894
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,160
So if you mess up your images
from home and

895
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:31,440
some dangerous use.

896
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,800
So when you have
that kind of responsibility,

897
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,920
trust me, your your brain,
it doesn't let you make mistakes

898
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:46,120
it makes sure that you are responsible
enough to do that

899
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,080
break.

900
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:55,720
Right.

901
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:58,320
Let's give a break to Dan and oh,

902
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:06,400
how about that?

903
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,840
I think you guys need great excuse
for breaking it

904
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:14,520
at 730.

905
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:18,320
Let's meet at 1145.

906
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,160
Okay. You want 10 minutes?

907
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:24,960
All of you are good with ten.

908
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,920
15 is good. Okay. I hope to fortify

909
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,160
and then we'll be

910
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:39,920
resuming from this point.

911
01:16:39,920 --> 01:33:35,680
But so

912
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:42,960
we are back.

913
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,320
And let's start

914
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:47,480
there.

915
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:51,920
We left having
pushed the next branch on GitHub.

916
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,880
Yes, we have got this sun up.

917
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,120
This officer.

918
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:59,160
Let's open
the GitHub, Let's go to our system

919
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:02,560
that lets you branches up.

920
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:06,480
Okay, so we have the moon one, two and sun

921
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,560
updates on this particular

922
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,600
branch.

923
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,360
Okay, Now let's do one thing.

924
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:19,160
Let's start opening up the pool request
and most branches

925
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:23,120
one by one.

926
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:27,600
So let's first of all merge
the branch seven

927
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,680
into the main branch.

928
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,920
So what do you guys think?

929
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:36,760
What kind of merge is supposed to happen
When we was one

930
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,960
with the main four,

931
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:41,880
it's going to be fast.

932
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,800
Very much so.

933
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:50,080
Something like this is going to happen.

934
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:50,320
Right?

935
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:53,440
Okay.

936
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:58,280
So we will go to our pull request.

937
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:01,680
We will go to now new upon request

938
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,960
and then the base should be made
and we should incorporate

939
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:08,680
more one.

940
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:09,840
And with that

941
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:18,760
we okay, now create one request.

942
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:23,760
The one has been added.

943
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,640
We merge

944
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,400
that nick on create pool request for

945
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:34,680
good.

946
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:36,160
Right.

947
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:37,960
Okay.

948
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:41,720
So as this is a password merge,
I told you guys that are not going to

949
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:44,040
no conflicts when we are doing a pass.
All right.

950
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:46,800
So it's good

951
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:50,200
value to be merged.

952
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:53,480
Thank you.

953
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:57,280
Because is the comment that we can have
I'm just showing you that command

954
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,600
right now, a chat history
regarding a particular branch

955
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,320
and then simply merge full

956
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:10,280
and confirm the month.

957
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,960
Let me show you the code

958
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:15,320
move.

959
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:21,520
One feature has been added
is merge into my main branch.

960
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,600
So this is something that we are done.

961
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:28,680
We let me know
when you guys are done to this point

962
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:41,720
and then we can proceed further.

963
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,600
Well, to delete a branch, you can

964
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,200
let us try

965
01:36:50,200 --> 01:36:53,040
to delete this planet too
because we do not need it.

966
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,560
Right? So

967
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,480
go to settings

968
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,760
but things we can do it from here.

969
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,840
Let me just quickly check the

970
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,520
branches,

971
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,960
actions and security

972
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:24,440
system

973
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,160
for somewhere zero here.

974
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:52,120
I just forgot that.

975
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:54,280
Okay. So

976
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,160
you do

977
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:02,640
okay.

978
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,840
View all matches and then okay.

979
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:07,600
Perfect scenario.

980
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:10,640
You need a branch,
you simply click on your branches

981
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:13,080
and then we can delete them from here.

982
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,720
So if you want to do one,

983
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:19,520
we can simply click on this button
and it's going to be deleted.

984
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:21,280
We want the planet to

985
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,920
get to leave that to

986
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,720
now. Planet one on Planet

987
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:40,800
two are not visible.

988
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,240
Okay, so now let's open up a pull request
to merge

989
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,600
a start

990
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,360
A first,
let's say we want to avoid sun updates.

991
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:01,920
First of all,
I want you guys to tell me one thing is.

992
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:10,800
The merge going to be of it or not?

993
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,960
No, it's not going to be
if that's our merge because the committees

994
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,960
we have changed

995
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:29,920
is there going to be any conflict?

996
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,320
Okay.

997
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:33,720
Is there going to be a conflict

998
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,840
way, way

999
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:42,360
and do not just copy

1000
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,520
one of what people are saying?

1001
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,960
Use your brain
and then tell me, will there be conflict

1002
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:18,560
that be So when does a conflict occur?

1003
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:35,440
First of all, let's review that.

1004
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,800
No, that's not the product you is change.

1005
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:43,720
Remember I told you that a conflict occurs
where the same lines are changed

1006
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,800
by two different

1007
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:52,680
persons, when same lines are changed
by two different persons.

1008
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:56,480
And then there is a conflict
because given is unable

1009
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:00,120
to decide that,
which one do you want to keep?

1010
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,000
Remember?

1011
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:07,680
So now tell me, do you guys think that
there will be a conflict?

1012
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:11,440
Let me show you what changed to solve it.

1013
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:16,160
We changed it to end and in our main
we changed it to

1014
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,160
this one.

1015
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:24,960
Was this change by anyone else? No.

1016
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,960
So when get made the branch

1017
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,760
this town was different

1018
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:36,120
and now in the branch it was added.

1019
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:39,480
But now when it's going back,
when we are merging it,

1020
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,840
it's still the same.

1021
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,360
When this particular branch
was made right.

1022
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,400
The history of this particular line
has not changed

1023
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:52,320
at that point.

1024
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,600
So the history is still the same.

1025
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,480
When spine to merge that back
put the line,

1026
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:02,480
then there should not be a conflict
according my concepts.

1027
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:07,680
Right.

1028
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:11,880
So as everyone hear about this
that there is not going to be a conflict.

1029
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,000
It's anyone who is unclear, not sure.

1030
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:14,560
Let me know.

1031
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:20,000
We can go into more depth of this
and have this conversation.

1032
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,720
Okay, so you guys and

1033
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:26,360
so let's try to open up the pool request

1034
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:29,920
and let's make a new pool request.

1035
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:35,000
So that updates

1036
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:39,000
able to merge, create, pull request.

1037
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,160
I'm not going to put any message.

1038
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:43,560
I'm just tired of that

1039
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:45,640
say checking

1040
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:50,120
the ability very do no conflicts
because the history is same of that

1041
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:52,600
particular line
when the branch was created

1042
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:58,120
multiple requests from

1043
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,960
and we are all over

1044
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:08,560
no conflicts at all.

1045
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,600
But this time
the strategy use was a little different

1046
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:35,560
and it was a premium march.

1047
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,680
We now we want to march

1048
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:41,240
this one to

1049
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:43,920
tell me, will it be faster? Much

1050
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:49,400
not a lot fast,

1051
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,840
but at the end
it's going to be other coercive

1052
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:56,360
merge that is going to happen.

1053
01:43:56,360 --> 01:44:19,200
Are so let's create info request going to

1054
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:31,000
be equal requests

1055
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:38,520
to create request.

1056
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:39,040
Okay.

1057
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:43,560
Says that this branch has conflicts
that must be resolved

1058
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,480
and these are the conflicts.

1059
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:51,840
Let's have a review.

1060
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:56,080
Okay.

1061
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,360
Now it's

1062
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:00,040
giving us

1063
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,880
those particular

1064
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:09,240
few pieces of code that were in conflict.

1065
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:16,280
But I left some space intentionally right?

1066
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,840
I left some space intentionally

1067
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:28,360
in order to avoid the conflict.

1068
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:31,520
But still, it's giving us this conflict.

1069
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:39,240
Why is that so?

1070
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:52,280
Part?

1071
01:45:52,280 --> 01:46:00,400
Yeah, well,
a big spaces, just like spaces, Yes.

1072
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:05,360
So what we did
is that this code is very similar

1073
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:10,920
to this one, right?

1074
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:13,880
Like almost everything,

1075
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,720
all the lines are same.

1076
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:18,280
So giving you a little bit intelligent to

1077
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:23,080
sort it while merging it.

1078
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:28,240
It recognized that
although the line spaces are not the same,

1079
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:32,640
but still this code
is like very much close to each other.

1080
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,560
So there might be a conflict.

1081
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,440
There might be, there might be not.

1082
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:41,160
So instead of doing everything
on its own, it gave you the

1083
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:46,040
authority to choose.

1084
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:50,480
Which one do you want to keep.

1085
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:54,120
So you just simply remove these names

1086
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,760
and then also like remove the space.

1087
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:02,360
And I would say, okay, now
these variable names,

1088
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:06,840
I don't want to have the same one,
so same mental one

1089
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:12,280
then one one and one.

1090
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:12,560
Okay.

1091
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:16,440
Do you guys get this concept that
why are we having a conflict over here

1092
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:19,120
although the left spaces.

1093
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,720
So it's a good thing for us right because

1094
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,800
the variable names were all the same.

1095
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,040
So we wanted to know that

1096
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,400
if we had not named them

1097
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:35,480
same, same then most probably
there wouldn't have been a conflict.

1098
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:39,160
But that's why we are putting a conflict
that that's a good thing.

1099
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,800
We know now that this button up
code needs some amendments.

1100
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:47,880
Obviously, that's resolved that conflict.

1101
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:57,560
Click on Mark as resolved
and then commit merge.

1102
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:02,280
No conflicts
other little from merge and everything is

1103
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:04,120
up to date

1104
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:08,240
in our solar system.

1105
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:34,000
So what we should.

1106
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,960
Well what of the code is more complex.

1107
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:40,560
So Mohammed,
the first thing is that you would be

1108
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,960
obviously two people
who are voting on the same project.

1109
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:47,560
The probability
of having the same variable

1110
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,880
is very less. Why?

1111
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:51,960
Because

1112
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:55,320
you name the variables
in an intelligent way.

1113
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:58,080
You name them so that

1114
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,760
they define what ever you are doing.

1115
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:02,960
So if you're already given
different features

1116
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:06,440
that obviously you will be having
different variable names.

1117
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:10,320
But if you get the same name,

1118
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:14,640
then they are going to be errors and bugs
and you need to like debug it.

1119
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:19,280
So obviously
it is not going to do everything for you.

1120
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:27,760
There is some caution
that you have to do on your own to.

1121
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,720
So that is this is the complete
workflow of our branch

1122
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:34,800
and you see how

1123
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:39,680
simple it becomes
when we are working on this using branches

1124
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:45,520
and stuff
to work on the same project. Yes.

1125
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:48,720
And that's because we are using
the same variable name.

1126
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:52,440
And apart from that also
we are also having seemed like a pool.

1127
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,040
So that's why

1128
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,720
now because there is a

1129
01:49:57,720 --> 01:50:00,560
merging and

1130
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:03,720
resolving conflicts

1131
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:11,640
clear to all of you,

1132
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:15,280
you just have to be very clear
about the concepts we are using.

1133
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:16,480
Very simple code.

1134
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,640
That's the reason I use doesn't look good

1135
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:21,360
just to make sure
that all of your concepts are clear.

1136
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:24,240
Over all of these classes.

1137
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:30,000
I tried my best to incorporate each
and every use case that benefits,

1138
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,160
but still there will be some scenarios
which I hope

1139
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:36,640
it will be impossible
for me to go through, because

1140
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,720
obviously all of you,
when working with be using

1141
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:43,640
different kinds of approaches
to, you know,

1142
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:47,760
work on branches and stuff like that,
you will be using different approaches.

1143
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:51,760
But if
you understand the concept of everything,

1144
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:56,640
how a conflict arises to resolve that,
how does it happen?

1145
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:57,360
If you understand

1146
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:00,880
these concepts, I am pretty much sure
that you will be able to easily

1147
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:04,640
resolve them and work your throughout.

1148
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:08,800
So this project is going to be
a very good practice for all of you

1149
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,800
to actually work on it
also and get your hands dirty or do

1150
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:18,400
anyone who has any problem
while working on the project

1151
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,480
and doing it in
the settlement shall tag me

1152
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:31,560
and I'll be there
to help you out with the get part.

1153
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:38,400
Okay, so now of your comments, simply
click on these comments that we have

1154
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:41,800
and if you want to any
at any particular version,

1155
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,160
simply on

1156
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:47,080
the code that we have for this

1157
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:49,600
that talks us to

1158
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:53,600
that, it takes us to that particular code
and what else we can do.

1159
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,680
We can also click browser at this point.

1160
01:51:56,680 --> 01:52:00,520
It would then work out,
which would be like our

1161
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,320
that was up to this point
to the first commit.

1162
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:08,440
If I want to have this go up,
I can simply download the zip file

1163
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:11,880
for this code
and I can have this put the source code

1164
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:14,880
on my system.

1165
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:18,480
So that's a shortcut way of getting
to previous comments,

1166
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:25,120
taking them in your system if you want
a previous version or something like that.

1167
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:28,400
One of the things
that I wanted to show you is that

1168
01:52:31,200 --> 01:52:32,800
I don't want you guys to follow me.

1169
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:35,840
I'm just going to show you on my system

1170
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:40,080
with the correct

1171
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:48,000
use of one second.

1172
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:48,280
Okay?

1173
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:54,600
So just pay attention
to whatever I'm doing.

1174
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,840
We know how to write someone.

1175
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,640
We can call if you want to, but right now

1176
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:03,360
we are not doing that.

1177
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:03,880
Okay, guys.

1178
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:08,440
So over here, what we see
is that we see a lot of comments

1179
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:12,000
that are one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

1180
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:19,200
So at any point in time
we want to just delete this comment.

1181
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,960
You want to read this, come in

1182
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:34,200
and do that.

1183
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:34,560
Okay.

1184
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:50,800
How will this coming?

1185
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,320
We will never guess that.

1186
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:56,520
Okay.

1187
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:00,320
To the command to delete your command.

1188
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:02,760
It's not recommended.

1189
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:05,720
First of all, I not teach you that, but

1190
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:09,600
it's not recommended.

1191
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,880
Make sure that when you are making
comments you are very vigilant about it.

1192
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,640
But obviously you can,
you know, by mistake.

1193
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:18,560
Some make some make a comment
and you want to.

1194
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,640
That can happen.

1195
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:23,040
So in order to welcome it,
you will simply use the

1196
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:26,280
command, get reset.

1197
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:26,920
That's

1198
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,200
my typing

1199
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:44,240
for you.

1200
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:46,880
So that's the command that we use
to delete the

1201
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:52,080
first coming,
the latest one and move our hat

1202
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:55,440
to the second last comment.

1203
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:57,120
Get reset.

1204
01:54:57,120 --> 01:55:00,080
I had one

1205
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:03,520
so you will see when I run

1206
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:07,000
this command might he did user
the one is going to disappear.

1207
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,920
So let me run this

1208
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:17,280
and now let me show you the last.

1209
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,400
Is that the move
the the last of it that we had?

1210
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:22,560
Yes, that's removed.

1211
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:27,440
So that's how you made your leave
your comments in the

1212
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:55,840
local repository. But.

1213
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,000
Okay,
So now if you want to observe, delete

1214
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,840
this particular command in your import
repository, you have pushed it

1215
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,320
and you want what you needed from
over there also.

1216
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:36,480
So what's the activity that.

1217
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:37,120
Okay, so

1218
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,080
let's see,

1219
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:43,960
we can use the command we push, but right.

1220
01:56:43,960 --> 01:56:46,680
Not saying that it's not possible. Why?

1221
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:50,600
Because we deleted one
which was already there in the requisite

1222
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:56,400
three and not seen that there is already
some of in order to do this push,

1223
01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:02,920
we have a command
which is with push force.

1224
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:07,680
So we have to force push it
and then it's going to be deleted

1225
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:46,640
on the remote.

1226
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:47,640
What about the history?

1227
01:57:47,640 --> 01:57:50,720
The command is gone now delete it.

1228
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,120
We have deleted it.

1229
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:56,760
There is way to restore that.

1230
01:57:56,760 --> 01:58:04,320
But I don't remember.

1231
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,360
The command

1232
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:08,520
did restart.

1233
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:09,320
Maybe

1234
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:27,920
not the person is not pleased or

1235
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:52,000
let me set them up.

1236
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,920
So if we use get reset command
you can have that come back.

1237
01:58:57,240 --> 01:58:59,040
This is the syntax for that.

1238
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:01,360
So whenever you need it simply no ruler

1239
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:06,840
is meant to be your best friend.

1240
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:11,360
Okay, so now let's discuss
a few other things that we have and

1241
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:13,920
yeah,

1242
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,720
one thing that I wanted to discuss
with you guys

1243
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:20,240
in your settings on GitHub,

1244
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:23,040
whenever you want someone to collaborate

1245
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,680
and work on your app
is typically what you do.

1246
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:30,320
You simply
go to the settings of that repository

1247
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:35,760
and then you go to collaborative of.

1248
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:39,360
Then you have to get the best
before you get up.

1249
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:40,200
Give me a moment.

1250
01:59:40,200 --> 02:00:15,000
Let me check my password.

1251
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,840
I think after that

1252
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:22,080
you add people, so add people and get

1253
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:25,720
someone would give me the yo yo user name

1254
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:29,840
anyone.

1255
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:30,760
You have that file.

1256
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:33,200
But I have not

1257
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,000
unfortunately had anyone

1258
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,720
so that's going to be here.

1259
02:00:41,720 --> 02:00:44,160
I'll click on ADD

1260
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:50,120
to the user and now the person I sent in.

1261
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:52,520
Why do you need to go to your Gmail?

1262
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,840
What it is associated

1263
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:58,640
with this particular GitHub with
you are going to have a message.

1264
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:02,960
You go to that email
and you will see a pattern

1265
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:07,280
in why you need to accept that can work
and then you will be able to work on this

1266
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:10,200
so I can go ahead
and just accept whatever.

1267
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:12,000
So I'll just

1268
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:15,800
also in the right circle
and just to give you guys an idea

1269
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,760
at people

1270
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:28,280
and to people out there.

1271
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:32,960
So that's how I'm inviting these people
to work on my right.

1272
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:38,040
So now Say has accepted my request
and she is a collaborative now.

1273
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:44,040
She can work on this particular episode.

1274
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:50,000
So now she let me make a push

1275
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:52,560
and pull from this very

1276
02:01:56,760 --> 02:01:59,640
so whenever you want your friends
to work on the same project,

1277
02:02:00,120 --> 02:02:06,360
invite them as a collaborator.

1278
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:09,560
And apart from that, in the branches,

1279
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:15,960
we have some branch protection rules.

1280
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:19,600
So if I want to add some rule
on the main branch,

1281
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:23,720
I can click on Add rule

1282
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:26,960
and they are going to be different
protection techniques

1283
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:31,800
which I can have for this branch that says
acquire pull request before merging.

1284
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:33,800
So whenever anyone wants to

1285
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,800
merge he has to

1286
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:40,720
make upload request force
the data pool request.

1287
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:44,640
There is not going to be unloads
like an animal

1288
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:47,760
this and no one is going to be able
to push to my branch,

1289
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,960
almost to my branch,

1290
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:54,840
without making a pull request.

1291
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,960
And in order to approve the request
required approvals,

1292
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,040
I can see of approvals required before

1293
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:04,560
it's able to merge,

1294
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:11,400
I can select one that's upon me.

1295
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:11,760
Okay.

1296
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:15,600
So then other options are also there
that we can

1297
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:20,160
check in
or check out if you want to, have them.

1298
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:24,080
So these are stuff that you can do
with the branch

1299
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:27,240
protection rules.

1300
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:31,080
We can also change the branch and select

1301
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:38,200
any other boss over here, move

1302
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:41,280
one more to whatever.

1303
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:44,840
But unfortunately we cannot

1304
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,440
restrict users to push in

1305
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:52,520
main using these rules.

1306
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:58,040
We can restrict them one merging data,
but we cannot restrict them

1307
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:02,000
from pushing the domain directly
in this limited version.

1308
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:02,760
For that I can.

1309
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:05,520
We have to go for enterprise rules.

1310
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:08,680
Last time I checked,
that was the scenario of, I don't know,

1311
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:10,640
maybe they have updated something or not.

1312
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:13,080
But last time it was not like that.

1313
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:16,720
So guys, please make sure
that none of you is pushing and I'll be

1314
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:21,320
on. What else do you need inside?

1315
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:26,120
We have discussed about it.

1316
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:28,440
We can have a look at the network
from over here.

1317
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:32,520
And then I need your opposite tree.

1318
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:34,960
I'm going to show you how can delete it.

1319
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:38,280
So in I'm Indonesia
opposite to you go to settings

1320
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:41,600
and then at the end you see

1321
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:45,400
delete this represent you can delete.

1322
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:48,760
And once you have entered this

1323
02:04:48,760 --> 02:04:51,720
and deleted this, you cannot have it back.

1324
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:58,400
I mean, maybe

1325
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:01,440
show you
some of the tools that we have on our

1326
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:11,880
that help.

1327
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:15,080
So this is one of the three

1328
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:18,000
of one of the previous is

1329
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,360
31 coming to start on me

1330
02:05:21,560 --> 02:05:23,960
if I show you development

1331
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,800
night set up main

1332
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:30,720
Wow so they have named it after do

1333
02:05:30,720 --> 02:05:33,920
own matches

1334
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:35,320
pool requests.

1335
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:38,640
There's only one request that is pending

1336
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:42,680
and you guys can see the how they have,

1337
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:43,920
you know

1338
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:50,320
now name them fixed
all the unrelated variables.

1339
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:51,520
Code one

1340
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:54,480
night star has been added

1341
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:57,760
updating my step and feature file
the project update update.

1342
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:02,280
Some status
details are updated from the example.

1343
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:09,520
So everything is no right align.

1344
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:12,120
That's the project
of one of our previous batch

1345
02:06:13,240 --> 02:06:14,880
which needed

1346
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:17,760
Don't

1347
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,560
let me show you
the government history also.

1348
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,160
So this is the first comment that I made

1349
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:30,800
this the basic structure of the project
which I will be uploading

1350
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:33,280
and from over there
you guys will be working.

1351
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:34,600
What is going to be the workflow?

1352
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:38,760
I'll let you know tomorrow.

1353
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:42,160
And then each and every one of them has a

1354
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:44,080
contribution.

1355
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:45,160
DEADLINE

1356
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:10,960
How did you
you collaborators who accepted you, right?

1357
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:15,560
So simply,
I'll go 2 seconds of this collaborators,

1358
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:20,480
and I can see that only group was pending.

1359
02:07:20,680 --> 02:07:22,600
The other people have accepted.

1360
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:26,080
So now you are a collaborator
and so one is also

1361
02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:39,760
collaborate.

1362
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:42,320
Okay, now
some other information about GitHub.

1363
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:45,880
So on GitHub,
you guys going to find out we have it

1364
02:07:47,320 --> 02:07:48,240
how you are programing, you

1365
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:52,640
need anything like any coding stuff,
you can have that on GitHub.

1366
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:58,280
It is a very important, which
is being gained by a lot of big companies.

1367
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:03,120
For example,
if you want to have a selenium Docker

1368
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:06,480
container image,
so you can simply write non

1369
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,280
selenium Docker

1370
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:15,360
image.

1371
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:20,320
Yes, I've shown the out you see in.

1372
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:23,960
So there are two branches
from that selenium tree

1373
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:26,080
that they're working on right now.

1374
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:29,360
Over here the whole code is uploaded

1375
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:32,520
but this particular

1376
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:35,400
repository, there are 108 contributors

1377
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:43,800
and there is a detail read me

1378
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:47,840
so I know you will be working on project
and will be also adding a read me

1379
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:51,480
and there will be a detail instructions
about what

1380
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:56,040
this repository is about.

1381
02:08:56,040 --> 02:09:02,200
What is this community
about how to start this project,

1382
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:06,720
what kind of browsers it uses
and what are the different demands

1383
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:09,160
that you can use over there?

1384
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:12,520
What is a hub and what is a node?

1385
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:15,480
And using different violent machine,
what you need to do.

1386
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:18,400
Like a lot of information
there is in there

1387
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:23,920
everything that you need to know
if they have a very good document of that.

1388
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:26,760
So this is the documentation
of this particular project.

1389
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:28,440
This is an open source.

1390
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:32,240
So that's
why everything is visible to everyone.

1391
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,800
But obviously
when you do work in companies,

1392
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:38,480
you guys are not going to be
working on open source thing.

1393
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,240
We will be working on some

1394
02:09:41,640 --> 02:09:45,200
dedicated task of

1395
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:50,000
Now this for stuff I went through.

1396
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,240
It's very simply that my work is used.

1397
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:54,840
Let's say this is an open source project

1398
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,920
and I want to work on it.

1399
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:01,200
So I don't simply for this is different.

1400
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:06,240
Working means
just like cloning this repository,

1401
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:09,400
but in the sense that I'm able to

1402
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:13,240
contribute to it without being invited

1403
02:10:13,240 --> 02:10:17,160
as a collaborator,

1404
02:10:17,160 --> 02:10:19,680
I can contribute to this positively

1405
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:23,280
without being invited as a collaborator.

1406
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:27,600
So I can simply make some at it

1407
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:30,000
this and have a clear request. Open

1408
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:35,840
the review my code of the thing
that I have made some work contribution.

1409
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:38,760
Then they can simply help me out to.

1410
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:40,960
They can simply do the emergency.

1411
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:41,840
Thank you to me.

1412
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,880
I they'll say, Hey, stay away from that.

1413
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:45,600
That's it.

1414
02:10:45,600 --> 02:10:52,280
So for me is something that you guys
will not be using forever.

1415
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:52,760
Okay.

1416
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:56,000
So any questions
that you may have let me know else

1417
02:10:56,280 --> 02:10:59,160
I think we are pretty
much done with everything

1418
02:11:00,240 --> 02:11:02,200
related to better.

1419
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:06,120
And that will be so vital.

1420
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:08,960
One that's for any questions
that you may have.

1421
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:11,120
And then we can end our session today.

1422
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:15,240
We will be having a session tomorrow

1423
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:17,840
in the morning and evening seven

1424
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:20,880
to discuss the project

1425
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:24,200
and give you the best.

1426
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:25,160
Well, nobody don't

1427
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:28,880
even because you are not going
to the right email address, a lot of you

1428
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:30,000
are going to make this mistake.

1429
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,320
Make sure that you visit the same address
with which you have registered.

1430
02:11:33,320 --> 02:12:00,960
You get out in order to see what.

1431
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:06,920
No, you will get that.

1432
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:07,320
Okay.

1433
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:11,920
Any more questions?

1434
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:12,720
No questions.

1435
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:15,080
I'll be all good now

1436
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:21,400
let me get because that was easy.

1437
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:27,000
Really?

1438
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,680
Okay. Silence on this one too.

1439
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:34,200
But now I'm confused.

1440
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:35,720
Maybe it was easy.

1441
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:39,920
Or maybe it was vague.

1442
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:43,800
So what do you guys think?

1443
02:12:43,800 --> 02:12:59,880
That is easy or difficult?

1444
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:01,200
Well, that's a very,

1445
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:05,480
you know.

1446
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:05,880
Yeah.

1447
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:14,640
So it depends it
depends upon a lot of factors.

1448
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:18,120
What? Just tell me about the concepts.

1449
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:21,000
Like all the concepts
that we have discussed.

1450
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:24,920
Obviously it's not going to be like that.

1451
02:13:24,920 --> 02:13:26,640
You will not have to work on it.

1452
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:28,320
You have to do the project,

1453
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:31,880
you have to spend some time on it,
then you will be very comfortable. But

1454
02:13:33,200 --> 02:13:35,400
the concepts aren't the all clear to you.

1455
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:36,960
Do you guys

1456
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,680
okay, don't be nervous
before making a comment.

1457
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:50,080
Even if you mess it up, you can always,
you know, the lead

1458
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,760
up and going into

1459
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:02,880
is it all about get

1460
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:06,280
yeah that's all about that was is in full
that's

1461
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:10,040
I think we have a lot of information
that we discuss

1462
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:15,960
Oh well guys listen I remember one thing

1463
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:17,960
I shared

1464
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:22,560
with you.

1465
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:26,200
I shared with you guys
the diagrams, remember,

1466
02:14:27,040 --> 02:14:29,640
in which we have all the basic steps

1467
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,680
you guys have those diagrams with you.

1468
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:38,040
Okay, So

1469
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:46,480
let me just open them up.

1470
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:52,160
So these diagrams
are going to have real life.

1471
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:57,720
So just make sure that when you get lost,

1472
02:14:57,720 --> 02:15:01,000
you revisit them

1473
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,760
and you know

1474
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:04,520
your basics.

1475
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:08,680
Just realize them apart from these basics,

1476
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:11,120
I don't think you will be confused
about anything else.

1477
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:17,240
Everything is going to be very much geared
to our Yeah, it's on canvas.

1478
02:15:17,240 --> 02:15:17,800
It's there.

1479
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:21,400
I uploaded the slides
also the slides I'll for you

1480
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:33,680
that to you.

1481
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:37,200
So these are the slides
I go at each and every slide

1482
02:15:37,200 --> 02:15:40,040
only I think

1483
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:46,160
this slide is left.

1484
02:15:46,160 --> 02:15:48,560
It's a little bit about centralized

1485
02:15:49,160 --> 02:15:51,920
weeks, distributed weeks and

1486
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:54,000
local.

1487
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:56,720
So is something that is your homework.

1488
02:15:57,120 --> 02:16:01,760
You guys are supposed to read it and
you'll get the idea of what it is actually

1489
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:05,160
stashing. I have a slide for that.

1490
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:09,160
Do branches a little bit life or death

1491
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:13,880
password much and most conflict
and when does of it arrives.

1492
02:16:13,880 --> 02:16:16,640
These slides are also available for you
on the canvas.

1493
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:19,720
You can have them go to them and read them

1494
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:23,440
and the notes.

1495
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,800
I will be uploading them too.

1496
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:28,080
I think that

1497
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:32,040
okay, class six and seven

1498
02:16:32,040 --> 02:16:34,480
notes are combined

1499
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:37,080
taken out there.

1500
02:16:37,080 --> 02:16:38,560
I hope that

1501
02:16:40,320 --> 02:16:42,120
now you guys

1502
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:45,560
will be showing me
good results in the good project there.

1503
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:49,520
That's that's the one where I don't know
whether I have done a good job or not.

1504
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:51,960
So I'm looking forward to that.

1505
02:16:52,680 --> 02:16:55,920
And the previous three batches, really,
they may be crowded.

1506
02:16:56,360 --> 02:17:01,200
No one had, you know, even a single posted

1507
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:05,280
and the support chatter that I didn't get.

1508
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,360
So I'm expecting the same from you.

1509
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:09,000
We did a lot of practice.

1510
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:13,080
We spend a lot of time
and I'm pretty much sure that you guys

1511
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:16,520
will be able to do the project
on your own, at least a big part.

1512
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:23,400
I trust you guys just make sure that you
are following the steps one by one.

1513
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:28,840
And one of the more important thing in
whenever you are working on your project

1514
02:17:28,880 --> 02:17:33,440
is to work in a team as a team.

1515
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:38,440
So if anyone is having trouble,
you guys have to help them out.

1516
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:41,840
You leave them and,
you know, get the project,

1517
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:45,240
tried to do the project,
just help that person out, use GitHub

1518
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:50,880
platform to communicate with each other,
help out each other, try to

1519
02:17:51,880 --> 02:17:52,920
make others.

1520
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:54,480
That's the opportunity there.

1521
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:58,560
You will be learning
how you actually work together as team

1522
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:04,240
and how you help each other
to reach the same level that you are.

1523
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:10,320
No, I would never showing you that
because I highly describe that.

1524
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:12,680
In fact, I don't like it.

1525
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:15,400
I tough on lira, trust me.

1526
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:18,560
Like the previous batches.

1527
02:18:18,560 --> 02:18:22,600
Few students figured that figured it
and I also showed them in one class.

1528
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:27,920
But I strictly mentioned as good
not not to do that anymore.

1529
02:18:27,920 --> 02:18:31,720
Not to teach students
how to use intelligent to push

1530
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:34,080
and do stuff like that.

1531
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:38,440
So there is there's a reason behind that.

1532
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:42,920
And that's that reason is that
most of work working might not be using

1533
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:45,600
intelligent.

1534
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:47,120
You might not be using that.

1535
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:49,040
You might be working on
something different. I mean,

1536
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:50,760
and one

1537
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:54,640
other reason is that when you guys start
using automated

1538
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:59,640
to like intelligent work with you,
you forget the come out of it.

1539
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:01,520
You don't even bother to go over there.

1540
02:19:01,520 --> 02:19:03,360
And that's the biggest mistake.

1541
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:06,880
You forget the workflows,
you start making mistakes

1542
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:12,080
and everything is, you know, messed up.

1543
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:17,320
Well, I don't I'm

1544
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:20,400
pretty sure that once
you know how to use it in an intelligent

1545
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:24,360
you will be using that because we all us
find a way to do it easily.

1546
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:29,280
So I would love to comment
that it will disturb you.

1547
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:31,320
It will disturbed your workflows.

1548
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:35,200
And apart from that,
you can never actually, you know,

1549
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:42,560
use that much power to debug your errors
and maintain a smooth workflow.

1550
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:45,400
Using that is all you can do
is make a bit of an addict.

1551
02:19:45,640 --> 02:19:48,680
And you know, sometimes that's
that's all you can do.

1552
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:51,760
So I don't want to do that.

1553
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,400
That's a favor from my side to you.

1554
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:58,480
You will get that in
maybe one or two years.

1555
02:19:58,480 --> 02:20:00,560
You'll know that was right about it.

1556
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:02,840
Not right now,
but you will let us have enough

1557
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:04,640
of it.

1558
02:20:04,640 --> 02:20:07,120
So anything else

1559
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:11,800
before

1560
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:21,960
looking

1561
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,200
for someone to ask me
about the tab that we have.

1562
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:30,560
So let's have a look at them to

1563
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:37,800
think,

1564
02:20:39,640 --> 02:20:42,000
Well, these are issues.

1565
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,600
You can open up a new issue
if you want to.

1566
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:51,320
So most probably you will not
be using this even if you want to.

1567
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:55,480
You can simply use tab in GitHub
that allows you to

1568
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:58,000
post some kind of issues over here.

1569
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:58,880
So let's have a look.

1570
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:03,680
Let's try to create one.

1571
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:06,080
There is a plug

1572
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:07,720
in We

1573
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:10,480
each branch

1574
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:28,760
and the details.

1575
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:33,360
You can assign this
issue to different people and

1576
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:35,280
you can

1577
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:40,400
label it also.

1578
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:44,120
So whenever you
someone can click on this issue

1579
02:21:44,360 --> 02:21:46,760
and have that, okay,
there's a bug in the feature, but

1580
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:49,600
okay, let me have a look at that.

1581
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:53,240
So let's assume that one of your friend
is having some issue,

1582
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:57,120
which is which he is unable to resolve,
so he can simply post issue

1583
02:21:57,120 --> 02:22:00,120
with the assign it
to one of his other friends.

1584
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:02,240
Maybe you guys have time to address.

1585
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:05,480
Maybe you guys are unable to communicate
via one chat

1586
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:08,760
at the same time one is working at night
and one is working at day.

1587
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:12,400
This kind of differences might be there,
so if you need someone helps,

1588
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:16,600
you can simply use create an issue
to go and assign

1589
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:20,400
that that particular person
which you think can help you out.

1590
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:25,760
And he is going to just view the issue
and say, okay, how can I help that person?

1591
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:30,840
Maybe I'll go to this going into my own
repository and I'll try to resolve it.

1592
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:33,560
So this is

1593
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:39,000
our issues is going to help you out
once that is the scenario,

1594
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,120
then you guys can have a communication
on that issue.

1595
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:43,880
I checked it.

1596
02:22:43,880 --> 02:22:48,000
The problem is in your semicolon,

1597
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,400
let's say, and you can comment on

1598
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:55,520
our try using this updated code

1599
02:22:57,680 --> 02:22:59,000
and you can post up here.

1600
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,840
So whenever he was here, you have this
mark on his issue and I would see, okay,

1601
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:07,000
so I need to make these changes,
something like that.

1602
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:11,400
And you guys can basically, you know, I'm
going to get over here, will request

1603
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:15,840
you all know what is that actions.

1604
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:17,960
This is something that

1605
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:20,560
we want we talking about.

1606
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:25,520
This is the advanced features
that GitHub was has

1607
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:28,800
with all the tools which we can integrate.

1608
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:33,640
There are going to
be see, I see the pipeline,

1609
02:23:34,840 --> 02:23:38,040
but They are usually
paid they are not free most probably.

1610
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:39,680
Yeah, they are pre

1611
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:42,800
and then the projects

1612
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:52,120
we won't be discussing anything
about project also

1613
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,520
because we do not have any wiki

1614
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:57,960
is again
going to do left like this security

1615
02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:01,760
this thing that is you know

1616
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:07,400
will be under the team lead or the one
who is one of the representatives.

1617
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:10,960
So I guess you will also
be not needing that inside.

1618
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:15,680
So we have discussed that you only need
to know about net for other stuff

1619
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:18,360
that's not that much needed,
but you can always

1620
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:20,600
in the settings.

1621
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:24,320
The important one was
how to invite collaborator and branches.

1622
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:28,680
The next next ones are something
that I think that it's

1623
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:32,880
okay even if we don't cover them.

1624
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:34,920
So that's all about GitHub.

1625
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:36,960
Thank you all for your time

1626
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:39,640
and tomorrow is

1627
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:43,720
not going to be any recap,
No review tomorrow.

1628
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:48,000
Tomorrow is just going to be
a one hour session in which you guys

1629
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,000
will be giving a brief overview of how

1630
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:55,280
to do your project and that's it.

1631
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:59,960
Nothing else.

1632
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:03,240
So make sure I'm sure all of you out there
who are not there, they can

1633
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:09,920
watch the video recording later on.

1634
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:12,040
And best of luck,
everyone, for your projects.

1635
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:16,080
I really appreciate that
you guys put in your best effort.

1636
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:17,160
That's

1637
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:20,960
everything that you have until this point.

1638
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:24,040
You guys will be practicing that.

1639
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:26,400
So make sure that you spend
a lot of time on it

1640
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:28,600
and review everything that you have done.

1641
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:32,240
And after that,
you will be having just two more topics.

1642
02:25:32,480 --> 02:25:35,760
Maybe you want us to add an API
and then you will be graduating

1643
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:41,840
and you will be in the job market
pursuing your dream of a good, handsome

1644
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,040
salary,
working in the fields in real time. And

1645
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:50,640
that's what we can go there, right?

1646
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:59,320
So that's your time to practice.

1647
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:04,440
I know this assistant project
is just for the example

1648
02:26:04,440 --> 02:26:08,400
you will be working on Index MSW.

1649
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:13,440
Not so surprising.

1650
02:26:13,440 --> 02:26:16,840
How did you put that project?

1651
02:26:16,840 --> 02:26:17,880
I don't know.

1652
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:20,040
I think you guys did.

1653
02:26:20,040 --> 02:26:21,000
You guys

1654
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:23,440
notified about that?

1655
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,240
You need to make

1656
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:26,400
jobs.

1657
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:29,400
What you guys know decide about that

1658
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,920
are you do you already have rooms.

1659
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:33,480
I don't know that

1660
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:37,720
you can have groups already
so you will be working on the same group.

1661
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:41,680
So I think minimum is at least
three people at a maximum

1662
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:45,840
was like 5 to 7 people,
nor less than three.

1663
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:55,520
So that's that's the requirement.

1664
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:55,920
Okay.

1665
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:58,120
So best of luck, everyone.

1666
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:00,240
I'll see you guys tomorrow in the morning.

1667
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:02,760
Sorry. Evening, everyone in for me.

1668
02:27:03,240 --> 02:27:05,160
And we will have that session.

1669
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:06,000
Okay. Take care.

1670
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:09,600
Have a good

1671
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:18,120
day at.
