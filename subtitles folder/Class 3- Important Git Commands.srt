1
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,920
That's only one.

2
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Yet I was always there, just, you know,
I was ready for all this.

3
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
Diane,

4
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,640
how are you?

5
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,240
Ron Lugo I shop.

6
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,880
I mean, and really,

7
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,160
I wonder if I pronounce your name
correctly.

8
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,240
I hope I do that.

9
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, well, yeah, I got knew

10
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,840
I was just, you know, going to
the traditions of was that announcer

11
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,840
I guess he was recommending
to have drive thrus and stuff.

12
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,560
So I got lots of fried foods, didn't

13
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,680
I. Thought maybe
I also need to improve my memory.

14
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,960
So, you know, waiting.

15
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,320
So let's see.

16
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:05,280
They would just need to a

17
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Okay, so

18
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,480
first of all, I want you guys to tell me

19
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,840
that you went over to the Revere

20
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,680
that you're the group

21
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,360
of all of you.

22
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,840
I that's great.

23
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm really happy with that.

24
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
So is the concept of

25
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,880
GitHub is that, you know,

26
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,200
all of you now

27
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,880
the basis that you should architecture.

28
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
No nothing about that

29
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,640
because it's really important
as you move forward

30
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,080
if the basics are strong first
and if you are going to be,

31
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,920
it's going to be very easy for all of us.

32
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,080
Okay.

33
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,160
Yeah, I just thought that maybe instead
of having a 3 hours lecture,

34
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,800
but you have to you

35
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,120
came, I guess it was 30, right?

36
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:22,360
Not 40,
but it sums up a lot of information.

37
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,320
Okay, great.

38
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,400
So let's sleep for just two more minutes,
and then we will begin

39
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
with 1.5 to 25 an hour.

40
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,880
Yeah, if you already know, you can simply,
you know,

41
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,480
make it move faster.

42
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,000
So we will begin at 710 and then

43
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,160
we are going to be having, I guess

44
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,360
approximately
four classes will be at today's Tuesday.

45
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,320
We'll be having a mass on Wednesday
and then on Thursday

46
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,680
is going to be our a new Saturday
and Sunday.

47
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,720
And that's it.

48
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
From Monday onwards, you guys will be

49
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,480
review will be off get most probably get
I guess you guys are pretty much done

50
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,520
with every every other stuff
so it's going to be get and

51
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
on from Monday I guess yeah on Monday

52
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,160
you guys will be having a session
in which I still am.

53
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,440
I will be guiding
you guys towards the project.

54
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
We will try to make it Sunday.

55
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,760
If you are able to finish early.

56
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,800
I'll let you guys an update
on this on Saturday.

57
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,560
So the next week is going to be the book
project.

58
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,080
It's really important, really exciting.

59
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,960
I encourage all of you to participate
fully in that.

60
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,800
It's going to help you a lot,
learn and know it's not at all hard

61
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,240
if you are like if you guys
have gone through to come right

62
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,760
and you know how to do the frameworks,
Selenium is good and right not to get.

63
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,520
It's also going to be,
you know, underpinned a bit

64
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,400
so that all you have to do is combine
the concepts you have learned so far

65
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,240
and put them into action
to do the project.

66
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,320
So it's going to be not that hard.

67
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,520
And obviously
we are always there to help you out if you

68
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,880
if you are

69
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,120
having a hard day. Oh,

70
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,360
well, sadly, I hope that it would happen.

71
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,320
That was exciting.

72
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,040
But now we will have to
we will have to just the basic application

73
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,560
that we have, most of it on this index is
our times is going to be different.

74
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:44,440
You have to test using different
confidence that you have learned.

75
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, so

76
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,920
it's similar to

77
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,640
let's begin our session and the rules
you guys already have.

78
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,720
Spend a lot of time with me.

79
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,400
You all that I always encourage
to question without really you guys

80
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,720
find anything difficult, any concept
that is hard to get, let me know.

81
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,840
I can explain that
and simpler words for you, but

82
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,880
make sure that you guys
are not just sitting lightly.

83
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,720
It's very important that we communicate.
That's a tool which I don't

84
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,360
get is really important.

85
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,680
If you guys understand this, you trust me.

86
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,320
You won't have to ever, ever review
it again.

87
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,360
It's it's a one time effort,
if put correctly,

88
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,840
you guys won't be ever needing
to review it again.

89
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,160
It's not like selenium or any of the stuff
that you guys have to go back

90
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,000
and, you know, remember stuff
this just simple concepts

91
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,920
go through them
once you will ever have to review that.

92
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,680
That's my promise to all of them.

93
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,400
But the condition is
that you have to be very interactive.

94
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,640
Okay, So today's agenda is going to be
to understand the concept.

95
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,120
First of all, of the local
at the remote repository,

96
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,920
we are almost familiar with that.

97
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,440
But people moving that, the next one
as to how to create a local level

98
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,760
one make commits in it.

99
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,280
We already know that this is something new
that we will be learning today

100
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,800
how to perform different operations
using get command on our local level.

101
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,200
Okay.

102
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,840
How to connect your local output
to the remote one.

103
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,560
We already know that,
but we will be revisiting it.

104
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,240
And the next new concept
that we will be learning is how to clone

105
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,720
some other get comparable.

106
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,760
I believe that you guys already know
how to clone.

107
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,360
Right?

108
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,880
We have been doing that
and but we will going back

109
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,280
a little bit understand the concept
that how learning actually works.

110
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,160
And the last thing,
how do we let go from our apple,

111
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,440
which you have already clone.

112
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,040
I believe that you guys have been already
pulling also.

113
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,800
But today we will be learning in depth
that how the poll works

114
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,800
and how it differs
from going and stuff like that.

115
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,200
So nothing very new in today's lecture,
but we will be reviewing a lot and,

116
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,080
you know, understand the concepts.

117
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,320
No, not that

118
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,800
we are not reviewing that.

119
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,960
We are just shooting very basics and
we will be learning a few more concepts.

120
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,520
Last time when I talked to you guys
and I skipped a little bit information

121
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,680
that need to be delivered,
so that is going to be included

122
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,280
pretty

123
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,040
that's fine.

124
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,840
Today is going to be cloning and killing
is going to be our major focus.

125
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,880
Some worry about that.

126
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:40,040
Okay, let's start from the beginning.

127
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,520
Okay.

128
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,600
So why do we use good?

129
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,400
We all know that whenever we are
working in our on our one on the project,

130
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,560
we need to crack it because in future
there might be a scenario

131
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,120
where we have to revisit
some of the previous version

132
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,800
or we might have to share our code
with some other person who is not located

133
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,120
on the same in the same region
where we are located.

134
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,280
And for that purpose
we need to track our project

135
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,080
and the best option for
that is to use get.

136
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,480
Do we have any other tools
available in the market apart from there

137
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,320
to take our projects?

138
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Yes, of course we do have like SVM bit,
but Bitbucket

139
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,720
and other tools are also available,
but it is the most popular one.

140
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,320
And right now I was just in touch
with one of the students in the market.

141
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,200
They are also using somehow

142
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,960
some of their Bitbucket,
but that is the exact same copy of it.

143
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,200
So you won't be having any problem.

144
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Okay,

145
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,200
so let's
start by tracking our first project,

146
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,000
for which what I'll do
is I'll simply open up my intelligent

147
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,560
and then I will be creating a new project

148
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,600
that's Bitbucket.

149
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,440
Okay, so inside my intelligent,
let's create a new project

150
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,720
from scratch.

151
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:29,720
File out of the project.

152
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,640
That's our project.

153
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:45,440
Let's get Project one.

154
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,520
All right.

155
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,880
W Yeah, a Java project.

156
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,560
Just create a project and

157
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,440
start a computer

158
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,800
you should follow.

159
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,160
If it wasn't

160
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,880
awkward,

161
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,320
let me know what you guys are

162
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,000
done creating your project

163
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:36,440
so that we can proceed.

164
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,240
Okay, great.
So now what do you want to do?

165
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,400
I want to have a track of this project.

166
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,040
And let's say
that you have a code in there that says

167
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,200
I'm about to enter that
just prints out this particular statement.

168
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,120
Nothing. Nothing else. Nothing.

169
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,520
And it is not mean class.

170
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,840
Okay, So the first step is to create
a local repository, right?

171
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,240
So we will obviously have to open up
our location in the system

172
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,440
where our project is residing.

173
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,760
One smart way of doing
this is to right, click on it

174
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:25,320
and click on Opening Explorer.

175
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,480
How is my project Get Project one?

176
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay,
so this is for Windows and Mac users.

177
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,680
You got you guys can simply going
to finder and drag down this back

178
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,680
and open up the X open up
this to the project in the Explorer.

179
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,760
I'm sure that until now
it's going to be not a task for you.

180
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,480
Let me know when you guys open up
your Explorer, all the Mac users

181
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,080
and Windows user and then we can proceed.

182
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,720
So this
is a project one and I have opened it,

183
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,960
opened it up,

184
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,440
yes. Alex

185
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,880
Because I'm going to also

186
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,120
draw this quick one over here real quick.

187
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,400
Let's name it

188
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:37,120
the project one.

189
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,360
Okay.

190
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Inside this folder I have no idea
as RC and project one dot I am.

191
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm just going to draw for now as RC

192
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,800
and dot idea because the I am a file.

193
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,240
You are not interested in it for now.

194
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,320
Let's have it all.

195
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,680
So let's not just ignore sa c

196
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,120
dot email and let's see.

197
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:10,800
Not idea.

198
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,160
Okay.

199
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,280
So the first decision that we have to make
is that

200
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,600
we are to create our app.

201
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,080
Okay.

202
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,280
I can either go inside
SRT and create a three at this point

203
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,080
where the main code is located,
but can you just tell me that

204
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,080
what will be the disadvantage
of creating repository over

205
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,000
here? I

206
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,880
Exactly.

207
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,560
Very good.

208
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,960
So if
I create a representative at this point,

209
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,880
only the main and other classes
that are inside this folder

210
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,720
which I create or the time will be trapped
by that click relatively.

211
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,360
Any other files that we have over here

212
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,360
and inside this border, SRT,
the column is located.

213
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,680
They won't be trapped by it.

214
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,400
Are we all clear about that?

215
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay.

216
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,840
So now we have seen that
when we are working with MAVEN Project

217
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,120
or like in Java,
we will have a lot of classes.

218
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,560
And in Maven also we have some extra Clive
Palmer example and other

219
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,920
configuration files.

220
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,120
We may have them.

221
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,040
So it's a very good practice to all of us.

222
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:29,120
Create your repositories
inside your immediate project folder.

223
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,120
So if this is my group, get Project one,
I should create my repository

224
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,240
at this particular point
that all the files and folders

225
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:44,000
are located.

226
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,640
Okay.

227
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,120
So now in order to create the repository,
what I need to do is

228
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,480
I will simply right
click on it and click on Get Bash over

229
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,240
here, right
click on your inside the project folder

230
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,680
and select it back here.

231
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,880
And it's going to open up your comment
for Mac users.

232
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,920
What you can do is
you can simply go to your folder,

233
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,040
you will right
click on it and select Open in terminal

234
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,840
or open terminal over here.

235
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't remember the exact words
of that man or that option,

236
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,360
but it's going to be something like that.

237
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,600
Let me know when you guys have opened up
this particular

238
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,440
get bash

239
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,600
grid.

240
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:48,800
So Demi has shared that.

241
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,280
Look at Mohammad.

242
00:20:50,280 --> 00:21:07,440
So look at the shot screenshot
that the Museu.

243
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,480
Okay,
I'm going to read for one more minute

244
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,360
so that all of we can cope up
because I know that matches,

245
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,720
as some of you might be having a hard time
with getting it

246
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,280
the don't we just created a means class

247
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,600
and that's it.

248
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
It's using the IBT terminal.

249
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,000
You can use the terminal ultimate
out of the command that open up

250
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,680
a separate terminal on it
that will be more convenient.

251
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,720
And all of this, we commend
you guys to stay away from the terminal.

252
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,040
I personally don't recommend it.

253
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,720
I personally don't recommend using
the Ivys at all use when you are using it,

254
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,400
because that is something
which is totally separate from any idea.

255
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,360
I know in Windows 11, I know

256
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,520
that's okay.

257
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:18,480
For Windows you have to click on
get back to.

258
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,600
If you do not see this option,
then what you don't have to do

259
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,640
is you will have to navigate
manually to your folder.

260
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
I believe that you know that

261
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,040
the only purpose of showing you this
is that it's a short charter for you guys

262
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,680
that instead of doing all that stuff
with none of your PWT

263
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,840
and then LCD, etc., navigate
to that particular folder,

264
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,600
you can simply follow this talk
that I did not teach you guys

265
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,200
this first,
so that you should also know how to do it.

266
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,880
Okay.

267
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,440
Because most of you might not be able
to find

268
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,040
this option in your coverage
or for those of you who can find it.

269
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,160
Very good.

270
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,480
But if you are unable to find it,
just simply navigate to that folder.

271
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,480
Okay.

272
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,920
Using LR, CDP and the the middle.

273
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,480
That's fine.

274
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,440
If it's not showing up,
just navigate to it.

275
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,400
Okay.

276
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,640
Well, you should know how
to navigate manually also.

277
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,160
Okay guys,
so navigate to your project folder.

278
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,320
If you are unable to find a site
to do it to the terminal using

279
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,800
the command of navigation
that you already know,

280
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,640
one minute for this and then proceeding,

281
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,280
I believe that you guys should know that
because we have

282
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,800
reviewed it a lot of times.

283
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,480
Okay, great.

284
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,920
So now if I do PWT,
it shows me that I'm inside

285
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,760
my get project one

286
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,400
that with a thought
that I immediately came here.

287
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,920
So it saved me a lot of time,
a lot of hassle.

288
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,040
Okay, now what I need to do
if I want to create a repository

289
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,920
at this point which come out of the gate,
we know that.

290
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,520
Does this work?

291
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,320
Get an IT perfect.

292
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,200
So get in.

293
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,520
That is the command path.

294
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,920
Get initialization.

295
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,080
What it did is initialize empty,

296
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,720
gives up a zip free and c users

297
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,360
and then the path is shown
to me very creative my free.

298
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,600
And at the same

299
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,320
time what will happen
is that I would see a folder.

300
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,480
I had them folder inside my project,
which is an audit folder

301
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,440
and this is a folder which is actually
going to be a repository.

302
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,200
Okay, So at this point
I would just quickly draw a simulation for

303
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,960
you guys
also so that we can move together.

304
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,640
Okay.

305
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,600
And then you go, let me create with me.

306
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,680
You there is an effect

307
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,320
on. Okay, so

308
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,240
after running the docket in a command,
we got

309
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,040
you guys able to see these lines

310
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,800
under visible

311
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,960
public group.

312
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:25,320
But so we will be having a folder

313
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:37,720
of dot and that docket.

314
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,800
So as soon as you run, come out of this
folder, appear inside this quarter,

315
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,440
I do two things.

316
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,120
Can you guys quickly tell me
what are they?

317
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,600
What is this this or will have team

318
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,400
that I have not?

319
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,080
Yes, this is the staging area.

320
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,160
And what is this?

321
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,680
This is our airport.

322
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,600
The local one is local
because it's residing on our system.

323
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,360
And what is this area?

324
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,040
This one, what do you call it?

325
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,360
This new working directory.

326
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,720
Perfect.

327
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,280
Okay, so now we've got t status in our
working directory staging area and repo.

328
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:29,840
So that's why we call that
it is a three stage architecture.

329
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,840
Okay.

330
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,640
So at this point, if
anyone who has any questions, let me know.

331
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:49,080
If not, then we can proceed.

332
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,840
Okay. So now

333
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,440
how? We check hidden files on Mac?

334
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,400
Can someone tell me?

335
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:03,440
Tell me how to show
hidden files that I can.

336
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,520
Okay, so now what we need to do?

337
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,480
We need to understand one thing.

338
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,680
These dot idea file are output files.

339
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,960
If I run this cooler,
let me run this code quickly.

340
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,720
I see an outfielder.

341
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,400
Right.

342
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,200
Let me throw that one to.

343
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:38,880
Let me name it out.

344
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,400
Okay, So do that.

345
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,880
Think that whenever we are backing up,
do we need this out of our cooler

346
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,960
in our repository?

347
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,480
Now go.

348
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,080
Come on, Chip Dot and it will appear.

349
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,440
Okay.

350
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:06,120
Do we need dot idea
folder in a repository?

351
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,200
I know I just ran my code
and it built make presented me

352
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,200
with this one to run your code
and this will build up you book.

353
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,120
So do you think that we need

354
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,400
good project one Doug I am

355
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,440
Alex.

356
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,360
If you don't have a good folder,
then make sure that your files are checked

357
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,640
and you are able to see your files.

358
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,160
If you are unable to see that it's
completely fine.

359
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,400
It's just good and okay.

360
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,880
Have you installed get

361
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,720
okay in order to have that kind of view.

362
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,800
And then over here
you will see hit an item.

363
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:54,920
Click on that.

364
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,120
Okay.

365
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,440
So we do not need this all folder. Why?

366
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,080
Because just run this code, run this,
good at it out a little bit of you.

367
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,200
We do not need this out folder. Why?

368
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,520
Because this is something that

369
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,320
contains our binaries
and they are generated on runtime.

370
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,640
They are system dependent
and I do not have to share it

371
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,560
with other colleagues or friends
because it serves no purpose.

372
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,400
Right.
They are going to be different for me.

373
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,560
They're going to be different for you.

374
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,480
I don't

375
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,640
need to send this dot idea folder item.

376
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,320
Okay, so what do you guys think?

377
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,240
If I want to ignore these files
and I don't want them

378
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:46,320
into our opposite facility,
what should I do?

379
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,800
I have and get.

380
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,160
No, not really.

381
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,040
Okay, so here's what I get.

382
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,480
Ignore and get.

383
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,840
We have a special file called dot
get ignore

384
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,280
and it's help us to ignore the files
that we want.

385
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,720
Don't want to crack. Okay.

386
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,920
So let's
see if we want to ignore some files.

387
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,120
Then we have to create
object, ignore, file

388
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,160
and add the names of the files

389
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,400
that we want to ignore.

390
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,960
Simple as that.

391
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,120
How do we do that?

392
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,400
Number one

393
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,480
touch dot.

394
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,240
Get it? No.

395
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,840
So I'm going to open up my terminal
and I'm going to write in the command

396
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,080
touch dot get ignore.

397
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,040
Now press enter.

398
00:30:44,040 --> 00:31:08,280
We created a file dot with ignored.

399
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,680
I said because we want to ignore
a few files we don't want

400
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,880
get to track them.

401
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,640
You can not run your code the one only
intelligent and it's going to be the

402
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,600
okay, do you guys have this file?

403
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,320
Don't get ignore

404
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,960
the We all have it

405
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,600
all perfect.

406
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,960
Christine, you need to run this command
and it will appear.

407
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,040
Okay, now open up this file
using your notepad

408
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,600
and simply write in the name

409
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,760
slash out.

410
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,280
And so I wrote down the name, slash out

411
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:29,880
and said this dot would ignore path.

412
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,240
I know I'm not much.

413
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,320
Okay, So there you go.

414
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,760
This is my terminal, This is my dog.

415
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,320
Get ignored by

416
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,600
that's dot get ignored.

417
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,960
Yeah. Okay.

418
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,840
Then after that, save this file

419
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,080
and close it.

420
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,440
Okay.

421
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,840
Now tell me if I type in the command
git status.

422
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,920
What do you guys expect to see

423
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,120
on the output of the console
without running this command?

424
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,080
I want you guys to tell him.

425
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,240
Do not want any command before me.

426
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,960
As you. You guys are going to have problem

427
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,520
this file

428
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,760
then is this come out of desktop
get ignore.

429
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Okay so get status.

430
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,320
If we run the command with status
it shows us the status,

431
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,920
the current status of our app. Zippy.

432
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,360
So right now
this will make you guys have a look at it.

433
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,760
If we do not see anything
in the staging area of the repo. No.

434
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,160
So logically what should happen
is that everything that is there inside

435
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,800
working, right?

436
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:08,480
We should appear in red, but we have a dot
it ignore file over here.

437
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,080
So we are expecting that
our client is not going to be tracked.

438
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,120
Yes. No.

439
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,040
Well, after saying it closed

440
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,120
the get status and that's money.

441
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,400
Okay.

442
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:26,240
Now I see every file,
but I do not see the output file. Why?

443
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,880
Because we have the mean included
and get ignored.

444
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,200
And now this file get knows
that I don't have to track any changes

445
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,000
that make inside this folder out
is not going to be tracked.

446
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,920
So this is a little trick
that you guys should know.

447
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,240
You will see that whenever you are
exploring some repositories on the GitHub,

448
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,480
you will see that
a lot of them have got it ignored file

449
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,960
and which people are ignoring
the files that are unnecessary.

450
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,360
Okay,

451
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,360
so let me
know when you guys are done to this step.

452
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,200
Any questions I'm here to answer?

453
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,520
Anyone having any problems?

454
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,840
I'm here to answer and then what happens?

455
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,720
So one minute for that.

456
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,480
How to ignore the idea.

457
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,320
Okay, so if you want to ignore

458
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,240
dark idea,
simply open up your bit, ignore quality

459
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,320
and in the next line write down

460
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,280
slash dot idea

461
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:35,200
and set it.

462
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,080
Now if you do get status,

463
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,880
don't see the dot idea.

464
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,400
Yeah, just simply do that.

465
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:55,920
Also ignore the dot idea file.

466
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,480
So you just ignore the intelligent.

467
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,600
Yes. All of should do it.

468
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,960
All of you should do it.

469
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,240
Add another dot idea inside your notepad

470
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,000
and ignore that to.

471
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,520
Okay.

472
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,600
So you guys see,
whenever you want to ignore

473
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,640
something, simply create a dot
giving no file, open it up.

474
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,560
Simply put in the file
name and it's going to be ignored.

475
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,200
What if now you want some file
not to be ignored?

476
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,800
Sebastian is asking.

477
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,520
Simply delete its name
and it's going to be proud of being okay.

478
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:43,000
Sebastian.

479
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,680
I'm going to write the step to also

480
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,360
include the file name and the text

481
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,160
file that you have

482
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,000
read.

483
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,920
Extension Don't get ignored.

484
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,200
See if that file

485
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,880
and just see what your

486
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
you can do to ignore it if you want that.

487
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,800
That's not an issue. Denis

488
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,520
Okay guys, so don't get ignored.

489
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,800
If I ask you now to create a don't file,
ignore few folders

490
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:53,680
when you will
all if you be able to do that.

491
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:02,400
Okay, great.

492
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,360
So like right now
only two files are appearing in red three

493
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,360
so I'm not giving no file.

494
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll get project email at SRT.

495
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,360
These are the files
which are me appearing them red.

496
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,680
This means that you're just saying that
these are the files which are untracked.

497
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,440
Let's let us know that this habit of now

498
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,680
reading
whatever is being shown on the console.

499
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,400
Because trust me, if you guys, I have it.

500
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,120
I have a habit of reading your console.

501
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,440
It's going to be very easy for you to know
what you guys are doing wrong.

502
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,760
So. Right. Not since on Grand Master.

503
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,320
No commits yet.

504
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,600
So have you made any comments?

505
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,240
No. Such is that there are no comments
but showing us

506
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,480
that untracked files are these see files?

507
00:38:52,080 --> 00:39:00,320
Have we started to track any files? No.

508
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,600
So this means that
all these files are on track.

509
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,560
Okay, now what I want to do,
let me first open up this and

510
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,560
let's have

511
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,000
a circle over here which represents
dot it.

512
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,240
Ignore.

513
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,920
So I have my out

514
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,000
and my dot idea

515
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,560
inside this sub.

516
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,880
These two quarters
going to be pressed right.

517
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,240
Okay.

518
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,840
So I want you to tell me
if I only want to crack.

519
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:51,400
See, like, I only want to initiate
tracking of source and what I need to do.

520
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:57,840
Which command will I use?

521
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,120
Get add srt regular.

522
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,920
Okay,

523
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,880
whatever I want to track

524
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,840
all the files.

525
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:20,160
Okay, so for tracking all the files,
we have the command and get at dot.

526
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,720
So as soon as I run this command,
what's going to happen?

527
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,920
It's going to take a snapshot, a copy,

528
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,720
and it's going to place it
in this staging area.

529
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,320
So in my staging area,
SRT is going to be there.

530
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,120
Which other file
am I going to have an investigator here

531
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,280
if I use get that dot, I will have my I.A.

532
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,440
file. But

533
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,920
and I know dot ideas and

534
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,240
it get ignored.

535
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,200
So I want to be having it right now
so it won't be packed.

536
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,800
And this got it ignored.

537
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,720
File that you created is going to be there
inside my staging area.

538
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:29,720
Let's do this.

539
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,040
Okay.

540
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,080
I'm at the same that you put the files
we don't want to track inside.

541
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,800
Do not get ignored.

542
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,840
But we are tracking the file dog.

543
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,120
No. Yes. Because that don't get ignored.

544
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,200
File only contains the name of the files
that have been ignored.

545
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,560
Okay,
so let me come to the mean vocals file.

546
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,440
So let's say that you are working
on a project and you ignore those files,

547
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,120
but you have this got it
ignored file also available.

548
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,240
So what can happen is that in future,
if someone wants a the file,

549
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,000
you can look into your docket.

550
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,320
Ignore and ask you for that.

551
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,080
Hey, you ignore this file.

552
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,520
But I think I needed.

553
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,200
Can you share this file with me?

554
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,840
So that's the reason
it's good to have a get ignore file.

555
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,040
Upload it on your behalf.

556
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:23,760
Makes sense.

557
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,960
Exactly.

558
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,800
Okay.

559
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,800
So let's go ahead, guys,
and just run this command.

560
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,280
As you saw in the simulation,
I hope that the same will happen

561
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,640
if you get that dot on the terminal.

562
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,160
Okay.

563
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,040
And if I want to see
whether work correctly or not,

564
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,160
get the status of game.

565
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,000
Now, I see that every file that

566
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,600
that I was seeing
previously appears in green color.

567
00:42:51,600 --> 00:43:13,200
So what does this green color represents?

568
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,400
Files appearing in green

569
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,880
in the presents that

570
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:28,680
they are in staging area.

571
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,080
Okay.

572
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,200
These farther down the staging area,
just keeping track of them good enough

573
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,160
now if you want to see that,

574
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,880
what are those files
that are inside the staging area?

575
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,320
Let's see.

576
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,560
At any time of time and point,

577
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,080
you just want to immediately check that.

578
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:49,680
Okay.

579
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,720
I just want to see
which ones are in my staging area.

580
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,520
How can I do that?

581
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,080
I know all of that is going to show me

582
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,040
the files in my

583
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,360
in my working directory.

584
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,280
Christine Log is going to show me
the files are the commits in the recall.

585
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Nas will get status is going show me only

586
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,080
if the fire zone staging area
but not in the wrapper. Okay

587
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,040
so before

588
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,520
we do that, before we learn how to do
this, let's do one.

589
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,880
Let's quickly make comment. Okay.

590
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,240
So in order to make a comment,
what we do is simply use

591
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,760
the command, get comment

592
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,000
dashcam along with the message.

593
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,760
Let's call it first time.

594
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,040
I spent a great deal of time

595
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,080
teaching you guys how to name your commit.

596
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:58,000
But for now we are going to name them
very simple, just like voice

597
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,200
animate or something.

598
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,800
That's what if I'm going to run
this command it's going to get

599
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,680
is going to take a snapshot of everything
that is there

600
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:17,280
in my staging area
and it's going to make the first time.

601
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,520
So this is going how my repository
is going to look like you guys agree

602
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,000
and there's going to be a

603
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,680
message
along with this same first comment.

604
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,480
Okay, There you go.

605
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:42,240
Okay, get commit.

606
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,920
That's our

607
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:51,960
first comment.

608
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,360
Three files change between insertions.

609
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,120
If joined up, then what it actually did
and it has made some

610
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,480
comment inside the wrappers if we actually

611
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,360
and we are good
until this point let me know

612
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,880
and once you guys have made the commit
and then we'll be proceeding

613
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:40,200
forward.

614
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,640
It doesn't work.

615
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,600
I never use that.

616
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,960
So I'm going to lock that if it works.

617
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:53,920
Okay, that's fine.

618
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,120
Okay, great.

619
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,720
So now what we want to do,

620
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,280
let's say at this point,

621
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,800
we want to view the status of the deficit.

622
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,040
So what do you guys expect
that if I run this command, get status,

623
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:20,640
what will the output
without running this album?

624
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,800
Okay. So we are expecting

625
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:25,280
to see that our increase mean
there's nothing to be committed.

626
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,720
There's nothing to be in there at.

627
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,080
Okay.

628
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,880
Right.

629
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,720
Okay. Yeah, that's fine. But, you know,

630
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:43,320
get status.

631
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,760
It shows that on grass master,
nothing to commit what can we is putting

632
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:52,360
everything is up to date
all the three stages are synchronized

633
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,520
if I make you see that
all the tree state is working directory

634
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,080
staging area
and they're up they are synchronized.

635
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,440
So one of the other thing about getters

636
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,760
and GitHub is synchronization.

637
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,320
It is actually synchronizing
your working directly,

638
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,560
your staging a rapport
and your animal travel.

639
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,360
They all should be same.

640
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:18,480
You guys do know that you have this backup
for WhatsApp and you don't drive.

641
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,480
It gives you an option to saying that
synchronize your local with the remote.

642
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,080
So it's just like that.

643
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,520
But in the terms of coding

644
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:28,920
that you are actually

645
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:36,360
synchronizing your calls and folders.

646
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:49,920
Okay.

647
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,360
Okay. Mohammed, your issue is because you

648
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,800
most probably reinstalled it

649
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,840
and you have to make these configurations.

650
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,800
I recommend that quickly go to your

651
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,880
support, Karen
and I think you are, of course,

652
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,800
is going to be there
to help you automatically.

653
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,760
You are that okay.

654
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,840
You need to make configurations.

655
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,240
Okay.

656
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,880
So the next step that we are going to
learn is

657
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,240
exactly when

658
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,480
to see

659
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,000
which are the files of folders
there in the staging area.

660
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,040
We have this command get Ellis that files.

661
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,440
So let's open up our terminal
and write down

662
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,280
get out of dash class.

663
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,680
So it is now giving me the files
that are there in my state.

664
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,480
There are three files, right?

665
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:34,280
And I see them all.

666
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:40,000
Okay, so this is one of the extra commands
that we we will be learning.

667
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,400
And the point is
that good is a very vast tool.

668
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,920
They are going to be around, you know,

669
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,160
50 commands
that are there that you can run

670
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,280
in your local terminal
to perform different kinds of operations.

671
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:05,240
Do you guys need to memorize
these commands? No.

672
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,520
The basic one you should know

673
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,760
the very basic one, add command, etc.

674
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,200
But these at one does not have to

675
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,040
remember them whenever you want to
in your real life project.

676
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,120
So whenever you need to do
some operations, you can simply go through

677
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,120
the sheet that I'll share with you
at the end of this session.

678
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,600
The whole session I'll shoot with you
a few teed off get.

679
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,640
You're going to always open up
that ship, look for our particular command

680
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,680
and its purpose and use that in your

681
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,480
terminal whenever you need it.

682
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,040
So now

683
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,200
I'm going to teach you a lot of these
powerful commands and their purpose.

684
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,680
You might find them handy whenever you are

685
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,960
working on your project,
you might need them.

686
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,760
In one of the case

687
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,240
scenarios, I want to be going over
to each individual scenario

688
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,520
because that is going
to take a lot of time.

689
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,560
But whenever you are, you should know
the purpose and the scenarios will appear

690
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,440
as you start working on the project.

691
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:09,640
Daedalus files will show you the files
that are there

692
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,560
in your staging area of your data.

693
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:17,040
That's the purpose.

694
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Okay, now let's discuss one scenario.

695
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,480
There was a file.

696
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,640
This file.

697
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,240
Good project one that I am.

698
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,440
I accidentally,
you know, just adding it to staging area.

699
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,480
And now I'm thinking, Oh, my God,
I should not have done that

700
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,760
because I don't want to crack it
right now.

701
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,000
While there might be much more reasons,
number one, it's not ready yet.

702
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,680
There are errors in it and I don't want
to share it with my colleague.

703
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,120
I don't want to crack it right now.

704
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,920
Number two, this is an unnecessary file
which I don't want to crack.

705
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,360
So if that's the scenario.

706
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,600
You and I have already added it
to the staging area.

707
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,360
If I want to remove it,
how can I do that for that purpose?

708
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,720
Again, we have a very good command
available to us.

709
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,640
Let me do that.

710
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,400
To remove any file

711
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,120
from the sitting area,

712
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:24,920
use the command, get on that guest

713
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,560
file.

714
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,600
It's actually dash.

715
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,040
Dash against.

716
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,520
So let's try to move this project.
One dot.

717
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:47,360
I am.

718
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,040
And by the way, guys,
let me tell you another shot that

719
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,680
whenever you are writing down filings

720
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,720
after Dash, if you have written

721
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,360
get press simply tab, it's
going to autofill the name for you guys.

722
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,120
Okay.

723
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,840
After writing that
and it shows all the file like VIP press

724
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,000
tab button
and it's going to fill the whole

725
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:21,320
complaint.

726
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:21,640
Yeah,

727
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,760
Tab. Oh, I'm really sorry.

728
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,520
But for Mac, I don't know
what's the argument before that

729
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,560
maybe it's

730
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,760
okay we have that in in Matt also.

731
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,400
Okay great great

732
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,720
priority. So

733
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,800
this is the command that we are using
to remove the file from the staging area,

734
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,760
get rid the access cache, and after that,
we have to give the filing.

735
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,960
So the shortcut I'm teaching you is type

736
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,920
the initial like get and press tab.

737
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:13,800
It's going to autofill the name for you
guys.

738
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,480
Okay, let's press enter.

739
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:17,840
Okay.

740
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,240
Now it says that that's removed.

741
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,400
We want to see whether it's moved or not.

742
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:37,080
Which command do we have for that?

743
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,720
Get this file that is.

744
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,960
I want to have a look at the files
inside my staging area.

745
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,680
Right.

746
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,120
So I'll use get ls that files?

747
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,640
Do I see now any file of the name.

748
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,000
Good.

749
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,760
Good project
I am. No. Which was being shown before.

750
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,840
Do I see that? No.

751
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,600
It means that it's
successfully removed from US area

752
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,960
so it can be a folder name to serve on
most of that

753
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,000
you have to give the full back.

754
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,800
If you use SRT, it may work, but

755
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,960
most really you will have to give the full

756
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:34,360
back.

757
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,600
You can try on both.

758
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,760
I guess that it will work in
both scenarios, but sometimes it doesn't.

759
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,480
If it doesn't, you have to give
the complete back of that file

760
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,440
that was not working for you.

761
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:53,160
I show you on Mac on my windows.

762
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,840
Mac. I don't know.

763
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,360
That is one back.
If the tab is not working,

764
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,960
just type in the name.

765
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,200
I'm sorry, not a mac expert.

766
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,080
Mac is really hard.

767
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,440
Anyone who had a success with Matt
Mac just, you know.

768
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,840
Okay, it's working for a moment

769
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,520
now. How do I get it back

770
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,920
from simple, right?

771
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,240
What do you think happened?

772
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:33,160
You got it back.

773
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,120
That status?

774
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,200
Yeah, exactly.

775
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,680
Just you get that again.

776
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,120
I will add it up

777
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,120
probably.

778
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:44,320
Right.

779
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:49,040
So let's take a two minute break to digest
all the information that we have learned

780
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,080
until now. Any questions?

781
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:51,840
Let me know.

782
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,640
Anyone who is lagging
behind is going to have join us.

783
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,200
But we're here now.

784
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,000
I want all of you to be on the same page
with me, okay?

785
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,520
Yeah.

786
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,960
2 minutes till eight.

787
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,880
That's not a big break.

788
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,040
It's just for the rest of the summer
to catch up.

789
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,680
That's it.

790
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,920
Okay, so let's see what you got. And

791
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,600
Alex, madam, you also

792
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,640
need to configure your get.

793
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,680
Okay, So you need to use this command

794
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,800
get config
that's desk mobile user dot email.

795
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,040
And then after that, in inverted commas,
you have to enter

796
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,240
your email ID which you are using on.

797
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:32,960
Okay.

798
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,840
And apart from that,
get that desk mobile user name

799
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,160
instead of your name
you have to add to your GitHub username.

800
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,640
Okay. Yeah.

801
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,000
Use this command, but you have example dot
com instead of that,

802
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
use your github

803
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,480
email account.

804
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,320
Okay. Your email account.

805
00:58:54,320 --> 00:59:08,160
Whatever you have on the GitHub. Yes.

806
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,880
We are dealing with right now

807
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:18,920
on local episode.

808
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:26,080
How good for the Mac users.

809
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,960
It's okay if the socket is not working.

810
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,240
I guess you guys can simply chime
in, right?

811
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:35,640
That's fine.

812
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:45,800
Let's figure out the socket later on.

813
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,960
Okay. Still everyone has gassed up, right?

814
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,440
So I need use for even for names
or only something.

815
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,040
Alex just imposed in this board
and someone is going to be there to help

816
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,280
you out. Okay.

817
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:05,560
This is something that you should have
done it already, but not a new machine.

818
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,160
I understand that.

819
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:12,680
Simply get to the support center.

820
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,440
All right. Nightmare.

821
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,360
You know, that's on a day to look at OC.

822
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,200
Not going.

823
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:22,920
You have my console using the command here
to just have a blank console.

824
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:31,080
Okay, So

825
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,160
at any point in time,

826
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,840
if you guys want to have

827
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,840
see the difference of the files

828
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,840
that you have in your

829
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,960
in your app

830
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,920
and of the files that you have
in your staging area,

831
01:00:52,720 --> 01:01:04,480
which command we have for that purpose,

832
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:14,000
that is a list.

833
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,320
Okay.

834
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:19,560
So the thing is that letting you
open the song,

835
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,760
let me update this we remove this right

836
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,640
Don I am plug was the

837
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:31,920
yeah we

838
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,160
didn't move this file.

839
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,240
I would be the person. Just wait a moment.

840
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,360
Let me update the
this picture for you guys so that

841
01:01:44,800 --> 01:02:34,400
everyone is up to do.

842
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,840
Okay. So the

843
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,760
this is updated. Okay.

844
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:46,400
Now if I use get status,
what do you guys expect to see?

845
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,640
I'll be the person who doing okay.

846
01:02:49,640 --> 01:03:01,400
So if I do good service at this point,
what do you guys expect to see?

847
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,840
We remove the item file. Right.

848
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,160
We should be seeing now

849
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,320
that I'm file

850
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,800
has been deleted.

851
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,840
Let's have a

852
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,080
that says that

853
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,480
changes to become.

854
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:23,160
I did get how we did this file got I email

855
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,560
from the staging area so this the one

856
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,600
appearing in green
it shows us the status of the

857
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,400
staging area.

858
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,120
So right now do you guys agree
that we have deleted

859
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,920
this particular file from the

860
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,640
from the staging area?

861
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,480
So it's showing us
that the status of the staging area is

862
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,280
that this is has
been deleted and unset file

863
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,880
because it was deleted from over here, but
it's still present in the working that.

864
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,440
So it stated that this book ready to file
is not being tracked.

865
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,160
So that is what we have just joined us.

866
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,480
Is this

867
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,280
clear to everyone whatever is being shown

868
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:12,600
on the console?

869
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,640
Okay, now we have two options.

870
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,160
What are those two options?

871
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:21,520
Number one,
make a comment of this particular

872
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:27,200
staging area, this particular
speed of staging area, I must see in which

873
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,800
we do not have a dot idea
or I am bookmarked.

874
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,280
So it's going to create a comic
and then a lot be done.

875
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,000
I will file

876
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,440
number one.

877
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,440
This is the thing that we can do.

878
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,280
Number two, what we can do is
we can add this file again

879
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,080
and then do we need to come back
at the inside of this file?

880
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:54,000
What do you guys think?

881
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,320
No, because it will be synchronized again,
right.

882
01:04:59,320 --> 01:04:59,760
Okay.

883
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,400
So is the concept of synchronization

884
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,600
here, Do all of you.

885
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,040
That's how it actually works.

886
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,920
So if that's understood.

887
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:11,440
Very good.

888
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,280
You guys are doing great. Really great.

889
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:15,680
Okay, well, how much?

890
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,160
So what I said is that after the meeting,
this file

891
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:24,760
from the staging area,
we have an unsafe area.

892
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,920
It's a staging area. Right.

893
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,840
This is not synchronized.

894
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,000
Now we have to synchronize
all the three stages.

895
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,120
Number one option is either
we make a comment of this

896
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,120
over here and the apple.

897
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,640
I believe

898
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,400
that this file also from
over here and direction back,

899
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,280
that's going to synchronize it right

900
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,600
this is one of the option.

901
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,680
And the other option is to add this file
name in the staging area.

902
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,560
And we do not have to make even a comment
because everything is at the end

903
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:00,720
going to be synchronize.

904
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,080
These are the two options that we have.

905
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:08,960
And I to think of it.

906
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,160
Okay, so let's do one thing.

907
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,480
Let's simply delete this file

908
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:18,680
from here

909
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,680
and the working.

910
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,160
So I simply did my file dot.

911
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,440
I am on my working day.

912
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:34,400
I want you guys to do the same. Yes.

913
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,200
Synchronization
means that they all are at the same level.

914
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:45,720
They have the same files
at that point in time.

915
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:50,440
Okay, so after deleting this file,
what do you guys expect to see?

916
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:57,800
If I want to get status come up.

917
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,720
Please
tell me without looking at your console,

918
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:10,360
without running the command
that your console console.

919
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,320
Okay, so

920
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,600
let's have a look at this

921
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,360
particular picture
and let's try to realize

922
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,920
if I deleted this dot,

923
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:27,760
I am a file.

924
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,360
I this is what we did, right?
We deleted this dot.

925
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:36,040
I am file from our working directory
right.

926
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,640
Are you with me?

927
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,120
All of you.

928
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,800
To this point we have deleted this dot
I have to file.

929
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,800
Let me show it to you.

930
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,040
You do not have it now

931
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:50,360
this thing that working right
can stay here.

932
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:50,560
Yeah.

933
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,480
They are synchronized

934
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,560
working area and staging area.

935
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,480
Ah, this implies Mohammad and Fahad.

936
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,760
You see that they are synchronized?

937
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,200
Yes, they are synchronized. Right.

938
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:15,960
Okay.

939
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,960
Is the rapport
synchronized with the staging area?

940
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:28,840
Is the rapport
synchronized with the staging area? No.

941
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:34,120
So at this point, if I run the goods Davis
command, what do you guys expect to see?

942
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,920
Whatever we are, we we have discussed
that will be the output, Right?

943
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,240
So can you can someone tell me that
what is going to be

944
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:47,640
there on the console?

945
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,400
Okay, let me give you options.

946
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,320
Let me give you options.

947
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,800
Is there going to be anything in red?

948
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,000
Is there going to be anything in the red?

949
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,880
No, because there is nothing to be had.

950
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:02,520
Right.

951
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,240
Will there anything in the green

952
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,280
showing the status or any changes
that are there in the

953
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,760
staging area?

954
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,800
Yes, there Will be something in green
because these two

955
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,440
things are not synchronized.

956
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,480
Right.

957
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,040
These two
these two things are not synchronized.

958
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,400
So there will be something in Greek
that can show you get status.

959
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,680
There you go.

960
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,760
Yes, Dennis, I know that.

961
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:36,680
But, you know, I just want you guys to
follow my instructions to your concepts.

962
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,440
That's the best I can do.

963
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,080
You should listen to my thing
and do not keep me.

964
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:48,000
That's not a good thing.

965
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,120
Okay, So do you guys see
now that we only see this

966
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,720
particular green signal?

967
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:58,880
And now what I was talking about,
that the staging area, it was not

968
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:04,880
synchronized to get started is showing me
that what needs to be synchronized.

969
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:10,800
Do we get it?

970
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,080
Okay.

971
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:15,240
Something that appears in green
either deleted are either.

972
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,120
Let's see. Added which

973
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,000
which portion

974
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,760
of the grid that refers to like
which portion,

975
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,240
which part of the architecture is to

976
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,160
the staging area.

977
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:35,280
It's referring to the staging area
that needs to be synchronized.

978
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,720
And the one that we see in
red are assigned to be

979
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,680
working dynamically.

980
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:41,480
Right.

981
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,160
This is one one of the ways

982
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:50,200
to have a look at your messages.

983
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,160
Okay,

984
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,520
so what do you guys think now

985
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,240
if I do get comment that what will happen

986
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,880
that will be sent to the staging area?

987
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:32,920
Yes. So let's say that
if I use the command, get comment,

988
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:38,680
second comment,

989
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:45,240
if I use this particular command,
another comment is going to be made

990
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:52,080
and there will be no dot in the file.

991
01:11:52,080 --> 01:12:03,960
Is this what's going to happen?

992
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,480
Okay.

993
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,560
A little question over here.

994
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:11,680
Do you guys think that particular file
is going to be during the first comment

995
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,080
or is it going to be deleted

996
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,480
and the first time it

997
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,400
it will stay? Yes.

998
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:21,920
Perfect.

999
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:26,520
That's the purpose of using good
not to lose our history.

1000
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,040
Remember, whenever we are dealing with it,
we very conscious about our history.

1001
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,840
We do not mess up with the history.

1002
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:40,400
Whatever is there, it's
going to remain there.

1003
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,080
Okay, so let's do this.

1004
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,320
I'm going to open up my terminal.

1005
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,400
No, sorry.

1006
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,640
There's no way you can delete it
from the repo.

1007
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,200
It's going to be there
in your previous coming,

1008
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,040
but it's not going to be
in your latest one.

1009
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,280
Okay, So that's fine. That will be there.

1010
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:06,400
Anything is free, but it is not going
to be in there in the present.

1011
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,000
So recommendation second comment

1012
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,560
I'll be guys, let me know once
you have made the second comment

1013
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:36,720
and then we will be proceeding further.

1014
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,000
Okay.

1015
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,040
At this point,
do you guys think of working great,

1016
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:43,160
the staging area and the repo,
the all our thing

1017
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:53,040
okay.

1018
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,680
For harvesting? No. Why?

1019
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,840
Why? If or not, why did you say no

1020
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,000
to add?

1021
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,720
What?

1022
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,840
Look at the simulation.

1023
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,080
What do you think is missing

1024
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,400
there? Apple has two files staging there.

1025
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,640
You has two files
and are working to create.

1026
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,480
Also has two files on the same and didn't
know these two files are being ignored.

1027
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,080
Right.

1028
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,480
So what's the unseen thing?

1029
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,280
Time. God, I have this picture.

1030
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,200
Oh, of

1031
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,280
So get status

1032
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:41,960
is going to show me nothing.

1033
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,080
Okay, so now tell me if I want to have

1034
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:48,320
a look at my comments.

1035
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,200
What can I use

1036
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:04,960
that lock?

1037
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,680
Yes. Right.

1038
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,760
So that's the get log.

1039
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,040
And let's have a look.

1040
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,440
First, commit

1041
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,760
the outcome. Okay.

1042
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,760
So those of you who are having problem,
that's the reason you need

1043
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,560
to have your email address
and username enter

1044
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:26,040
so that it can get of label

1045
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,840
your name
and your email ID with your comments.

1046
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,400
That's why you were having that problem.

1047
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,560
So this is my first time
and this is my second comment

1048
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,000
and this is the commit quote that we have.

1049
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,480
And they are going to be unique.

1050
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,400
Yes, them and I should go ahead.

1051
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:57,160
94 was that there is 94.

1052
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,320
Yeah.

1053
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,280
We have loop gaps.

1054
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,440
So we do that with this one step.

1055
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,040
So do we need that I'm

1056
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,560
I so we just the that file

1057
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:20,880
I don't have it.

1058
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,600
Okay so my last thing happens
that I didn't get that is that it's

1059
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,440
still trying to delete the file correct.

1060
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,000
Okay. Did you delete it wrong

1061
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,640
here and do opposite and local.

1062
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:44,440
What exactly. No.

1063
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,480
You must have skipped does that.

1064
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,720
That's why that's happening.

1065
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,600
Okay, but don't worry.

1066
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:56,200
Even if that's doing, if it's there,
that's fine.

1067
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,080
You must have skipped some step.

1068
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,960
Just make sure that you get that. Not.

1069
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,520
Why do you need to?

1070
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,600
I don't think that you need to add
something.

1071
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,400
If you have deleted it
and everything is synchronized,

1072
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,160
then it should not appear in that.

1073
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,440
It did not appear at for me.

1074
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,280
So for all of us,
the output should be exactly the same.

1075
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,920
If you are following
all the stuff that I'm doing.

1076
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:24,280
That's why I mentioned that never run
a command until and unless I have ran it.

1077
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,640
I give you time to run this.

1078
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,000
So please just try to be,
you know, hold your horses

1079
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,640
before you under command.

1080
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:36,760
But that's fine.

1081
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,280
Let's let's move forward. Okay, guys.

1082
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:42,360
So one thing that I want to ask you

1083
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,680
to manage later,
I will have to look at it in the break.

1084
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,000
Okay?

1085
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,560
I'll help you out.

1086
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,080
Okay, guys.

1087
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,480
So let's focus on this.

1088
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,800
I'll have coming out later
on. Let's focus on this.

1089
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,600
I want you guys to tell me that.

1090
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:12,600
What is this?

1091
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,400
Do we know anything of budget?

1092
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,360
No, we don't. Great.

1093
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:17,960
So let's not say that Brad.

1094
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:22,120
So let's not confuse us.

1095
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,480
Okay, So her hat is like a pointer.

1096
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,600
You guys do know that.

1097
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,280
What's a pointer?

1098
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:31,840
Right?

1099
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,600
So let's say in your GitHub,
you have different commits

1100
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,040
and your head

1101
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:43,080
let me call it call this hat.

1102
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:46,080
How disappointing
do this particular comment

1103
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,680
it means that right now

1104
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:56,960
this particular commit is in your working
directory.

1105
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,720
Okay.

1106
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:01,920
Does this make sense to all of you?

1107
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,360
Okay. So what if I say had

1108
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,240
plans to this particular commit?

1109
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,640
What if I say this?

1110
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:21,560
What does this mean? Yes.

1111
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:25,320
If the hat is pointing to the first commit
that it means that

1112
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,400
in my working type right now
I have my first one.

1113
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,880
Okay,

1114
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,680
so whichever commit is going to be there
in the version

1115
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:44,040
that we had
is going to be pointing towards that.

1116
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:54,560
Is that understood?

1117
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,360
Yes, we have by
default is pointing to the last minute.

1118
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,160
Okay. I repeat.

1119
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:00,480
Okay.

1120
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:04,360
So, hey, wherever see this particular hat

1121
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:07,800
that anarchy and then master it means that

1122
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,200
we had is pointing do

1123
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,320
that particular commit.

1124
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:16,960
So if this particular hat
is pointing to our second commit,

1125
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,160
it means that our second commit

1126
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:24,880
is present in the working directory.

1127
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:29,160
Whichever commit does the hat one
two words

1128
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:35,760
that commit is present
in the working directory.

1129
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,520
If your this one do second
it means that just second commit

1130
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:43,240
in your working directory.

1131
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,080
Okay.

1132
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,800
So if if.

1133
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:49,280
Now the question is that
if my hat is pointing to the first commit,

1134
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,280
then what record is going to be there
in my

1135
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,840
in my working agree.

1136
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,480
If this is the scenario
that had this pointing the first coming,

1137
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,800
then which code is going
to be there and the that

1138
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,680
the first commit is going to be
the networking directory.

1139
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:06,800
Simple enough guys.

1140
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,760
This this is nothing complicated, right?

1141
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,840
I'm going to write it down.

1142
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,120
So for those of you
who still have misconception

1143
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,520
can get it get

1144
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,640
let me copy that.

1145
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,680
That's not bad.

1146
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,760
Master

1147
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,280
points to the commit

1148
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:35,880
which you out in your wrapper

1149
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,400
by default it once did.

1150
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,760
The latest coming

1151
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,040
okay a medical response to the latest

1152
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:53,600
coming right so our latest one
is the second command commit.

1153
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,760
So it's going to be pointing towards that.

1154
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:05,000
I know you'll be done
working that we had this pointing

1155
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,080
towards the commit in the working that you
which is in our

1156
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,520
in the under apple
which is now working that

1157
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:18,600
okay to that

1158
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:23,800
which you have in your assignment
biological.

1159
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,800
I'm ready
sort of with that thanks for the days

01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,360
I can make mistakes. I'm sorry for that.

1162
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,520
I wish I was a roadblock.
No, sorry, I don't.

1163
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,800
We stop. Just kidding.

1164
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,840
Can you show your terminal?

01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,720
Yeah, sure. There.

1166
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:49,160
You know it.

1167
01:22:49,160 --> 01:23:05,520
There's my terminal.

1168
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,000
Okay, guys.

1169
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:06,760

I can give you 10 minutes if you give me
a five minute lecture by off the class.

01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:53,760
Let's go for 1515.

You asked me that.

1181
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:02,160
That's that's a nice example.

01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,840
Alex can you help him
because he had the same problem

1193
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,040
at the moment.

1194
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,400
Here you screenshot.

1195
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:56,840
Let me.

1196
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,600
Yes I'm record

1197
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,560
after the second commit
and it gets digitized.

1198
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,720
Try still read.

1199
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,360
No that is no.

1200
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,760
Okay then unless you have a screenshot
of your terminal,

the screenshot of this terminal.

1202
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,400
Can you just collaborate with Alex?

He's going to help you out.

1204

Is there anyone support Marcos
and are you there?

1205
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:23,800
Okay, so this status.

1206
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,400
Okay then the reason being that
get project deal one that I am

1207
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,520
I can still see it
in your working directory.

1208
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,400
Why does it still do
this? It's appearing in red.

1209
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:39,960
It means that there is something
that is still untracked showing you that

1210
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,480
your your project 01.

1211
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,480
email is untried
and it's in there and you'll automatically

1212
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:53,040
you have not needed from the version
that they can get you need to from there

1213
01:26:53,320 --> 01:27:19,920
and then run the status command.

1214
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:23,680
What's this like what is this last mile
what do you see this project,

1215
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,840
the one that I am or why do I see this?

1216
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:28,560
I'm going to go to see.

1217
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,520
It is a table for you.

1218
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,400
I can see this project to one point.

1219
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:37,520
I am the last file.

1220
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:38,720
Seriously?

1221
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,040
Okay, come on up.

1222
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,440
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1223
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:46,680
Can you have a look at this six folder?

1224
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:48,520
What's that?

1225
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,520
Oh, oh, Oh, I'm not.

1226
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:54,920
Seriously, dude, seriously.

1227
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:59,840
Like I was.

1228
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:04,000
I thought there's some kind of spooky
stuff going on because I can see that

1229
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,280
you're saying that you.

1230
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,880
You are able to see. It's
not that. Okay, that's fine.

1231
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:08,720
Sorry. Shit.

1232
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,840
So that's fine.

1233
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:22,720
Anyone else?

1234
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:25,800
I guess now. So I'll go straight to that.

1235
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,120
See you guys at

1236
01:28:28,160 --> 01:38:06,840
839. Okay.

1237
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,400
So it to the nine break time as a rule,

1238
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:17,320
I hope that all of you are back to.

1239
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:21,080
Okay, so

1240
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,920
and then no,

1241
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,000
I guess back.

1242
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,920
Okay, great.

1243
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:31,640
Great.

1244
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:35,240
Perfect.

1245
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:40,280
So let's do one thing now.

1246
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:44,080
We will be discussing a little bit
more about these demands and then we'll

1247
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,680
be proceeding on to the next topic.

1248
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:48,560
But before

1249
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,600
that there are two very powerful commands

1250
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,160
that are going to come very handy
when you guys are having some problem.

1251
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,120
So before you actually use these commands,

1252
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:04,560
I highly recommend that you do
not anything on your own computers.

1253
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,160
You just look at what I'm going
to show you, okay,

1254
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:12,720
So do I have your attention, all of you

1255
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,440
just need to understand how they work,
okay?

1256
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,280
I don't want you to do anything.

1257
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,920
You do not have to execute these commands.

1258
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,760
Please just watch the instructions.

1259
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:23,960
I hope to you.

1260
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:26,720
Okay, So let's see

1261
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,000
before we actually jump into it, Let's.

1262
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,800
Yeah, You have to promise for that.

1263
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,240
Let's review that.

1264
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:37,480
What we have done when we left,
we centralized everything, right?

1265
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:40,880
Remember, we have synchronize everything,
the rapport, the staging area

1266
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:46,720
and our that.

1267
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:51,640
So at this point if I run get status
what do you guys expect to see the output

1268
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,760
symmetry right.

1269
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:02,880
This is what we are expecting
so I'm going to open up my terminal

1270
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,640
and I'm going to get status

1271
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:09,160
out of it.

1272
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,680
So what's stack

1273
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,720
up? What is that? So

1274
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:16,960
just wait. Just wait a moment.

1275
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,240
If it blew up, it shouldn't have happened.

1276
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,440
I'm ready.

1277
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:23,440
You know, that's that guest.

1278
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:23,800
Yeah.

1279
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,400
Okay, that's fine.

1280
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:30,360
I'll Now look at it.

1281
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,240
So let's do it.

1282
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:33,600
They have moved up

1283
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:37,280
against status.

1284
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,120
Okay?

1285
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:44,280
Nothing. Nothing. Okay, now what do I see?

1286
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,600
I see that for me

1287
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:50,480
shows that I have
what if by the following dot Java,

1288
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:58,160
what did you have to do that? No.

1289
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,480
Okay, now I'm. I'm going. Okay.

1290
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:05,040
I have not made any changes,
and it seemed that this fight is modified.

1291
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,280
I'm very brave. Okay, What should I do?

1292
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:17,360
So what do you guys expect
that I should do?

1293
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:19,360
No, I cannot just ignore

1294
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:20,760
call.

1295
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,040
I mean, what I'll be holding up
is the lesson alone.

1296
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:27,840
I think that you get abnormal.

1297
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,720
But the problem is that

1298
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,040
if I do this, it will mean that

1299
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:36,240
I don't know what changes are there in my.

1300
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,400
And I'm trying to add them. Right.

1301
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,120
Is that a good thing to do?

1302
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:46,720
No, no.

1303
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,760
I do not even want to add us.

1304
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:54,040
RC Okay, so this is the problem
that you guys would be as you proceed

1305
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:58,120
in your group projects wherever you are
working, you will see that

1306
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,200
like you cannot make any changes

1307
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,520
and this kind of message is appearing.

1308
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,200
There might be others.

1309
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:11,080
You could also have this book in that
we have a particular command

1310
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:14,280
in order to view such situations
that what's going wrong

1311
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:17,160
and that critical command is get this.

1312
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,160
So get this is the command that shows us.

1313
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:23,120
Remember, you will not be
doing anything. Remember that

1314
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:27,360
get this shows us

1315
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:35,200
that difference in the files,
the staging area

1316
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:47,080
and the working directory.

1317
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:47,520
Okay, guys.

1318
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:51,120
So it's saying that it's modified
using this particular command.

1319
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,080
I can see that.

1320
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:57,360
What modifications have been made right,
Because it will show me the changes

1321
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,400
that are there in the file
which is in the working.

1322
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,200
I see.

1323
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,720
And the one which is in the staging area.

1324
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:06,080
And then I can decide
whether need to come back.

1325
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:10,000
Those changes are like my file
to the previous state.

1326
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:14,480
So let's have a look at that.

1327
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,000
Okay.

1328
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,320
So that's the change.

1329
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,640
An empty line.

1330
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:23,160
I have accidentally inserted
an empty line,

1331
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,360
which it was taking as a modification

1332
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,560
in the file

1333
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,040
that not that all of you

1334
01:43:38,040 --> 01:43:43,840
on this point.

1335
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,320
So I don't need this. Right.

1336
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:50,640
So what I can simply do is I can

1337
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,280
try to,

1338
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,760
you know,

1339
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,880
delete it if I want.

1340
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:03,480
Let's see if this removes it.

1341
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:11,840
Now. Okay.

1342
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,280
Yeah. Now that there's nothing to commit.

1343
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:17,840
Now I have I just did that line
and it says that everything is

1344
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:26,160
same.

1345
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:29,240
Okay,
so this is one of the use case. Okay.

1346
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:30,520
Of this particular command.

1347
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:32,560
Look,
there you got it will be using it a lot.

1348
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,800
Let's assume that, you know,
there are some changes

1349
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:40,800
that you made in your code
and you need to compare it before it.

1350
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,720
You need to compare that filed
with the file in the staging area.

1351
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,800
You need to make sure
that those that you are making are there.

1352
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:52,280
So you can you make use of this,
come back similar to this.

1353
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:57,600
Let's do one more thing.

1354
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:03,080
Let's open up our encounter
and and to become and to the other

1355
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,360
systems are different languages
I'm back track

1356
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,240
let's add
this let me know once you have added it

1357
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:27,040
we simply open up our SRT

1358
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,520
and we have added another line

1359
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:36,920
which is I'm back backup. Yes.

1360
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:37,280
You with that.

1361
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:40,600
You were right about it.

1362
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,880
Okay. So

1363
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,560
all of you have added it right

1364
01:45:45,560 --> 01:45:47,360
now. Let's open up our terminal.

1365
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,200
I'm going to do it.

1366
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:49,800
First of all.

1367
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,440
Tell me if I do get this,

1368
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,360
what changes do you guys expect

1369
01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:10,600
to see? Yes.

1370
01:46:10,680 --> 01:46:12,360
Get this.

1371
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,720
That's showing me that

1372
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:17,600
you have added this second line.

1373
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,840
This is a nation in the file.

1374
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,160
Okay, So now if I do get status,

1375
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:33,480
what will I see?

1376
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:37,080
Get status is going to show me what

1377
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:40,200
a modification in

1378
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,400
made on Java. Right?

1379
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,880
Right.

1380
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:45,160
There you go.

1381
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:49,000
And now I want to add it to my

1382
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,000
staging area.

1383
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,320
So what I would like to

1384
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:02,560
get at DOT update

1385
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:13,680
and now I want to make a comment of this
file.

1386
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:14,080
Okay.

1387
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,680
So let's wait before we make a comment.

1388
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,000
Okay.

1389
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,720
Before we make a comment,
let's wait and let's do one of them.

1390
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:24,480
Let's our pictorial representation.

1391
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,520
Okay. So over here,

1392
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:32,760
let me quickly color it red.

1393
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:37,160
And when we did
get at on this particular command,

1394
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:42,680
when we ran it, the screen,
what happened is that it

1395
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,880
took the snapshot of the updated SRT

1396
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:50,240
and it placed it in here

1397
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:05,240
reference.

1398
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:08,120
So this is what happened right

1399
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:12,760
after we landed that dot.

1400
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,600
It updated the authority,

1401
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,320
sent back to the white there.

1402
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:24,440
What that is, is this clear to all of you?

1403
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:28,560
Okay, now, before we make a comment,
before we actually make a comment

1404
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:31,440
in the Wrap, what I want to do is
I want to see the difference

1405
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,920
of the five zero in the reticle
and in the staging area for that purpose.

1406
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:36,680
We have a command

1407
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,640
get death mask that stays

1408
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:45,400
there. You

1409
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,520
so this particular command

1410
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:58,240
with the best staged is going to show me
the difference between the files,

1411
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:18,880
which I'm not seeing in the repo
and in the staging area.

1412
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:19,920
Okay. One more time.

1413
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,360
I'm going to I'm going to read that.

1414
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:29,800
So what we did
is that we modified our SRT, right?

1415
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,760
And then we use get ADD doc,

1416
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:35,080
it added that file to the staging area.

1417
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,040
Now is the word from the command
staging area

1418
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:42,040
at the same sync level after this command,

1419
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:45,120
get that dot
and they have the same sync level.

1420
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:47,240
Yes they are.

1421
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:49,880
Now before

1422
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:53,960
I think my staging area and my rapport
before I see that,

1423
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:57,240
I want to see the difference
between the files that are out there

1424
01:49:57,240 --> 01:50:07,920
in the staging area
and the wrapper cannot see the difference.

1425
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:13,680
Yes, for that I have a command
which is get death dash dash stage.

1426
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:15,400
The previous one was get def

1427
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,440
only.

1428
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,600
The next one is

1429
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,640
get death.

1430
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:24,120
That staged

1431
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,160
and it's going to show us the difference

1432
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:28,000
in the files

1433
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:33,560
in the staging area and we record.

1434
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:46,960
So there you click

1435
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,880
that will show the difference
between the files

1436
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:51,000
and the staging area
and working correctly.

1437
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,840
Get that back up stage is going to show
the difference between the file

1438
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:58,480
and the working directory and the staging
represent the staging area.

1439
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,680
Let me mention it over here

1440
01:51:01,680 --> 01:51:04,880
like this.

1441
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:07,000
This particular difference is shown by

1442
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,880
get the

1443
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:19,160
this particular difference in the five

1444
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:20,640
filling by

1445
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,920
get the access states.

1446
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:27,800
Okay.

1447
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,880
So now is it is it clear to all of you

1448
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:41,320
right.

1449
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:47,800
Okay, great.

1450
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:51,560
So what I want

1451
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:55,040
you guys to do now is

1452
01:51:56,400 --> 01:52:00,520
have this difference,
write this down and then

1453
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,440
run the commands get add dot

1454
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:07,440
to add

1455
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:11,280
this file in the staging area
and then let us together made a command.

1456
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,240
So we are synchronized together

1457
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:16,080
and we all have
the same number of comments.

1458
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:19,520
Let's do that. So

1459
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:22,440
let me know when you got once

1460
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:27,560
you are updated to this point,

1461
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:30,480
made the modification in your code,

1462
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,280
just add this file,

1463
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,920
add this line.

1464
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:38,600
Once you have added this line,
then what you need to do is then you

1465
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:42,600
need to run the command, get to add dot
to bring it to the staging area.

1466
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:49,720
And after that
you make a comment to the AP.

1467
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:57,160
I'll give all of you time till 854.

1468
01:52:57,160 --> 01:52:58,880
Let's make it. Make what?
Make the comment.

1469
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,880
No, let's wait.

1470
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:02,640
Let's wait for the rest of the guys. Let's

1471
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,280
let them catch up and then

1472
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:10,760
we'll be proceeding to that.

1473
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:12,920
Yeah, let's make it all the way out of it.

1474
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:16,880
Great.

1475
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:19,680
Oh, there we go. 54 three.

1476
01:53:19,680 --> 01:53:21,960
Now, simply,

1477
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,440
I would have to use the get comment dash

1478
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:34,360
select on it right.

1479
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:38,640
And this is going to actually
bring this over here

1480
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:41,800
and this video is

1481
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:48,840
and the hand is going to want two towards
by default.

1482
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:50,960
The latest coming right

1483
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:03,600
So get commit action

1484
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:09,240
so current.

1485
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:11,280
Okay. And now if I do this log,

1486
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:14,600
I see all my pre commits over there.

1487
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,680
Let me know
if you guys are done to this point

1488
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:21,240
and then you will be proceeding together
for the

1489
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:36,720
okay to all have.

1490
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:41,240
We can quickly just do this
and then it will be presumed you got

1491
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:52,440
the third commit is still in working area.

1492
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:56,560
I didn't I did not get you

1493
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:06,600
to my update.

1494
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,000
So you are talking about the fact.

1495
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,400
Now let me show
you get the lot of you guys.

1496
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:14,560
So my head master is pointing
towards my coat coming.

1497
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:19,280
What does this mean?

1498
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,600
Okay, so you need to do this.

1499
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:26,760
You need to WQ or that's just you.

1500
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:29,680
You need to press WQ or Q

1501
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:31,560
or. Right.

1502
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:34,280
Okay.

1503
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:38,840
So if they had this pointing
towards my code commit,

1504
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:42,920
it means that right now in my working day,

1505
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:47,440
this is the present op.

1506
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:48,440
You have to

1507
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:52,640
look.

1508
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:55,080
Look, I said you need to press.

1509
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,360
Q how to write down.

1510
01:55:57,360 --> 01:56:01,640
Q When press enter or press WQ and enter
after the column.

1511
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:05,080
So I'm writing nice on one of these,
you can choose about it

1512
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:11,640
if that doesn't work and try

1513
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,400
window see okay, work program.

1514
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,720
Oh, okay, guys.

1515
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:23,480
So let me look at the notes.

1516
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:26,360
The next command
that we have in our plate.

1517
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:33,400
Let's have a look at that.

1518
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:39,160
Oh, well, Alex,

1519
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:41,520
That's right.

1520
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:44,360
Because you are not

1521
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:46,120
following me.

1522
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:48,640
You have done some of the stuff.

1523
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:52,960
That's why it's right.

1524
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:53,600
Yeah,

1525
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:56,720
we have discussed nothing about GitHub.

1526
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:59,240
We will be doing that
and then it will ask that.

1527
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:02,280
Okay, So

1528
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:13,280
one command, which I love,

1529
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:23,240
I'll show it to you guys.

1530
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:24,960
Okay, so let's do that.

1531
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,120
One day I was, I was just sitting down

1532
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:31,440
and I accidentally

1533
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:34,200
deleted my ASIC

1534
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:38,880
books that got deleted.

1535
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:41,160
Let's do that in real

1536
01:57:41,960 --> 01:57:42,440
order.

1537
01:57:42,440 --> 01:57:44,200
That got deleted.

1538
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:50,960
Now what? No,

1539
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:54,200
no, no. Don't do it, guys.

1540
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:55,400
You don't have to do this, okay?

1541
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:57,160
Only just have a look at this.

1542
01:57:57,160 --> 01:58:02,880
Not no one is going to follow this.

1543
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:05,800
Oh, even if that's deleted, no problem.

1544
01:58:05,800 --> 01:58:08,400
We have that file
in my staging area. Right.

1545
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:12,960
So? So let's try to recover it.

1546
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:18,720
Come over there
and I'll say get talk. SIRC

1547
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:22,400
and there we go.

1548
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:22,920
SIRC.

1549
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:29,960
Is that so?

1550
01:58:29,960 --> 01:58:33,240
A simple command I'll just mention Get

1551
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,800
restore

1552
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:38,680
file name

1553
01:58:40,280 --> 01:58:43,360
to restore a file

1554
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,280
from your

1555
01:58:45,360 --> 01:59:01,040
staging area.

1556
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:01,680
Okay.

1557
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:05,680
So apart from this, we have other commands
also, which I'll share with you,

1558
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:07,320
but I'll not keep you.

1559
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:09,040
I will just share it with you.

1560
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:12,960
But I believe that
after going to all these commands,

1561
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:16,680
you guys, I have made you capable enough
to understand the meaning.

1562
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:19,840
And I have made you capable enough
to write this.

1563
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,360
Those commands on your own,

1564
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:25,520
if that's what I'm expecting, is
my expectation.

1565
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:29,640
Correct With you.

1566
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:31,320
Right. Because they are simple.

1567
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:35,480
You just need to understand the purpose
and run those command and build work.

1568
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:36,120
Right.

1569
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:39,080
So I have told you guys how to fish.

1570
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:42,280
Now fishing is your job, not mine.

1571
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:49,960
You had to fish and eat yourself.

1572
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,480
We cannot have.
We still have one. All right.

1573
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:55,240
Yeah, we do have.

1574
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:57,480
I love fishing. Fishing today.

1575
01:59:57,480 --> 01:59:59,840
I mean, I also love fishing a lot.

1576
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:02,880
And I would do that, though,
but maybe one day.

1577
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,280
What was the last command?

1578
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:06,760
The last amount is this one.

1579
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:10,320
Just restore five.

1580
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,480
That restore planet?

1581
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:13,200
Yes. Yes.

1582
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:17,160
We still have one hour left
and we will be doing cloning.

1583
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,440
Don't worry about that.

1584
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:22,440
Okay. So

1585
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,200
I want you guys to take one minute,

1586
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:33,440
take your breath and let your mind align

1587
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:36,040
because we are going to be jumping on
to the next stop.

1588
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:40,080
And I really want all of you to be here
with everything

1589
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:43,800
that we have done on the local repository
so that we can smoothly work

1590
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:53,440
on the next topic.

1591
02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:54,240
Okay.

1592
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:58,680
So before we move on to the next topic,
here's what we are going to do.

1593
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:00,880
I'm going to delete

1594
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,480
this avatar that we have done

1595
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:08,480
quickly, but

1596
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:12,560
and I'm going to

1597
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:18,840
create my GitHub

1598
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:22,600
repo man,
going to connect it with my local wrap.

1599
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:25,920
So I want you guys to do it with me.

1600
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,440
We are going to do it together.

1601
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:31,840
I believe that you guys watched
the videos.

1602
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:37,200
You have a clear idea of what not to do
and what to do while creating a backup.

1603
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:41,360
How many repo should be connected
to your one remote repo?

1604
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:44,760
I believe that all of you understand
that, right?

1605
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:49,360
Because I'm not going to go through
that, Alex, many, many times.

1606
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:52,920
So let's go hard on GitHub

1607
02:01:55,680 --> 02:01:59,480
and let's try to create a rapport.

1608
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:03,320
So I'll be creating a new rapport

1609
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:05,040
on your episode, please,

1610
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:08,680
and I'll click on New Rapport.

1611
02:02:08,680 --> 02:02:14,440
So are you guys following me?

1612
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:16,520
Okay, so does that code name is

1613
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:24,800
get that level?

1614
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,360
Because you know, you're
just creating a remote wrap on GitHub.

1615
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:29,920
That's it. Okay.

1616
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:33,120
So you also have to go to your GitHub
accounts,

1617
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:37,960
create a repository, make it public,
not private, and we'll discuss that.

1618
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:43,320
Why it has to be public and
then you will not be selecting anything.

1619
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:48,600
You just completely contrary aggressively.

1620
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:52,240
Okay,
so once we have created the repository,

1621
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:54,280
so if I could show you on simulation,

1622
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:57,480
this stuff is going to be there
on the Internet, on GitHub.

1623
02:02:57,680 --> 02:02:58,320
Right?

1624
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:01,280
Let's do GitHub.

1625
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,720
Let me go have this there.

1626
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:09,000
Now, my local oracle has some stuff,
but my remote report is empty,

1627
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,800
so how can I send my stuff
from the local to the remote?

1628
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:29,240
What are the steps?

1629
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:32,320
First of all, establish following

1630
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:36,520
that remote at origin

1631
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:39,800
and the address

1632
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:44,520
to which you want to connect right.

1633
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:47,800
So I'm going to go to my terminal.

1634
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:50,760
I'll say get remote

1635
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:54,960
and origin and the address.

1636
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,120
I can simply take it from over here

1637
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:01,120
or come over here or fall over here
anywhere.

1638
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:03,600
And I just need the you

1639
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:05,760
of this personal representative

1640
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:14,400
so I can select it from anywhere.

1641
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:15,280
So there I go.

1642
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:18,240
We have this one

1643
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:21,400
that connected it.

1644
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:24,360
Okay, so now who is asking that?

1645
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:28,920
How about if you want to push two already
existing rapport?

1646
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:29,640
Okay,

1647
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:33,840
so now if you want to do
an existing rapport,

1648
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,960
my first question to you is,

1649
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,880
does it have any content already

1650
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:45,960
or is it empty?

1651
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:48,400
Is it empty or does it have any content?

1652
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:51,200
It has some content. Okay, guys.

1653
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:53,520
So that question has been raised.

1654
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,720
I'm going to just answer it.

1655
02:04:55,720 --> 02:05:00,120
So now it is asking me that
what if we have all our apple

1656
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:04,440
with some number of comments right?

1657
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:05,880
One, two, three,

1658
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:09,240
and we want to connect

1659
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:11,600
this particular output to our

1660
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:15,360
already established that one.

1661
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:18,120
Get up and send the data over here.

1662
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:20,160
What do you guys take?

1663
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:31,840
Would we be able to do that?

1664
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:32,320
Okay,

1665
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:37,440
so for those of you who are saying maybe
and who are confused, I'm going to

1666
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:42,040
make it clear for you,
but please pay attention to this concept

1667
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:44,040
because I don't like repeated at the end,
okay.

1668
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:47,880
Because this is something that
I really want you guys to be very about.

1669
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:51,600
Okay, So listen, if we try to do this,

1670
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:55,320
first of all, I'll have to establish
a link, right?

1671
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:58,320
A connection.

1672
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,360
Obviously,
I'll have to establish a connection.

1673
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:06,040
Let's say
we have established a connection.

1674
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:12,400
Okay, Now, my question to you guys
is when I will use the command,

1675
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:17,800
get push.

1676
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:20,040
What is it going to try to do?

1677
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:26,360
What will this command do?

1678
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:40,160
Just type in whatever you think.

1679
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:41,840
Okay So.

1680
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:42,920
Okay.

1681
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:44,760
So okay, fine.

1682
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:47,040
Now, here is this concept.

1683
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:52,560
There is this concept,
this call already has some command.

1684
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:53,800
It's already established.

1685
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:55,960
We have not pushed anything.

1686
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:59,280
So tell me first is the history of border
Apple.

1687
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:03,920
Same is this is this history over here,

1688
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:08,240
this rapport? No.

1689
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:13,160
When we tried to push it was
is there going to be a conflict

1690
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:18,200
in the history of border apples? Yes.

1691
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:21,840
So it's not going to allow us to push

1692
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:27,560
it. Let's say
there is already some history

1693
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:33,920
on remote apple that you do not have

1694
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:43,120
on local.

1695
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:46,880
It will say there's already some history
on remote report

1696
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:50,520
that you do not have on the local
and it is right about it right.

1697
02:07:50,760 --> 02:07:52,080
He's very smart guys

1698
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,800
so what is the solution to this

1699
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,000
What do you guys

1700
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:09,840
the solution to

1701
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:13,920
this is to create a new replica.

1702
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:17,520
And there's another solution
which we will not be discussing right now.

1703
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:20,960
I just it up and you will be discussing it
in the future.

1704
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:23,960
And that one is to

1705
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:26,520
mask the history for that purpose.

1706
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:30,840
You will have to first download
this history in your local apple,

1707
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:38,400
and then we be able to push make sense.

1708
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,600
Okay, so.

1709
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:42,080
But now, for now,
we will not be discussing that.

1710
02:08:42,080 --> 02:08:44,000
We will be just creating a new apple.

1711
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,080
So now is what I hear about this
concept. Now

1712
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:55,120
this.

1713
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:56,080
Okay, great.

1714
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:59,680
For now, I hope that you will be
also in the future.

1715
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:02,440
Okay guys,
I think I skipped your questions for you.

1716
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:05,040
If you if you want to ask them
quickly, ask them because

1717
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:06,960
I skipped them.

1718
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:10,200
They are I'm not going up.

1719
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:11,840
So let's see what

1720
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:21,320
what these are.

1721
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:25,200
It is the stupid question is that
when the terminal doesn't have anything,

1722
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:26,040
what to that or not?

1723
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:27,880
That's an important question
to mind about it.

1724
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:33,160
It's not a stupid because that is going
to happen to a lot of you.

1725
02:09:33,160 --> 02:09:34,680
When you will be

1726
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:37,880
using the command object log,
it will most probably not allow you

1727
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:38,840
to write anything.

1728
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:41,840
But in order to escape that solution,
what you have to do is

1729
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:48,080
use column WQ

1730
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:51,440
and press enter.

1731
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:52,160
Okay,

1732
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:56,120
I just use column Q that to help you

1733
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:59,400
exit the editing mode of the terminal.

1734
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:02,800
So just make sure that you remember this.

1735
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,800
So is that one of the instructors need
I mean, they were adding a bit

1736
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:07,240
in the content in there.

1737
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:09,360
Yes, that that is what they were doing.

1738
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:12,040
They were matching the history
and then they were working.

1739
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:14,240
So whenever so here is

1740
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:16,800
pushing something on GitHub

1741
02:10:16,800 --> 02:10:19,800
and I come in
and I try to push in there first,

1742
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:24,200
I always make sure the history is matching
and after that I push it.

1743
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:27,360
So we will be learning
that hard to do in the future classes.

1744
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,760
But for now
we will be creating a new GitHub wrapper.

1745
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:33,000
Okay,
so that is I have created a new report

1746
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,600
and how to have established on that.

1747
02:10:34,600 --> 02:10:37,200
Let me know when you guys have established
something using the command

1748
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:48,640
with remote abrasion.

1749
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:54,520
So the second step is name the branch.

1750
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:58,120
What is this we'll be discussing
in the next coming classes?

1751
02:10:58,120 --> 02:11:00,680
But for now
we will be just going along with that.

1752
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:04,800
We have the name my branch,
so get a branch

1753
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:08,680
dash and me.

1754
02:11:08,680 --> 02:11:32,120
We will run this command.

1755
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:34,920
Okay, so we need all these two commands.

1756
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,680
Well, we need to establish a connection.

1757
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:41,120
After that, we do not ever have to run it
once the connection has been established.

1758
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:47,760
Do you guys know that?

1759
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:49,280
Okay. Vega, Grace.

1760
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:49,680
Alexa.

1761
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:56,640
I'll come to that.

1762
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:58,040
That's okay.

1763
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:00,600
Let me know what you guys have done
from this point.

1764
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:03,480
I'll of you and, then I'll be telling you

1765
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,200
something else

1766
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:07,720
similar.

1767
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:10,640
This is what I said. So

1768
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:21,400
once.

1769
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:23,480
Well, it can

1770
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:32,960
at this point I'm going. How?

1771
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:38,160
And well, if you enter the wrong origin,

1772
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:41,280
it's going to change origin, right?

1773
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:46,040
So if you enter the wrong name, it's
going to change the boss name.

1774
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:46,800
Right?

1775
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:56,640
So that's how it can be problematic.

1776
02:12:56,640 --> 02:12:59,880
Okay, so I'm going to teach you
something out of this

1777
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:03,760
might come in handy.

1778
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:06,120
What if you want to check the connection

1779
02:13:06,480 --> 02:13:08,600
that is established,
you want to have a look at it?

1780
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:10,320
Is it the correct one?

1781
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:16,560
You want to make sure
that you get the one that we.

1782
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:19,520
And there you go. You have the address
to that in the repository.

1783
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:22,240
You make sure you read it syntax applied.

1784
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:23,840
You get that allowed on here.

1785
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,720
Is that the correct repository
where I want to put. Yes.

1786
02:13:27,720 --> 02:13:30,800
This is the correct neighborhood
which so I'm just making sure

1787
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:33,840
that I have enough
in my up to the right level

1788
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:37,400
of work all the time.

1789
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:41,480
It may happen that we accidentally
are getting the error that this

1790
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:46,080
that you cannot wish to so desperately
go ahead use this command

1791
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:49,440
so make sure you are connected
to the right repository.

1792
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:52,080
Okay.

1793
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:54,200
Know sort of on use make no matter

1794
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,400
with the more that we

1795
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:04,080
do check the address through which

1796
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:07,840
your local is kind of

1797
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:15,880
like this.

1798
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:20,520
Okay, come on Fahad, I'm going to that.

1799
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:22,200
Come towards that.

1800
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:24,160
Let me time. Max,

1801
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:26,840
Trust me, I won't leave anything.

1802
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:29,400
Well, yeah, your pass is very fast.

1803
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:32,760
Okay, so

1804
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:34,800
this is something
that you guys should not do.

1805
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:36,720
I'll just.

1806
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:39,560
I'm just mentioning it
For your information.

1807
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:42,320
You do not have to follow me on this,
okay?

1808
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:43,640
You do not have to follow me.

1809
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:45,840
I'm repeating.

1810
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:48,400
Do not follow me.

1811
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:52,960
What if you entered the wrong origin?

1812
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:56,680
You can simply remove that and enter
the right one.

1813
02:14:57,120 --> 02:15:00,640
Get remove.

1814
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:04,480
What's the command item or region

1815
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:06,080
of the?

1816
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:09,840
I forgot the command at the moment

1817
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:12,800
Command to remove the origins

1818
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:15,960
victim. What?

1819
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:18,320
The rules. Yeah. Okay. It's more cool.

1820
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,720
So the command is
If I am working for origin

1821
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:27,000
now it's obvious
after typing this command,

1822
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:31,960
if I do get the more bash league
it appears empty.

1823
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:36,160
It means that I have successfully deleted
the previous connection

1824
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:41,320
that was established.

1825
02:15:41,320 --> 02:15:42,120
Okay.

1826
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:48,040
And I hope that you guys
did not follow me on this.

1827
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:51,160
This is just part of knowledge
that in future you may need me

1828
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:57,240
to remove the connection.

1829
02:15:57,240 --> 02:16:03,400
So to remove

1830
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:07,760
the already established

1831
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:10,640
connection.

1832
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:11,240
Okay.

1833
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:15,520
Now, because I remove my

1834
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:18,360
connection, I need to reestablish it.

1835
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:20,200
I just use the command.

1836
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:20,440
Okay.

1837
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:21,280
By the way,

1838
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,040
in order
to move to your previous commands,

1839
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:25,760
you guys can simply use
arrow keys will take

1840
02:16:25,760 --> 02:16:28,120
you take you to the commands
that you have all these on.

1841
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:31,800
That's also one of which, like this

1842
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:35,680
use arrow keys.

1843
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:38,040
The up and down works to

1844
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:41,240
okay navigate to your previous commands.

1845
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:42,240
Okay Okay.

1846
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:45,600
Of so

1847
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:52,440
I will not be telling you anymore.

1848
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:55,160
I start this from now

1849
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:58,920
because you may probably know it.

1850
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:01,240
Yes, I'm going to do it

1851
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:03,680
all of you guys.

1852
02:17:03,680 --> 02:17:05,880
So to this point, are you guys with me?

1853
02:17:05,880 --> 02:17:11,560
Is everything up to date on your computers
and tell you proceed.

1854
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:15,320
Okay, Now let me open up the simulation

1855
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:18,520
so I'll use the command.

1856
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:21,240
Get across that hue

1857
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:29,400
origin main.

1858
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:30,960
And what is this command going to do?

1859
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:33,800
Can someone tell me

1860
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:45,840
that's going to see

1861
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:51,240
both their efforts right.

1862
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:56,240
It's going to save them.

1863
02:17:56,240 --> 02:18:00,360
It's going to copy all the commits
that are there in the local

1864
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:01,920
and put them in during launch.

1865
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:04,800
So this is what what is going to

1866
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:06,920
so all my comments are going to move

1867
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:11,200
into the more critical

1868
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:15,520
one, too.

1869
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:17,040
So we have to become a site.

1870
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:19,480
So I have moved all the speed permits

1871
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:24,200
into the room.

1872
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:25,200
Okay.

1873
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:28,800
So do you guys agree with me that this is
going to happen when I run the command?

1874
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:32,360
Get that you origin me

1875
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:34,440
Okay,

1876
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:37,440
so let's open up our terminal
and let's do that.

1877
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:39,600
Get push that you

1878
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:42,720
origin

1879
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:49,440
name. Oh,

1880
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:55,320
well, how did you need to enter

1881
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:57,760
your password over here

1882
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:03,480
And how to do that?

1883
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:06,440
Maybe after the class
I'm going to teach you because that's

1884
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:13,760
something that's going to take time.

1885
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:16,280
Okay? If I read that my page right now.

1886
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:19,840
Okay, I've got my comments over here.

1887
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:26,160
How number of comments do I see?

1888
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:31,360
I see three comments right.

1889
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:35,200
Okay, great. Now,

1890
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:37,680
this is pretty thin.

1891
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:42,600
Like we all have done this plenty of times
and we all know how it works.

1892
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:46,520
So that's should be a problem.

1893
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,920
I think this is a terminal

1894
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:16,680
public release.

1895
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:19,440
So at this point now,
I'm going to close it

1896
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:32,600
and I'll close this one to yes,
because for tender,

1897
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:38,560
what you did is that you have entered
the correct remote add or is in command.

1898
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:41,760
After that you have get branch
and dash meeting, same line.

1899
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:44,040
You need to enter them separately.

1900
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:47,960
That's a problem.

1901
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:49,680
Deleted that right.

1902
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:50,760
I show you the link to that.

1903
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:52,800
So that's that's why I did not have it
done.

1904
02:20:52,800 --> 02:21:09,920
I am the one.

1905
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:12,800
Yeah. It will affect the code.
It will affect the code,

1906
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,560
but that's fine.

1907
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:20,040
That file is basically concentration
setting of the intelligent

1908
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:21,920
and it has to be there.

1909
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:25,440
But I just deleted that to show you guys

1910
02:21:25,840 --> 02:21:28,320
the operation is that
if you can perform and

1911
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:31,720
using it, you know you do not

1912
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:34,920
actually have to be it okay in real life

1913
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:36,200
of a great

1914
02:21:36,960 --> 02:21:39,320
so let's jump to our next topic.

1915
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:41,400
Okay.

1916
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:43,960
So what is it
that that is going to be get clobbered.

1917
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:46,840
Let me open my

1918
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:49,640
notes

1919
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:53,520
this full

1920
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:58,760
now the before I jump into it.

1921
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:00,440
Are you guys done till this point,

1922
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:04,440
all of you, are you with me?

1923
02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:07,520
Okay, I now need your attention. Okay?

1924
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:10,160
This is something
that we need to understand.

1925
02:22:10,320 --> 02:22:12,080
I need your attention.

1926
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:12,680
We need go.

1927
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:14,160
What is this concept?

1928
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:16,320
And then it's going to be pretty much
easy.

1929
02:22:16,360 --> 02:22:52,960
It's very simple.

1930
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:55,840
I still give you
guys a link of prepositions.

1931
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,760
First, just

1932
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:04,160
open this up.

1933
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:07,680
Last.

1934
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:08,200
That's

1935
02:23:16,880 --> 02:23:17,160
okay.

1936
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:18,600
Now, cloning.

1937
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:25,280
What do you mean by when I say clause?

1938
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:29,400
Something, make a copy.

1939
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:30,240
Right.

1940
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:32,480
And what is going to be the difference

1941
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:36,160
between cloning and downloading the code?

1942
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:39,560
And you guys get someone telling me
that the difference

1943
02:23:39,560 --> 02:23:46,360
between the.

1944
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:49,040
Okay, it's the thing.

1945
02:23:49,040 --> 02:23:49,320
Okay.

1946
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:57,200
So have you guys ever clone
a requisite riff on guitar?

1947
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:02,520
So how do you get these chords
on a computer? It's

1948
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:12,040
E like you corporate is like
you will put up the code and copy it.

1949
02:24:12,040 --> 02:24:19,320
Yes, I call it fusion.

1950
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:19,800
Okay.

1951
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:23,120
I'm really sorry, guys.

1952
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:24,600
I'm really sorry.

1953
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:27,960
I'm serious.

1954
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:31,240
Let let me

1955
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:33,600
let me tell you,

1956
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:37,000
if I click on this, there's

1957
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,000
an option, downloads it right?

1958
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:45,640
You click on your code, there's an option,
downloads it, simply click on it,

1959
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:51,400
and it will download your code.

1960
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:51,760
Okay,

1961
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:55,880
let's open it up,

1962
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:58,040
extract that file

1963
02:24:59,640 --> 02:25:05,120
and you have it available.

1964
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:05,560
Okay.

1965
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:08,680
So, so what you need to do,
click on the scored downloads

1966
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:12,440
in the zip file

1967
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:15,560
and after that

1968
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:18,280
just extract it and you have all the codes

1969
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:25,280
available.

1970
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:27,400
This is not loading,
this is downloading the code.

1971
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:36,120
Okay, We are downloading the code.

1972
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:37,000
So So

1973
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:46,480
I don't like this separately.

1974
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:48,760
Let's select another level repository.

1975
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:50,160
Yes. Okay. I'll repeat.

1976
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:51,560
Okay, I'll repeat

1977
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:01,640
that.

1978
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:02,880
So I'm repeating this.

1979
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:03,840
Make sure that you guys

1980
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:07,600
first listen and then proceed
whenever you want to download.

1981
02:26:07,600 --> 02:26:09,480
One of the food
that is dealing with GitHub,

1982
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:12,240
you can simply click on this code,
this green button.

1983
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:15,760
And under there
there will be the option called downloads.

1984
02:26:16,200 --> 02:26:20,760
When you hit this option, it's
going to download the code in your system.

1985
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:24,240
For some of you, it may download
a zip file for either of you.

1986
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:29,000
It may download and unzip file for me
it's downloading a zip file.

1987
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:30,080
So I'll just

1988
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:33,920
see where this has been downloaded

1989
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:36,760
and all the codes are inside that.

1990
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:44,840
Any questions?

1991
02:26:44,840 --> 02:26:47,640
Download is simple, right?

1992
02:26:47,800 --> 02:26:48,520
Yeah.

1993
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:50,000
There are two.

1994
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:53,440
You can simply click on this
and download zip.

1995
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:56,240
It will download everything.
All of those that are there.

1996
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:58,960
You see
they are going to be on your system

1997
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:05,240
any questions regarding download.

1998
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:06,600
Okay, great.

1999
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:09,000
Right now

2000
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:17,600
let me also mention that I'll get

2001
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:20,440
the download

2002
02:27:21,320 --> 02:27:23,440
download the code

2003
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:28,120
that is there on the top,

2004
02:27:28,600 --> 02:27:32,080
and that's us.

2005
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:35,840
So let's be clear.

2006
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:40,320
Let's just say that
I want to work on this.

2007
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:43,760
So in basic about 11,
I want to work on this

2008
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:45,080
project

2009
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:52,160
and I also want

2010
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:56,400
all of you to work with me
on this particular project.

2011
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:59,360
So what what should
we all be doing right now?

2012
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:02,400
I also don't have it on my system.

2013
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:06,440
You also don't have it on the system
and we all want to work on.

2014
02:28:06,440 --> 02:28:12,080
So what should we do?

2015
02:28:12,080 --> 02:28:12,960
Okay, why not?

2016
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:26,040
We just downloads it.

2017
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:32,520
Okay.

2018
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:33,960
No, no, I say you are right.

2019
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:35,880
You are wrong about it.

2020
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:42,320
Now I've selected app.

2021
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:44,160
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

2022
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:46,560
Yeah, I'm just kidding.

2023
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:47,960
You can be wrong about stuff.

2024
02:28:47,960 --> 02:28:51,200
I'm not expecting you to be

2025
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:55,320
right all the time.

2026
02:28:55,320 --> 02:28:57,680
So do we have as it is in?

2027
02:28:58,360 --> 02:29:03,160
No, that's to remember that wasn't true.

2028
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:04,240
Come on.

2029
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:05,760
It wasn't color.

2030
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:14,160
That's not correct.

2031
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:26,200
Repository is really.

2032
02:29:26,200 --> 02:29:28,200
All right.
What do you have to work with this?

2033
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:30,400
Okay, Let's say this is a repository
and it got.

2034
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:34,880
It's a mic one commit
to kind of clean random

2035
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:39,320
score. See?

2036
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:44,120
Want to see three and see four.

2037
02:29:44,560 --> 02:29:45,000
Okay, guys.

2038
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
So this is important.

2039
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,360
When we do download zip,

2040
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:52,520
it's going to pick up

2041
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:56,040
this particular
see for the latest commit that is zero

2042
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:59,040
and it's going to bring it to us

2043
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:09,080
on the computer.

2044
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:09,760
Okay.

2045
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:13,000
When we do download zip
that brings the latest commit

2046
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:20,640
and it downloads it on the computer,
this is what downloads zip.

2047
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:24,520
Does this

2048
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:35,880
like when you get closed, it actually

2049
02:30:36,480 --> 02:30:39,160
downloads the whole recipe for us

2050
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:42,240
with all the previous commits data here

2051
02:30:53,360 --> 02:31:00,000
just the difference.

2052
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:02,920
I've to all of you

2053
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:04,680
what's the difference between download

2054
02:31:04,680 --> 02:31:08,880
and clone?

2055
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:11,760
Yes, we get the history with the clone.

2056
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:12,680
Okay.

2057
02:31:12,680 --> 02:31:16,720
My next question to all of you is
why is that important to clone

2058
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:19,880
when you want to work
in a project together?

2059
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:30,080
Why is it important to close?

2060
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:35,040
Never.

2061
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:39,360
The most important reason
is to have the same history.

2062
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:41,480
We should all have the same history.

2063
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:46,920
Only we will be able to push backwards
right?

2064
02:31:46,920 --> 02:31:49,200
Else it won't let us with this group.

2065
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:50,880
Does it make sense

2066
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:54,280
if we don't have the history?

2067
02:31:54,480 --> 02:32:00,200
How are we supposed
to, you know, push our records to the

2068
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:02,320
GitHub?

2069
02:32:03,360 --> 02:32:07,200
Yes, you're right about okay, so whatever.

2070
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:10,240
We are going to work on a project

2071
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:13,200
we must do for working on it, cloning,

2072
02:32:13,920 --> 02:32:16,760
I hope that is now evident to all of you.

2073
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:54,600
Any you guys can ask me?

2074
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:55,840
I'll show you the procedure.

2075
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:59,200
Don't worry about it.

2076
02:32:59,200 --> 02:32:59,720
I'll be back.

2077
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:01,720
So let's have a look at the procedure now.

2078
02:33:02,880 --> 02:33:07,320
So here's what we are going to do with
all of us are going to clone

2079
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:12,080
this particular episode on our system
and open the pool in our immortality.

2080
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:15,360
So here's what I'm going to do

2081
02:33:16,760 --> 02:33:18,000
all on my desktop.

2082
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,200
I'll create a folder, I'll name it,

2083
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:24,200
get cloning.

2084
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:27,840
I just named the School of that because
I want to make sure that it stands out.

2085
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:29,160
And I

2086
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:32,040
know that where I am cloning my project.

2087
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:37,440
Okay, so create a folder on the desktop
all you will get cloning or any means

2088
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:59,440
that you want to give it and let me know
and we'll proceed together.

2089
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:01,200
That's after that. What you need to do.

2090
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:03,840
You need to open up this folder

2091
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:10,720
and you'll open up your get back
all your terminals.

2092
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:31,480
At this point.

2093
02:34:31,480 --> 02:34:35,720
Now you guys will be using the command
get clone,

2094
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:40,080
and then you give the address
of the repository which you want to clone.

2095
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:42,080
So this is the address I'll copy it

2096
02:34:43,160 --> 02:34:46,080
simply busy doing here

2097
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:47,720
that will show me a message

2098
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:50,880
cloning in to setting in but this exact 11

2099
02:34:51,800 --> 02:34:54,280
you know my internet is maybe slow
I don't know.

2100
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:58,120
Yeah so it will take some time
and after that it's going to

2101
02:34:58,120 --> 02:35:07,320
be done. So

2102
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:11,880
I want it on the desktop.

2103
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:15,680
You can go anywhere you want to.

2104
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,840
I created a folder on my desktop

2105
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:21,080
with it cloning
and then I cloned it inside that.

2106
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:23,800
I will put up my password there
and then I'm going to do

2107
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:30,240
let me know once again
all of you have cloned

2108
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:59,160
and then we'll discuss
some things about it.

2109
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:04,200
Okay.

2110
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:09,000
Now I want to open up
this project in integrity.

2111
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:14,560
And also I want to have a look
at the repository that I just clone.

2112
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:16,680
I want to have a look at that.

2113
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:19,080
I want to have a look
at the number of items that are do.

2114
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:22,080
So first of all, I'll do pwt.

2115
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:24,800
It shows me right now I'm in get cloning.

2116
02:36:25,880 --> 02:36:30,840
So this is the cloning right now.

2117
02:36:32,320 --> 02:36:33,360
If I open this

2118
02:36:33,360 --> 02:36:38,160
cloning, there is another folder inside
that.

2119
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:42,600
So basic batch 11,
I want to go into this folder.

2120
02:36:42,760 --> 02:36:50,960
How can I do that?

2121
02:36:50,960 --> 02:36:54,320
Maybe so.

2122
02:36:54,440 --> 02:36:56,960
Even basic back to that right

2123
02:36:57,040 --> 02:37:01,760
now, I'm in this particular folder right?

2124
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:04,040
I have navigated this folder.

2125
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:05,480
Okay.

2126
02:37:05,480 --> 02:37:09,720
So on my Explorer,
also I have navigated to this folder.

2127
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:12,120
What do I see in here? I see. I've got it.

2128
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:15,360
I see a dot idea, I see driver

2129
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:18,600
notes out screen screenshot,
SIRC and everything else.

2130
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:22,640
I see it over here.

2131
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:26,120
I said, What do you want to do with step?

2132
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:27,360
If you

2133
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:32,800
from get off the

2134
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:34,440
you want me to repeat

2135
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:41,720
after me?

2136
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:42,600
My folder is empty.

2137
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:47,760
Did you know how you must not have code

2138
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:52,480
correctly?

2139
02:37:52,480 --> 02:37:57,400
You need to have name.

2140
02:37:57,400 --> 02:37:58,800
Okay. Yes. I'll repeat

2141
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:14,840
that.

2142
02:38:14,840 --> 02:38:19,040
Mainly because we know that
you have not flown to the right solution.

2143
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:20,040
You have.

2144
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:22,640
You need to see that you go

2145
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:28,080
to the replication.

2146
02:38:28,080 --> 02:38:29,720
Okay, guys, I'm going to read.

2147
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:31,560
Please follow me.

2148
02:38:31,560 --> 02:38:35,000
So this is my for the right
click closed and over

2149
02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:37,560
I opened up my

2150
02:38:38,600 --> 02:38:42,720
I will not make a mess and I use
the command get flow on and the address.

2151
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:50,640
I'm going to enter that name.

2152
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:54,240
I'm going to read this right.

2153
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:57,400
I use this command to get cloned

2154
02:38:57,400 --> 02:39:01,680
and then I use the address
and it cloned everything, right?

2155
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:04,040
This is what I did.

2156
02:39:04,040 --> 02:39:06,120
So this one,
any questions that you may have

2157
02:39:09,480 --> 02:39:10,320
noticed?

2158
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:12,960
Okay, great.

2159
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:16,080
Now what I want to do, I want to

2160
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:20,640
in this folder, I all the important files,
which I want to open up.

2161
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:25,120
So I want my terminal to navigate
inside the school there.

2162
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:25,800
Is that a heart?

2163
02:39:25,800 --> 02:39:27,520
Just this.

2164
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:29,800
Is that something hard to do?

2165
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:34,440
We get inside the folder, right?

2166
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:36,880
So see me solving here.

2167
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:38,640
Let's examine it.

2168
02:39:38,640 --> 02:39:40,640
And I'm inside it. Now

2169
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:43,680
I'm going to

2170
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:47,920
clear my pencils.

2171
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:59,880
Do I need to create a repository
at this point?

2172
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:03,160
I already have it. Right.

2173
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:05,320
Good status.

2174
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:09,920
Nothing to update, get lost.

2175
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:10,800
All the commits.

2176
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:12,600
I see this

2177
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:13,720
new virus.

2178
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:15,480
You pass this, this and this.

2179
02:40:15,480 --> 02:40:19,320
Everything is there.

2180
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:28,320
These are the previous commits
that are here.

2181
02:40:28,320 --> 02:40:31,760
Okay, So

2182
02:40:35,240 --> 02:40:37,080
at this point

2183
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:42,480
I have successfully cloned
the whole recipe.

2184
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:44,960
I want to work on the project.

2185
02:40:44,960 --> 02:40:46,400
So what I'll do,

2186
02:40:46,720 --> 02:40:49,920
I simply open this project in my activity.

2187
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:59,240
So I would say open up the intelligent.

2188
02:40:59,240 --> 02:41:03,160
It's already open file. Open

2189
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:07,920
Now after opening, click on Open,

2190
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:13,080
I'll navigate to the location
where I have cloned my project.

2191
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:15,920
So That location is

2192
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:18,440
for me.

2193
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:21,840
It's my desktop.

2194
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:24,240
On my desktop I see get cloned

2195
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:26,280
and over there I

2196
02:41:26,280 --> 02:41:31,600
see selenium based it back
out of click on it and I click on key.

2197
02:41:32,840 --> 02:41:36,600
This will open up the project
inside my intelligent.

2198
02:41:37,960 --> 02:41:40,680
All the classes are there

2199
02:41:40,920 --> 02:41:43,880
and all the screenshots, everything

2200
02:41:44,360 --> 02:42:05,760
how it's opened up in the ecology.

2201
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:07,880
Okay, so you need to click on file.

2202
02:42:08,960 --> 02:42:11,280
Then you go to open

2203
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:12,200
from over there.

2204
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:16,560
You need navigate to the location where
you downloaded or cloned your project.

2205
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:20,560
For me, it's desktop
and then something in basic Mac 11.

2206
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:23,640
I'll click on that. Simply press.

2207
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:29,160
Okay and select New window and it will
open the whole project for me in the IEEE.

2208
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:38,520
That's how you do.

2209
02:42:38,520 --> 02:42:45,040
Yes. There your that is my terminal.

2210
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:50,320
Just the status then with love,
is there nothing else?

2211
02:42:50,320 --> 02:42:52,640
Okay, guys, are you able to do this?

2212
02:42:52,640 --> 02:42:53,640
All of you?

2213
02:42:53,640 --> 02:43:03,320
Have you done it?

2214
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:04,000
Okay, great.

2215
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:09,120
So. So now

2216
02:43:09,240 --> 02:43:13,120
the scenario is this that
this is the repository on the Internet

2217
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:19,040
and I just clone it on my own system,
right?

2218
02:43:19,720 --> 02:43:55,200
I made a copy of it on my system.

2219
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:55,840
Okay.

2220
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:59,840
So now if I want to work on this project,
what I can simply do is

2221
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:05,320
I can open up this project
and I can simply create a new class.

2222
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:09,840
I'll create a new package, let's name it,

2223
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:11,960
get classes

2224
02:44:11,960 --> 02:44:15,480
and add inside this spectacular new class.

2225
02:44:16,400 --> 02:44:17,720
I limit

2226
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:23,880
testing, clone.

2227
02:44:23,880 --> 02:44:26,400
Okay, so what I did, I simply

2228
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:30,920
created a new package and a new class.

2229
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:33,960
This is something that I believe
that you guys can do quickly.

2230
02:44:33,960 --> 02:44:38,880
So just create a new class
and they're just a package in a class

2231
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:42,240
and let me know what steps done.

2232
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:44,480
Yeah, you are beginning in your class.

2233
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:52,000
You have to add them matter.

2234
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,480
Okay now let's say system

2235
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:57,840
that out not just

2236
02:44:59,440 --> 02:45:00,840
print out

2237
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:10,840
anything.

2238
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:12,960
Okay, that's it.

2239
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:17,000
These are the changes that I made
and I want to make a comment on my report.

2240
02:45:17,240 --> 02:45:19,480
Oh, we are focusing on coding right now.

2241
02:45:19,480 --> 02:45:22,400
Okay, guys,
we just focus on how we have words.

2242
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:23,880
That's feedback.

2243
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:25,920
So we want to make a comment.

2244
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:29,080
How how are we going to do that?

2245
02:45:29,080 --> 02:45:32,040
Get at DOT right

2246
02:45:32,040 --> 02:45:34,560
get commit dash

2247
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:40,960
am my get comment.

2248
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:43,800
Certainly
I need some changes in the project.

2249
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:46,720
I made a new comment that says

2250
02:45:49,360 --> 02:45:51,920
if I show you in the repository

2251
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:54,200
right
now, there is going to be a new comment

2252
02:45:55,920 --> 02:45:57,960
system and blue color

2253
02:46:02,760 --> 02:46:05,400
and it's going to say

2254
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:07,440
the message

2255
02:46:08,520 --> 02:46:11,560
which our output is.

2256
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,200
Okay, so this one,

2257
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:23,320
any questions that we have?

2258
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:25,520
I'm just showing you how to clone.

2259
02:46:25,880 --> 02:46:28,040
And after learning how to simply

2260
02:46:29,680 --> 02:46:30,680
start working on the

2261
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:35,200
project, that's it.

2262
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:36,760
Nothing else.

2263
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:39,880
I just talked to you guys
how to clone and start working on it.

2264
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:44,440
How did you first clone projects

2265
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:47,960
now? So

2266
02:46:48,320 --> 02:46:51,000
we haven't got any clone projects
right now

2267
02:46:55,400 --> 02:46:59,160
since it was in terminal

2268
02:47:00,720 --> 02:47:02,000
there. I have pushed.

2269
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:02,680
I don't know what.

2270
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:06,960
I haven't pushed anything.

2271
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:09,160
You mean how I closed the project?

2272
02:47:09,160 --> 02:47:13,200
You want to know that?

2273
02:47:13,200 --> 02:47:15,240
How I closed the project?

2274
02:47:15,240 --> 02:47:20,400
Are you talking about that?

2275
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:21,320
Okay, so now.

2276
02:47:21,320 --> 02:47:24,480
Well, let's put that question for now

2277
02:47:25,480 --> 02:47:27,240
unanswered after the class, okay?

2278
02:47:27,240 --> 02:47:30,600
Because we got little time in the class
and that's how we got to that.

2279
02:47:31,320 --> 02:47:33,720
So you guys some I'm asking all of you

2280
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:36,680
to this point
and the questions that we have,

2281
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:40,960
what we doing, what we have done
that, you know, so that I can make it

2282
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:47,600
clear for all of you
and then you can proceed for the process.

2283
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:48,720
So now I'm coming to that

2284
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,480
because I haven't reversed

2285
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:14,640
you haven't reversed turn down
your question before I traversed below.

2286
02:48:14,640 --> 02:48:19,880
Then I guess one.

2287
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:20,360
Okay, guys.

2288
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:24,120
So we just learned how to clone
and then start working on our project.

2289
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:25,720
Simple.

2290
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:27,240
Nothing complicated in that.

2291
02:48:27,240 --> 02:48:31,080
Now the real part where the problem
is, okay,

2292
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:35,320
so this is my working directory

2293
02:48:35,320 --> 02:48:38,520
and this is my docket folder.

2294
02:48:39,480 --> 02:48:43,200
And here my project files are

2295
02:48:49,440 --> 02:48:51,000
this is the repository

2296
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:57,160
on GitHub, right?

2297
02:48:58,080 --> 02:49:01,240
So this is the remote

2298
02:49:01,240 --> 02:49:04,560
repository on GitHub,
which we have closed, right.

2299
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:07,200
This, this and this too.

2300
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:10,680
But I want to do this one.

2301
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:11,320
Okay.

2302
02:49:11,320 --> 02:49:15,600
Now does this repository
has this particular commit

2303
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:18,840
the new one that I just created
and you also created?

2304
02:49:18,840 --> 02:49:21,000
Does it have this particular commit?

2305
02:49:21,360 --> 02:49:25,760
No, it does not have it right.

2306
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:27,360
So what should we do?

2307
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:32,760
So they push it.

2308
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:34,920
Okay, so let's open up our terminal

2309
02:49:36,320 --> 02:49:36,960
right now.

2310
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:38,920
I don't want you guys to do anything,
okay?

2311
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:41,080
Only I'll it not you.

2312
02:49:41,080 --> 02:49:41,920
Let's

2313
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:48,240
get push.

2314
02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:51,360
Okay. The statistics commit.

2315
02:49:51,360 --> 02:49:57,560
Now let me see this Is there?

2316
02:49:57,560 --> 02:50:01,200
Yeah, there are 30

2317
02:50:03,440 --> 02:50:05,280
and then it's updated.

2318
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:05,600
Right.

2319
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:07,360
It says that 4 minutes.

2320
02:50:07,360 --> 02:50:10,840
So this one is what I did.

2321
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:11,560
Great.

2322
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:13,440
Now I want you guys to.

2323
02:50:13,440 --> 02:50:14,720
To push

2324
02:50:19,080 --> 02:50:34,120
this.

2325
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:37,320
Okay? Yeah.

2326
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:41,040
You guys will be having a permission
problem, and you will be tonight.

2327
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:45,560
Not much. Yes.

2328
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:50,520
You won't be able to push in there.

2329
02:50:50,520 --> 02:51:00,160
That's how you stop the bad guys
from coming into your apple.

2330
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:04,840
So I'm able to push
because that's my own reference.

2331
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:06,480
I it.

2332
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:09,960
No, it's not about this.

2333
02:51:09,960 --> 02:51:11,600
It's not about the space.

2334
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:14,400
It's not about the history. It's
because I want this for Apple

2335
02:51:15,440 --> 02:51:16,640
and I

2336
02:51:16,640 --> 02:51:20,360
kind of push do it, you guys,
you do not own it.

2337
02:51:20,960 --> 02:51:23,560
You just clone it
and you are trying to push it, pushing it,

2338
02:51:24,520 --> 02:51:28,440
It it will not allow you to do that
because that will be the scenario

2339
02:51:28,480 --> 02:51:30,480
everyone is going to push
in each of the rep.

2340
02:51:30,480 --> 02:51:33,520
One is going to be a lot of mess, right?

2341
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:39,120
So how do we deal with this
when we are working on a project

2342
02:51:40,040 --> 02:51:44,840
in order to make you guys work
on the same project in GitHub?

2343
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:48,760
I invite you guys to work on my repository

2344
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:51,960
as a collaborator.

2345
02:51:51,960 --> 02:51:55,080
Okay, first
I give you the access to my repository,

2346
02:51:55,480 --> 02:51:58,240
then I invite you to work
as a collaborator

2347
02:51:58,560 --> 02:52:01,320
in which I give you the permission
that you can push.

2348
02:52:01,800 --> 02:52:06,000
But before I give you the permission, it's
very important that I do kick

2349
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:09,200
you and make you learn that where
to push and when to push,

2350
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:12,520
because that's
what I'm going to do with this name.

2351
02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:14,680
You are going to know.

2352
02:52:14,680 --> 02:52:16,320
So that's why I'll give you the access.

2353
02:52:16,320 --> 02:52:19,440
But after our second or third class.

2354
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:21,440
But not right now.

2355
02:52:21,440 --> 02:52:25,080
Okay, Now, now we are done with this.

2356
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:30,840
But we are done with
we are left with only one concept.

2357
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:34,120
What is that?

2358
02:52:34,120 --> 02:52:39,280
Let's discuss this quickly and get well

2359
02:52:39,280 --> 02:52:50,360
and get fetch.

2360
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:51,320
Okay.

2361
02:52:52,280 --> 02:52:52,920
This.

2362
02:52:52,920 --> 02:52:56,280
So get cool and get fetch.

2363
02:52:56,280 --> 02:53:00,160
What do they do?

2364
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:03,280
Get fetch is the command

2365
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:07,800
which will tell you

2366
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:16,240
the status of your remote trap.

2367
02:53:16,240 --> 02:53:22,920
Is there any update
that needs to be downloaded?

2368
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:30,240
So when I want,
you will run the command, get fetch.

2369
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:34,000
So it's going to tell you whether

2370
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:38,760
there is anything in the remote output
that you should update.

2371
02:53:38,760 --> 02:53:41,280
Yes or no. So at this point

2372
02:53:43,880 --> 02:53:45,840
I have synchronized it

2373
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:50,280
so my local end more are synchronized,
but I got a local under mode support.

2374
02:53:50,320 --> 02:53:53,440
Synchronize.

2375
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:56,720
So I want you, all of you
to run the command,

2376
02:53:57,440 --> 02:54:00,640
get fat and tell me what's the output

2377
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:04,600
for? Me Because everything is up to the

2378
02:54:08,360 --> 02:54:09,040
use the command

2379
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:12,240
Good fetch and tell me that
what is there that

2380
02:54:13,320 --> 02:54:17,360
you guys see?

2381
02:54:17,360 --> 02:54:18,120
Yeah.

2382
02:54:18,120 --> 02:54:22,400
So over here it shows you
that you need to update your origin.

2383
02:54:22,400 --> 02:54:24,440
Mean this particular branch.

2384
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:26,480
You need to this branch.

2385
02:54:26,480 --> 02:54:27,680
What is branch outlet.

2386
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:31,360
You know so quickly
I'll make some changes in GitHub.

2387
02:54:31,360 --> 02:54:34,320
I don't want you to see that
because it's just like

2388
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:38,440
I'm adding a new commit on the guitar,
not local,

2389
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:57,000
so that we can be on the same page.

2390
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Okay,
so now my remote is also not synchronized.

2391
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:04,560
My remote is one commit further,
I did something.

2392
02:55:04,560 --> 02:55:07,720
I have made it
with the same scenario as you guys.

2393
02:55:08,160 --> 02:55:14,520
So if I do get fetch,
I see that there is something that

2394
02:55:14,520 --> 02:55:24,360
needs to be updated right. So

2395
02:55:29,080 --> 02:55:29,720
nothing wrong.

2396
02:55:29,720 --> 02:55:30,720
You are doing nothing wrong.

2397
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:32,640
You just need to escape this.

2398
02:55:32,640 --> 02:55:35,080
You need to press column Q

2399
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:42,160
while when loading a file to your desktop,

2400
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:46,920
you also linked to the live report.

2401
02:55:46,920 --> 02:55:50,200
You use the link off
the online network to clone

2402
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:53,040
your project on your desktop.

2403
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:59,840
That's how you do it.

2404
02:55:59,840 --> 02:56:03,120
Okay, guys, let's let's get back to this,
all of you.

2405
02:56:03,440 --> 02:56:07,520
So get fetch is just going to look at this
and tell us

2406
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:10,760
if there is any

2407
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:14,520
updates on the echo or not.

2408
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:14,760
Okay.

2409
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:17,280
Mohammed,
we are pushing without providing the URL

2410
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:21,400
because then included
the URL was already embedded in there.

2411
02:56:21,400 --> 02:56:26,880
We do not need to establish the connection
once we have got it.

2412
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:38,720
The URL to that
proposal is already embedded.

2413
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:40,200
Yes, exactly. If you check

2414
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:42,400
all of here, I want

2415
02:56:42,400 --> 02:56:45,600
you to run the command,
give you more destiny.

2416
02:56:45,600 --> 02:56:46,480
What do you see?

2417
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:58,560
You will see my oracle connected.

2418
02:56:58,560 --> 02:57:01,800
Yes. That's the reason
you are all connected to my laptop.

2419
02:57:02,520 --> 02:57:04,600
So if you want to.

2420
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:06,000
Yeah.

2421
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:10,240
If you want to create your order up one,
send it to your own repository.

2422
02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:15,880
You can simply move this link, place
your will address and upload it to GitHub.

2423
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:17,680
That will work to

2424
02:57:20,760 --> 02:57:22,800
know how you need to rescue

2425
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:27,000
Q, Press Q and let you continue.

2426
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:33,120
Okay guys, to this point, I'm all good.

2427
02:57:33,120 --> 02:57:34,680
The rest of you.

2428
02:57:34,680 --> 02:57:35,840
All good.

2429
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:39,320
Okay, so get set out.

2430
02:57:39,320 --> 02:57:41,440
I was expecting you guys. Good. Fetch.

2431
02:57:41,440 --> 02:57:42,960
So what does good fest do?

2432
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:48,080
It Just go to your GitHub,
the repository you upload, it looks at it

2433
02:57:48,440 --> 02:57:51,760
and it tells you that hey there is
something that needs to be updated.

2434
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:52,280
That's it.

2435
02:57:52,280 --> 02:57:54,480
It just gives you the message.

2436
02:57:54,480 --> 02:57:56,320
There is something to be updated.

2437
02:57:56,320 --> 02:58:05,280
So you guys also get the same message
right, which I am getting.

2438
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:09,960
It means that there is something in this
particular box that needs to be updated.

2439
02:58:09,960 --> 02:58:14,240
So if I want to have that update
on my computer, on my system,

2440
02:58:14,880 --> 02:58:19,560
I'll use get pull.

2441
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:22,000
Now it's going to download that.

2442
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,320
A lot of this command.

2443
02:58:23,320 --> 02:58:27,840
Tell me if you guys see this particular
that's been going on, not

2444
02:58:29,720 --> 02:58:31,520
which I created

2445
02:58:46,400 --> 02:58:47,080
the command

2446
02:58:47,080 --> 02:58:56,640
vehicle.

2447
02:58:56,640 --> 02:58:57,280
Okay.

2448
02:58:57,720 --> 02:59:02,440
That's it's there.

2449
02:59:02,440 --> 02:59:03,640
That's fine.

2450
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:06,120
Mohammad Mohamud you

2451
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:11,520
okay?

2452
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:15,000
We just need to add something
and just press.

2453
02:59:15,560 --> 02:59:17,960
You know, this.

2454
02:59:17,960 --> 02:59:18,480
Okay, I'll.

2455
02:59:18,480 --> 02:59:21,760
I'll have a bit of a break thing. The

2456
02:59:26,640 --> 02:59:27,680
very good.

2457
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:28,080
Yeah.

2458
02:59:28,080 --> 02:59:28,760
Okay, fine.

2459
02:59:28,760 --> 02:59:32,160
Prod is also getting that.

2460
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:34,640
Now let's discuss the outlet.

2461
02:59:35,360 --> 02:59:36,840
Yeah, I just need 2 minutes.

2462
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:39,240
I'll feel that,
you guys. I'll just be explaining you.

2463
02:59:39,240 --> 02:59:40,240
Why is that happening?

2464
02:59:40,240 --> 02:59:42,960
And then we will be
discussing the solution tomorrow.

2465
02:59:42,960 --> 02:59:44,600
Okay, Is. That's fine.

2466
02:59:44,600 --> 02:59:46,560
We'll discuss the solution tomorrow.

2467
02:59:46,560 --> 02:59:47,160
But just.

2468
02:59:47,160 --> 02:59:49,440
I'll tell you why this error is there.
All of you.

2469
02:59:49,440 --> 02:59:54,280
I want to listen at this.

2470
02:59:54,280 --> 02:59:56,960
Those of you who are having the error.

2471
02:59:56,960 --> 02:59:59,160
Very good. You guys did the right job.

2472
02:59:59,280 --> 03:00:02,120
Those of you who are not having that,
you guys did the wrong job.

2473
03:00:03,440 --> 03:00:04,280
Okay.

2474
03:00:04,320 --> 03:00:07,560
So let me tell you why.

2475
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:11,440
So right now
you have a permit in your right

2476
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:14,720
with the same file

2477
03:00:14,720 --> 03:00:17,480
as the one that is on the GitHub.

2478
03:00:17,640 --> 03:00:19,200
The name is

2479
03:00:22,640 --> 03:00:24,400
Get Glass testing.

2480
03:00:24,400 --> 03:00:26,640
What do you guys have
the same name as mine.

2481
03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:28,080
The permit that you had.

2482
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:31,600
Do you have the same one?

2483
03:00:31,600 --> 03:00:33,360
You have a different one.

2484
03:00:33,360 --> 03:00:35,640
Now, for those of you
having the error, I'm

2485
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:37,360
talking about you that

2486
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:47,040
okay, so you are having the same someone.

2487
03:00:47,160 --> 03:00:49,200
Someone is having different. That's fine.

2488
03:00:49,560 --> 03:00:51,120
But why the errors?

2489
03:00:51,120 --> 03:00:54,160
We need to understand this is important.

2490
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:57,360
Okay, so

2491
03:00:57,360 --> 03:00:59,760
I'll have to drive for you like this.

2492
03:01:01,360 --> 03:01:03,160
And so that is going to take some time.

2493
03:01:03,160 --> 03:01:05,920
Let's to our tests.

2494
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:09,200
It's actually happening
because the history is now conflicting.

2495
03:01:10,440 --> 03:01:12,000
The history is actually conflicting.

2496
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:15,360
Just giving you a that's
why it's happening.

2497
03:01:15,760 --> 03:01:17,760
So we will discuss this in depth.

2498
03:01:18,640 --> 03:01:21,600
And tomorrow you have more

2499
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:24,960
seriously my in this kind of point.

2500
03:01:24,960 --> 03:01:28,480
No, that's not a cover of Excel.

2501
03:01:28,560 --> 03:01:31,280
Let me just end our session before that.

2502
03:01:31,280 --> 03:01:34,240
I just want to make sure thing

2503
03:01:34,240 --> 03:01:37,320
to this point
you guys understand everything, right?

2504
03:01:38,560 --> 03:01:41,440
And we are only left with
on this particular agenda.

2505
03:01:41,480 --> 03:01:47,400
First of all, we have got it right.

2506
03:01:47,400 --> 03:01:48,320
Great.

2507
03:01:48,720 --> 03:01:52,520

03:01:56,040 --> 03:01:59,400
the start of this cloning.

2510
03:01:59,400 --> 03:02:02,760
And, you know, the error
that we're getting

2511
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:05,400

2512
03:02:05,400 --> 03:02:08,320
