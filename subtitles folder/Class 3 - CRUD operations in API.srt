1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,240
Right before anyone began.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,560
We tried to look for children.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,960
Okay, know what

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,880
I'm to

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,280
then is ready.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:46,440
But I knew what?

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,560
No, I know. I'm in a good mood today.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,560
I just came from a function, so I'm.

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm in a very good mood. Don't watch.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,640
We don't need injury.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:08,240
I was the mother, right?

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
And they'd

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,960
on the behalf of Ukraine and pressure
conflict.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,680
I am. Yes.

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,720
That's like good witness.

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,920
Ready now in the class?

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,600
No issues, Alexi, you're not late knowing

18
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,760
you look.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
But that's not the case.

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,080
I had a training in the morning.

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,760
I didn't say should in afternoon.

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,600
Then I laid out for some party function.

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
I have to leave someone.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,760
So I went there
and I just came in ready for new station.

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,880
No, no, no, no.

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,240
All right,

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,080
let's start.

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,720
All right, guys, tell me,
what was the topic?

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,640
What was the first topic in the class
to two recovered

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,680
in EPA

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,720
students

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,440
to to get for the last class

33
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,960
clients about architecture.

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,800
All right.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,440
Well, that's
I think we caught in first class.

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,080
Yes. Cutting

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,200
is one a service services

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,400
anyways.

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:50,800
What is lip service this EPA is the EPA.

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,480
They all state that over the Internet,

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,000
over the substance.

42
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,520
They bills are posted over the Internet.

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,120
Web services.

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,880
Fine.

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,240
What type of how many types of services

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,920
the do?

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,640
What are the names of them?

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,960
The first one is so

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,960
and the second is the.

50
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,120
And we are going to work with

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,360
we are going to work with

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,480
not only list

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,080
supports, how many languages,
what are the names of those languages

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,880
is so

55
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
simple.

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,000
Next DML except

57
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,520
on this language is correct.

58
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
Why? It's called restful.

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,520
I need to talk to developer representation

60
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,400
and state translate
by the point name like this.

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Why that is a name Gina or testimonies.

62
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,800
What is what is the reason behind this?

63
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,560
Why we call this framework?

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,520
But what is the reason behind this

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
notice and state?

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,080
If I end up on that,
I can give any name right?

67
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,120
Got it. Now see why.

68
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,200
Looking at the answers.

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,440
Right? Whatever the questions I'm asking.

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,880
RESTful, RESTful.

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,080
Great. And restful.

72
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,480
That same thing. Don't worry.

73
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,120
So. Yep, definitely.

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,080
Definitely.

75
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,680
This is the name of my generator.

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,440
And this. So

77
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,080
now when I see here, whenever

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,200
I ask questions,
you are able to recall all those quotes.

79
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,200
It means your understanding right?

80
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,320
It means you understood the topic in
the last class, even in the review class.

81
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,920
Also you've got the points, then split up
and I'm asking

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,600
within a fraction of a moment.

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
I see you guys are responding
to my answers.

84
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,920
That's correct.

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,880
No. Who says

86
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,120
that you do a review of a class
and you forget?

87
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,040
See, this is the example, guys,

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,120
is just Do you mind that you're forgetting
the things you're not?

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,400
Actually. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

90
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,680
You're not.

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,520
You are.

92
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,080
You're able to remember the things

93
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,280
guys, and trying to just,
you know, increase your confidence.

94
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,760
You all have these things memory
or what's difficult

95
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,000
in a Jedi in reality, it's
not that difficult.

96
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,920
You guys are doing this.

97
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,560
You guys are recording
one of these things.

98
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,040
You guys are dealing with these things,
right?

99
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,480
And it's a very good part.

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,040
Just review your credential.

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,760
You have a lot more than you anticipated.

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,440
All right, fine.

103
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,760
All right.

104
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,560
Just full a base.

105
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,840
We are working with big.

106
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,760
Does this rest in based on required

107
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,720
Lisbon to meet, to transfer their data

108
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,560
and supports multiple languages such as?

109
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,160
Such as statistics
such as just on such achievement, etc..

110
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,120
Getting

111
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,960
no when we talk

112
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,080
about so in this table
is that the whole state over

113
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,360
the internet rate
they can host it over the internet.

114
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,800
Thank you very much.

115
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Now on the Internet,
I give you one example.

116
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,360
If you live in a country,
you have to follow all the rules

117
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,560
and the condition
of the particular country.

118
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,680
If you want to make this,

119
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,400
if you're opening an organization
in any country,

120
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,440
you have to follow all the rules
of the conditions of this country.

121
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,920
To run Europeanization,

122
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,960
you have to pay the taxes and everything
according to the rules of that country.

123
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,840
Similarly, if you want to communicate
with any of the member state,

124
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,920
with any of the server
which is available on the eight,

125
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,360
and then you have to follow the rules
and the conditions

126
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,480
to fight over the Internet.

127
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,240
So what are those rules and regulations?

128
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,640
What are those
protocols? What we call that protocol

129
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,560
age. The the

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
be Hypertext transfer protocol.

131
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,400
This Hypertext Transfer protocol
enable us to communicate

132
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,360
with multiple websites,
with multiple servers, to communicate

133
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,480
with them
over the Hypertext Transfer protocol.

134
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,600
Fine.

135
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,920
So when we talk about hypertext transfer
protocol

136
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,040
here,
we have to understand a couple of things.

137
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,520
What are the functions?
What are the methods?

138
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,960
This is strictly because
and how we can use all of those functions,

139
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,880
how we can use all of those methods
in our API request rate.

140
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,640
By far in these two classes
in the beginning of the third class,

141
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,320
everyone know what is behind,
what is server, what we call request,

142
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,400
what we call response
getting what is web service?

143
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,160
What are the types of web service?

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,960
What is so what is the rest of the scene
and list interest?

145
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,360
How many languages it is to support
what is just on,

146
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,760
what is accessible,
what is based, what is HTML?

147
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,400
What is.

148
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,600
So every single thing we know,
we know what HTP is,

149
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,560
but trade hypertext transfer protocol.

150
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,080
Now what all are
the methods in hypertext transfer protocol

151
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,000
so we can perform current operations?

152
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,880
What kind of operations they perform
here, Create operations, right.

153
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,800
So when we talk about current operations,
what does it mean those

154
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,880
create

155
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,000
a degree of date or delay in simple thing,
which if I see in simple language,

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,440
if I see to add a record in their
database, is nothing but create operation

157
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,520
to get existing record from

158
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,240
the database
is nothing but a retrieval operation.

159
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,960
Update
an existing record in their database.

160
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,160
We call it update Operation What it means
editing the existing record and to delete

161
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,760
existing record in their database
record embedded operation.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,600
This is what we call operations
Internet protocol that is interesting,

163
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,680
that allows us to perform
all these functions using its own methods.

164
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,120
Using its own functions. Fine.

165
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,880
So now, in order to use its own functions,
in order to use its own methods,

166
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,280
the very first thing we need is bees.

167
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,880
You are by bees,
you are a uniform resource.

168
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,800
Identify it.

169
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,960
We need to use this.

170
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,200
You don't realize how we can make this.

171
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,080
You are right.

172
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,160
What are the things
we need to make the bees?

173
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,720
You want to.

174
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,120
But I'm reading this.

175
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,200
You are a nurse, the education

176
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
nurse

177
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,760
and now

178
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,640
when we talk about this, you want to know
what does it mean?

179
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
What is base you are in?

180
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,520
Base,

181
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,240
right?

182
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,880
Address

183
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,120
of this of.

184
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,760
And then if we talk about API location,
it means so

185
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,800
the existence of API

186
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:11,520
inside this.

187
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,200
And then if you talk about endpoint,
it simply means

188
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,000
that we are going to

189
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:43,400
analyze. Now

190
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,400
after making this base, you are right,

191
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,480
we have this,
you are an API location plus endpoint.

192
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,520
Is this enough?

193
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,080
Is this enough?

194
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,080
This is not enough
because you just found the address.

195
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,040
This is the complete address, right?

196
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,240
This is complete interest.

197
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,280
Let me write like this your point.

198
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,400
Not actually method point.

199
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,640
Now, now, now another thing.

200
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,040
If if

201
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,360
I am going
to add something in the database

202
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,800
or I'm going to retrieve
some information from the database

203
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,480
or I'm going to delete some information
from the database,

204
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,880
or I'm going to edit some information
in the database,

205
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,640
depending on the operation, I will decide
what all are the other credentials,

206
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,600
what all the other components
I need to make a request.

207
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,240
Because right now,
if I'm planning to make a request,

208
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,600
I need to have all of this information.

209
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,400
Right? Because you are.

210
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,040
I is just a license
to enter into the import right now. See?

211
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,840
No, see what we have to do here.

212
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,120
So first what we did was

213
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,800
to create an

214
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,360
import, right? We

215
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,840
what kind of employs this case?

216
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,200
Yes, this is me.

217
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,160
Why we continue

218
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:30,600
doing this.

219
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,800
And what is the reason behind
is that first we created.

220
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,080
Yes. Well, the reason behind

221
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,680
creating the element, employing list is

222
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,480
if we do not have an element embroiled in
who is going to perform

223
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,560
other operations, who's going to provide

224
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,560
and manage the existence of other entries
are the registered users.

225
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,360
State admin
is going to provide all these things.

226
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,680
So whenever we create any system,
whenever we create any application

227
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,120
in that application,
the first ever use that we create

228
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,600
is the admin search,
who is having all the credentials,

229
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,920
who can play in the application
and all the possible forms

230
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,920
industry

231
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,160
names.

232
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,600
So look here, the employing simply means
if we talk about yes,

233
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,480
if we talk about current operation,
this is the created one, right?

234
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,480
So to create something, to add something,

235
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,880
to add a new record in the database,
we need first base.

236
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,440
You want to

237
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,840
We need first base.

238
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,920
You are right.

239
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,360
Then what is the second thing we need?

240
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,160
We need a load

241
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,320
payload, right?

242
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,920
Yeah.

243
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,520
When I say Nas would be this.

244
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,160
You are right, it simply means this.

245
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,480
You are in this API location.

246
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,360
Let's import. Right?

247
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,320
We need a payload recall.

248
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,360
This payload is body.

249
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,160
Body.

250
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,840
So David is in which language
we provide words

251
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,280
we are using, which language

252
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,040
we use,

253
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,400
JSON language,

254
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,840
a wide array of what

255
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,720
we use, just a language

256
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,480
to write a body cutting

257
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,120
file.

258
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,800
Now now when I have this, you are
I guess is one week,

259
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,080
not a language JavaScript object notation.

260
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,600
Right. You can call.

261
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
This is a language

262
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,000
and or not answered in long time.

263
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,560
It's been three months assurance.

264
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,480
So even a single word
plus the existence. Yes, she is

265
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,600
nice.

266
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh. Chicago, Illinois.

267
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,920
Trade and relationship
and university of Illinois.

268
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,560
It's bad.

269
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,600
And if I'm not wrong,

270
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,280
nice couple of restaurants
have setting their science

271
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:27,720
promotion.

272
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,200
Nice it's a good idea was actually

273
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,320
nice is to study

274
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,600
one of my studies
now he is going to Newcastle

275
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,080
and two of my spirits
are going to Liverpool and most to be

276
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,880
are going to Manchester
this year, September.

277
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,520
So they would be joining, I think,

278
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,200
I think a foreign country,
they would be joining Formula One,

279
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,480
but I wouldn't be going there
for their internship.

280
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,840
I'm just imagining Right.

281
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,440
How much experience they will get
by working with this one chance

282
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,400
like I know

283
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,160
this Newcastle University is a good one,
Liverpool, Istanbul, just to Istanbul,

284
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,200
but obviously on weekends they can go
going, What's the matter, Right.

285
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,840
Maybe in Manchester or Liverpool. Yes.

286
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,680
Yes. Getting

287
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,120
or did it was
it is like in 17th century 16th century.

288
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,400
Great Manchester is
I think 500 year onwards

289
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,480
any one city. Okay

290
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,640
nice enough.

291
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,600
Fine after bailout after bailout

292
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,440
after bitter.

293
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
What is the next ten days?

294
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:55,720
What are the things we need not to be?

295
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,240
We need to

296
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,360
wait.

297
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,840
We need to have this right now.

298
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,200
After Haider,
my request would be probably really great.

299
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,280
My request really, I think

300
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,160
or not?

301
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,880
No, no. What?

302
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:21,840
What is the next thing we need?

303
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,400
Keep content papers, Header of content.

304
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,880
I wasn't.

305
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,320
If this is already held up, we have to

306
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,080
continue.

307
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,120
We don't need it. Correct.

308
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,160
We already done with this matter.

309
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,120
We have to select.

310
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,160
So now here I break my method.

311
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,880
What would we? My mother.

312
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,800
That would be my post

313
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,560
right

314
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,320
before save me before sending anything.

315
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,760
We need to understand one thing.

316
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,480
What is we need to understand.

317
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,080
We need to understand that.

318
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,800
What are the responses I need to consider?

319
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,120
I should know what response is correct
and what response is not correct.

320
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,480
I should know, right?

321
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,400
What kind of warning I'm going to get

322
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,760
or even whether I'm going
to get anybody in the response or not.

323
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,920
Every single information we must know.

324
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,200
That's why we have the very
first thing is API status.

325
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
Could it be a status quo?

326
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,720
Right?

327
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,280
What is the 1001?

328
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,200
What is portable?

329
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,040
04014024034044202 every single code.

330
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,560
Right.

331
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,000
I would request you to read
like all the cities,

332
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,600
but having the knowledge of 400
to desert one is an important

333
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,040
thing to understand. This

334
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,200
interview
with is that he might ask you for 303.

335
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,640
Sometimes,
but it is just to check your knowledge.

336
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,040
It has nothing to do.

337
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,800
But when you do just
that, it's not a big deal.

338
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,680
It is just for pipeline status, remember?

339
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
So you can do it at any point of time.

340
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,880
In just four 5 minutes you'll be able
to read all of these things.

341
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:14,400
Findings.

342
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,200
Now let's start

343
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,160
removing slides.

344
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,200
Apes, take a squad. Yes, Yes.

345
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:37,320
You will be having this enslaves us.

346
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,960
Fine.

347
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,360
So now they see what is postman.

348
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,160
Basically, when we're using the postman,
what mostly does

349
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,920
postman basically allows us, right?

350
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,840
It allows us

351
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,120
to connect

352
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,240
connect with the end point

353
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,720
rate in Postman what we are doing,
we are connecting with the end point

354
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,240
and then we are performing
any single operation rate,

355
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,960
every single operation
we're performing from here.

356
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,400
So Postman is
just doing what Postman does,

357
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,360
what most

358
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,320
readers deliver your message,
deliver your card or something.

359
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,280
Deliver to a card.

360
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,120
Somebody write it, connected
with their database.

361
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,640
Write whatever the message you do
to the postman.

362
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,800
Postman Give that message, right?

363
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,320
Take a sign back and then come back again
with the response.

364
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,000
This is what post Windows,
That's the name.

365
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,520
Really ready
to liberate the name of the postman. See

366
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,840
if you compare this name
with the computer.

367
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,600
No comparison and

368
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,960
may not even be

369
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,960
like it When you are writing
some English language in your calling.

370
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,720
It could do amazing Einstein level
thinking no next play

371
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:08,320
point. No.

372
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,800
No. See, one more thing is

373
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,280
when we are talking about APIs trade,

374
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,560
when we're talking about APIs,
we have two types of IPA.

375
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,040
If you get the two branches
that even if it's branches two,

376
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,600
then why

377
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,120
not coriander?

378
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,520
If you've got a spinach,
it has branches too.

379
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,920
Then broccoli would be the best example.

380
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,960
Lot of branches.

381
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,680
Cauliflower is the best example,
not of branches.

382
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,440
Then why only get your.

383
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:47,680
Yeah.

384
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,440
If it is distended then it should be lemon
all round 316.

385
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,680
No. And I think that is a starting point.

386
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,480
It is, I think. Why no one knows

387
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,040
right, that this distant this lemon

388
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,440
getting in a type
as big as a vegetable market fine

389
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,920
so now

390
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,360
now we have an API, right?

391
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,880
We have APIs, two types of API,
the right liquidity,

392
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,680
two types of the first is

393
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,800
public appearance

394
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,440
and the second one is

395
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,520
I repeat,

396
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,720
the first one is public API
and the second one is private.

397
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,280
Okay.

398
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:51,880
Can you give me the example of public API?

399
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,960
My okay,

400
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,680
libraries, public.

401
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:07,040
How many of you guys are using Google now?

402
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:18,160
How much money you pay for that?

403
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,960
You're not paying even a single penny
for using your maps.

404
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,760
Google Maps, you're paying this
for your Internet connection rate.

405
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,320
So these are two different things, right?

406
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,720
Cutting through it.

407
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,720
So you're not paying any money
to Google Maps right now.

408
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,120
Tell me, is it accessible to some of you
or all of you?

409
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,400
Google Maps

410
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,760
accessible to.

411
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,320
All right, all of you

412
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,400
know, in Google Maps.

413
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,360
In Google Maps,
you see only your device, current location

414
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,960
or you see, okay,
your friend is coming from that point.

415
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,640
So you can see that
current location is the same thing.

416
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,520
And one goodness,

417
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,160
people are going into the open road
and you see all of their characters

418
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,400
know only,

419
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,680
only if that student only if that thing
which shared his nice condition,

420
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,120
they don't need to do

421
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,000
with breaking.

422
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,280
No, no, no, no,

423
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,760
no. It's a flat because

424
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,400
there is a match going on. Right?

425
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,600
So one beam is one the match.

426
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,920
So there's not stupid search celebrating.

427
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,920
I would say

428
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,360
I don't know
whether you heard about it or not,

429
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,440
but someone said right, that they did
some planning for the regions.

430
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,200
At the same time
someone is planning for the empire.

431
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:03,720
They are stupid.

432
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,160
Yeah.

433
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,160
Their search match is going on
and they guys are celebrating.

434
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,720
They didn't even play,
but still they're celebrating.

435
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,640
See, there's the height of stupidity

436
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,800
if you ask them what they're going to do
on Monday morning, 8 a.m.

437
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,280
they know that they're not having any on.

438
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:25,640
Some people with no region
living here, it's conditional.

439
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,120
It's for fun. No, ma'am.

440
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,920
There's for when they're like not for fun.

441
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,480
This is not fun.

442
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,120
If you double others, this is not fun.

443
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,280
Smart people don't come on road.

444
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,400
They don't want to
and celebrate for nothing.

445
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,840
This is just a league
match of one small city.

446
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,480
It's the same
what you can do in Italy, correct?

447
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,160
I know, I know. Stupid
does that every year.

448
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,480
I'm not saying stupid
is that in India only they

449
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,800
people like this that everywhere exist.

450
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,040
Humans are humans.

451
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,840
It doesn't matter which part of the one
you're going to put on risk point.

452
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,920
This right.

453
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,320
And they're sort eager to ruin their life.

454
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,680
Did you try to stop them then?

455
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,560
We agree on you are living on them.

456
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,640
Okay, Go ahead. Live your life.

457
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,920
Not actually living your life.

458
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:33,360
You're actually ruining your good.

459
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,600
Nice.

460
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,040
It's been it's

461
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,640
funny.

462
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,640
So now now you'll see.

463
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,840
The first one is,

464
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,600
is this firecrackers?

465
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,800
And it is firecrackers.

466
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:54,240
Guns has nothing to do with firecrackers.

467
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,320
No alcohol.

468
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,120
I am.

469
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,320
How many of you guys are using DoorDash
GrubHub

470
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,200
at this food delivery app?

471
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,480
But when you do that, everyone right now.

472
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,200
Now, the guy.

473
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,240
Them and the guy
who is delivering your food

474
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,960
who is underway,
can you see his location of what?

475
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,160
Can you see his location using Google map

476
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,880
you have to use which map?

477
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,920
The map which is available in the menu.

478
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,680
Correct.

479
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,040
And if you be if you play, then only

480
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,240
you get to the exits opened, Right.

481
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
It So that is your private API.

482
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,800
You need to first log in
to your zomato account.

483
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,080
You need to show that okay,
you are registered user

484
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,480
or a guest user on an existing user.

485
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,480
Correct?

486
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Yes. Correct. Same it all, but it's also.

487
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,560
But it's GrubHub DoorDash ability.

488
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,400
Correct.

489
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,480
So you use this type of features
and see map is available here.

490
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,240
Also Google Maps is available in Zomato,
also in GrubHub, also in DoorDash.

491
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,560
But the difference, can you see it
one time to show your identity?

492
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,600
What is that, a district mobile number?

493
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,560
You get one OTP, you have to redefine your
or you did your password

494
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,640
with the application.

495
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,120
Then only
you will be able to use that account.

496
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,080
However, on the other side,
you don't have to provide any information

497
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,520
or authentication point of your right.

498
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,720
It is not indication cutting.

499
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,000
So this is public API
that is primarily EPA.

500
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,440
These are two different things,
but same concept of API.

501
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,200
Understood.

502
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,640
No, no.

503
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,840
When we talk about security in the API,
we need to understand.

504
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,800
We need to understand
how API is keeps security

505
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,400
and how API keeps security.

506
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,240
So there is a cycle of

507
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,160
authentication and authorization

508
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,840
authentication and authorization based.

509
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,320
Sometimes you provide a username
and password, correct?

510
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,040
Correct.

511
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,000
How many of you guys know this thing
takes each item application?

512
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,400
This one issue,

513
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,680
This application everyone knows

514
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,080
if you log in to this particular
application as an admin user,

515
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,720
you will see different Facebook page
with different options.

516
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,760
But if you log in to this application
with a normal user, you will see

517
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,040
different beach,
you will see different dashboard options,

518
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,680
correct?

519
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,200
Is indicates.

520
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,680
How is it possible that this same system

521
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,160
is providing you two different dashboard
for two different logins?

522
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:32,520
How is it possible?

523
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,880
This is the logic of the API trade.

524
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,520
So here here API should not read,

525
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,520
API should know that
if a log in is the normal user,

526
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,560
I should not provide the access
of administrative.

527
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,040
Did not indicate the admin.

528
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,440
I should not provide that dashboard
of a normal user.

529
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,720
Correct there.

530
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,800
So API keeps security so the correct
accesses will be given to connect people.

531
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,840
Right.

532
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,760
And there is the process
called authentication

533
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,720
and authorization authentication
authorized.

534
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,680
Right.

535
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,840
So now here
let me draw one page to show you

536
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,640
what is authentication

537
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,680
and composition point.

538
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,360
So this is the part one,

539
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:48,880
this is the part one.

540
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,840
So here I'm going to read

541
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,880
authentication

542
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,000
second

543
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,200
authorization, right?

544
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,960
And now, now here, see,
I'm going to do one example.

545
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,480
So here I'm going to write in order to

546
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,680
in order to write

547
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,840
post on Facebook,
in order to post something on Facebook

548
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,320
and to see the content
and to see the content.

549
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:27,960
Right.

550
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,320
The first thing what we have to do is

551
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,560
in order to post something on Facebook

552
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,240
or to see the content of the Facebook

553
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,480
post, we have to exactly.

554
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
Not so now.

555
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,320
Now you see here, right here
is the first cycle.

556
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,400
The fourth to cycle, we call it

557
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,720
authentication.

558
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,880
Find the one last
one will be your be correct

559
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,200
correct authentication.

560
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,800
Now, what I what it does
authentication does means it

561
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,640
confirms

562
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,240
it confirms your identity

563
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,680
based, it

564
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,200
confirms your identity and

565
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,920
permit you

566
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,920
to access the system.

567
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,560
But I'm with you to access
this is to trade.

568
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,440
For example. Okay.

569
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,640
What is your name?

570
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,320
I shall industry in the region. Nice.

571
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,880
What is your password?

572
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,600
I am a genius.

573
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,320
So both your credentials not correct.

574
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,920
Please log in.

575
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,760
Please come and access your system Right
Like this.

576
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,200
Connect the moment you provide your
username and password, your email I.D.

577
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
and password.

578
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,360
It permits you to access the system.

579
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,120
Right?

580
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,080
So it is confirming your identity.

581
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,760
It is confirming your identity.

582
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,440
Getting my point.

583
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,600
When I see

584
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,680
confirmation of identity
and accessing the information.

585
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,200
Right.

586
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,560
Giving you the access to the information

587
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,960
it sees authentication process,

588
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,680
authentication clearance, student

589
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,840
Yeah, I changed a couple of things.

590
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,600
You know, in a Facebook profile

591
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,000
that is this Firebase

592
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,080
authentication part is done on

593
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,400
now after authentication

594
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,400
the another part the another on left

595
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,120
or on left,

596
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,880
what is online?

597
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,400
This is part one.

598
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:33,640
This is part one.

599
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,280
Fine.

600
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,120
So now here here there is a part two,
There is a part two.

601
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,600
We call it

602
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,440
authorization, right?

603
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,440
So part two is your authorization.

604
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,040
Now, what we do in the authorization, this

605
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,320
authorization always controls it controls

606
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,800
whether whether you are

607
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,800
allowed

608
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,680
to perform

609
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,280
certain

610
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,760
operations or not

611
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,760
to perform certain operations.

612
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,800
But all right.

613
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,120
Now, see,
when we talk about authentication

614
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,280
simply means or to go provide
username password will check

615
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,200
whether you are a part of the system
or not.

616
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,920
Yes, you're a part of the system.

617
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,320
Okay.

618
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,160
We'll give you the log in, will give
the permission to access the system.

619
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,600
Authorization says no forced.

620
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,880
I will check even
you are in the system now.

621
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,560
Let me check
how much things accessible to you,

622
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,760
how many things
you can access to the system,

623
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,240
what kind operations
you can perform into the system,

624
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,000
and then give you the system
access accordingly.

625
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,080
Correct?

626
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,960
Current.

627
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,640
So it's once you enter into the system
as a normal user, right?

628
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,840
As a normal user, that's what I'm saying.

629
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,600
If you enters into the system
as a normal user,

630
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,040
you can do whatever you want to do
with your own account.

631
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,800
You can't do anything else.

632
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,520
But if you log into the system as an admin
user, you can delete any other user,

633
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,560
you can block any of that account,
you can do any of the things.

634
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,600
Right now you see sometimes

635
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,320
celebrities post that, Hey, my, my,
this Twitter account is

636
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,680
blocked,
Twitter has blocked my account out.

637
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Twitter is doing this

638
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,600
is Twitter asking their password log in
and then not yet.

639
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,320
No they have an element of admin
you know accesses.

640
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,360
Right. They own their Twitter.

641
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,240
So what they generally do log in
where to me

642
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,360
or does users in database go there Jake.

643
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,920
Okay.
This user blocking blocked his account

644
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,240
right?

645
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,760
That's correct.

646
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,600
So it's all about authentication
and authorization

647
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,600
accesses should be given to correct

648
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,800
or I would say always did that to Trump.

649
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Here we also have one, you know, same

650
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,840
kind of personality in India,
not one activity of many.

651
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,200
If you have 3.3, I think 33 million,

652
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,520
330 million people in us.

653
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,040
Right.

654
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,960
And you have this much of you
in big pieces.

655
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,200
We are a population of 1.5 billion.

656
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,000
Consider how many big
we have here in India,

657
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,920
closer to 400 million.

658
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,880
Yes, there.

659
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,840
Have you ever been hundred million?

660
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,480
Right.

661
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,600
So in 400 million, if you have not a thing
decreases in 1500 million.

662
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,720
Just imagine.

663
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,120
Well, I'm not the country, to be honest.

664
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,960
I'm telling you, it's a lot. I'm not a big

665
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,680
and I never take credit

666
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,760
of this.

667
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,440
Right.

668
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,640
So even in that 1.5 billion is still
my contribution is zero.

669
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,720
Don't worry.

670
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,760
I got to neither for

671
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:36,280
global warming, right?

672
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,880
Lugar directly
blame me for the population of India.

673
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,280
I never appreciate anyone.

674
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,920
I never think I know
I'm a motivational speaker.

675
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,480
I never motivated,
inspire, encourage people

676
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,680
to increase the population of India.

677
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,160
I don't do it. Do it.

678
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,440
This is not my time to encourage people
to stay

679
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,920
1.5 billion.

680
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,160
I'm not doing it

681
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,640
right.

682
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,680
Well, this is something new
to look at my every year to think of.

683
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Great, let's motivate people.

684
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,840
Ask them to charge for this class. This

685
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,600
time is going to be a mess for that

686
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,760
they have to be six
one like me and Chinese are always three.

687
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,400
To do it is because it's

688
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,200
correct.

689
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,280
Cutting.

690
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,240
Correct. All right.

691
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,520
Now, when we talk about authentication

692
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,920
and authorization rate, the

693
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,880
motorman

694
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,960
and the BRI, the beehive is a unique one.

695
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,240
We can't show this to any other country.

696
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,360
And this is a unique read.

697
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,480
Once you get it to India, you'll see

698
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,040
out of the box

699
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,280
they out of the SometimesI
when I get shot,

700
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,440
this type of brutal behavior like this.

701
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,840
So this is the world of security, right?

702
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,480
This is the world of security.

703
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,840
Now, here.

704
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,520
Here they always ask for questions

705
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,760
in authentication and authorization
to understand it more clearly.

706
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,120
We should focus.

707
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,960
We should focus on four questions. Right?

708
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,360
If you understand four questions,
if you understand these four questions,

709
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,240
the concept of authentication
authorization becomes crystal

710
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,400
clear from the Philippines. Okay.

711
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,320
So let me give you
one of those four questions.

712
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,520
First is,

713
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,200
who are you?

714
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,040
Who are you? So again, it's

715
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,160
odd. Are you

716
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,040
allowed to access the system multiple

717
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,520
parties

718
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,120
show your eye.

719
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,640
And the fourth is

720
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,200
what excites you

721
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,880
in simple language.

722
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,440
If you ask me to collect these four points

723
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,840
to make a right of this complete
information,

724
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,680
right then you collect the all information
in easy language.

725
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,400
Is this four questions?

726
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,640
These four questions ask Why are you

727
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,000
are you allowed to show your I.D.,
what kind of access you have?

728
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Just understand this question.

729
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,760
And this is all about authentication
and authorization process.

730
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,160
This is all about authentication,
this authorization process,

731
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:04,880
industrial based, this .11 guy,

732
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,680
the speaker has been just one hour.

733
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,440
What happened?

734
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,520
I hope I hope you guys are not
you know, I'm

735
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,520
not blaming your energy
for the first two question.

736
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,080
The last two will be joined by.

737
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,320
Correct? Correct.

738
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,120
And that's why I gave
you just four questions.

739
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,240
Right?

740
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,080
Just four questions.

741
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,600
Fine.

742
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,440
So if you understand this work,
which is you guys learning

743
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,000
all this bookish definition, right.

744
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,160
Well, this is to help us
in the limited edition part one.

745
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:47,240
So so here, right here.

746
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,040
Every time,

747
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,840
given the Google definition of bookish
definition is not the best answer,

748
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,280
the best idea.

749
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,280
Instead, if you explain the things
in your own right,

750
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,280
but your own means
conveying the same message

751
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,520
to the original message,
that is the best part of the

752
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,920
It shows that you understood the concept

753
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,720
and now you put it in your framework
and you're spinning in your own words.

754
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,440
Nothing could be better than this.

755
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,600
This is the original version
of your explanation, right?

756
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,280
If you understand this book once,

757
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,600
why you are you allowed show your writing
what access you have and use it.

758
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,760
This is all about authentication
authorization.

759
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,720
Believe me, your interviewer will never
ask a mixed question on this part

760
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:39,280
right? I

761
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,640
let's proceed for this.

762
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,200
So now we are going to talk about security

763
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,480
because we are going to talk about this
security place,

764
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:03,280
not the public space,
not the public one, but the secured one.

765
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,440
So here, here, let me give some examples,
not some examples.

766
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,240
Basically, we talk about the applications

767
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,800
of security, secure
application type of security application.

768
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,520
So the one first one, I'm calling it as

769
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,840
stateful application,

770
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,720
what I call in case

771
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,120
genuine up

772
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:42,880
bank application is a really pretty much,
you know, low level example.

773
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm giving
you was kind of an information, right?

774
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,800
And then I think you know level knowledge
fine stateful application

775
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,640
not what does this stateful application
guys let me then you this

776
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,000
let me give you an example.

777
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,680
How many of you guys are

778
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:06,560
using Amazon in this book?

779
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,480
So if you log into your Amazon
or if you log into a Facebook right

780
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,280
after they ask you for one thing,
what is that?

781
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:22,720
Hey, do you want to see your credentials?

782
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,000
Remember me?

783
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,520
Seems later,
something like this, they ask you

784
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,120
and if you save your information,

785
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,880
if you save your information next time,
next time when you try to log in,

786
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,080
when they ask you for again,
log in password or they just simply

787
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,480
allows you to log into your homepage

788
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,160
that allow you right

789
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,400
to log in to your homepage, click

790
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,800
simply.

791
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,960
And now it will be captured in the fine.

792
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,240
Now, just keep this one
point in your mind.

793
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,440
Just to keep this one point in your mind,
because now all the information

794
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,320
I'm going to explain from here
on how these things work.

795
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,200
Right. And what are the things missing?

796
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,960
Because there are a lot of different
information available in this concept,

797
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,040
which I'm going to open in the next 5
minutes on a very interesting topic, guys.

798
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,120
I'm expanding
the entire IED free will be crystal

799
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,800
clear to you
if you understand all of this information,

800
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,520
which I'm going to extend into this class
and the models.

801
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,240
Plus, believe me, your perception
when looking at the things that making

802
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,240
us free will change.

803
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,200
If you understand this point. See

804
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,760
see, what they generally do is,
for example,

805
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,400
lipstick and knock, for instance.

806
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:50,240
Right?

807
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,560
You're not doing this right.

808
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,680
She is trying to exist.

809
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:01,400
She is trying to exist
to her Facebook account.

810
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,840
To her Facebook account.

811
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,520
Right.

812
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,360
And to violence and occupy in this age.

813
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,040
Why is it so what she does,

814
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,360
she provides that you are in there,
that you are it on that you want it.

815
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,000
She provides her

816
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,200
all right.

817
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,840
He provides username and he provides
password.

818
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,960
Who said she had been saying
he all the times?

819
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,680
Also, she guys please take care of this

820
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,480
brokenness.

821
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,160
She is a

822
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,000
light coming in.

823
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,960
Right?

824
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,520
So not a not great username and password.

825
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,840
He has a new account.

826
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,160
He provides username password.

827
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,840
Now now here.

828
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,160
This is the server.

829
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,160
This is the server under local events
server or browser server.

830
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,160
Right.

831
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,680
This server.

832
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,440
This server has one memory

833
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,400
for this server.

834
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,640
Has this one has one memory.

835
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,280
We cannot remember the guys,
what we call it one

836
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,840
colleague server memory.

837
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,080
Okay, so now what happens?

838
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,800
What happens?

839
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:36,960
And here, here we had a database.

840
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,520
Right here. We have a database?

841
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,120
No, not a repository.

842
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,920
You can see one database
in normal language, right?

843
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,640
So data is stored here.

844
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,080
Something like this Data is stored.

845
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,160
You know what is happening?

846
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,160
First time
when Hanako tries to log, right?

847
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,520
He enters username and password

848
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,880
after entering username
and password into the server

849
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,520
server first goes to database.

850
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:06,800
Okay.

851
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,440
See if you enter a username and password
which is incorrect.

852
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,600
Server never asked your browser
never asked you to store this right.

853
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,760
Only in the successful operation.

854
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,880
When you provide
valid username and password, it asks

855
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,520
you to observe it.

856
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,560
Try to log in to your system
with incorrect username and password.

857
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,120
You didn't never ask you
to save your password, but I was.

858
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,000
That is smarter than you.

859
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,720
Great.

860
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,840
So first, what does it goes to database.

861
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,600
It goes to database and takes it database.

862
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,120
Do you have this particular user,

863
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,080
this particular user
with this username and password databases?

864
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,520
Yes, I do have find it returns.

865
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,440
It returns one section 80 What?

866
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,840
It returns one

867
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,320
session.

868
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,400
A session

869
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,880
we call this session in our language is

870
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:06,840
an admission

871
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,040
granted rate databases yes databases. Yes.

872
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,200
This use existing me right

873
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,040
allow him
allow him to access the application.

874
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,200
Find know what is so what he does,
what somebody does.

875
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,160
So what?

876
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,680
Ask to see your username and password
and it says yes we identify it.

877
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,320
You're a part of this system
and to give you warnings is this

878
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:34,120
you just do one thing you just save
your username and password here.

879
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,200
Would you like to save
that username and password?

880
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,440
What do you do?

881
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,720
You ask me to remember
your username and password.

882
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,000
If you click on the number of the option,
the moment you click your

883
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,120
you remember the option exceeds
your username and password,

884
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,040
which is already is ten,
which is already established.

885
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,880
The communication
link with their database.

886
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,480
So this connection is always there.

887
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,600
Next time when you open directly,
you go here

888
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,000
and you connect to the server web server.

889
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,120
It connects you with a database.

890
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,640
That's why it never,
ever asked you to enter your username

891
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,600
and password once again,
if you already saved it in your browser

892
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:14,920
in this room.

893
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,960
This topic so far.

894
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:17,920
So far.

895
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,840
Just two days later.

896
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,520
Now let's go a process now let's go

897
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,520
a step further. See

898
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:37,080
when it provides,

899
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,800
when not provide right here
this username and password.

900
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,160
Right there is a server

901
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,640
that is our database, right?

902
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,240
That is a database or month loan.

903
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,600
But she looks good.

904
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,400
He looks good actually.

905
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,600
See, it looks good now

906
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:14,960
they got to

907
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,000
I just went into it.

908
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,040
You see

909
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,520
now now see what is happening.

910
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,360
This is server.

911
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,080
Now tell me

912
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,200
their database looks like a gate.

913
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,600
Let's make it a proper database
before you it.

914
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,080
I think now.

915
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,840
Now see

916
00:54:45,400 --> 00:55:03,080
just a moment based.

917
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,360
Yeah, maybe so. Now now,
tell me one thing.

918
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,960
If you talk about Facebook
application, right?

919
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,720
If you talk about Facebook application,

920
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,920
how many users you think Facebook has,

921
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,560
how many users,

922
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,040
millions of users, billions of users,

923
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,480
how many is

924
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,960
Facebook has be a thing
that one server is able to handle

925
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,360
all of these things, every single thing,
just one server, low rate,

926
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,600
multiple servers are available.

927
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,840
Multiple servers.

928
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,320
Now see what is happening.

929
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,400
This is your server too.

930
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,440
This is your server.

931
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,960
One stone, one free.

932
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,520
So what happens?

933
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,320
What happens if that is?

934
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,360
A lot of node is increasing on

935
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,360
one particular server,
one particular server.

936
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,640
Your request has been transferred
to another server

937
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,800
by event functionality,
not actual functionality.

938
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,320
We call it

939
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,240
node balancers.

940
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,640
We put load balancers
which are responsible to divert the load,

941
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,400
to distribute the load
among all the servers equally

942
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,920
so that one server
would not take all the load.

943
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:25,880
Right?

944
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,560
So the load would redistribute
to all the servers.

945
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,440
If load increases, industrial discipline

946
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:35,720
servers from this point.

947
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,080
So now see, every server has

948
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,200
every server installed would have been

949
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,120
my full time

950
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,760
when you logged in your connection
established via server one.

951
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:51,880
Correct.

952
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,920
For example,
your connection established was one one.

953
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,480
So your credentials were stored
in just one sort of one.

954
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,160
Or in all these servers.

955
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,680
How it works, Just one sort of one.

956
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,600
In this one, particularly right now,

957
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,520
sometimes you might have observed I'm
not sure where they all do it or not,

958
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,440
even if you stole your information,
even if you saved your information.

959
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:16,720
Right.

960
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,320
In this case, you couldn't
normally get in this terrible memory.

961
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,720
Sometimes maybe once in a blue moon
or maybe sometimes, like very often,

962
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,080
it again
asked you to provide your username

963
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,920
and password.

964
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,120
Sometimes it happens on raw

965
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,360
and then you must be thinking, Well,
I already saved this credentials.

966
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:40,400
It must here in my credentials of
in this sort of amendment

967
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,160
and in white is asking
because the first time

968
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,360
when you log into the system
your server one your server

969
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,960
one was there and you created the link
with the server one.

970
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,640
Now no,
because in this system load increases

971
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,520
and because of the increment in the node,
what is happening this time?

972
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,760
Load balancer has diverted your request
to server three.

973
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,080
Now Salvatore doesn't have your logging
credentials, right?

974
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,600
So here here
if you go away a different set of one.

975
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,920
So this server again
goes to database database

976
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,320
and it does different station ID
and after returning different station I.D.

977
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,200
first, when you enter your username
disturbance says, Hey, I do take

978
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:24,920
your information

979
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,080
provided we get information.

980
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,840
When you provide that information, it goes
here to database, connect with them.

981
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,480
Right.

982
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,000
Take the security now.

983
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,440
Saved your credentials here

984
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,120
and then allows you to log in
so this time again

985
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,080
in the time your connection is available

986
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,480
with the server three,
you will be able to log,

987
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,880
you'll be able to log in and this would

988
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,520
industrial part.

989
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,080
That's how that is how your things work in
is stateful application

990
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,720
because this sort of a memory,
that's sort of what everybody would be

991
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:08,280
having this server in the state of this
memory is the state to do through.

992
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,560
And because the speed of this server
memory is safe to do

993
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,920
recall it state

994
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,840
full is big, full

995
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,680
stateful application, right.

996
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,600
We call it stateful application
industrial disparities.

997
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,520
That state is set to true.

998
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,680
That's why we call it is full application

999
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:37,960
guys.

1000
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,080
Any question so far?

1001
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:54,320
Any question?

1002
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,520
Yes, yes, yes.

1003
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,480
So now now I'm
going to touch on another important point.

1004
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,520
I'm going to touch
another important point.

1005
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,040
Okay.

1006
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,920
See, we on this type of application,

1007
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,720
stateful application on less security.

1008
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,240
Guys, just a moment.

1009
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:41,760
Just a moment based,
can you tell what this to to. Yes.

1010
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,560
So this set a lot of memory you see right.

1011
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,040
This that a lot of memory.

1012
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,440
What we are talking about here.

1013
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,120
Right. This server memory.

1014
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:56,200
So when the state of this server
memory is a state to do,

1015
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,360
it means this is state of the server
memory is set to true, simply meaning

1016
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,200
it is eligible,
it is enabled to store your information.

1017
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,200
Right.

1018
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:10,360
So when you make
this server is a state, true,

1019
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,560
then we call it is stateful application
in hundred percent of time.

1020
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,320
Obviously, if you're providing the server
memory, you have to keep the state of

1021
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,720
this memory is true then only
it will be able to store your information

1022
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,800
correct that it didn't need to be able
to store your information.

1023
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,680
So we call it
set amount of memory is set to true

1024
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:33,480
and when it will be specific to true
because it is dead full application.

1025
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:37,680
Now the point is
this stateful application,

1026
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:41,440
this particular stateful
application is less secure.

1027
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,560
Can somebody
guess what is the reason behind this

1028
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,040
why this type
of application is less secure

1029
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,480
then somebody gets?

1030
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,120
What is the reason?
What could be the reason?

1031
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:00,480
What would be the reason behind this?

1032
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,520
Any idea that it is public? No,
not normal.

1033
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:09,600
The API is not public.

1034
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,920
API is not public.

1035
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,960
It on the API is the private one.

1036
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,480
That's why it is asking you.

1037
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,520
That is why it is asking you
to provide your user admin password.

1038
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,000
Now see the reason behind this?

1039
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,680
How many server we have?

1040
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,080
How many?

1041
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:30,200
Some would be like people server state yet
I'm just giving you four server.

1042
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,040
We have multiple server.

1043
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,840
Correct now in every single server.

1044
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,080
Right. Or in many servers.

1045
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,680
In many servers. Right.

1046
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,680
Your information is already stored in many
what your information is stored

1047
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,560
getting current.

1048
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,760
So isn't it that hackers are getting more

1049
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:55,400
and more places, more
and more to like to have your information

1050
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:00,960
right?

1051
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,640
They are having more accessible
information in multiple servers.

1052
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,360
So now they're don't need to click
and they don't need to access

1053
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,400
this database to get information.

1054
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,600
What they simply do is
they will hack any of the server,

1055
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,160
any of the server,
which is not then because great,

1056
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,040
they will hit any of the server

1057
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,880
if the phone information of
any of the user, they will simply take it

1058
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,160
and they will use it for their own
purpose.

1059
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:26,920
Right?

1060
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,560
Right.

1061
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,840
Which is similar to the user cutting.

1062
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,120
So now what will happen tomorrow?

1063
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,240
Maybe you hackers
hacked the information of the normal rate

1064
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,120
and the post Twitter account.

1065
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,320
The post went well.

1066
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:43,480
You know, they provide one post with
a counter that says I will rule the world

1067
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,640
and another day.

1068
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:50,280
And so just woke up and she said a lot
your comments are coming that okay,

1069
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,920
we know we know one day you will
and you might be thinking why?

1070
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:56,440
Why they're saying.

1071
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,160
And then when she checked for in my post,
someone posted this then she posted

1072
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,240
someone egged my account.

1073
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,960
Maybe so there is no better
not taking the account

1074
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,200
they generally randomly get in
political hacking.

1075
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,040
Definitely you shouldn't online. It's
not that difficult.

1076
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:29,800
The ethical thinking is okay.

1077
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:35,480
You know I mean to the point also, I did
several classes over and I ever said this.

1078
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:39,200
Then the class is over.

1079
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,120
And look

1080
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,960
no right in all your classes

1081
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,240
and sending creepy
and then asked this question

1082
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,720
and I think

1083
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,480
I don't think so now

1084
01:04:54,600 --> 01:05:00,120
now this stateful application
and as to why this is less secure,

1085
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,200
I already gave you this part on story,
why this is less secured,

1086
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,080
less secured information

1087
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,640
because of a lot of servers
available somehow.

1088
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,680
Now, fine. Now, point let's move.

1089
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,040
Let's move
on to the next type of application.

1090
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,440
We call it.

1091
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,920
We call it is

1092
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,120
list application.

1093
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,560
But what about today's

1094
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,960
is Stateless application.

1095
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:30,720
Okay.

1096
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,560
Before looking

1097
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,640
guys, the concept of load

1098
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:45,360
balancer is clear.

1099
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,880
I like what

1100
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,080
you're doing is you're then it's
but that is work

1101
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,760
that is headed by database database
under the symbol approach.

1102
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:01,320
Okay so now not when it comes to stateless

1103
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,400
application how things work
in this stateless application.

1104
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:04,800
Right.

1105
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,520
It's what goes on.

1106
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,320
This part.

1107
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,880
So here, here, let's see this time.

1108
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,920
This time,
because it is already using the baseball.

1109
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,200
Great.

1110
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,880
So he must be busy with browsing
that information.

1111
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:30,120
So here, let's take another
example, Miriam.

1112
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:30,400
Right,

1113
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,320
Right.

1114
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,560
So now what he does,

1115
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,480
what he is basically.

1116
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:44,040
Okay,
so now here, see Miriam is trying to log

1117
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:49,720
into the information, provides
user name, username and password

1118
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,120
and to create she is a user,

1119
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,920
she is a user
in, let's say a Wells Fargo Bank.

1120
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:58,160
Right?

1121
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,920
She has an account in Wells
Fargo Bank, Right.

1122
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,720
So when she has to go in Wells Fargo Bank

1123
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,440
now see again, so

1124
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,080
will we use against that do here

1125
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,160
what But this time

1126
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,080
but this time just just give me a moment

1127
01:07:16,080 --> 01:08:00,120
This just came here.

1128
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,720
I was about to take in.

1129
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,480
It's about to I was almost on the verge

1130
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:10,440
to call you.

1131
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,520
Fine. So now, see, here.

1132
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:17,040
Here in this type of application,
when use this stateless application.

1133
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:22,200
Remember in this stateless application,
right in this is stateless application.

1134
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,200
We do not have many

1135
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,200
to log in to log in here.

1136
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:29,600
Right.

1137
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,840
I don't have any server memory,
but still I have their database

1138
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,840
or I have I have their database.

1139
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,600
Correct.

1140
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:43,080
So now how things work this time
when Miriam provides

1141
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:47,720
a user name and password to the server
server, connects with their database,

1142
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,720
takes the identity, who are you,
what kind of access you have?

1143
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:54,360
Sure your ID got the permission, right?

1144
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,600
Grant the permission? No.

1145
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:59,400
After granting the permission
from the database,

1146
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:04,120
what this person is doing because server
is not going to provide any station I.D.

1147
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,480
so somebody is not going to ask
to save your username and password.

1148
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,600
If you observe
only this type of application.

1149
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,800
Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, they ask you
to provide this option, right?

1150
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,440
Save your password,
remember me or something like that.

1151
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,280
However, on the other end,
if you talk about any banking application,

1152
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,280
right, if you're using native banking,

1153
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:27,160
they never asked you to provide
your username and password to say,

1154
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,280
Is there anyone who has

1155
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:33,120
got this type of information

1156
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,080
used to remember

1157
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,120
your native banking applications?

1158
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,800
Wait then never asked you to say
that username and password. Why?

1159
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,440
Because they're connected to the server.

1160
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:48,920
Right.

1161
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,320
And those servers
and doesn't have a memory.

1162
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,800
Those servers doesn't remember.

1163
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,840
They did not have any memory. Right.

1164
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,280
And because this server
doesn't have a memory,

1165
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,080
why would this ever ask to be saved?

1166
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,640
Username Password.

1167
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,120
It makes sense right?

1168
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:17,640
But remember the option going to Cannock?

1169
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:21,320
Correct.

1170
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:21,960
Right.

1171
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,280
So the one I would suggest to you

1172
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,360
and take this on priority change your bank

1173
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,080
as it is possible
before you see your bank account.

1174
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,600
Zero balance right.

1175
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,680
Change your bank.

1176
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,880
The app can use base 80
but still is this eighties Look

1177
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:43,760
this place.

1178
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:53,160
It is every time
you have to bring the base 80 cutting.

1179
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,200
That's what I'm saying.
Because that's what I'm saying.

1180
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,120
Every time you're pointing 88

1181
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,120
Nice.

1182
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,560
But Hunt,
you always think anything anything

1183
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,400
you think in terms of company would be a
like she didn't happen.

1184
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,720
Everything is

1185
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,800
what I do
my experience I have in my plus great

1186
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,600
amazing but

1187
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,240
guys you should learn

1188
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,000
from this
the student see even in this you know

1189
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:32,040
I think should you lot of difficult
topics is is still able to maintain this

1190
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:36,720
creativity that okay how can I put this
compellingly in every single topic

1191
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,640
he knows all of these things

1192
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,600
even that are still new
transaction numbers but every transaction

1193
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,760
got it correct
So now see now see you guys.

1194
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,760
Now come back to the topic

1195
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,080
in this database
instead of what is getting connected

1196
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:59,160
with the database, despite what happens
because it doesn't have a memory.

1197
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,600
So what is not going to support
any session.

1198
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,720
However, however, from here,

1199
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,880
from will, if
it goes back, if it goes back from here.

1200
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,320
So what happen?

1201
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,520
It returns.

1202
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:17,120
It returns one thing to the user
that a user go ahead and use your system.

1203
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:21,640
And we call this response
write a response from their database.

1204
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,480
And in another language, in another
language is the language, right?

1205
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,440
We call it

1206
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,040
what we call it

1207
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,360
is spoken right now.

1208
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,280
What is this token?

1209
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,200
What is this token?

1210
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,960
This is what we need to understand
simply means

1211
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:50,120
and ever this part

1212
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:56,000
one time password, what it does,
it allows you to provide

1213
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,560
your OTP in just 120 seconds
and 90 seconds or 60 seconds.

1214
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:00,760
Right?

1215
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,240
Not more than that.

1216
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,840
Not more than that, Correct.

1217
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:13,080
I got credit

1218
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,240
after 90 seconds on 1.2 seconds.

1219
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,360
If you provide
this, then what would happen

1220
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:20,880
then?

1221
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,000
What would happen if you wait
after 90 seconds, it will expire.

1222
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,360
Then again, you have to generate a new one
again, you have to generate a new one.

1223
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,760
The same thing.

1224
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,560
The same thing is fretless application
does when you try to log into the system,

1225
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,400
it goes to database and it does one token.

1226
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,760
The token is having the session
ID in session 80 with expiry time.

1227
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,800
Right? Two things.

1228
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,120
It has expiry time.

1229
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,360
So now this security will expire
at the time initially.

1230
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,880
So this you can use
for a particular amount of time.

1231
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,440
Right.

1232
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,200
That's why you might have observed
if you open your bank application,

1233
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,880
you log into the system

1234
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:01,560
and you don't work there for three,
4 minutes or even if you're working after

1235
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:07,280
five, six, 10 minutes,
it says your station is expired,

1236
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,760
your station is
expired, it happens or not,

1237
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:11,520
there is.

1238
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,560
Then again here to enter your username
and password again, you have to work

1239
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,080
on the application by right.

1240
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,600
Then why is this happening?

1241
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,240
Because of security. What is the security?

1242
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,280
Let's see.

1243
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,720
Let's say you got one very good
ethical hacker, right?

1244
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,520
And he you to account with the token.

1245
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,800
So now tell me even with the token
for how much time this user

1246
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:36,600
is able to access your account.

1247
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,520
I know this is not memory.

1248
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,360
This is not memory.

1249
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,440
It is coming directly from the database.

1250
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,200
Directly from the database. 90 minute.

1251
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,400
And in 91 it is more than enough to rob
the environments.

1252
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,120
Fargo Bank right
next to makes one point seconds

1253
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,640
90 seconds sixties I guess.

1254
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,640
Right.

1255
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,840
Or maybe if you are using

1256
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,200
intermediate level security application
then maybe 4 minutes.

1257
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:01,800
5 minutes.

1258
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,360
Did something like this correct?

1259
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:06,760
Correct.

1260
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,240
But most of us, believe

1261
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,200
me, we have a lot of intelligent people,
Einstein people, kind of people.

1262
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:15,720
Right.

1263
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,640
So if you provide just 25 seconds

1264
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:21,480
to enter the OTP,
they need 30 seconds to read the DP.

1265
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,120
Then there it is, I guess, to decide
whether I should put it on

1266
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,360
or in the next 30 seconds
to put this six digit OTP.

1267
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,600
That's my name is again.

1268
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,200
We should consider every single one.

1269
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:33,600
We have 7 billion instruments
on this planet train.

1270
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,600
We have to take into consideration
every single one

1271
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:41,720
that.

1272
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,720
Yes, correct.

1273
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,560
I think.

1274
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:51,240
Why should I give you that example?

1275
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:58,520
My brother, my cousin, my cousin,

1276
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:03,480
the station would not expect
it was still working on the site.

1277
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,720
Yes. If you're working
it was actively connected.

1278
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,280
But if you keep working there,

1279
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,040
right, for 20, 25 minutes after that,
it will expire.

1280
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,440
Try this with the bank application.

1281
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,440
Someone tried this with the bank
application.

1282
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,760
What if continuously
2025 minutes on your bank application

1283
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,560
it will get expired and for station in it
they will be there for five 6 minutes

1284
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:38,160
for station
continuous activity of 25 to 30 meters.

1285
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42,120
Thank you for.

1286
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,880
So you only pass authentication
when not authorization.

1287
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,000
Authentication
is something we have to pass

1288
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:51,720
and based on the authentication details,
it will authorize

1289
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,880
system will authorizes raid.

1290
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:58,240
So authentication and authorization
authorization is relying on authentication

1291
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,240
based

1292
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,720
authorization
is relying on authentication.

1293
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,720
Authentication is something you provide.

1294
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,880
So guys this is
is taking less application.

1295
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:14,760
So now even if you multiple servers
12345 server nor balancers, right.

1296
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,800
Loan balances is going to divert the node
so it doesn't later on this server

1297
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,680
you're going this time
every time you will get a new token,

1298
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,880
every time you will get the musician
80 from the database and you work on you,

1299
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,240
you work with your system,
you use your system,

1300
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:33,800
you access your system with new security,
with new with the new token industry.

1301
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:34,800
This part

1302
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,080
industrial.

1303
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,400
Despite today's

1304
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:52,880
fine.

1305
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,880
So now let's take a break.

1306
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,520
Let's take a break for 10 seconds
or so, 10 minutes late.

1307
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,880
I think I'm very much in API.

1308
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:05,840
I'm going to give you more time,
otherwise they should expired.

1309
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:06,680
If I had

1310
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,480
to do just 10 minutes, just in this case.

1311
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:11,400
Please, please.

1312
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:12,680
I am in a complete flow.

1313
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,920
I want you to learn everything

1314
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,640
that you already knew.

1315
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:23,000
Take 15 minutes to learn to take a break
for 15 minutes and others for 30 minutes

1316
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,080
break will continue to take class for 2
hours,

1317
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:29,280
will continue working for 2 hours.

1318
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,560
It means by your time, 150 or 130

1319
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,200
and then it will be clear your class
at 130 will complete your class, say

1320
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,920
one hour early, take one third,
you will complete your class.

1321
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,480
So for a diverse district list

1322
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,200
you have for any of the application
you use, you meet this fitness.

1323
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,600
So nobody

1324
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,400
because we have our topics
like which are distributed, so forth.

1325
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,400
What in the help of a student
for four and a half hours tomorrow

1326
01:18:56,440 --> 01:19:01,400
will be able to complete everything okay.

1327
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,960
No one my nobody. Today we

1328
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
you. Yeah.

1329
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,520
Not getting disconnected within minutes
great again in 40 minutes actually.

1330
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:21,600
Then do two and a half hour
continuous class looking like

1331
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,080
so now

1332
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,840
now here

1333
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,080
we are going to deal with is debt
less application.

1334
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:34,880
I will also tell you how to work
at this simple application rate,

1335
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,720
but there is no point in the
AP of providing a straight,

1336
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,880
full application rate is decrease

1337
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,720
application, which is dealing
every time we to contemplate we go.

1338
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:50,520
And so now here also that is the main
reason why we created admin user first.

1339
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:55,720
So now after admin user
we will get this token data via

1340
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,800
and it will get token,
it will perform all the operations them

1341
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,200
will perform all the operations.

1342
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:06,080
So we will get to provide this token to
you are not from the database.

1343
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:11,440
Great database is just a storage database.

1344
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:14,280
It is just a storage
which saves your information.

1345
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,520
But who decides whether to provide this
token to you or not?

1346
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,600
From the database, it's admin rates.

1347
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,640
We decide.

1348
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,640
Correct Logic decides
whether to provide you

1349
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,720
information or not,
whether to provide you access or not.

1350
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,600
And if we are providing access to you,

1351
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,920
what kind of access
we are willing to provide.

1352
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:33,720
Right.

1353
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:39,040
So, Edmund, besides this, that's
why now we have a mean right in October

1354
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,000
and means
we will going to generate the token

1355
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,080
right to perform
whatever operations we want to perform.

1356
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:51,240
So simply authentication
authorization would be done via tokens.

1357
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,720
So first we will understand

1358
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:56,520
what this token is all about,
what kind of tokens we have,

1359
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,920
which token we will use
and what we have inside the token.

1360
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:01,560
Right.

1361
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,960
Let's do a complete operation of this.

1362
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,800
You a complete engineering
basically of this token.

1363
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:13,960
Okay, let's start with this.

1364
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,280
Let's start with this.

1365
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:19,440
So now, now if I go to my right swagger

1366
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,800
video, you see the first

1367
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,440
point to be covered
is creating the admin user.

1368
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,160
Can you see guys

1369
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,080
and you see

1370
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,080
first creating the admin user
and then the second point.

1371
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:39,240
And then the second point here
we see is generate the token

1372
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:40,960
guys.

1373
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:47,400
Can you see the second point is generate
token, generate token.

1374
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,160
Fine.

1375
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:51,240
So now, Amy, this document,

1376
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:56,240
this document we have already have this
information that this document,

1377
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:00,240
all the relevant information,
what we need to perform and what kind of

1378
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,120
what kind of response
we are going to get right.

1379
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,480
What kind of response we are going to get.

1380
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,560
So remember one thing.

1381
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,840
Remember one thing when you are trying

1382
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:14,120
to access the system, grade this database.

1383
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:19,120
Why our server, this database,
why a server is going to give you,

1384
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,800
then it is going to give you this token.

1385
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,880
So when it is returning the token?

1386
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:27,480
It is returning the token.

1387
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,920
It is giving you the access or you are
actually adding a recording database.

1388
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,040
What you are doing basically, and

1389
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,040
it is just giving you the access.

1390
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,200
You're not going to add
any information in the database.

1391
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,080
Are you going to record
adding a record in the database?

1392
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,920
No, you're not going to end
any record in the database.

1393
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,160
You are simply accessing the token right.

1394
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,440
And this token is nothing
but some information.

1395
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,040
Some information. Right.

1396
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,880
What kind of information is this?

1397
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:02,040
Let me tell you.

1398
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,520
Client So now the point is, the point is

1399
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,600
there should not be the same status code
in response.

1400
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,000
What we were getting,
why creating the element user.

1401
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,280
There is a big difference
in the status code rate of the response

1402
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,640
because here
the nature of operation is different

1403
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:24,760
than what operation we perform in the
creating and meanings of part

1404
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,440
industrial,

1405
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:33,240
industrial everyone.

1406
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:33,800
Right.

1407
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,840
So now let's look into this operation
from here.

1408
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,040
Let's look into this operation.

1409
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,840
First base you are.

1410
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:44,720
I would be similar Mark guys base
you are right.

1411
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,280
Plus API location is same.

1412
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,800
The only thing is changing
is the only thing

1413
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:54,120
which is going to change is

1414
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,320
endpoint. Right?

1415
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,680
The endpoint is then is the thing
which we will going to change in our base.

1416
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:03,440
You are mark good base.

1417
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,280
You are a part
So now simply force take this particular

1418
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,640
you want to take all the things
one by one.

1419
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,240
We will take all the things one by one.

1420
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:15,800
Now tell me guys, should I create
a new request or same request?

1421
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:21,320
I can continue with What should I do?

1422
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,960
New request. Right.

1423
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,720
So click here, click on the collection
and it says, Add a new request.

1424
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,920
Add a new request.

1425
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,720
Fine.

1426
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,560
So now when I'm going to add a new request

1427
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,360
right here,
the name of the request were Do we

1428
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,160
generate

1429
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,960
token?

1430
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,880
Generate token

1431
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:47,560
or No.

1432
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,040
And it's not. Don't do it
as of now, don't do it.

1433
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:53,600
And if you want to do it, you can do us
know if you are done both ways. Are

1434
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:56,280
but don't get

1435
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,280
lost yourself in just typing that things

1436
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,520
because this is something we are doing
first time. Right?

1437
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,160
So I would suggest you do see I am doing

1438
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,960
this training base.

1439
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,760
You are it
less API location after API location.

1440
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:19,720
I'm going to provide
going to provide this endpoint,

1441
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:22,680
this endpoint see base you are it

1442
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,520
plus API location plus endpoint.

1443
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:29,040
Is this correct? Is this correct?

1444
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,400
Now come here

1445
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:34,280
and it says which method we need to use.

1446
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:38,280
See, it says
which method we need to lose this

1447
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:44,080
is it just paused.

1448
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,600
So I'm going to change it to forced

1449
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:49,760
this.

1450
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,640
You want to find an endpoint?

1451
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,240
Fine type of method?

1452
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,360
Fine.

1453
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,880
Now let's read the information.

1454
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,920
It says this endpoint will generate token.

1455
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,280
Please enter email and password

1456
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,040
that was used to create a user

1457
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,280
which user it is talking about

1458
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:16,360
admin user.

1459
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:16,960
Right.

1460
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:22,560
Because admin is responsible
to provide that token, right.

1461
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,000
And we need responsible
to provide the token.

1462
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:28,400
So we have to provide
the email ID and password of the admin

1463
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,840
so that we can bind to database
the database.

1464
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:34,640
I am the admin and I'm going
to generate the token from user ID.

1465
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,240
My user can access the system. Right?

1466
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:41,040
So now here, here
you'll see if I'm going to provide

1467
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,960
this user name and password for admin,
it will allow me to generate the token.

1468
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,440
Now see I generated.

1469
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,920
What kind of token is this case?

1470
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,200
It says Jason Web token I expensive.

1471
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,840
What is this?
Just a token ordinary JSON web

1472
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,040
token person takes a chat
and this is only valid for

1473
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:05,360
nice.

1474
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,440
Can you see it?

1475
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:08,960
It is only valid for 20 hours

1476
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,920
because this is for strictly purpose.

1477
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:15,600
For learning purpose
we get the duration of

1478
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,280
expiry of the token is Twitter's.

1479
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:21,160
We kept it intentionally right.

1480
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:25,160
Otherwise, if we just put it to 90
seconds, every time we have to generate

1481
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,240
new will complete.

1482
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:29,200
So for us
it means you can use it for longer.

1483
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,400
Broadcasting so that it would be easy

1484
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,200
for you to utilize
just to now these two points.

1485
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:40,640
If a user has not created for us,
we have to create a new user.

1486
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:44,880
Or if you are not able to remember
the password again, create a new user.

1487
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,520
So remember,
even when you perform testing,

1488
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,920
when you perform
API testing in most men in your role

1489
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:56,880
or whenever you try to revise
it is always recommended, right?

1490
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,040
It is always recommended right? Right.

1491
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:04,680
It is always recommended that
first you create an admin user, right?

1492
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,520
And with this admin user, right
this minute user

1493
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,640
you have to generate a token. Understood.

1494
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,680
So now you see while generating the token,
we got this information,

1495
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,120
we understood the instructions

1496
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:23,840
and he after the instructions,
if you see it is asking for the body,

1497
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:27,960
it is asking for the body
and it says body is required.

1498
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,120
It says bodies required.

1499
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:34,680
Can you events.

1500
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:39,960
So now now it says in the body,
I'm going to provide email and password.

1501
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:42,720
So I'm going to

1502
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:46,680
provide email and password.

1503
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,320
So again, we guys this email and password
crucial and work.

1504
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:49,720
By now.

1505
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:52,280
We added the request on pause to make sure

1506
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,800
click on the collection.

1507
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,400
This dots click on the collection.

1508
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,880
And here you see add request.

1509
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:08,520
Here you see a request.

1510
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:12,360
Click on the collection and add request.

1511
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:17,120
Now now you see generate token
natively generated this pain point.

1512
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,360
Correct. We got this body.

1513
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:23,160
So now let's take this body forced guys,
remember this username

1514
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:26,480
and password
is the one we use for creating the user.

1515
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,680
So do we have this username
and password or not?

1516
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:33,360
Yes, we do have in not
previously been used that fine.

1517
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:34,960
So now here.

1518
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,680
Here to add anybody that I have to go.

1519
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,640
Yes. To just that username and password.

1520
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,120
So to add the
body we have this option body

1521
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:45,840
in body.

1522
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,480
What should I select from your non form
data?

1523
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,240
We are to select row after row

1524
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,960
after row, select from the dropdown,

1525
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:01,720
JSON after JSON based on this part

1526
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,600
based on this place.

1527
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:15,680
See now guys,
see here in this string the email.

1528
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,080
So the one we used this is the

1529
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,560
remember this email is

1530
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,680
what is the name loophole Zima

1531
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,000
being transferred in is a strange spot.

1532
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,480
Aisha is principal in Katrina
and the students us.

1533
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:36,120
But I still remember seeing copy this

1534
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:44,040
come here pasted, pasted

1535
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:48,680
and here
the password is best in the regular.

1536
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:52,080
Is this correct?

1537
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,400
And then I think nice.

1538
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,120
Thank you for correcting you guys.

1539
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:59,160
Even in password. Great.

1540
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,240
This is work requirement. See this? Right.

1541
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:05,000
So we are not doing anything on one
because the instructions

1542
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,120
in one document called Swagger
and we are just following the document.

1543
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:09,680
Right.

1544
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:13,080
And following the instructions
which are available in the document.

1545
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:17,480
We are making this request
right after adding this data,

1546
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,920
I'm going to go and click on headers

1547
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,440
because inherited here
I have to add one point.

1548
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:24,680
What is think
we have to add one here today?

1549
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,560
What is the trend of

1550
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,120
we have to add

1551
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,200
content type fine

1552
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,360
content page.

1553
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:43,120
So what is the content database

1554
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:46,320
application slash just right.

1555
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:50,880
I bought into

1556
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,560
header has done

1557
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,240
basically what I did

1558
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,280
this tartlets were done.

1559
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,040
Now See in response.

1560
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:03,880
In response it says it generates work
in response it will generate something.

1561
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:05,880
What does that something

1562
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,160
what is that
something that is telling in response

1563
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:14,920
token.

1564
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:19,560
So let's send the request.

1565
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,760
There you go.

1566
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,920
In this case, we got one thing.

1567
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,800
What is that?

1568
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:26,760
We got one thing here.

1569
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,560
What is database token?

1570
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,680
We got organizer. Great.

1571
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:35,840
Let's make this token right.

1572
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:36,480
Great.

1573
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:38,920
This is their token.

1574
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,760
This is the token record
from this request.

1575
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:47,160
No, Every time, every time,
whatever the operation we perform,

1576
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:52,920
we will use this particular token grade
as an access to the application raised.

1577
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:55,240
At the moment, I provide this token.

1578
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:59,760
The moment I provide this token,
it will allow me to access the application

1579
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,400
and perform whatever the operation
I want to perform affect

1580
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:10,080
confetti.

1581
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:14,120
Now see now see here
admin can do whatever the things

1582
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,240
admin can add or not

1583
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,440
eliminate the employee a lot more

1584
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:27,640
and we can update the employer, not admin.

1585
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:31,560
The employees are not
admin can do anything anything great.

1586
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:34,520
They expect to be used
admin, username and password.

1587
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,080
You all great operations.

1588
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,160
That's why we use admin.

1589
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,440
Use ready and password here now.

1590
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,600
Now understand this particular token.

1591
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:45,040
Right. Understand this particular token.

1592
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,600
We call it

1593
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,440
we call it the right

1594
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,840
token is this repair

1595
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,040
report that we talk about

1596
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:58,840
is take full application

1597
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,720
and then we talk about stateless

1598
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:06,800
in this application.

1599
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,320
Right.

1600
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:09,920
So now here to this JSON web token

1601
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,920
in this JSON token content type,
so you can tell you

1602
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:18,760
what video internal data run
it is the same one, right?

1603
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:21,000
It is the same one,
which is a mentioning here.

1604
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,200
You see content type
applications like JSON.

1605
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:29,640
So also put the same thing here
in headers, content type applications.

1606
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:36,200
Let's just correct, correct.

1607
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,480
Is this correct?

1608
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,520
Nice.

1609
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,800
So now here, now see here.

1610
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:47,160
What is this? Just a token. Remember,

1611
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,880
remember, we

1612
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:53,640
are going to study three types of broker.

1613
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,640
How many types of companies?

1614
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,920
We are going to see three types of token.

1615
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:02,480
The first is the first one is beta token,

1616
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,840
the second one is Mac token
and the third one is green.

1617
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:07,840
So again,

1618
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,760
how dates, dates, we are to make grants

1619
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:17,760
like when we generate the token, generally
we deal with this three terminologies

1620
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:24,480
beta mek, drums and mustard.

1621
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:25,160
The students.

1622
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:29,840
Now this MEK, this MEK is basically a key,
right?

1623
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,640
This this it is basically a key.

1624
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,400
I'm giving you the really simplified
definition of make token.

1625
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,440
It simply means asymmetric interference

1626
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,360
between three parties on a client server
and the source.

1627
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,160
Right.

1628
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:45,480
It means it'd be a part client API.

1629
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:49,960
So this mechanism requires the
establishment of sharing to keep the same.

1630
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:53,320
Given you exchange in the gig,
it will allow you exist.

1631
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,400
So it is not of our use in FBI scope.

1632
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:58,800
We never use bank.

1633
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,360
We neither use grants either.

1634
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:05,480
We don't use either
y because grant is basically

1635
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:08,600
used to perform
a specific type of information.

1636
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:09,440
Right?

1637
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:13,520
If you want to transfer the data
from one place to another place

1638
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,200
there, you use grants.

1639
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,200
So Grant is also out of school.

1640
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:20,040
Mac and Grant,
we're not going to talk about.

1641
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:24,280
So there is just one type of token
which we are going to talk about that is

1642
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,200
which token guys that is

1643
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,120
beta token to be added token.

1644
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:37,080
So first first we will see
what is this Jason.

1645
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,400
Jason there.

1646
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,800
Okay. Jason Tokens.

1647
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,000
Remember guys, when we talk about Jason

1648
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,720
web tokens, right
Always this Jason BEP tokens, right?

1649
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:53,920
Whenever we talk about this token,
this token always comes in three parts.

1650
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:58,240
How many games, how many bugs?

1651
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,440
Jason Get tokens.

1652
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,040
Always grams, please.

1653
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:05,880
Again, Alexi Gram simply means
if you want to transfer the file or share

1654
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:11,520
the file from one source to another source
in those kind of applications

1655
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,000
or in those kind of operations,
you need clients.

1656
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:18,960
So there is no scope of clients
in our testing automation API part

1657
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,400
or even in development.

1658
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,920
Also be used only beta part.

1659
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:23,960
Okay.

1660
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,080
Now when we talk about Jason, them
to console

1661
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,800
whether it is against
or if it is a mac or it is a beta.

1662
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:36,000
Jason The tokens always comes
in three bucks, right?

1663
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,080
In three parts.

1664
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:42,680
Now let's see, there is a website called
it is a website called JWT

1665
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:45,800
Not Believe It is a website called JWT,

1666
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,400
not able or read open this application.

1667
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:50,280
Let me share this.

1668
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:53,160
You want to with everyone
but it's not. You go to JWT

1669
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,640
and put it in the message here.

1670
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,360
You can use it.

1671
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,200
Okay.

1672
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:03,280
Everyone can use a digital duplicate
if someone can post to the same thing

1673
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:04,920
right now.

1674
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:05,840
You got them.

1675
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:08,080
Nice. Great.

1676
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:11,640
So now see guys here we can read here,
we can read about this

1677
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,280
introduction part.

1678
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:20,400
So here you see what is JSON.

1679
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:25,200
That token simply simply
we have to understand what is this?

1680
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,400
Just some group to be able to understand
this point.

1681
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,240
Always remember, always remember.

1682
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,800
When we talk about this JSON token
rates, it follows

1683
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:39,160
it follows some kind of algorithms
or standards, right?

1684
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:43,480
Either it is a make or odyssey
or is this is CDC rate.

1685
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:47,280
These are some kind of algorithms
this token follows.

1686
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:48,840
Who provided that key?

1687
01:38:48,840 --> 01:39:03,280
Have you ever heard about encryption
and the picture?

1688
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,880
Have you ever heard this does not work?

1689
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:06,760
All right.

1690
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:11,480
So when I told you to change your
bank, but it's really a logic

1691
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,120
like check.

1692
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:14,600
What is that?

1693
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,360
You should be right.

1694
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,360
Don't worry. When troubleshooting.

1695
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:21,600
Now, guys,
see in this JSON web token, writing

1696
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:25,440
this JSON token is what it is
to encrypt data

1697
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:28,320
from encrypted form information.

1698
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:33,960
All right, this is some information
in encrypted form or read encrypted form.

1699
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:37,440
So now, see, we did first

1700
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,160
simply what Token does, guys, we know it
very well.

1701
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:41,240
What are the two things?

1702
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,440
Insecurity based guys?

1703
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:48,280
What are the two things?

1704
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:53,160
When we talk about private APIs, Private
APIs takes care of security in two phases.

1705
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:58,320
Part one is authentication
and, part is authorization, right?

1706
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:01,640
So here
this JSON tokens are doing nothing else

1707
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:05,760
but authentication
in authorization, correct?

1708
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,360
Correct.

1709
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:09,600
Authorization
and authentication information exchange

1710
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,480
simply means it is a part of authorization
also.

1711
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,080
Right.

1712
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:15,560
What kind of excuses you have,
what exists.

1713
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:18,320
We should give you this thing now.

1714
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:22,360
Now here you see in its config form JSON

1715
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:27,480
web two guns
consist of three parts separated by dots

1716
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:30,840
in its compact form.

1717
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:34,680
Decent web tokens consist of three parts

1718
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:38,000
separate ID by dots which are header

1719
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:42,880
payload signature

1720
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,400
which are header payload signature.

1721
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,720
Now you see this.

1722
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:54,960
This should be
this should be the of just a token x x x.

1723
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:59,760
Let me put one more y y, y, y or z z z.

1724
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:01,920
Can you see

1725
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,400
can you see this case

1726
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:08,400
right now?

1727
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:15,880
This bar, these three bars every token
must have separated by separated by dots.

1728
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:18,760
So now C windows is separated by dots.

1729
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,680
If you go to post men, can you see

1730
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,280
this is one part dark.

1731
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,600
This is vacant park

1732
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,480
dark.

1733
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,680
This is part of work.

1734
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:37,320
It means my token is just a token or not.

1735
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,920
Come on. This.

1736
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:44,400
You see, these are B minor details
and then you read BD minor detail.

1737
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,040
I'm telling you, first bar,
second bar, code bar,

1738
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:52,720
separate ID,
but don't disagree with token point.

1739
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:54,400
Now, what does it mean?

1740
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,760
What does it mean
when I see this particular part?

1741
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:00,200
So this is some encrypted form
of information.

1742
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:03,320
Encrypted form of information, Right.

1743
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:05,600
And what this information has here.

1744
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:16,560
So now, see, I'm
telling you, in this token, in this token,

1745
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,440
this was x, x x x is nothing but your

1746
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,400
header.

1747
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,880
Then when we talk about why they buy it,

1748
01:42:25,880 --> 01:42:29,080
why it is nothing but you'll be known.

1749
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:32,760
And then Zsa Zsa
Zsa Zsa is nothing but your

1750
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,960
your signature.

1751
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,640
Your signature header
payload and signature.

1752
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,440
Now we have to understand
what is this header?

1753
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:46,160
What is this payload?
What is this signature?

1754
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,640
Three things, right?

1755
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:51,120
This. But

1756
01:42:57,240 --> 01:42:58,120
all right.

1757
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:03,400
Why payload is equal to worthy

1758
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,240
nice apple.

1759
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,880
What a genius guy you are proud of.

1760
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:11,680
You right?

1761
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,600
You are absolutely correct.

1762
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,600
Absolutely perfect.

1763
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,840
Payload means body.

1764
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:19,080
Fine.

1765
01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:21,000
So now, now, here.

1766
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,120
Here was two.

1767
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:24,640
We talk about header.

1768
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,880
What is this candidate?

1769
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,200
What does this member header consist of?

1770
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:31,680
Two parts.

1771
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,440
And therefore that consists
of how many parts guys

1772
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,160
and it consist of

1773
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,760
two parts.

1774
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,600
Great. One plus one byte. Excellent.

1775
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,200
Another mainstream, low key and value
according to Einstein.

1776
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:52,160
Amazing. See this?

1777
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:57,120
This is what I call innovative, innovative
mind to trade, sometimes key and value.

1778
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,720
I think he said
one plus one is equal to two.

1779
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,120
Amazing.

1780
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:08,000
If I was between us today,
I would have come to your home Butterfly

1781
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:12,120
rhythm book and both of you agree
that I would have to do this these days.

1782
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,920
You guys did something

1783
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,360
amazing

1784
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,640
in the book from my show, Guys,

1785
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:25,480
your late William
Wellington's days already passed.

1786
01:44:25,640 --> 01:44:31,200
You were never advertised your shop yet
in the right and I would have I.

1787
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:36,480
I could have tried my level best you know
to contribute to your as much as I could

1788
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:40,680
because here I could have,
you know, forced everybody

1789
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:45,760
to purchase.

1790
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:47,880
But Nikola not took a knock.

1791
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:53,920
It's what, a month in a Katrina for both.

1792
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,440
Like you're sarcastic, gentlemen.

1793
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,160
There's a kind of active truth.

1794
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:04,800
So now, hey, has how many things
and is what they say.

1795
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:05,920
Don't worry. Look,

1796
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,520
I'm not going

1797
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,800
to, you know, I

1798
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,280
think two parts.

1799
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,520
Two parts. Here is the first one.

1800
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:20,800
The first one is
what kind of token it has.

1801
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,000
Type of token.

1802
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:24,960
Type of token.

1803
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,920
What kind of token it is.

1804
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,080
First thing is type of token.

1805
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:32,400
And the second thing is the signing
algorithm,

1806
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:34,240
right?

1807
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:41,040
The signing algorithm that is being used,
algorithm used

1808
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:46,800
such as your age make or your RC

1809
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:51,000
or your asset two, five, six or something.

1810
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,760
So this is finding algorithm
something, right?

1811
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,080
This algorithm is generally encrypting
your information grade,

1812
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:00,480
whatever the information here
that we have, it is something

1813
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,480
encrypting, right,
and giving you an encrypted form.

1814
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:04,680
So who is doing this?

1815
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,840
This signing algorithm is doing okay.

1816
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,840
So the first is what kind of token?

1817
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:09,960
The type of token.

1818
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:12,080
And the second is signing algorithm.

1819
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:16,560
So it is
we have these two things in header now.

1820
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,320
See now see this part?

1821
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:21,360
This part is having two things.

1822
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,520
Your type of token you're signing
will go to them.

1823
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,960
I will show you.
I will show you these also.

1824
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:26,520
Okay.

1825
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:30,880
So first thing clear what is header?

1826
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:31,560
First thing clear.

1827
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:39,960
What is it?

1828
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,080
I always use genius to punish.

1829
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:48,640
I never said to devise. Like

1830
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,840
if I am in a

1831
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:55,080
serious mood, if I'm talking to a person,
I always talk.

1832
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:58,400
They always make sure that this person is

1833
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,880
always counted, should always be counted
from talking to that person.

1834
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,360
So I never use this kind of words.

1835
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:08,640
And then one of them, the signing
algorithm consists of what exactly?

1836
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,160
The signing algorithm is nothing,
but the algorithms are great.

1837
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,800
So basically it is a programing.

1838
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:18,640
You can see that is converting
your message into the interpreted form.

1839
01:47:18,920 --> 01:47:22,680
Okay,
so this is the name of this algorithm only

1840
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:25,000
for all the Einsteins.

1841
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,640
Again, same thing.

1842
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:28,360
It is no one exception.

1843
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,040
Alright, fine.

1844
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,440
So First part of token is header.

1845
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,280
This second part of token is guys

1846
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,880
below or body, right.

1847
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,640
Nobody.

1848
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:45,040
So what does it mean what we have in this
or what we have in this body?

1849
01:47:45,400 --> 01:47:48,360
Remember, it contains information.

1850
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:50,880
It contains information about

1851
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,800
who is the issuer of the token posting,
who is the issuer of the token?

1852
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:01,560
What is the expiry name of this token?

1853
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,600
What is the subject of the token?

1854
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,360
Who is the audience of this token?

1855
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:11,640
Right, that issue and expiry time
subject of the audience, all these things,

1856
01:48:11,640 --> 01:48:15,400
all these things we would be having
in this paper, in this body, right?

1857
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:18,600
Because simply in simple language,
we call it

1858
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:20,920
claims

1859
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,680
what we call it claims, right?

1860
01:48:24,680 --> 01:48:27,640
Someone is claiming
someone is claiming something great.

1861
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:31,080
So it is claiming that we are
be sure this is the experiment.

1862
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:34,560
This is the subject, this is the audience,
this type of information

1863
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:38,240
we have about this token in payload

1864
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:45,360
here, in payload,

1865
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:51,680
basically it by

1866
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:55,480
then the next thing and the last thing is

1867
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:59,040
we have the third part, third parties
signature,

1868
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,800
third parties signature.

1869
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,240
So now in the
signature, you'll see it says

1870
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:09,440
fixes.

1871
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,360
The signature is used.

1872
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:15,360
The signature is used

1873
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,600
to verify

1874
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:22,320
the message.

1875
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:25,920
The message was not changed,

1876
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,600
was not changed along the way.

1877
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:30,880
What does it mean?

1878
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,080
It means the message
which we are sending the same message

1879
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,680
would be the soon to be claimed
right the way.

1880
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:41,800
So it means the token which is generated
does same token we should exempt.

1881
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,240
So signature is having all these things.

1882
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:45,080
All right.

1883
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:48,880
All right so you get consider
this is a part of authentication.

1884
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:51,800
Obviously this is authentication
and for correctness

1885
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:56,840
the signature is used to verify
the message was not changed along the way.

1886
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,800
Now this is the

1887
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,160
this is the time to operate out of

1888
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,800
see therefore, what it says are typical

1889
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:11,760
JWT token
looks like x, x, x, y, y, y, z, z.

1890
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,760
Now let's break down the token and see.

1891
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:20,800
So here, if I go, let me do it.

1892
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,760
Let me open this website

1893
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,000
correctly.

1894
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:28,920
Correct.

1895
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:32,200
Now you'll see here they see this token.

1896
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,400
First I made empty.

1897
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:36,880
I made it empty. Right?

1898
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,600
And now I'm going to copy my token from

1899
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,560
my to confront Postman.

1900
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:49,440
I copied my token from post
when I pasted in the moment I pasted here.

1901
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:54,120
You see, it gave me header,
it gave me payload, it gave me signature.

1902
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,080
Three things.

1903
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:55,920
And you see

1904
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:03,120
it issued its coordinates.

1905
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:06,720
You can also copy your tokens
which you guys have generated

1906
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,560
in your postman
and just put it here in the debugger.

1907
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:12,960
The moment you put it, you'll give
it will give you header

1908
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,560
payload and signature

1909
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:17,720
grade signature.

1910
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:22,960
Now see, according to the information
we have seen, I am provided to you

1911
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:27,680
see every information you see that
type of token is what see just to go.

1912
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,000
It's this type of token.

1913
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,520
What is your type of token based?

1914
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:33,880
What is the table? The token

1915
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,240
student's JWT?

1916
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:39,760
Simple.

1917
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:44,040
It means JSON, web, token JavaScript,

1918
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:47,040
the web token, no December token, but

1919
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:50,520
this is just another token rate.

1920
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:53,960
And the algorithm we are using,
is it just proof of the six?

1921
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:57,520
Can you see who is encrypting
my information?

1922
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:01,840
The algorithm signing algorithm, which is
sending algorithm it just to five six.

1923
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:05,520
This is the part of it
that contains things.

1924
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,480
Both these things we have seen here.

1925
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:12,520
Now go to the payload in payload
you see right expiry time.

1926
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:16,400
This issue here is this right?

1927
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:20,200
And then after issue, what you see,
what is the subject rate?

1928
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,640
What is the audience?

1929
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,720
So this is the audience for this user
idea.

1930
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:25,600
Is the audience right?

1931
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:27,240
Who is going to use it? Correct.

1932
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:35,600
So all this information
you'll see in payload or not,

1933
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:39,200
right.

1934
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:40,320
But now I'm going to

1935
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,560
because JavaScript

1936
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:49,320
and JavaScript in JavaScript

1937
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:54,120
object notation is a simply like,
you know what

1938
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:55,440
I would see

1939
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,800
Labor Day without labor,
like this one in our language,

1940
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:08,560
that is our dessert
curriculum with our the rules,

1941
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:13,440
something like that.

1942
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,600
But yes, and please ask,

1943
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,360
please ask

1944
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:46,400
explicit, read explicit.

1945
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:47,520
Where

1946
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,520
in pain
automate is three four, three nine.

1947
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:59,080
So this is not something we have provided.

1948
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:02,160
This is something just token

1949
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:07,600
provided, but

1950
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,840
we provided just our username and password

1951
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:15,080
and all this information
we deployed anything from here.

1952
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:17,640
This is something we got.
And what is this?

1953
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,760
This is the decoded form
of this particular token.

1954
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,840
Is it idea of that user, correct.

1955
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:24,560
Correct.

1956
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,560
So it generates every name
a different one,

1957
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,640
obviously, if there is a different user.

1958
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:31,440
So this is the encoded form of information
I've seen

1959
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:35,640
and this is going to be coded
form of this particular token, Right.

1960
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:39,280
So what this token has,
we are getting all this information

1961
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:44,160
from the database it generates
based on the security grade and station.

1962
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:46,800
And it could be anything,
It could be anything.

1963
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:49,360
Three, four, 391, two, two, one, two,
three, two, two.

1964
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,560
It could be anything.

1965
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:51,760
It's not in our head.

1966
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:58,720
Okay?

1967
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,400
Because you didn't provide anything.

1968
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:03,080
And see here
this invalid signature, right?

1969
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:03,400
It is.

1970
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:08,960
I don't know why, but yet we are getting
all this information, so don't worry.

1971
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,000
So hidden question.

1972
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:10,680
Yes, it is.

1973
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:34,200
Ask. No, no.

1974
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:35,880
You just generate token.

1975
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:36,480
You use it.

1976
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:40,520
You perform your operation
focus on the ABC scored bit in that

1977
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:44,360
you don't go home simple.

1978
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:49,680
Like I said, in the first attempt
of learning you learn every single thing

1979
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:51,840
late.

1980
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:55,040
This is something to get a job.

1981
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,840
It's for understanding, right?

1982
01:55:56,840 --> 01:56:01,320
So it is something great which helps you,
which helps you to get a job.

1983
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,760
After getting a job, it's your calling.

1984
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,840
They find the easiest way to get the job
done,

1985
01:56:07,720 --> 01:56:10,400
get promoted, switch on to another job.

1986
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:13,280
Be like Superman.

1987
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:16,200
Then you can always explore
other ways around the work

1988
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,680
getting engaged.

1989
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:20,520
So this is not something you do every day.

1990
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:22,080
It is just for information, right?

1991
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,240
Like I said, are when to operate.

1992
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:28,400
So that's why we just included
all these three points, right?

1993
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:31,600
And I'm giving you the information
what every point contains.

1994
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:35,600
So you must know, okay, I'm getting this
just the right.

1995
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,240
And tomorrow you never know
if your manager asked you to

1996
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:41,240
educate your team on

1997
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:45,720
API or take the trainings of API
for your team because your team is new

1998
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:49,240
and they don't know how to work on it. A

1999
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:50,960
For hard,

2000
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:55,680
the token is basically a stateless
application.

2001
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,560
When we discussed

2002
01:56:56,560 --> 01:56:59,600
what is a stateless application,
but we do not have server remedy.

2003
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:03,400
If you do not have server memory,
there is no place to save your credentials

2004
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:07,200
and if there is no place
to save your credentials, database returns

2005
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:11,440
the response to the server instead of
well returns the station ID token.

2006
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:14,840
So this token is nothing
wouldn't exist to be excused

2007
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:18,120
granting the permission to you
so that you go and access

2008
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:20,200
the particular system for a moment
and then

2009
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:23,520
delete point of time.

2010
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:24,520
Okay. But

2011
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:36,400
a new book,

2012
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:39,920
I don't know why, because maybe sometimes,
you know, because of the user's

2013
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:44,760
easiness raid so that the user
just one time and the saved their data.

2014
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:47,040
They don't need to log in again and again.

2015
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:48,560
There's one reading.

2016
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:50,600
And if the decision expires every time.

2017
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:51,080
Right.

2018
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:54,040
You see people use
when I was in our grade,

2019
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:56,600
but banking applications,
they use one, five, six, seven

2020
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,240
when it's not more than that integer
unless you are milania

2021
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:03,120
and then you have to transfer
billions of dollars every day.

2022
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,720
How many of you guys use your Internet
banking rate?

2023
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:10,280
And for more than 5 minutes in one shot,
how many of you guys

2024
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:24,200
for encryption?

2025
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:27,640
And encryption
simply means order that you are going

2026
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:30,480
to change its language
to see what is in there?

2027
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:31,680
Correct?

2028
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:34,120
It's not going to change the information.

2029
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:37,120
It shows you
that the actual form of information

2030
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:43,080
that is what encoded
decoded meaning right.

2031
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:43,440
Right.

2032
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,320
So if the expiry time of the

2033
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:50,880
token is limited,
there's is fine explanation of the time.

2034
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,000
It's very time on the token is limited.

2035
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,440
So one can not change after decoding
it will be same.

2036
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:00,480
It is just to let you raid.

2037
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:02,200
It is just to let you know.

2038
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:05,000
Tell me when you are using your two EUA
applications.

2039
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,200
Right
when you're using it, your applications.

2040
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:10,520
First of all, the use API is for testing.

2041
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:15,240
Have you seen any user
was is doing transactions via API?

2042
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:18,560
Have you seen any user on this planet?

2043
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:22,440
Tell me if you find anyone
was taking this particular part and doing

2044
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,880
imposition. Got it. Got it.

2045
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:27,160
This is a temporary token.

2046
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:30,320
I give the example of a banking great.

2047
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:31,360
It's for us to.

2048
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:35,280
So there is data collection
that has been established in between

2049
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:38,280
the UI and the database
from the presentation layer

2050
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:41,920
to the data layer in this middleware,
how data is being transferred.

2051
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:44,600
We are testing this data via API, right?

2052
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,640
That's why we are able to see their token.

2053
01:59:46,640 --> 01:59:50,240
But if you're using your native
application, can you see the token?

2054
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:54,640
If you don't see
the token, how would you grab this token?

2055
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:57,720
If you don't get this token,
how would you decode this to happen?

2056
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:00,600
If you don't decode this token,
how would you see the different

2057
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:11,400
information in the decoded form?

2058
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,040
There's two different things, guys.

2059
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:17,040
We are doing it from distinct perspective,
but in the end, like whatever

2060
02:00:17,040 --> 02:00:20,080
you do, you know, with the UI,
because you put users

2061
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:22,200
your way has been implemented, right?

2062
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:25,680
And on the UI part with the website,
you never see these tokens.

2063
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:31,680
They don't get confused in between what
you are learning and what you are doing.

2064
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:34,040
These are two different things.
This is for your job.

2065
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:35,400
This is not for you.

2066
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:36,880
Really. Don't ask me.

2067
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,400
Provide me that API offline.

2068
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:43,000
Spargo I'm going to do translation
time using this JSON token, right?

2069
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,600
Joe Biden will commit suicide after that.

2070
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,280
Don't do that.

2071
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:50,640
If if you understand this part,
it will get my

2072
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:55,640
Americans are going to make transactions
using API based on decent biblical.

2073
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:59,840
Can we just in having three parts
Hey look, we're not signature, right?

2074
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:04,040
He might be thinking how intellectual
people become now in the US saying

2075
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:06,480
these are two different things.

2076
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:08,520
This is a single that pretty good

2077
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:12,120
students.

2078
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:14,280
One understanding my point

2079
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:23,640
I saw No,

2080
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,520
no no Silver I'm not getting mad.

2081
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:27,280
I'm just kidding.

2082
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:46,520
I'm in a very good mood like a separate,

2083
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:49,000
uh, no, I'm fortunate enough

2084
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:57,280
I didn't.

2085
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,000
All right, guys. Yeah. Yeah.

2086
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:02,400
Then that's what I'm saying.

2087
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:03,960
I'm like, Yeah,

2088
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:06,760
I skipped from there.

2089
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:07,960
Fine.

2090
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:11,920
So now let's see what this request first.

2091
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:14,640
So now you guys see so far

2092
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,960
there's some mistake like this.

2093
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:34,600
The best thing, Alex,
that is, does their reality.

2094
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:36,040
We all have to accept,

2095
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:40,840
believe it or not, consider it or not.

2096
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:43,800
One day we all have to lost our lives,

2097
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:47,200
right?

2098
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:48,680
Today's his day.

2099
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:51,040
The model will be made that

2100
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:00,680
no foreign.

2101
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:04,440
If I get serious, I will tell you
when I'm going to get serious.

2102
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:07,920
Because right now
I'm trying to teach you something.

2103
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:13,040
So it it's very essential for me
to maintain the balance of the class

2104
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:16,880
if I just give you all the time,
all the 5 hours,

2105
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:20,520
believe me,
you do not have potential as a student.

2106
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:24,560
I don't have potential as a teacher
to beat except fight.

2107
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:27,000
The worst is strictly is to the point.

2108
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,640
Otherwise you guys get boredom
because you're a student.

2109
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:32,040
You will listen to me,
but you will not be an activist.

2110
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:33,640
None of the great.

2111
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:37,320
So I have to maintain the environment
of the class, which is very healthy

2112
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:40,640
so that I don't need to push you to less
than what I'm seeing.

2113
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:43,480
You will always be an active
listener, right?

2114
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:44,360
This is what I do

2115
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:46,520
so I don't get mad.

2116
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:49,560
And yes, obviously,
and expecting a lot from you guys.

2117
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:51,960
Not totally from last three
or four months.

2118
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:54,360
That's what I've been telling you, right?

2119
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:56,760
This is important for me.

2120
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,640
That's why I set my expectations with you
from the very first day

2121
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:00,640
because I know you guys.

2122
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:05,680
I don't want to deliver.

2123
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:10,920
I cannot just click on this fifth part,
just click on this important said.

2124
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:14,640
If it is it,
just see what our brain experience will

2125
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:16,520
not trade on them.

2126
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:17,760
No one can think even more.

2127
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:18,360
Think

2128
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,640
that is getting very interesting.

2129
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:26,160
Congratulations on this

2130
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:29,840
nice Aborigine emerald custom.

2131
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:34,680
No, exactly.

2132
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:39,080
The one is it?

2133
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:39,880
This is fine.

2134
02:04:39,880 --> 02:04:42,520
Answer this for straight Alexa.

2135
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:44,560
I just explained we have to save it.

2136
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:46,680
So once you save it, it becomes paused.

2137
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:47,720
You also, Jacob,

2138
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,480
is to get temporary
access to share security information.

2139
02:04:51,680 --> 02:04:52,520
Correct, Jimmy.

2140
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:55,920
So you'll see here Jimmy
in this information barred

2141
02:04:56,320 --> 02:05:00,840
it says Jason Token is valid for 12 hours
only after 12 hours.

2142
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:07,080
It did not work.

2143
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:08,760
Oh, yeah.

2144
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,640
Katarina Correct.

2145
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:13,920
But then when it comes to buy a new car,

2146
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,600
I already have a lot of showrooms
in India.

2147
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:19,320
Also trade in you open variable.

2148
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:22,480
One second. Yeah, sure, sure.

2149
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,640
There you go. Great.

2150
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:28,680
I have not done showrooms in India
also have been prices are even much lesser

2151
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:32,240
than places in you is great
also import duty I can see

2152
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:36,560
I don't need to go into the custom
check that on a lot of my select is yes

2153
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:41,840
there obviously it is correct
but still the point is I don't know.

2154
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:44,080
I have a new car to buy a new car.

2155
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:44,920
That's the point.

2156
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:47,120
Concerned about finding a car in India.

2157
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:54,600
So. All right, guys.

2158
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:58,280
So now we have talk.

2159
02:05:58,520 --> 02:05:59,760
We have generated a token.

2160
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:02,640
So now we have a mini
user in the system, right?

2161
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:04,640
We have generated a token also.

2162
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:07,880
Now, whatever the operation
we are going to perform from here,

2163
02:06:08,040 --> 02:06:11,080
we will need this token
so that we can tell to our system

2164
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:14,240
that, hey, system, I'm an admin,
I haven't permission,

2165
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:18,360
this is the token accepted
and allow me to do whatever I want to do

2166
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:21,840
and what I'm going to do,
I'm going to perform great operations.

2167
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:28,080
I'm going to perform great operations
categories.

2168
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:32,760
Correct.

2169
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:35,920
Like I hope your days
that you guys are not getting bored now.

2170
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:36,840
Great.

2171
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:40,920
I see your lot of previous stations and
you guys are not responding deductively.

2172
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,440
I can totally understand that.

2173
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:44,360
What is the reason?

2174
02:06:44,360 --> 02:06:50,080
That's why I changed this technique
and in the match it ended point of time

2175
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,040
in our operations we open for hug.

2176
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:56,280
If it is a stateless application.

2177
02:06:56,280 --> 02:07:00,120
No, we have to have this particular find.

2178
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:01,400
Look to

2179
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:05,640
find this.

2180
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:10,000
So now, now let's do first operation
with the help of token.

2181
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,480
What is that operation?

2182
02:07:13,480 --> 02:07:16,640
From this kind of paradigm,
we created something great.

2183
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:20,880
So let's take an example for any

2184
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:26,520
adding an employ into this.

2185
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:29,800
I'm going to create a new employee
in their data.

2186
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:32,960
So how can an employee all normal users

2187
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:35,760
going to deploy no on only enemy, right.

2188
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:41,200
So now now tell me to add a new employee
in their database.

2189
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:44,400
What is the first thing I need

2190
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:46,120
one way

2191
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:49,680
to create user
would you need for general Token Now

2192
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:55,280
I don't want you to see your
all swagger document, but still instead of

2193
02:07:55,280 --> 02:08:00,000
don't use your common sense logging,
there is no log in raid.

2194
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:01,640
We had a procurement appearing.

2195
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:04,840
Now we are not performing
any building forced.

2196
02:08:04,840 --> 02:08:06,760
We need bees. You are right

2197
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:08,240
guys.

2198
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:09,080
Come on.

2199
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:12,000
We need a basic. You want a

2200
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:20,160
This is the very first thing I need
is this in base You what I am

2201
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:21,560
what I need

2202
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:24,840
base.

2203
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:25,920
You are in

2204
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:29,760
plus API location

2205
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:32,080
plus and important

2206
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:38,080
plus end point correct

2207
02:08:43,200 --> 02:08:45,960
base you are only plus API location
plus endpoint.

2208
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:47,680
Then what is the next thing?

2209
02:08:47,680 --> 02:08:50,640
I guys after we ask you what I

2210
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:52,880
this part

2211
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:55,880
is common to everywhere
because the same database

2212
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:59,600
but this part is changing
according to the operation we are making.

2213
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:00,840
So for create user,

2214
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:04,720
it was different ordinary token
it was different now for ending it.

2215
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:06,800
A Right, it is different. Okay.

2216
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,800
And the next thing I need is mine is mine.

2217
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:14,400
The node payload simply means body, right?

2218
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:18,360
What what, what are the parameters
I need in the body?

2219
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:21,120
Who is going to give me this information?

2220
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:24,160
Okay, tell me this.

2221
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:28,320
What are the things I should put in
the body I can get that information from.

2222
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:30,400
From swagger,

2223
02:09:31,680 --> 02:09:33,760
from Slick

2224
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,240
Connect.

2225
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:40,640
After this.

2226
02:09:40,640 --> 02:09:43,040
After this. We need

2227
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:45,600
we need headers

2228
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:47,400
here.

2229
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:51,200
Here we need first content

2230
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:56,240
applications like JSON or whatever.

2231
02:09:56,240 --> 02:09:59,840
Right?

2232
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:00,680
Then.

2233
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,400
Then we need another thing.

2234
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,720
Then we need another thing.

2235
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:07,360
That is my method,
which meant that I'm going to use.

2236
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:11,400
So which method have to use instead?

2237
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:12,120
Okay.

2238
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:14,160
What is the reason behind this? Why?

2239
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:15,480
Why I want to use Boost?

2240
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:18,520
Why not other?

2241
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:21,960
Because we are creating. Exactly, exactly.

2242
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:25,560
We are going to add a new record
in the database

2243
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:30,800
to add a new record in the database
we have to use all method.

2244
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:33,120
We have to use boost method. Right?

2245
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:37,440
So all this information we need to create,
let's collect all this information.

2246
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:41,960
So first first let me go here.

2247
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:43,920
We add a new request.

2248
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:47,200
So to add a new request from here,
I add a new request case,

2249
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:49,680
but I should go

2250
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:54,120
click on this three buttons,
then click on add request,

2251
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:57,560
then give the name, create

2252
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:01,720
and create and employ raid.

2253
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:03,640
Create an employ.

2254
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:06,400
Correct.

2255
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:08,000
Now let's follow swagger.

2256
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,480
What can we begin

2257
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,600
so going see for creating the employee?

2258
02:11:13,200 --> 02:11:15,280
This is the one.

2259
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:20,760
This is the one first why
I am telling you to create the employee

2260
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:25,080
Because after creating
the employee will add a record rate.

2261
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:29,280
It means violating the record,
creating an employee, and after they will

2262
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:31,320
big, big venue

2263
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:33,800
will receive this information,

2264
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:36,840
will get this information,
will the information

2265
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:41,760
and after retrieving the information,
will play with it, will update it.

2266
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:42,600
We delete it.

2267
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:45,520
And then whatever the operations
we want to do, we can do that.

2268
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:46,960
It's the main reason.

2269
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:49,640
First,
we are adding a record and the store

2270
02:12:01,440 --> 02:12:05,280
makes getting my point

2271
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:07,160
swing.

2272
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:21,160
So let's take this now.

2273
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:26,800
Let's take the let's take the end point
from here to make it complete.

2274
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:30,000
So I'm picking this end point
also adding it here.

2275
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:32,200
I got to complete this.

2276
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:34,880
You are categorized

2277
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:35,680
complete based.

2278
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:39,960
You are going to be gone and then we are
going to select post from here.

2279
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:43,520
We are going to select post from here.

2280
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:48,480
Now see, it says Body required.

2281
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:50,240
It means body is a mandatory part.

2282
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:51,840
And we finished this one more.

2283
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:55,560
The link for this site.

2284
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:59,320
For swagger you need a

2285
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:05,920
there you go.

2286
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:07,200
I think he shared this.

2287
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:14,880
Alex, can you please check?

2288
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:18,360
So now you'll see in this body
what are the things we see guys

2289
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:20,760
guys in the body.

2290
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:22,000
You see all of this information?

2291
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,720
Students.

2292
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:26,160
Students.

2293
02:13:26,160 --> 02:13:29,000
Just copy this body from the

2294
02:13:29,880 --> 02:13:31,920
Just copy this body from here.

2295
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,200
And where should I post to this body?

2296
02:13:34,240 --> 02:13:35,120
Then we

2297
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:48,120
select the raw.

2298
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:52,040
Just the body, which all

2299
02:13:53,960 --> 02:13:55,160
Jason

2300
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,320
is Twitter.

2301
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:01,200
So now see implied force name.

2302
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:04,160
I'm going to provide the
we have to create a header again

2303
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:06,600
even though when you copy and the header

2304
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:11,480
compared with the header creative
said yes, I'm expanding this range

2305
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:15,960
so that these items are hidden
and providing this simple header

2306
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:18,600
which can be which we can show,
which we can see.

2307
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:19,800
Right.

2308
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:21,920
So even if you create, it's not an issue.

2309
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:26,120
So it's good practice basically
to create headers to maintain those fonts.

2310
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:27,160
Alright,

2311
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:35,680
alright.

2312
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:39,560
So now in first name, great hostname I'm

2313
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:43,800
going to take, give me a nice

2314
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:50,360
then the last name is

2315
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:59,600
you'll get the money, you're gonna

2316
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:06,240
find. Yes.

2317
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:14,240
Yes, yes that is correct.

2318
02:15:14,240 --> 02:15:15,880
Not a nice name yet.

2319
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:17,400
The one that I know every time.

2320
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,600
I can't make everyone happy, you know.

2321
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:22,520
Okay so the expert leaving

2322
02:15:23,680 --> 02:15:27,880
little bit to meet the.

2323
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:32,080
All right so let's take next name is yours
so they live

2324
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:33,240
would be

2325
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:46,040
all going now school another

2326
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:50,040
buying.

2327
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:52,800
No no

2328
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:55,080
I got I got confused here

2329
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:57,840
inter aim for male and F for female.

2330
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:00,000
So now what should I put.

2331
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,440
So let me put here F right.

2332
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:06,440
Employ gender is F

2333
02:16:06,440 --> 02:16:10,720
and now here I'm going to provide I'm
going to provide here

2334
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:12,520
the employee would be.

2335
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:16,440
So it'll be 2000 and late

2336
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:19,240
17th of February 17th

2337
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:23,480
February
or 18th of February 2000 and employ is

2338
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:28,040
status
is employee right and providing employee

2339
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:32,920
and here I'm going to provide
this data is cloud consent

2340
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:42,840
now 21 years old employee Ellen

2341
02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:47,440
child labor law

2342
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:52,480
that's why I just read about it
so I need to know right now.

2343
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:56,840
See 21 or 22, just 20 to do this back.

2344
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:00,920
If someone doesn't remember little name,
can we leave it as it is?

2345
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:02,640
Yes, we can leave it as it is.

2346
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:04,760
No insurance.

2347
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:09,920
We can play with any you know, we it now.

2348
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:10,920
We'll see you guys.

2349
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:13,120
Even if I'm providing this boss name,
last name.

2350
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:15,240
Really rate everything.

2351
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:17,520
Who's providing this data?

2352
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:18,240
It's you.

2353
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:22,280
When you enter your Euroleague,
sign up for free and you provide for us.

2354
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:24,640
Then we didn't name last everything.

2355
02:17:24,640 --> 02:17:26,400
You provide data from UAE.

2356
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,800
That's
how things are getting stored there.

2357
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:34,640
So things are getting stored in the store
despite everyone.

2358
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:37,960
Everyone around us
put the spark right now.

2359
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:38,880
What is the next thing

2360
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,280
after this?

2361
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:42,440
What is the next thing?

2362
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:43,560
We have to look

2363
02:17:48,480 --> 02:17:53,400
saying, Come on guys,
first we have to add header here.

2364
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:55,840
Behind that is my

2365
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:57,880
content type

2366
02:17:57,880 --> 02:18:00,920
and the venue is application slash.

2367
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:03,600
Jason Right, Application slash.

2368
02:18:03,600 --> 02:18:06,240
Jason Right now.

2369
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:09,600
Now I told you one more thing
after adding header.

2370
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:10,720
So far so good.

2371
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:12,560
Everything we have ID based

2372
02:18:12,560 --> 02:18:16,680
you are right the method, the body,
the haters and single thing.

2373
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:18,640
But still one thing is pending.

2374
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:23,280
What is that token that we generated?

2375
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:24,720
Token that we generated?

2376
02:18:24,720 --> 02:18:29,040
And now what is the reason that we have to
update token every single time?

2377
02:18:29,240 --> 02:18:32,640
Because
I'm going to play with the database.

2378
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:36,080
I'm look, I'm going to claim
in the database the database

2379
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:40,920
I am allowed to perform
this particular operation in the database.

2380
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:43,920
So database is not to trust on this point.

2381
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:47,720
What I'm saying database is going to ask,
do you have any proof?

2382
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:49,560
So I will provide the token.

2383
02:18:49,560 --> 02:18:51,480
There you go. This is the proof I have.

2384
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:55,760
I got access from your database and I can
do whatever the operation I want to do.

2385
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,080
So authentication
authorization is being done via

2386
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:03,240
via your token.

2387
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:05,000
Via your token.

2388
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,360
Remember, guys, remember,
this is a stateless application

2389
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:10,880
and it is the stateless application.

2390
02:19:11,040 --> 02:19:13,240
We always deal with token stored

2391
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:15,760
in a stored.

2392
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:18,920
So now now see here authorization.

2393
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:22,320
Did you see when debit authorization

2394
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:24,040
and everyone said

2395
02:19:26,520 --> 02:19:29,680
select this authorization, select
this authorization

2396
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:33,680
that and here from the dropdown
which token

2397
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:35,920
we are going to use those

2398
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,080
we had a token raid.

2399
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:48,880
So simply select beta from here,
simply select the beta from here.

2400
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:53,600
And then this is the token
trying to force to delete this token

2401
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:55,920
deleted.

2402
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:57,560
Make it empty.

2403
02:19:57,560 --> 02:20:01,000
Now go where you have generated the token,

2404
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:05,640
where you have generated the token
and copied it from there.

2405
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:09,600
Copy the token that you have generated
recently

2406
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:13,240
because this token
is saving the expiry time for dwellers.

2407
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:17,400
So still, still this token is valid
because we just generated

2408
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:20,840
what is it, time of demolition everyday
you then go

2409
02:20:20,840 --> 02:20:25,160
and to create an employ
go and to create employ here.

2410
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:25,520
Right?

2411
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:28,840
Going to create an employment
based nor double course

2412
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:33,320
double quotes is available here
because that data is coming in decent.

2413
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:36,160
What we do see it is in decent forward
suggestion.

2414
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:38,320
Just I just give a look.
So this is the key.

2415
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:39,680
This is the value, right?

2416
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:41,400
So really comes in double codes.

2417
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:47,040
But when you're copying this right, don't
copy cause just basic raw value here.

2418
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:49,320
So this is the value of bitcoin.

2419
02:20:49,320 --> 02:20:51,760
This is the value required for industrial.

2420
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:52,560
At this point, everyone

2421
02:20:58,480 --> 02:21:01,000
understood this point, everyone

2422
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:14,200
try. Shall we

2423
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:20,520
proceed further now?

2424
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:27,600
Anything else
pending or everything completed this?

2425
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:30,600
Is there anything which is pending
or everything is completed?

2426
02:21:31,720 --> 02:21:33,160
Everything is completed.

2427
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:35,840
Correct? Correct.

2428
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:37,800
It's okay.

2429
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:39,120
Fine.

2430
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:40,440
Let's send it

2431
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:46,600
guys.

2432
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:49,080
What is the expected response API code?

2433
02:21:49,080 --> 02:22:09,080
I should go here.

2434
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:10,880
What I got is

2435
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:21,600
201201 created.

2436
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:24,200
Is this the correct one
that I was expecting?

2437
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:27,840
See just the most forward
to this particular status code

2438
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,680
and it says that request
has been fulfilled

2439
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:34,320
and it resulted in a new resource
being created

2440
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:36,400
right.

2441
02:22:36,400 --> 02:22:40,760
And now if you observe closely
in the body of the response,

2442
02:22:40,960 --> 02:22:44,600
you got the date of the employee
along with one additional field.

2443
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:46,800
What is that additional

2444
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:52,080
employ 80,

2445
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:53,520
employ 80.

2446
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:58,040
So this is the unique part
in that database or this particular

2447
02:22:59,160 --> 02:22:59,520
this is

2448
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:03,240
the unique part in the database
for this particular employee

2449
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:06,440
right there displayed
we all visit employ 80

2450
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:09,320
and whenever you work
with multinational organization

2451
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:13,440
there they ask you can we take
you actually make you actually create.

2452
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:17,920
So we got this data from the database,

2453
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:21,480
we got the I.D.,
we got the message to zero one we created.

2454
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:22,360
Right?

2455
02:23:22,360 --> 02:23:24,480
So a whole other way.

2456
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:26,480
You have to check this been me.

2457
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:28,680
It's everything is crystal clear. Jamie,

2458
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:32,720
is there anyone with any note,
whether their data is created

2459
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:36,840
or because we go to the employee
double check by using you?

2460
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:41,080
You know, so remember, one thing wouldn't
clear anything right from here

2461
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:41,880
to let you work.

2462
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:45,040
So even if you try to log in
with this admin credentials,

2463
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:48,520
create the one which we created
in your try to provide log in there.

2464
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:52,520
You would not get the data
because if you do trust or will respond,

2465
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:56,800
that means it is passed right when?

2466
02:23:56,800 --> 02:24:01,120
You test differently from the post
when only we will check whether we have

2467
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:02,600
this information in their database.

2468
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:07,080
So we will check that
this is what we call retrieval operation.

2469
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:11,280
Yes, actually it is the same way
how to create

2470
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:18,000
so we can use this credential.

2471
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,280
You mean index?

2472
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:21,840
Why would the logic work?

2473
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:25,240
Simon, You are asking from your way

2474
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:29,720
because we intentionally not the way

2475
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:32,320
did this linking to this API
what you want.

2476
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:33,880
That's why

2477
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:38,000
the user that you're creating in the API,
it will be as it is in the API.

2478
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:39,840
We provided

2479
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:42,200
specific details, the specific

2480
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:44,280
linking with the you way we knew it

2481
02:24:45,160 --> 02:24:49,320
experience when you know the way to create
log intelligence here for the enemy

2482
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:53,760
and they will use it intelligence in you
and they will do whatever operations.

2483
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:57,040
And if they have any argument in the class
with someone,

2484
02:24:57,400 --> 02:25:00,000
where does the UI verify
from the database?

2485
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:04,320
Yes, I'm getting a UI benefit
from their database

2486
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:07,600
cutting, but it's all about
you always limited the access, right?

2487
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:09,040
You always do with the emphasis

2488
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:12,320
in the end.

2489
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:14,400
So maybe I missed the question.

2490
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:18,040
Well, do we need to clear the things
from Postman Mustafa?

2491
02:25:18,040 --> 02:25:23,920
Do we have any other options?

2492
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:30,360
And then simple.

2493
02:25:30,360 --> 02:25:34,840
Okay, we have see,
Postman is basically an API

2494
02:25:34,840 --> 02:25:38,000
to write to, even to work with the

2495
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:41,160
I mean for what purpose. Up.

2496
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:42,520
That's, that's what I'm saying.

2497
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:45,720
See your selenium is available,

2498
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:49,680
your website is available,
your database is available right now.

2499
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:55,360
Who is creating the connection in between
your website and your database API.

2500
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:56,600
Right.

2501
02:25:56,600 --> 02:26:00,040
So API is sponsoring the reader correctly
or yeah.

2502
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:02,400
Who is providing the data API.

2503
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:06,400
So whether API is providing their data
in the correct connection

2504
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:09,680
name is working
properly, not be able to take this or not.

2505
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:11,720
We have to check this. Right.

2506
02:26:11,720 --> 02:26:15,080
So from UI, can we just API? No. Why?

2507
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:18,960
Because then that would be your selenium
testing, your whitelisting

2508
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:21,000
and rejected from the database.

2509
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,760
No. Otherwise
that would be your database testing.

2510
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:26,760
Then what is the be
the way is to test something

2511
02:26:26,800 --> 02:26:30,520
the middle way grade
and to test something in the middle way.

2512
02:26:30,520 --> 02:26:34,320
We do not have any UI available,
so if you do not have any UI available,

2513
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:35,600
we would make trouble.

2514
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:37,880
We will not be able to perform
in existing.

2515
02:26:37,880 --> 02:26:41,840
That's why we need one tool
that will ask us to provide this thing.

2516
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,160
This is UI for us.

2517
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:46,320
This UI is for our help.

2518
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:48,200
Right. Be happy.

2519
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:50,280
Honestly, it was risky in the market.

2520
02:26:50,280 --> 02:26:52,480
If you don't want to use postman,
use the RC.

2521
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,360
We have Tosca.

2522
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:56,600
If you don't want to use this, use Tosca.

2523
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,440
We have soap. You don't.

2524
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:00,680
If you don't
want to use this useful point,

2525
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:05,000
if you have not all of these things,
this is free of course, but use this one.

2526
02:27:05,160 --> 02:27:10,240
That's why people in industry
use postman a lot.

2527
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:13,560
This is the purpose to take the connection
that has been established.

2528
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:15,680
When we thank you so much.

2529
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:17,760
I am just great, sir.

2530
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:20,120
You're always welcome. I

2531
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:25,880
know there are a lot of books in this API.

2532
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:27,840
There are a lot of books in this API.

2533
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:30,400
But yes,
because we are generating the data,

2534
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:32,920
it will return the same use
of 80 employs 80.

2535
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:36,160
If we create a new data,
it will create new employee.

2536
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:37,920
Don't worry about that.

2537
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:39,280
Our books in the application.

2538
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:42,000
But the intention behind this
I repeat once we proceed further

2539
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:45,960
because we don't have to best only happy,
but we will see some books also,

2540
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:53,320
they don't want.

2541
02:27:53,320 --> 02:27:54,240
So far so good.

2542
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:55,160
Everyone

2543
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:02,040
there to encourage encouragement.

2544
02:28:02,040 --> 02:28:10,480
Nice and great.

2545
02:28:11,480 --> 02:28:14,760
So now, now see

2546
02:28:26,600 --> 02:28:30,120
my but in API you are beating sequel.

2547
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,840
Excellent and people are so smart.

2548
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:37,040
They used already
my sequel workbench in the followed

2549
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:39,120
that for employees
is having the same employee.

2550
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:42,960
Maybe they are not bothered about API
but what we are teaching yet

2551
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:43,920
and what we're learning in

2552
02:28:43,920 --> 02:28:47,120
the API delivered by a sequel,
we're committed for their sequel.

2553
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:50,160
But next,
what do you do in selenium classes?

2554
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:51,720
You perform Java.

2555
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:56,040
In Java Review, you will
you learn destiny and destiny.

2556
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:59,160
You think about sequel. They

2557
02:29:01,960 --> 02:29:02,440
don't do it.

2558
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:04,360
They don't do it.

2559
02:29:04,360 --> 02:29:08,120
The classes for 24 hours
after that you have 24 hours.

2560
02:29:08,120 --> 02:29:10,560
They then these things in those 20 hours.

2561
02:29:10,960 --> 02:29:11,640
Okay.

2562
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:12,120
Yeah.

2563
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:14,160
Just trying to learn connecting dots.

2564
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:15,800
Exactly.

2565
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:19,040
If the application is the instance Vega.

2566
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:23,360
Yes. If there is a token part,
then token parties or will always be in

2567
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:27,040
only stateless

2568
02:29:30,360 --> 02:29:31,440
custom bid.

2569
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:32,800
Send your query to Alexa.

2570
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:34,880
You also want to try

2571
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:37,920
Alexa,

2572
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:40,440
Should I open my
My sequel will be mentioned. You?

2573
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:43,480
No, not sorry I.

2574
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:44,920
I'm. I'm just kidding.

2575
02:29:44,920 --> 02:29:47,000
Doing. It's good, right?

2576
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:50,160
Okay. Right. Select star.

2577
02:29:50,160 --> 02:29:51,440
It wins from other people.

2578
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:55,520
Aside from one particular agent,
it just employ the database.

2579
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:55,800
Right?

2580
02:29:55,800 --> 02:29:57,880
And then you have to provide
a valid keyword

2581
02:29:57,880 --> 02:30:01,240
when you given on
what one particular keyword is employed.

2582
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:05,040
The employee can take proposal
to put in there and whether you'll get

2583
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:05,960
the option. Okay.

2584
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:13,320
But I don't know, I guess you guys do
because

2585
02:30:14,560 --> 02:30:17,040
it's suitable.

2586
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:20,680
So now, now understand this first,

2587
02:30:21,200 --> 02:30:23,800
first what we did was

2588
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:26,160
first what we did created means that

2589
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:30,040
but with the help of this admin

2590
02:30:30,040 --> 02:30:32,920
user, with the help of this admins use it,

2591
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:39,200
we generated a token kind,
we generated the token.

2592
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:42,520
Now this is one cycle
that we have completed.

2593
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:46,800
This is one cycle
that we already completed.

2594
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:49,440
Does not expect expected to be enough
cycle.

2595
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:51,040
Please come back.

2596
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:52,000
It's enough

2597
02:30:54,120 --> 02:30:55,120
once to be submitted.

2598
02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:56,320
Your status

2599
02:30:59,160 --> 02:31:00,480
focus here something important.

2600
02:31:00,480 --> 02:31:02,720
I'm going to be excellent.

2601
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:07,440
So now this element in dendritic
token part, we are done with great.

2602
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:09,520
We are done with this part

2603
02:31:09,960 --> 02:31:13,840
now. Now what we did,
the first thing is we created

2604
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:16,880
we create an

2605
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:22,080
we create an employee, right?

2606
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:25,160
We create an employee

2607
02:31:25,160 --> 02:31:30,000
by now and mean
consider your current operations.

2608
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,240
You're working in the industry, right?

2609
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:37,200
And you are the first one who is going
to perform any test in the right.

2610
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:41,680
If you try to retrieve the information
without creating the employee,

2611
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:45,600
your DSW database
already already have nothing.

2612
02:31:45,600 --> 02:31:48,440
It would be divisive,
nothing. It has nothing.

2613
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:56,000
So with your retrieve,
operation will work.

2614
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,760
You are trying to update the data
in the database with your update operation

2615
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:09,360
Work eliminate your retrieve operation,
your update operation.

2616
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:12,560
And even if you tried
to delete the database

2617
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:15,280
but it work database will return.

2618
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:17,920
I don't have anything to delete.

2619
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:20,000
Right. Same. No.

2620
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:20,960
Right. Exactly.

2621
02:32:20,960 --> 02:32:22,160
You Could have used capital.

2622
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:24,400
Millions of. Okay.

2623
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:27,240
So it all depends from here.

2624
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:30,640
It all depends from here.

2625
02:32:30,640 --> 02:32:33,200
With this you don't create operations.

2626
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:36,840
Paused
We have to add a record in the database.

2627
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:40,440
So once we have something in the database,
we can either retrieve it

2628
02:32:40,760 --> 02:32:42,800
right TGT or delete it.

2629
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:43,880
Correct

2630
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:46,680
correctly days.

2631
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:50,800
That's
why intentionally to make the cycle work.

2632
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:56,160
First we created the input
plus to be known as the criminal logic.

2633
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:57,920
Why we did it

2634
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:07,800
gutting it
enables us to use remaining methods.

2635
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:11,760
So after this what we will do, we will get

2636
02:33:12,760 --> 02:33:13,600
this created.

2637
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:20,440
Employ.

2638
02:33:20,440 --> 02:33:23,280
We will get this create an employee

2639
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:24,080
carrying

2640
02:33:27,800 --> 02:33:29,880
activities
that will get this created employment.

2641
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:34,320
And then after this,

2642
02:33:34,680 --> 02:33:37,320
after creating this data,

2643
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:40,520
we will update will update this employment

2644
02:33:44,160 --> 02:33:45,280
rate based.

2645
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:48,160
We will update the employee content

2646
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:54,720
after updating the part will get updated.

2647
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:57,240
What is the reason behind this
why we are doing this?

2648
02:33:58,120 --> 02:34:00,960
First, we are creating the employee way
of getting the employee.

2649
02:34:01,160 --> 02:34:02,880
Then we are updating the employee data.

2650
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,680
We are getting the completed employment.

2651
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:06,000
What is the reason behind this

2652
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:10,640
One guy is

2653
02:34:11,360 --> 02:34:13,920
to check whether that same information

2654
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:17,760
has been updated
against that particular employee.

2655
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:24,960
Not or not understood.

2656
02:34:24,960 --> 02:34:25,840
Understood.

2657
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:28,720
And then then we have another information.

2658
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:32,960
See, did I do is to update any employee

2659
02:34:33,040 --> 02:34:34,480
how many was

2660
02:34:36,200 --> 02:34:37,960
how many ways to do it?

2661
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:41,520
First, either
I should update all the information,

2662
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:45,560
post them with a name, last name,
gender, date of birth, employment

2663
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:48,200
status, employment category, job title

2664
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:51,760
everything, object all information.

2665
02:34:52,240 --> 02:34:55,600
Or I can do another to keep false name
brand name last

2666
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:56,880
name as it is just changed.

2667
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:59,040
You don't work, just change update it.

2668
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:02,120
It means update

2669
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:06,720
on issue details of employment,
partially update

2670
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:11,160
employment current
and then get their details.

2671
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:16,480
Get their details of
it right so do is to update

2672
02:35:17,640 --> 02:35:19,520
do is to update first fully

2673
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:23,440
update second
is partially of good correct? Yes.

2674
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:26,040
Correct. Correct.

2675
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:26,800
Correct.

2676
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:30,880
I'll come to that window
and then we will do

2677
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:34,800
delete the employee.

2678
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:38,560
We will do delete the employer
and then we'll see employee gets deleted.

2679
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:41,400
So we try to access the information
from the database.

2680
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:42,720
Database will return.

2681
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:45,200
There is no found against this employee.

2682
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:49,440
It means employee
has been deleted from the database.

2683
02:35:49,440 --> 02:35:51,560
Employee has been deleted from that.

2684
02:35:51,560 --> 02:35:54,240
It is correct.

2685
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,840
That is correct.

2686
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:57,240
Create update.

2687
02:35:57,240 --> 02:35:58,880
Update partial delete.

2688
02:35:58,880 --> 02:36:01,160
Get information we are doing already here.

2689
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:05,400
Right all the great operations
now we are in this.

2690
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:10,200
Creating an employee enables us to perform
all the other operation,

2691
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:13,960
getting the information, deleting
the information, updating the information.

2692
02:36:13,960 --> 02:36:16,680
It is only update
partially updating the information.

2693
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:34,560
All these things is ending.

2694
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:38,040
So we use a big gizmo, we use talking.

2695
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:41,200
I think they use you don't
we don't see everything.

2696
02:36:41,240 --> 02:36:44,320
You programed it
if you just created an employee, right.

2697
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:48,040
Let this employee survey images
for one or two days

2698
02:36:48,240 --> 02:36:51,800
and then we will update its information
right.

2699
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:53,880
Don't be so harshly that newly created

2700
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:56,640
by would not pitch.

2701
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:57,560
Look what I would tell you.

2702
02:36:57,560 --> 02:37:00,720
The difference would been, wouldn't that

2703
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:02,560
great?

2704
02:37:06,760 --> 02:37:09,360
I will give you the difference
and we can put it back right now.

2705
02:37:09,560 --> 02:37:14,160
Let's stick to the gig and then we'll see
what and then we'll see which.

2706
02:37:14,400 --> 02:37:16,920
Okay.

2707
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:19,200
And then
and then a lot of other operations.

2708
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:23,640
For example, what about the users
I have in the database because I know

2709
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:26,760
people are
people will definitely apply this trick.

2710
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:29,000
They will use this to me.

2711
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:32,240
They will create hundreds of employees,
none of job everything.

2712
02:37:32,440 --> 02:37:36,360
So we'll see, get all employees,
whatever the employees we have,

2713
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:41,360
it will perform this data to an operation
because we have these links.

2714
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,440
Get all employees.

2715
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:45,600
They will see that after this.

2716
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:48,120
And we'll see get job right

2717
02:37:48,360 --> 02:37:51,000
for all the employees,
all the job titles available there.

2718
02:37:51,480 --> 02:37:56,400
And then we will see get employment
status, all the employee status.

2719
02:37:56,400 --> 02:38:00,520
These all are the things we will look
at this all are the things that we look at

2720
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:02,200
going to

2721
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:04,840
categorize

2722
02:38:13,080 --> 02:38:21,320
purpose.

2723
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:23,880
I thought we doing all of those today.

2724
02:38:23,880 --> 02:38:27,320
Yes, we are going to do all of those. But

2725
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:35,040
Google, we got a way to do all of those.

2726
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:37,080
But don't do the

2727
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:41,000
but what made you think mistake?

2728
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:43,560
We are not going to perform
all this today.

2729
02:38:43,560 --> 02:38:45,240
What made you think this?

2730
02:38:45,240 --> 02:38:49,880
I'm still here with you based.

2731
02:38:49,880 --> 02:38:54,840
You wanted to know why would I bounce?

2732
02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:58,240
No mark at all.

2733
02:38:58,240 --> 02:39:00,560
Fine. Right?

2734
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:05,080
If I bones break,
you guys will become 4 to 1 in individual.

2735
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:09,800
I or goodie

2736
02:39:15,120 --> 02:39:22,480
or great.

2737
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:23,040
You got it.

2738
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:31,480
And then you got it.

2739
02:39:31,480 --> 02:39:34,080
Actually,
what what is happening is here late of

2740
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:37,960
what is happening here.

2741
02:39:37,960 --> 02:39:40,440
I'm going to cover
every single point. Right.

2742
02:39:40,720 --> 02:39:45,200
But first, it is important
that I should give you the proper outline

2743
02:39:45,480 --> 02:39:49,000
that these are the things
we are going to cover right now.

2744
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:52,640
The moment basic we are going to cover
all these points, right, is

2745
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:54,040
going to stick it in and we

2746
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:55,560
think

2747
02:39:56,400 --> 02:39:59,000
this much information in one day know

2748
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:03,280
people get frustrated
with the hook one by one.

2749
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:07,360
I think it's just we didn't get employed
in that in the response.

2750
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:09,000
Yes, that I know.

2751
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:13,400
I know that
I know that nobody is is something.

2752
02:40:13,400 --> 02:40:13,600
Right.

2753
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:16,760
I'm telling you, these are intentional
books available in the API.

2754
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:23,080
Okay.

2755
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:26,280
If we gave you rate,
if we give you only the happy box

2756
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:30,480
that everything is working absolutely
fine and, then you go into the industry

2757
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:33,440
and they're on your retail program
to get such kind of responses

2758
02:40:33,600 --> 02:40:35,840
and you'll think there'd be just
something else.

2759
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:38,480
Now here we are getting something else.

2760
02:40:38,480 --> 02:40:41,680
So first we have to check how to play
with this or defect.

2761
02:40:41,800 --> 02:40:42,960
eBay's

2762
02:40:44,920 --> 02:40:45,640
fine,

2763
02:40:46,440 --> 02:40:53,760
fine.

2764
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:55,480
Yeah, that's great.

2765
02:40:55,480 --> 02:40:56,800
That's great.

2766
02:40:57,040 --> 02:40:59,320
It's like more of a than Atlas.

2767
02:40:59,480 --> 02:41:03,120
Everyone is dancing,
laughing, sending horses,

2768
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:07,120
something that great.

2769
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:08,040
So now.

2770
02:41:08,040 --> 02:41:10,200
Now the next operation.

2771
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:11,240
The next operation.

2772
02:41:11,240 --> 02:41:16,720
You see, we created the employee according
to the topic, according to the page.

2773
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:19,320
What is the next thing we have? Google.
After creating the employee

2774
02:41:22,400 --> 02:41:24,960
would know first to get created, employee

2775
02:41:26,200 --> 02:41:29,920
first to get created employed urging

2776
02:41:30,160 --> 02:41:34,360
a Luna has seen it Katrina
to update for us to be able to check

2777
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:37,360
whether this particular employee exist
in the database or not.

2778
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:41,440
Rights of slaves get created
employee See here

2779
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:48,720
I believe I did it on

2780
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:53,160
it is no option to

2781
02:42:06,920 --> 02:42:11,040
see create employee
and then get create an employee, right?

2782
02:42:11,320 --> 02:42:14,080
So first we have to create
get to be created employee

2783
02:42:14,280 --> 02:42:19,320
and then we can think of operating
the employee, correct?

2784
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:21,600
Correct.

2785
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:23,800
So now, now let's come to this point

2786
02:42:26,440 --> 02:42:27,720
to get that created.

2787
02:42:27,720 --> 02:42:30,080
Employee
What is the first thing we need guys,

2788
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:34,320
come on screen
X to get the creation employee

2789
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:37,320
What is the posting need

2790
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:41,960
to base you on? I

2791
02:42:43,560 --> 02:42:46,000
basically want to create

2792
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:52,080
what it does take anything we need.

2793
02:42:52,080 --> 02:42:53,360
We need body.

2794
02:42:53,360 --> 02:42:54,120
Okay,

2795
02:42:54,760 --> 02:42:57,480
fine.

2796
02:42:57,480 --> 02:42:59,520
Now tell me why is when we need a body.

2797
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:03,960
We need body
when we have to add another base.

2798
02:43:03,960 --> 02:43:04,400
You are right.

2799
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:06,120
Means you are an

2800
02:43:06,400 --> 02:43:08,360
API location plus end point.

2801
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:12,280
So we got this to add
something in their database

2802
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:16,000
to create a recording their database,
we need body.

2803
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:20,280
So here, when we are going
to get some information from the database,

2804
02:43:20,520 --> 02:43:25,080
do I need to have a body?

2805
02:43:25,080 --> 02:43:26,160
That is their difference.

2806
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:28,560
Nobody. Right now.

2807
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:30,160
Let's go to Swagger.

2808
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:34,440
See, when I open the swagger,
it says, Get one employee days.

2809
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:47,240
We are going to get all the employees
or just one employee.

2810
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:49,400
Just one employee.

2811
02:43:50,080 --> 02:43:51,240
So fine,

2812
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:54,400
open this bar, open this part.

2813
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:56,160
See It says

2814
02:43:58,640 --> 02:43:59,840
query.

2815
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:02,160
This is not the body. Like
we forget the difference.

2816
02:44:02,160 --> 02:44:05,280
This is the body. You see,
This is the body.

2817
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:08,760
And here it says, is tranquility.

2818
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:10,840
Understood the difference.

2819
02:44:10,840 --> 02:44:12,920
This is a barometer.

2820
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:14,640
What kind of barometer?

2821
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:16,000
Query. Barometer.

2822
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,520
So now, now we query barometer.

2823
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:20,440
Why any barometer?

2824
02:44:20,440 --> 02:44:23,600
What I need, I need employee I.D..

2825
02:44:24,160 --> 02:44:26,640
I need employee 80.

2826
02:44:26,640 --> 02:44:29,400
If you go in, create employee,

2827
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:32,720
it will say, can you see employee I.D.?

2828
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:37,320
This is the same employee
and see this a screen and this is strip.

2829
02:44:37,320 --> 02:44:39,800
See him or not see him or not.

2830
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:44,200
Right now
the question is, do you have to create

2831
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:47,040
a request all the time, make up and create
inappropriate.

2832
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:49,920
You can just add
this is the best practice.

2833
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:51,160
Do we just to cross-check?

2834
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:52,920
Just to cross-check?

2835
02:44:52,920 --> 02:44:54,920
If you don't want to do it, that's fine.

2836
02:44:54,920 --> 02:44:56,560
If it is working fine, no issues,

2837
02:44:56,560 --> 02:45:00,640
but if it's not working fine,
then you are the one to blame, right?

2838
02:45:00,640 --> 02:45:04,360
Your managers will ask you,
did you check after adding the employee

2839
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:07,560
that it was the right?

2840
02:45:07,560 --> 02:45:10,920
So just to keep us safe,
it's better to run one more

2841
02:45:11,440 --> 02:45:14,000
on which time it takes
just based in seconds.

2842
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:14,800
Right.

2843
02:45:14,800 --> 02:45:20,760
But it can save up from.

2844
02:45:20,760 --> 02:45:21,200
Right?

2845
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:23,560
Actually, it happened in my organization.

2846
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:25,840
One of my members right.

2847
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:28,680
And she was doing this. I answered her.

2848
02:45:29,280 --> 02:45:31,280
He said that the retaining ability
to check.

2849
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:32,120
Yes, sir.

2850
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:34,800
Everything I checked,
I turned out to be ready for deployment

2851
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:37,760
and that because we are ready
to get more than ready.

2852
02:45:38,560 --> 02:45:40,320
That's what he is not confident.

2853
02:45:40,320 --> 02:45:41,920
She said, Yes, I'm confident in a way.

2854
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:45,040
But Hope was predicting deployment
does deals when they're on site with check

2855
02:45:45,280 --> 02:45:48,800
and before production deployment
I will check EPA once again.

2856
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:50,720
I point what he was doing.

2857
02:45:50,720 --> 02:45:52,800
She was just adding an employee.
She was not cheating.

2858
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:55,160
Not he employed a customer.

2859
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:57,720
Basically it was a transportation act.

2860
02:45:57,720 --> 02:46:00,480
So she was just keep adding
the new customer she was getting.

2861
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:04,480
But she didn't check whether the database
is responding correctly or not.

2862
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:07,160
EPA was responding
correctly or not. Great.

2863
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:09,040
So she was adding the order number.

2864
02:46:09,040 --> 02:46:12,200
She was getting the customer stock number,
she was getting the phone number

2865
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:14,440
in every single thing,
but she was not checking.

2866
02:46:14,720 --> 02:46:16,800
And we came to the opposite like 5 p.m.

2867
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:18,600
in the morning right? Right.

2868
02:46:18,600 --> 02:46:19,080
5 p.m.

2869
02:46:19,080 --> 02:46:22,480
in the morning is late,
almost evening, 730 in the US.

2870
02:46:22,920 --> 02:46:26,520
So basically from USA,
that is the best time to provide

2871
02:46:26,520 --> 02:46:30,560
the maintenance time so that even the
is down for two, three, 4 hours straight.

2872
02:46:30,840 --> 02:46:35,560
No is going to stick that much because
people are sleeping at the rate that's

2873
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:39,760
why we do have early morning deployment
from our late evening during US time.

2874
02:46:40,080 --> 02:46:40,400
Right.

2875
02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:42,040
I was

2876
02:46:42,040 --> 02:46:45,480
relying on
her because she was one of my superstars,

2877
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:48,520
my team and other team
members were also doing good.

2878
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:53,120
I went to Office Order team in the morning
by August to perform some API testing.

2879
02:46:53,360 --> 02:46:55,880
She performed.
I got the reports, I made it.

2880
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:58,280
I sent it to the list that get fine. Now.

2881
02:46:58,280 --> 02:47:00,360
These are the important features we have.

2882
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:02,080
These are the requisite features we have.

2883
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:05,280
We are done with all of these points
on the checkboxes I've checked.

2884
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:08,560
Go ahead and deploy
the moment we deploy in

2885
02:47:08,560 --> 02:47:12,240
both production deployment
testing a guy from our team only.

2886
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:14,720
Right. He found it.

2887
02:47:14,720 --> 02:47:18,240
So the data is not going to be of data
from the application.

2888
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:21,520
That is some issue with the API

2889
02:47:21,520 --> 02:47:23,360
on the production. It happened

2890
02:47:25,240 --> 02:47:28,920
so I should or should know when I used it.

2891
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:30,400
Here. I'm having my coffee.

2892
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:33,960
It's already early morning, 730
and I'm here till 430.

2893
02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:37,280
I think. Make one more coffee.

2894
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:38,680
I'm coming to get ready.

2895
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:42,040
Will meet this.

2896
02:47:42,040 --> 02:47:44,320
Then I went there

2897
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:47,240
and it was I think

2898
02:47:47,840 --> 02:47:49,960
I think it was Tuesday
morning or something

2899
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:53,040
and on Thursday she got the information

2900
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:54,240
that he

2901
02:47:56,200 --> 02:47:57,920
your project has changed.

2902
02:47:57,920 --> 02:47:59,760
You will be working a different project.

2903
02:47:59,760 --> 02:48:04,680
The normal part of this project.

2904
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:09,520
So I don't need it.

2905
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:13,560
I don't need it that this
I mean with my team members I need

2906
02:48:13,800 --> 02:48:16,720
if I'm asking them to come to my desk,

2907
02:48:16,720 --> 02:48:19,680
if I'm coming to your desk,
that is more than enough.

2908
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:21,600
This is more than formal working late

2909
02:48:25,440 --> 02:48:25,840
then.

2910
02:48:25,880 --> 02:48:28,320
So I'm only going to go 17 people
right now.

2911
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:29,720
Right.

2912
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:34,600
17 people in 2000, 20,
I fired 79 employees,

2913
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:39,080
79 calls I made to tell them that, hey,
this is the last day of your job.

2914
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:41,280
You will be on notice.

2915
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:42,920
You're serving for 15 this.

2916
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:44,480
That is normal to one.

2917
02:48:44,480 --> 02:48:46,680
So despite this, and then you'll be going.

2918
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:49,760
So just, you know, start
preparing for the interviews,

2919
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:54,320
look for other jobs.

2920
02:48:54,320 --> 02:48:54,640
Right?

2921
02:48:55,240 --> 02:48:56,800
Sometimes it's important every time.

2922
02:48:56,800 --> 02:49:00,720
You can't be nice to your employees,
otherwise they make you start taking it

2923
02:49:00,720 --> 02:49:01,680
for granted.

2924
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:04,680
You can't do it
in, not allow them to do it.

2925
02:49:04,680 --> 02:49:07,280
You should not actually, you are.

2926
02:49:07,280 --> 02:49:08,760
They're not doing the diligence.

2927
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:12,440
You are there to deliver the things
according to your customer satisfaction.

2928
02:49:12,440 --> 02:49:16,880
The customer is the one
who is going to pay you for the job.

2929
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:17,200
Right?

2930
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:19,680
So that's my here.

2931
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:21,040
I'm repeating proficient this.

2932
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:22,760
I'm being very nice to all the people.

2933
02:49:22,760 --> 02:49:26,640
It is my job because I want
people be ready for the market.

2934
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:29,480
But once you go into the job,
you will see this reality.

2935
02:49:30,120 --> 02:49:33,320
When your manager, your scrum master,
your product owner,

2936
02:49:33,440 --> 02:49:35,760
your even stakeholder
to be very strict, to

2937
02:49:39,960 --> 02:49:41,440
why would I make a bee,

2938
02:49:41,440 --> 02:49:49,320
why would I pay for the coffee?

2939
02:49:49,320 --> 02:49:51,840
There's no point.

2940
02:49:52,040 --> 02:49:54,920
There is no point to be the coffee.

2941
02:49:54,960 --> 02:49:56,640
Whenever it is, please

2942
02:49:56,640 --> 02:50:00,440
bring It is free In my office,
in my community, it's always free.

2943
02:50:00,680 --> 02:50:04,080
You can take in number of times is coffee

2944
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:07,200
and the soda and milk Any time.

2945
02:50:07,400 --> 02:50:09,080
If you want to take it for 15 times.

2946
02:50:09,080 --> 02:50:11,360
29 stinking. I used to get it.

2947
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:14,400
How many of you always want me to?

2948
02:50:14,400 --> 02:50:15,880
How many of you guys want one to?

2949
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:20,080
Everyone knows it gets

2950
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:25,040
one that is basically like chocolate
powder, right?

2951
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:26,160
Chocolate powder.

2952
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:28,880
To make your milk more tasty.

2953
02:50:29,080 --> 02:50:30,080
You just put it there.

2954
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:32,760
It has some nutrients. Drink.

2955
02:50:32,760 --> 02:50:35,280
You pay for coffee. No, I didn't.

2956
02:50:35,280 --> 02:50:36,240
I did.

2957
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:38,520
Yeah, correct. Correct.

2958
02:50:38,520 --> 02:50:40,720
You have got a chocolate
or the cocoa powder thing.

2959
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:45,120
So what I used to do when I use Goodwill
District, I used to carry a small box

2960
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:50,160
in my back having this one because milk,
I am going to get in my office.

2961
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:50,960
Okay.

2962
02:50:50,960 --> 02:50:52,080
I go there.

2963
02:50:52,080 --> 02:50:54,600
I take one milk of one big glass plate.

2964
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:57,480
I put my the get it for some time.

2965
02:50:57,960 --> 02:51:01,440
Drink, drinking, drinking
milk is, you know, healthy for you

2966
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:05,240
and your studio and the top
if you're taking it for free, be

2967
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:06,240
receiving it for free.

2968
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:09,680
You just have to buy your
the one with the powder.

2969
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:14,480
So that's what I used to do
when I was in the office.

2970
02:51:14,480 --> 02:51:20,080
There's work that is us.

2971
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:22,600
Okay. Okay. Got it.

2972
02:51:22,600 --> 02:51:25,200
All right, guys. So now, now, see,

2973
02:51:26,200 --> 02:51:27,920
here they.

2974
02:51:27,920 --> 02:51:33,480
We need to get one particular employee,
and every employee is associated.

2975
02:51:33,480 --> 02:51:34,640
The one employee,

2976
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:37,920
which is unique to a person,
which is unique to a guy, correct?

2977
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:40,440
Correct. So this should return.

2978
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:43,600
This is the expected functionality
from the API.

2979
02:51:43,880 --> 02:51:47,280
If I'm providing
what employee issued return their data

2980
02:51:47,280 --> 02:51:51,520
against that particular employee rate
against that particular employee.

2981
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:54,400
So now now see, I don't need body,

2982
02:51:55,080 --> 02:51:57,720
but I need a stream that is employed.

2983
02:51:57,720 --> 02:52:00,520
And so from there
I can give the employee D

2984
02:52:01,160 --> 02:52:04,160
And you bought
from creating that employee, right?

2985
02:52:04,160 --> 02:52:07,960
So just go here
and this part creating an employee part

2986
02:52:09,160 --> 02:52:11,320
copy this work important it

2987
02:52:11,440 --> 02:52:14,480
markets told me this is important
something great and now

2988
02:52:15,640 --> 02:52:18,000
oh come on
for us to be able to end the request

2989
02:52:18,520 --> 02:52:21,080
so let me add a new request for get

2990
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:25,200
one employee

2991
02:52:25,200 --> 02:52:28,280
correct get one employee in here.

2992
02:52:29,440 --> 02:52:32,400
I'm going to provide for

2993
02:52:35,120 --> 02:52:35,480
post.

2994
02:52:35,480 --> 02:52:38,000
I'm going to provide

2995
02:52:39,120 --> 02:52:40,680
this part.

2996
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:44,360
Then I'm going to provide

2997
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:46,720
this part.

2998
02:52:47,480 --> 02:52:51,640
And then then you'll see here, right here.

2999
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:54,880
Bannon's I got so in

3000
02:52:55,360 --> 02:52:58,280
it is asking parameters
for query parameter.

3001
02:52:59,120 --> 02:53:02,040
It is asking for one guy is

3002
02:53:02,840 --> 02:53:04,080
query barometer.

3003
02:53:04,080 --> 02:53:07,320
Can you see everyone?

3004
02:53:07,320 --> 02:53:08,600
Students

3005
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:14,160
query better with the rate.

3006
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:19,280
So just tell me in this query perimeter
key and value it is asking.

3007
02:53:19,280 --> 02:53:21,600
So this key and value is what?

3008
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:23,560
What is key
and what is benefiting from here?

3009
02:53:23,560 --> 02:53:31,600
And do I need to provide any JSON or no?

3010
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:35,920
No, because it is no more disclosures
and for me it is simply a query parameter

3011
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:37,120
that I need to pass.

3012
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:39,000
So what is the query barometer?

3013
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,160
The first is employ 80.

3014
02:53:41,720 --> 02:53:44,240
This employee 80 is the G fine.

3015
02:53:44,440 --> 02:53:45,960
So I'm putting it here in the key

3016
02:53:49,080 --> 02:53:52,080
and then then it is asking for value.

3017
02:53:52,320 --> 02:53:52,800
Fine.

3018
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:55,680
So see, I'm
going to take this value from here.

3019
02:53:56,560 --> 02:54:01,440
Copy.

3020
02:54:01,440 --> 02:54:06,240
Now, now, if you observe one thing, my
you are going to changed

3021
02:54:07,560 --> 02:54:09,440
C check

3022
02:54:12,720 --> 02:54:15,120
it, you observe are you are least changed.

3023
02:54:15,480 --> 02:54:18,280
And now after this question mark

3024
02:54:19,640 --> 02:54:21,200
after this question mark.

3025
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:23,160
I got this I.D.

3026
02:54:23,160 --> 02:54:27,600
I got this value, key and value
after the question mark,

3027
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:33,520
what is this question one
Then also, I will explain it also.

3028
02:54:33,520 --> 02:54:36,280
I will explain I will explain
every single thing to you guys.

3029
02:54:37,840 --> 02:54:39,200
Now. Now this.

3030
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:41,840
You are
it is fine because you want to explain.

3031
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:44,440
Adding the parameters is fine.

3032
02:54:44,440 --> 02:54:47,400
Selecting
the method is great for you to select.

3033
02:54:47,400 --> 02:54:52,720
Get my by because we are going date
be created employee from the database.

3034
02:54:53,800 --> 02:54:56,680
We are going to get that created a break
from their database.

3035
02:54:56,680 --> 02:54:59,280
That's why we are using
get method with this

3036
02:54:59,280 --> 02:55:02,200
you are in with this key
in the new beer trade.

3037
02:55:02,440 --> 02:55:05,280
We don't need body,
we need to add headers.

3038
02:55:05,640 --> 02:55:08,280
We didn't. We need to deadhead it here.

3039
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:10,440
One header we are going add. Right.

3040
02:55:10,560 --> 02:55:11,920
What does that header contain?

3041
02:55:11,920 --> 02:55:16,600
They seem a similar number
when simply do so.

3042
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:19,760
Now see that is dead
We what is header weird

3043
02:55:20,560 --> 02:55:23,040
exactly
when I am here in my previous days.

3044
02:55:24,360 --> 02:55:27,640
Till the time you get your job offer,
I will be with you.

3045
02:55:27,880 --> 02:55:30,360
I told you this so. Don't do it in media.

3046
02:55:30,520 --> 02:55:32,560
Which had to be a big

3047
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:37,680
student

3048
02:55:42,520 --> 02:55:44,040
content. But

3049
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:48,600
application slash just separate.

3050
02:55:49,400 --> 02:55:50,040
Right.

3051
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:51,920
Another thing we have to add.

3052
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:52,600
What is that?

3053
02:55:52,600 --> 02:55:57,080
I told you from now onwards the operation
we are going to perform.

3054
02:55:57,080 --> 02:56:00,600
We will perform
all those operation using token.

3055
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:02,640
So how do I do?

3056
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:03,240
Good.

3057
02:56:04,080 --> 02:56:09,120
Come on, students, how do I token going
to authorization part from here?

3058
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:10,720
Be able to select

3059
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:15,240
beer token
and here I am to provide my token.

3060
02:56:15,360 --> 02:56:18,200
So the token available here on the site

3061
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:22,920
is to complete
this token is to copy this token

3062
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:26,160
go here and then simply pasted

3063
02:56:27,840 --> 02:56:29,640
simply this to

3064
02:56:31,320 --> 02:56:33,840
so far any question

3065
02:56:39,960 --> 02:56:42,360
so far so what everyone

3066
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:54,240
nice.

3067
02:56:54,240 --> 02:56:58,080
Let's send this information

3068
02:57:01,400 --> 02:57:03,400
now. See, guys, we got the data.

3069
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:08,280
We got the data usually on
we only spent and we just not body.

3070
02:57:08,520 --> 02:57:11,880
Yes not usually every time every time

3071
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:15,400
engagement there
we only use parameters not body.

3072
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:19,920
And there is a reason behind this
because while fetching the mission,

3073
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:22,720
retrieving the information
from their database,

3074
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:25,760
we have been what information I need

3075
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:30,120
so which information I need need
permission of one particular employee.

3076
02:57:30,280 --> 02:57:30,760
Right.

3077
02:57:30,760 --> 02:57:33,280
So I need to provide this query barometer

3078
02:57:33,720 --> 02:57:37,680
because this is my query,
but I don't want to add a recorded.

3079
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:38,920
The data is expected.

3080
02:57:38,920 --> 02:57:43,680
We need 48 now use the information we got.

3081
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:48,400
But at the same time,
when we got the information is for Kisha

3082
02:57:48,400 --> 02:57:51,480
Nel, Cuba, who is this duty?

3083
02:57:52,320 --> 02:57:54,400
And we honestly
who created this employment

3084
02:57:58,880 --> 02:57:59,520
assignment.

3085
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:00,800
Why do we need content types then?

3086
02:58:00,800 --> 02:58:03,160
We don't need a one
then it is a restricted this.

3087
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:04,800
I'm putting it right.

3088
02:58:04,800 --> 02:58:09,040
So if you don't want to use it,
don't use it.

3089
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:11,520
And is the culprit

3090
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:14,440
This guilty is the shortfall of your deep.

3091
02:58:14,440 --> 02:58:16,480
I know who did this

3092
02:58:20,600 --> 02:58:21,600
Amazing.

3093
02:58:21,600 --> 02:58:23,400
Maybe for hot

3094
02:58:30,960 --> 02:58:31,960
couple

3095
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:42,320
nights. No.

3096
02:58:43,320 --> 02:58:44,480
Then is

3097
02:58:46,240 --> 02:58:54,440
Simon. Bye.

3098
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:57,440
Fine. So now see?

3099
02:58:57,440 --> 02:58:59,880
Now see here. Here.

3100
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:01,320
There's what I'm saying.

3101
02:59:01,320 --> 02:59:02,240
That's what I'm saying.

3102
02:59:02,240 --> 02:59:04,440
See, it is returning me.

3103
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:07,000
The employee against the employer lady

3104
02:59:08,400 --> 02:59:10,480
laid against the employee.

3105
02:59:10,680 --> 02:59:12,120
It is returning with this part.

3106
02:59:12,120 --> 02:59:16,120
Correct.

3107
02:59:16,120 --> 02:59:18,720
So it's supposed to become what a nice

3108
02:59:19,880 --> 02:59:21,960
innovation. Green.

3109
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:22,680
Great.

3110
02:59:23,200 --> 02:59:24,600
The logic make.

3111
02:59:24,600 --> 02:59:27,160
And then you provide this algorithm.

3112
02:59:27,160 --> 02:59:31,600
Excellent.

3113
02:59:31,600 --> 02:59:34,440
Now, see, Isaiah, right.

3114
02:59:34,680 --> 02:59:38,280
If you test
if you test only street as good

3115
02:59:39,400 --> 02:59:41,240
case, understand this point.

3116
02:59:41,240 --> 02:59:44,160
When you are getting the information
from the database,

3117
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:47,280
what is the API status code you need?

3118
02:59:47,280 --> 02:59:50,520
What students code you need to test?

3119
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:51,200
No, no, no.

3120
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:54,440
Getting the information me 200.

3121
02:59:55,600 --> 02:59:56,160
Right.

3122
02:59:56,160 --> 03:00:00,000
So now according to the status code
that you are getting

3123
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:03,120
from the database
against this particular employee,

3124
03:00:03,960 --> 03:00:07,080
based on the status code,
your application is working

3125
03:00:07,080 --> 03:00:11,720
fine or not.

3126
03:00:11,720 --> 03:00:16,320
But actually if you go and deep
dive to the body there, you realize

3127
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:21,040
that your application is reflecting
not providing the data, but database.

3128
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,440
But data is not the one you are looking

3129
03:00:24,440 --> 03:00:30,760
for, right?

3130
03:00:30,840 --> 03:00:33,040
But data is not the one
you're looking for.

3131
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:35,200
Now let me try to get another data

3132
03:00:44,640 --> 03:00:45,360
employed.

3133
03:00:45,360 --> 03:00:48,680
You provide it
and what it employed someone changed,

3134
03:00:48,880 --> 03:00:53,760
I think not sure.

3135
03:00:53,760 --> 03:00:57,400
Can we get some of that employee?

3136
03:00:57,400 --> 03:00:59,680
The point that we're trying to do this

3137
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:14,600
was 260508.

3138
03:01:14,600 --> 03:01:18,600
So now regarding Zeta Mick Jagger, right
men singer,

3139
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:21,200
super costar of This Must be Dennis.

3140
03:01:22,440 --> 03:01:25,200
We employ 80

3141
03:01:25,200 --> 03:01:28,400
introduced with other than employ
80 are Jimmy.

3142
03:01:28,400 --> 03:01:32,000
It depends on this particular part
your swagger not doing

3143
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:35,280
great it depends on this document.

3144
03:01:35,280 --> 03:01:38,400
We got this mandatory parameter
from the swagger document.

3145
03:01:38,400 --> 03:01:38,960
Right?

3146
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:43,600
So if it is available in swagger document,
then we have to follow one document.

3147
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:44,760
That is Vega.

3148
03:01:44,760 --> 03:01:47,320
That's
why we are using yet employed. Great.

3149
03:01:47,440 --> 03:01:49,800
So we are not doing anything
from our side.

3150
03:01:50,120 --> 03:01:53,320
Everything we are doing
based the swagger document,

3151
03:01:53,320 --> 03:01:56,520
the information, the instructions
we got, inspector documents.

3152
03:01:56,520 --> 03:01:58,560
We're doing all of these things.

3153
03:01:58,560 --> 03:02:01,800
All right, All right,

3154
03:02:03,360 --> 03:02:04,000
fine.

3155
03:02:04,960 --> 03:02:07,560
So now, now, after this.

3156
03:02:07,560 --> 03:02:08,200
After this.

3157
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:11,840
When we created the employee,
when we the information here

3158
03:02:12,120 --> 03:02:14,240
right now, what we have to do

3159
03:02:14,880 --> 03:02:19,200
know what we have to do right?

3160
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:22,080
That means what we have to do first thing.

3161
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:25,960
First thing, when we are working
with this type of application,

3162
03:02:25,960 --> 03:02:27,560
we got one employee.

3163
03:02:27,560 --> 03:02:30,160
That's why we provide equity barometer.

3164
03:02:30,480 --> 03:02:31,560
Now, tell me one thing.

3165
03:02:31,560 --> 03:02:34,880
If I want to get the information
for all the employees

3166
03:02:34,880 --> 03:02:37,360
available in their database,
do I need for the benefit of

3167
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:44,600
why, why we don't need query benefit?

3168
03:02:44,600 --> 03:02:46,080
And in that case

3169
03:03:09,800 --> 03:03:12,960
generating
because it just brings everything we need.

3170
03:03:12,960 --> 03:03:15,080
We are calling we complete table right?

3171
03:03:15,080 --> 03:03:16,920
Are calling the complete employee.

3172
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:19,040
So if we are calling
the complete end point,

3173
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:21,360
definitely
we don't need that due to right.

3174
03:03:21,560 --> 03:03:23,760
We don't need the detail at all. Fine.

3175
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:25,920
Now let's further.

3176
03:03:25,920 --> 03:03:30,800
So the next thing is next thing
we are going to perform is to go

3177
03:03:30,920 --> 03:03:33,600
get date

3178
03:03:35,160 --> 03:03:36,840
on employee's

3179
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:37,720
good.

3180
03:03:37,720 --> 03:03:40,240
All employers is like this.

3181
03:03:40,240 --> 03:03:43,800
So now tell me for
getting all the employees which matter.

3182
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:59,440
We need to use.

3183
03:03:59,440 --> 03:04:02,760
You will see when one movie
in the Bollywood movie three idiots

3184
03:04:08,040 --> 03:04:08,880
there is a movie.

3185
03:04:08,880 --> 03:04:11,040
Good All is a dumb is there?

3186
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:14,360
All is with great every time

3187
03:04:14,360 --> 03:04:18,320
many of the all is well it gigs.

3188
03:04:18,320 --> 03:04:21,360
I got to the point here so see

3189
03:04:21,920 --> 03:04:25,760
now here this request
you are this request you want and we need

3190
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:29,880
all the information, right?

3191
03:04:29,880 --> 03:04:32,280
All the information we need.

3192
03:04:32,520 --> 03:04:35,640
That information should be taken

3193
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:39,120
from one document called

3194
03:04:40,320 --> 03:04:43,320
We should get this information
from swagger document.

3195
03:04:44,760 --> 03:04:48,320
Correct?

3196
03:04:48,320 --> 03:04:53,680
Correct.

3197
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:54,280
Correct.

3198
03:04:54,280 --> 03:04:58,440
So now, see, to get all the employees,
I have to go here

3199
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:01,080
to get the employees.

3200
03:05:01,080 --> 03:05:02,360
I have to go here.

3201
03:05:02,360 --> 03:05:06,040
I have to take this particular end
point from here.

3202
03:05:06,040 --> 03:05:07,720
I can get the information.

3203
03:05:07,720 --> 03:05:11,040
Now, you'll see in
I'm with this embedded meters.

3204
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:13,920
If you see here,
it will see one employee A

3205
03:05:14,440 --> 03:05:17,760
that I need market in this parameters
it is see

3206
03:05:17,960 --> 03:05:20,800
I don't need any better.

3207
03:05:20,800 --> 03:05:21,600
There's a difference.

3208
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:24,240
There is no barometers required point.

3209
03:05:24,520 --> 03:05:26,760
So for us, let's take this base.

3210
03:05:26,760 --> 03:05:29,600
You are you from

3211
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:30,640
Let's take this base.

3212
03:05:30,640 --> 03:05:32,680
You are right from here.

3213
03:05:32,680 --> 03:05:35,760
Edit Next thing we need guys is

3214
03:05:38,040 --> 03:05:39,240
is this

3215
03:05:39,240 --> 03:05:43,560
particular You are aligning
this particular you are aligning.

3216
03:05:43,560 --> 03:05:46,880
So I would put this you are in

3217
03:05:46,880 --> 03:05:47,800
I will put this.

3218
03:05:47,800 --> 03:05:49,360
You are in here

3219
03:05:49,920 --> 03:05:55,440
Now tell me what else I need.

3220
03:05:55,440 --> 03:05:56,400
Simple,

3221
03:05:57,360 --> 03:06:01,240
simple content trade

3222
03:06:09,120 --> 03:06:12,640
in me is do we need anybody

3223
03:06:14,720 --> 03:06:16,960
this is not the

3224
03:06:16,960 --> 03:06:19,040
vineyard authorization, right?

3225
03:06:19,040 --> 03:06:23,200
So authorization we put SBA token rate,

3226
03:06:24,480 --> 03:06:27,560
we put as beta token,

3227
03:06:27,560 --> 03:06:31,920
correct?

3228
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:34,240
Correct. Being a token we need fine.

3229
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:37,800
So now the better token
we already have where we have

3230
03:06:38,280 --> 03:06:40,560
we generated this token here, right?

3231
03:06:41,680 --> 03:06:43,720
We generated this token here.

3232
03:06:43,720 --> 03:06:47,080
So let me copy this particular token and,

3233
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:49,920
and let me base teach.

3234
03:06:51,480 --> 03:06:55,280
So I'm going to based this token

3235
03:06:55,560 --> 03:06:58,160
I'm going to based on this token, see,
I've bested

3236
03:06:58,800 --> 03:07:16,960
now what else I need.

3237
03:07:16,960 --> 03:07:17,680
So notion

3238
03:07:18,760 --> 03:07:20,760
that everything is available

3239
03:07:21,200 --> 03:07:25,680
now, I need to have the information
on what I need in the response.

3240
03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:29,360
Note We need key and value of good.

3241
03:07:29,360 --> 03:07:30,680
That's the main point, right?

3242
03:07:30,680 --> 03:07:32,280
We don't need parameters, right?

3243
03:07:32,280 --> 03:07:35,360
You see, I you if I'm looking here

3244
03:07:35,360 --> 03:07:38,000
it says no parameters on correct.

3245
03:07:38,480 --> 03:07:41,640
So if it sees no parameters,
what does it mean?

3246
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:42,600
No value.

3247
03:07:42,600 --> 03:07:46,160
We have to provide why we need parameters

3248
03:07:46,160 --> 03:07:50,240
in the previous one
because there was via specifying

3249
03:07:50,240 --> 03:07:54,200
one particular information
from the group of information.

3250
03:07:54,200 --> 03:07:57,840
Right now here
we are going to target the complete group.

3251
03:07:57,840 --> 03:08:00,720
So we are not going to specify
any particular information.

3252
03:08:00,920 --> 03:08:03,680
We need all the information

3253
03:08:03,680 --> 03:08:07,240
categories.

3254
03:08:07,240 --> 03:08:09,160
We need all the information here.

3255
03:08:09,160 --> 03:08:11,440
That's
why you are not providing this part.

3256
03:08:11,440 --> 03:08:15,840
So now, after adding this part
authorization, ending every single

3257
03:08:16,320 --> 03:08:17,720
simply click think.

3258
03:08:19,560 --> 03:08:20,160
Still, we are

3259
03:08:20,160 --> 03:08:23,240
performing the retrieve Operation
data retrieval.

3260
03:08:23,400 --> 03:08:26,400
So again,
I will get the status quo to double zero.

3261
03:08:26,760 --> 03:08:28,760
So now you'll see

3262
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:33,880
all the low, more than 80.

3263
03:08:34,360 --> 03:08:35,400
We get the information.

3264
03:08:35,400 --> 03:08:37,440
So how many employees we have to tell

3265
03:08:39,520 --> 03:08:40,720
who created this one?

3266
03:08:40,720 --> 03:08:41,880
By the way,

3267
03:08:42,360 --> 03:08:48,040
who created this blunder?

3268
03:08:48,040 --> 03:08:52,600
Then, as I need the list,
I need the list of all these culprits.

3269
03:08:52,600 --> 03:08:55,840
By Monday.

3270
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:57,320
So let it before Tuesday class.

3271
03:08:57,320 --> 03:08:59,280
I'll make sure

3272
03:08:59,960 --> 03:09:04,960
I do justice to all of the main

3273
03:09:05,600 --> 03:09:07,560
a Lucia

3274
03:09:08,040 --> 03:09:09,600
mystery.

3275
03:09:09,920 --> 03:09:12,000
My title origin came out in the market.

3276
03:09:12,200 --> 03:09:16,840
When I do great.

3277
03:09:16,840 --> 03:09:19,920
No see all this 103 employees,
we get great.

3278
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:22,520
We got all this 103 employees.

3279
03:09:22,560 --> 03:09:23,360
Correct.

3280
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:27,120
You guys see all information available
If it means

3281
03:09:27,480 --> 03:09:32,480
we got the complete information right,
We got the complete information here.

3282
03:09:32,480 --> 03:09:35,880
Understood.

3283
03:09:35,880 --> 03:09:43,320
Industrial of this case.

3284
03:09:43,320 --> 03:09:43,880
Fine.

3285
03:09:43,920 --> 03:09:46,880
So getting one employee, getting multiple

3286
03:09:46,880 --> 03:09:51,680
employees,
both on same nature, one is retrieving

3287
03:09:51,680 --> 03:09:55,080
one information, one is retrieving
complete information.

3288
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:57,480
Understood this point.

3289
03:09:57,480 --> 03:10:00,600
Retrieving lemon submission, retrieving
complete information.

3290
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:03,400
Right.
This is the only difference. Correct.

3291
03:10:03,720 --> 03:10:05,760
But status code is C

3292
03:10:05,760 --> 03:10:09,960
and the specified information
is the credit parameter

3293
03:10:10,080 --> 03:10:14,640
which we provide in our request
when it comes to specify

3294
03:10:14,760 --> 03:10:18,920
one particular location, one
particular of information I want to check.

3295
03:10:19,240 --> 03:10:21,000
Sure. Alert in New Jersey

3296
03:10:24,080 --> 03:10:26,480
for small

3297
03:10:29,280 --> 03:10:31,440
and don't know. Just

3298
03:10:31,560 --> 03:10:33,400
please take care, Alex.

3299
03:10:34,400 --> 03:10:41,280
Please take care.

3300
03:10:41,280 --> 03:10:47,280
Fine.

3301
03:10:47,280 --> 03:10:47,880
Same.

3302
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:52,800
I don't have any alerting.

3303
03:10:52,800 --> 03:10:54,440
No, no, no.

3304
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:56,680
See, guys, we are done with this.

3305
03:10:56,680 --> 03:10:58,080
Five requests so far.

3306
03:10:58,080 --> 03:11:01,400
Can you see everyone?

3307
03:11:01,400 --> 03:11:04,960
Can you see everyone?

3308
03:11:04,960 --> 03:11:09,920
Now we need to convenience
stores from here every other day.

3309
03:11:10,480 --> 03:11:12,680
It's a normal thing for us.

3310
03:11:12,680 --> 03:11:14,280
Nice, Nice.

3311
03:11:14,280 --> 03:11:16,840
Boston beauteous lady you are.

3312
03:11:16,840 --> 03:11:19,760
We have a break then, is it?

3313
03:11:19,920 --> 03:11:23,600
What do your time rate
with the wrapping of the class anyways?

3314
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:26,280
Rates are going to be a break.

3315
03:11:26,520 --> 03:11:29,640
That's what I told you to do
in a half hour continuous class

3316
03:11:30,040 --> 03:11:33,400
so that we can cover their timings
and we can see this happen.

3317
03:11:33,400 --> 03:11:34,800
A little break.

3318
03:11:34,800 --> 03:11:36,120
This happened our break rate.

3319
03:11:36,120 --> 03:11:40,040
What we take generally between what is
for 20 minutes when it's over 80 minutes.

3320
03:11:40,280 --> 03:11:44,520
So that 30 minutes break rate,
we get over it taking industrial

3321
03:11:47,080 --> 03:11:50,440
no break right now

3322
03:11:52,200 --> 03:11:54,400
rate cutting

3323
03:11:54,400 --> 03:11:57,640
because there is a power of rate
that is a power warranty.

3324
03:11:58,080 --> 03:12:01,600
Eight hour time, 2030 rate that's why.

3325
03:12:01,600 --> 03:12:03,600
So it will be like one our leaders point

3326
03:12:03,600 --> 03:12:07,240
I'm saving that one hour
so I'm taking any break rate

3327
03:12:07,480 --> 03:12:10,960
so it will be like to
do not do 3 hours power off in India

3328
03:12:11,760 --> 03:12:13,800
not in India basically get it just

3329
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:18,240
place when I'm leaving or because this

3330
03:12:18,240 --> 03:12:21,840
you know of BP the DC generator

3331
03:12:22,440 --> 03:12:25,520
other transformer basically

3332
03:12:26,640 --> 03:12:28,440
their transformer store

3333
03:12:28,440 --> 03:12:31,800
not been a year and what amazing idea

3334
03:12:32,080 --> 03:12:34,680
I talked to the prime minister
tomorrow morning

3335
03:12:34,880 --> 03:12:38,240
you must be sleeping notes to India
so I like the

3336
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:43,680
transformer got busted in the afternoon

3337
03:12:43,680 --> 03:12:46,840
break so we've got massive
power thing and currently

3338
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:49,920
Jersey but I know

3339
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:53,120
our prime minister is great e-books
24 seven grid

3340
03:12:53,160 --> 03:12:54,880
65 this

3341
03:12:56,280 --> 03:12:57,080
so basically

3342
03:12:57,080 --> 03:13:01,320
they are using the alternative line
but in the night they went to work on it.

3343
03:13:01,560 --> 03:13:05,200
So that line will also be
will also be will not be available.

3344
03:13:05,360 --> 03:13:06,560
That's why

3345
03:13:08,200 --> 03:13:10,440
I'll replace let's cross out for

3346
03:13:12,080 --> 03:13:14,600
now. Currently

3347
03:13:18,120 --> 03:13:19,040
and no

3348
03:13:19,800 --> 03:13:21,080
I know there

3349
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:29,040
are no it will be back in 3 hours.

3350
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:30,920
Yeah Alex I know

3351
03:13:31,560 --> 03:13:33,480
and I know
who has written this pontificate.

3352
03:13:33,480 --> 03:13:36,680
Imagine that you can achieve an book
every day

3353
03:13:37,360 --> 03:13:39,680
in which article there was book

3354
03:13:43,640 --> 03:13:44,280
fight.

3355
03:13:44,280 --> 03:13:46,680
So now CEOs get part

3356
03:13:47,040 --> 03:13:51,920
post what it means creating an information
in their and retrieving

3357
03:13:51,920 --> 03:13:56,120
the information from their database
from the stateless application.

3358
03:13:56,280 --> 03:14:11,840
Clear far or not.

3359
03:14:11,840 --> 03:14:13,000
Is it clear to everyone

3360
03:14:14,200 --> 03:14:16,360
right.

3361
03:14:16,360 --> 03:14:18,280
That's nice.

3362
03:14:18,280 --> 03:14:21,840
No. Now, here I'm going to show you
just a glimpse.

3363
03:14:21,840 --> 03:14:25,760
If you're working with
is full application or right.

3364
03:14:26,320 --> 03:14:28,320
If you're working with

3365
03:14:28,920 --> 03:14:31,200
guys.

3366
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:33,600
In our case, we got the results.
It is incorrect.

3367
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:35,960
Yes, is I will tell you right

3368
03:14:35,960 --> 03:14:39,800
how to put verification, assertions,
validations, everything you need to do.

3369
03:14:39,800 --> 03:14:42,360
Check every single.

3370
03:14:42,360 --> 03:14:44,760
Right now we're focusing on EPA responses.

3371
03:14:44,760 --> 03:14:47,520
Right? So it's working.

3372
03:14:47,520 --> 03:14:49,680
If you are working with a stateful
application,

3373
03:14:49,960 --> 03:14:52,400
stateful applications have tokens on one

3374
03:14:56,880 --> 03:14:59,400
is paired with application,
doesn't have tokens.

3375
03:14:59,680 --> 03:15:04,360
Then we have to rely on what?

3376
03:15:04,360 --> 03:15:12,880
So instead of what we do, we provide one.

3377
03:15:12,880 --> 03:15:15,200
We provide credentials, right?

3378
03:15:15,240 --> 03:15:18,240
We provide credentials
simply username and password.

3379
03:15:18,240 --> 03:15:22,400
So if you are working
with your stateful application

3380
03:15:22,520 --> 03:15:27,320
but you have to rely on username
and password, that is the credentials.

3381
03:15:27,320 --> 03:15:32,000
So what do you have to do there
you go into the authorization, right?

3382
03:15:32,280 --> 03:15:35,160
You're going to the authorization
you select.

3383
03:15:35,160 --> 03:15:39,360
The value from this
dropdown is basic authorization.

3384
03:15:40,520 --> 03:15:41,160
What you select

3385
03:15:41,160 --> 03:15:49,680
goes from here.

3386
03:15:49,680 --> 03:15:53,320
Basic authorization, right?

3387
03:15:53,320 --> 03:15:55,200
So from this basic authorization

3388
03:15:55,200 --> 03:15:58,480
you have to enter your username
and password here, right?

3389
03:15:58,760 --> 03:16:02,120
Once you enter your username and password,
then you click on it.

3390
03:16:02,160 --> 03:16:03,600
It will work.

3391
03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:09,120
Alright, again this using this username
and password is spot, which is an impulse.

3392
03:16:09,120 --> 03:16:14,040
What do you have to put you?

3393
03:16:14,040 --> 03:16:16,560
Admin username and password? Right.

3394
03:16:16,880 --> 03:16:22,960
Create user username and password
that when you have to put here.

3395
03:16:22,960 --> 03:16:24,280
All right. This

3396
03:16:25,760 --> 03:16:28,280
what does this what again not remember

3397
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:32,520
we have discussed about instead of full
and instead less application.

3398
03:16:33,480 --> 03:16:34,040
Right?

3399
03:16:34,040 --> 03:16:36,040
So it is stateless application.

3400
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:38,040
We are dealing with tokens.

3401
03:16:38,040 --> 03:16:39,520
These are JSON tokens.

3402
03:16:39,520 --> 03:16:41,320
We are dealing with this tokens.

3403
03:16:41,320 --> 03:16:42,000
Right.

3404
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:45,480
However,
if we talk about a stateful application,

3405
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:50,120
then we should not rely on tokens
because we do not understand the tokens.

3406
03:16:50,400 --> 03:16:52,360
Writing is stateful application.

3407
03:16:52,360 --> 03:16:55,360
So we had what? Roberta

3408
03:16:56,360 --> 03:16:57,680
Who is this?

3409
03:16:58,800 --> 03:16:59,760
Someone cool?

3410
03:16:59,760 --> 03:17:01,880
Name one.

3411
03:17:01,920 --> 03:17:05,040
They did last name also Main.

3412
03:17:05,160 --> 03:17:06,400
Yeah, he must be.

3413
03:17:06,400 --> 03:17:08,480
When they die nobody will be back.

3414
03:17:08,480 --> 03:17:11,400
And job title is Loser.

3415
03:17:11,640 --> 03:17:12,520
Oh, we're remote.

3416
03:17:12,520 --> 03:17:16,560
Which is as soon as people
when you have to deal with token

3417
03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:21,440
when you have to deal with token
disease is stateless.

3418
03:17:21,840 --> 03:17:25,080
When you have to deal with username
and password, this is a stateful.

3419
03:17:25,400 --> 03:17:26,080
All right.

3420
03:17:26,080 --> 03:17:30,680
So in your swagger document,
if you see any endpoint

3421
03:17:30,840 --> 03:17:36,000
that requires you to provide,
that requires you to generate that token

3422
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,960
within a fraction of a moment,
you will understand this is

3423
03:17:40,280 --> 03:17:43,800
the this is stateless application.

3424
03:17:43,920 --> 03:17:46,840
And in your struggle document,
if you see there is no point

3425
03:17:46,840 --> 03:17:48,680
for generating the token that

3426
03:17:48,680 --> 03:17:52,640
you have to provide username and password
for basic authorization log in there

3427
03:17:52,680 --> 03:17:55,880
you will understand within a fraction
of a moment the application.

3428
03:17:55,880 --> 03:17:59,200
You are going to work,
you are going to test the API. It.

3429
03:17:59,400 --> 03:18:02,520
This application is having
the nature that is strictly

3430
03:18:16,240 --> 03:18:19,200
understood.

3431
03:18:19,200 --> 03:18:20,000
Fine.

3432
03:18:20,720 --> 03:18:21,440
Fine.

3433
03:18:21,600 --> 03:18:23,520
So now, now here.

3434
03:18:23,520 --> 03:18:27,160
This is how we deal with basic username
and password.

3435
03:18:27,320 --> 03:18:29,360
Correct? Correct.

3436
03:18:29,360 --> 03:18:31,200
It's cutting.

3437
03:18:31,200 --> 03:18:33,240
So now if

3438
03:18:34,360 --> 03:18:40,520
if you work see here, here
if you work with this part, if I provide

3439
03:18:40,560 --> 03:18:45,680
see the moment it is giving me
it mean Johnny nor William admin.

3440
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:48,960
What it is
is it's not from where this data is

3441
03:18:48,960 --> 03:18:52,000
coming, right.

3442
03:18:52,560 --> 03:18:56,040
This data is coming from where did me

3443
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,120
exactly

3444
03:18:59,760 --> 03:19:00,920
Exactly.

3445
03:19:00,920 --> 03:19:04,920
This data is coming from keys.

3446
03:19:05,320 --> 03:19:08,920
So now the next topic,
which we are going to

3447
03:19:08,920 --> 03:19:11,400
learn is

3448
03:19:12,440 --> 03:19:16,680
we are going to learn things.

3449
03:19:16,680 --> 03:19:19,200
Cookie's not the one.

3450
03:19:19,440 --> 03:19:21,760
We eat it in the breakfast.

3451
03:19:21,760 --> 03:19:26,320
It is cookies, ethnic items.

3452
03:19:26,320 --> 03:19:28,840
Yeah, get shader and that makes us memory.

3453
03:19:28,840 --> 03:19:33,320
The temporary memory cookies are same
rate is correct.

3454
03:19:33,320 --> 03:19:35,880
I knew a lot of cookies on the we

3455
03:19:41,360 --> 03:19:46,840
can so guys to me.

3456
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:55,040
Any idea about what cookies are.

3457
03:19:55,040 --> 03:19:58,280
Yeah and ones that were dinged

3458
03:19:58,280 --> 03:20:08,520
for the same rate

3459
03:20:08,600 --> 03:20:11,200
so now I see
let me give you a first example

3460
03:20:11,720 --> 03:20:17,280
nowadays of nowadays if you see you go

3461
03:20:17,280 --> 03:20:21,720
and you search for something
in your browser, right.

3462
03:20:22,440 --> 03:20:25,640
For example, you open your code doesn't

3463
03:20:26,480 --> 03:20:28,560
and you search for the Nike shoes,

3464
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:33,880
You search for Nike shoes.

3465
03:20:33,880 --> 03:20:36,400
Where we deal with the stateful is good.

3466
03:20:36,400 --> 03:20:37,160
Full application.

3467
03:20:37,160 --> 03:20:39,680
I showed all your aid
in your authorization,

3468
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:43,600
so instead of selecting tokens
from the dropdown, you select

3469
03:20:43,600 --> 03:20:46,680
the basic one and then you provide
username and password.

3470
03:20:46,920 --> 03:20:49,320
So that's how we deal
with this particular part.

3471
03:20:49,320 --> 03:21:00,000
Understood.

3472
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:01,440
Understood. This

3473
03:21:05,400 --> 03:21:06,120
file.

3474
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:10,680
So now,
now when we talk about the cookies, right.

3475
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:13,920
So remember you go and you search

3476
03:21:13,920 --> 03:21:17,120
something on your chrome
browser, your shoes, right?

3477
03:21:17,600 --> 03:21:20,120
You want just one or two shoes
and suddenly you have

3478
03:21:20,240 --> 03:21:23,600
you go to work or
to do you close your browser,

3479
03:21:24,760 --> 03:21:26,480
you you just wind down

3480
03:21:26,480 --> 03:21:31,320
next time fuel on your Facebook
or you open YouTube.

3481
03:21:31,320 --> 03:21:34,320
You see advertisement about this
Nike shoes

3482
03:21:34,320 --> 03:21:36,240
and, you know, shoes

3483
03:21:37,640 --> 03:21:44,520
have and even observe this.

3484
03:21:44,520 --> 03:21:47,520
So any one more question
Do we have to choose which method to use

3485
03:21:47,520 --> 03:21:50,800
or which industry to continue? We

3486
03:21:51,960 --> 03:21:53,160
we have to

3487
03:21:53,160 --> 03:21:56,640
we have to see
first nature of application,

3488
03:21:57,680 --> 03:22:02,320
nature of application, right.

3489
03:22:02,320 --> 03:22:18,360
And yet

3490
03:22:18,720 --> 03:22:21,320
that is a part of the air and air.

3491
03:22:21,400 --> 03:22:25,960
And then you don't want to wait
for the console.

3492
03:22:25,960 --> 03:22:33,560
So here, here, here
you see, you know, that's what I'm saying.

3493
03:22:33,720 --> 03:22:36,520
So we always exempt cookies, right?

3494
03:22:36,720 --> 03:22:38,040
We accept cookies.

3495
03:22:38,040 --> 03:22:42,480
So then while accepting the cookies,
we are ready to share this information.

3496
03:22:42,960 --> 03:22:46,000
We are giving their consent
that okay, we are okay

3497
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:47,800
if you share information, right?

3498
03:22:47,800 --> 03:22:50,640
That's what we do, guys.

3499
03:22:50,960 --> 03:22:55,960
That's what we do or not.

3500
03:22:55,960 --> 03:22:57,840
Sometimes it doesn't even ask.

3501
03:22:57,840 --> 03:23:00,120
Right? So what? What is happening here?

3502
03:23:00,320 --> 03:23:02,880
What is happening? How the system knows

3503
03:23:03,840 --> 03:23:05,280
that we should

3504
03:23:05,280 --> 03:23:07,560
give you this type of suggestions.

3505
03:23:08,240 --> 03:23:11,120
You're looking for issues

3506
03:23:12,640 --> 03:23:19,880
How how system knows it.

3507
03:23:19,880 --> 03:23:22,360
There should be a special algorithm first.

3508
03:23:22,680 --> 03:23:26,800
First algorithm works on data.

3509
03:23:26,800 --> 03:23:28,200
Algorithm works on work.

3510
03:23:28,200 --> 03:23:30,600
If there is no data,
algorithm doesn't work out.

3511
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:33,600
Correct. So algorithm works on data.

3512
03:23:33,960 --> 03:23:36,080
So the data is coming from where

3513
03:23:38,160 --> 03:23:41,280
in technical language

3514
03:23:41,280 --> 03:23:45,720
cookies are simply
is small blocks of data.

3515
03:23:45,720 --> 03:23:47,280
What are cookies?

3516
03:23:47,760 --> 03:23:49,880
These are small blocks of data

3517
03:23:50,360 --> 03:23:55,440
created by a website
that are were created by web server.

3518
03:23:55,440 --> 03:24:01,200
When you try to browse something in a
particular website or some deep drive.

3519
03:24:01,400 --> 03:24:07,480
So this block of data on your computers
or on the other device

3520
03:24:07,840 --> 03:24:12,080
which you are using by a web browser,
it stores that information,

3521
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:16,560
it stores that information.

3522
03:24:16,560 --> 03:24:17,640
And as to this point,

3523
03:24:18,760 --> 03:24:19,920
Jimmy, please correct me

3524
03:24:19,920 --> 03:24:25,320
if I'm wrong.

3525
03:24:25,320 --> 03:24:28,720
These cookies are small block of data,

3526
03:24:29,760 --> 03:24:32,520
small block of data
created by a web server.

3527
03:24:32,520 --> 03:24:35,400
What is your web server?
Your web browser, Right.

3528
03:24:35,400 --> 03:24:37,440
It is connecting you to so many things.

3529
03:24:37,840 --> 03:24:39,960
Correct. So that is your web server.

3530
03:24:40,320 --> 03:24:43,680
So this cookies are available
in your browser.

3531
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:47,920
You see if you are getting your username
and password

3532
03:24:47,920 --> 03:24:51,760
in Chrome browser,
trying to open it from the edge browser.

3533
03:24:51,760 --> 03:24:54,600
It will ask you again
to provide username password.

3534
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:56,040
Why is that so?

3535
03:24:56,040 --> 03:24:58,200
Because you see it in chrome.

3536
03:24:58,200 --> 03:25:00,640
You didn't see it in edge, right?

3537
03:25:01,080 --> 03:25:06,080
So different web server rate available
on your application's browser part.

3538
03:25:06,360 --> 03:25:10,760
When you are actually interacting with
so many applications you are searching.

3539
03:25:10,760 --> 03:25:11,960
So we need permission.

3540
03:25:11,960 --> 03:25:15,720
The database from the global web page
understood

3541
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:16,920
this part first.

3542
03:25:16,920 --> 03:25:21,360
So what cookies does, whatever the
information you have, it's towards that

3543
03:25:22,440 --> 03:25:25,560
you're searching history, browsing,
history, likes, dislikes,

3544
03:25:25,560 --> 03:25:30,480
every single thing available
in this cookies, in this cookies.

3545
03:25:30,600 --> 03:25:33,760
Is this, is this clear?

3546
03:25:35,160 --> 03:25:36,960
So the point is.

3547
03:25:36,960 --> 03:25:38,120
But Hunt, is this clear?

3548
03:25:38,120 --> 03:25:49,880
No, but so now the point is

3549
03:25:50,160 --> 03:25:53,000
why these cookies are storing

3550
03:25:53,000 --> 03:26:01,440
all of this information,

3551
03:26:01,440 --> 03:26:05,560
why these cookies are supporting
all of this information?

3552
03:26:05,560 --> 03:26:09,960
A lot of reasons,
a lot of reasons behind this.

3553
03:26:10,760 --> 03:26:13,920
See, first reason

3554
03:26:15,280 --> 03:26:18,240
The very first reason is

3555
03:26:18,240 --> 03:26:24,960
you don't need to log in again.

3556
03:26:24,960 --> 03:26:26,760
You don't need to log in again.

3557
03:26:26,760 --> 03:26:29,480
Correct? Correct.

3558
03:26:29,520 --> 03:26:32,200
It consumes your information.
You need to log in again and again.

3559
03:26:32,200 --> 03:26:33,000
Tell me

3560
03:26:34,080 --> 03:26:39,800
and will, you don't need to log in again.

3561
03:26:39,800 --> 03:26:43,800
Second thing,
they can transfer their data.

3562
03:26:44,040 --> 03:26:48,880
They can transfer their data
transfer your history and they can use it.

3563
03:26:49,160 --> 03:26:51,000
They can use it for

3564
03:27:00,360 --> 03:27:01,240
advertisement.

3565
03:27:01,240 --> 03:27:02,400
But it was

3566
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:06,920
great.

3567
03:27:07,080 --> 03:27:11,080
It transfers their data collected
also can supposedly information

3568
03:27:11,080 --> 03:27:14,880
or utilize it information
for advertisement purpose.

3569
03:27:15,280 --> 03:27:15,920
Right.

3570
03:27:15,920 --> 03:27:20,960
So now now algorithms come into the
what algorithms do year

3571
03:27:21,360 --> 03:27:24,640
algorithms takes your data, right?

3572
03:27:25,080 --> 03:27:27,840
Read your history, choose shows choose.

3573
03:27:27,840 --> 03:27:30,280
All right. It goes into the database.

3574
03:27:30,520 --> 03:27:33,280
See all the details of the issues, grab

3575
03:27:33,280 --> 03:27:36,320
this information,
show it on to the web server.

3576
03:27:36,600 --> 03:27:39,920
It shows every information
where the ads enable the.

3577
03:27:39,920 --> 03:27:41,920
Now you see all the requirements of

3578
03:27:46,000 --> 03:27:46,920
this stored

3579
03:27:48,560 --> 03:27:50,040
industrial this

3580
03:27:50,800 --> 03:27:52,480
how things work

3581
03:27:54,160 --> 03:27:56,200
students is this clear?

3582
03:27:56,200 --> 03:27:59,440
How things work in the cookies

3583
03:28:06,040 --> 03:28:07,240
based on any questions.

3584
03:28:07,240 --> 03:28:13,000
So one read

3585
03:28:16,360 --> 03:28:19,680
no questions like Zima

3586
03:28:19,680 --> 03:28:21,080
good exit

3587
03:28:21,680 --> 03:28:23,520
exam that goes towards the non

3588
03:28:23,520 --> 03:28:27,480
normal owners
good cookies are already storing your data

3589
03:28:27,920 --> 03:28:31,240
algorithms is baking the data
from the cookies right

3590
03:28:31,360 --> 03:28:35,360
separating you, bringing down
to several pieces understanding.

3591
03:28:35,360 --> 03:28:39,240
What is your search history Choose
then goes into the database,

3592
03:28:39,480 --> 03:28:42,480
grab all the names on the issues,
put it in your browser.

3593
03:28:42,640 --> 03:28:44,280
You see that data.

3594
03:28:44,280 --> 03:28:48,840
So algorithm simply filtering
your browsing history from the cookies.

3595
03:28:48,840 --> 03:28:52,680
Their data this algorithm got from great

3596
03:28:52,800 --> 03:28:55,720
and then providing
you the agreed basement rate

3597
03:28:57,720 --> 03:29:01,160
read.

3598
03:29:01,160 --> 03:29:03,720
So now here, here you see

3599
03:29:04,560 --> 03:29:08,360
if you are searching a lot of information,
a lot of information right

3600
03:29:08,680 --> 03:29:11,960
there is everything available
in the cookies, correct?

3601
03:29:12,960 --> 03:29:15,400
Everything available in the cookies book.

3602
03:29:15,680 --> 03:29:17,680
But you get the details.

3603
03:29:17,800 --> 03:29:21,040
You get this advertisement
to get this information,

3604
03:29:21,320 --> 03:29:24,120
not for all the information
you search for,

3605
03:29:24,400 --> 03:29:26,760
not for all the information
you searched for,

3606
03:29:26,760 --> 03:29:29,040
but for only a specific
point of information

3607
03:29:29,040 --> 03:29:32,960
such as product, groceries, cards, rate,

3608
03:29:33,240 --> 03:29:37,920
or some videos or some movies
or some accounts like this kind of things,

3609
03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:42,800
which is business related,
Which is business related.

3610
03:29:43,040 --> 03:29:48,200
Okay, What is getting my point,

3611
03:29:48,800 --> 03:29:53,480
which is business had for example,
if you go and check, how do you generate

3612
03:29:53,760 --> 03:29:56,160
as a how get my assistant number

3613
03:29:56,160 --> 03:29:58,600
next time
it will not give you rate to generate

3614
03:29:58,600 --> 03:30:00,920
it is just a number agency name
or many things

3615
03:30:00,920 --> 03:30:02,320
because this is something else.

3616
03:30:02,320 --> 03:30:04,160
This is not their business right.

3617
03:30:04,160 --> 03:30:09,720
But if we search for watches, eyeglasses,
specs, shirts, shoes, right.

3618
03:30:09,840 --> 03:30:11,040
Any other thing.

3619
03:30:11,040 --> 03:30:13,280
And definitely
it'll give you a lot of suggestions.

3620
03:30:13,280 --> 03:30:18,960
It's a So now I understand how important
these cookies are in more than one

3621
03:30:20,960 --> 03:30:23,400
That is another type of cookie called

3622
03:30:30,560 --> 03:30:36,240
third party cookies.

3623
03:30:36,240 --> 03:30:39,920
Third party cookies. What does it mean?

3624
03:30:39,920 --> 03:30:43,680
What?

3625
03:30:43,680 --> 03:30:46,360
YOHANAN Yeah, that that's what I'm going
that's what I'm coming to.

3626
03:30:46,360 --> 03:30:50,000
The point we are telling to third
party is cookies.

3627
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:52,320
What is this, cookies,
third party cookies.

3628
03:30:52,320 --> 03:30:56,840
So basically,
basically what it does is simply, simply

3629
03:30:57,200 --> 03:31:00,720
this third party cookies, stores data.

3630
03:31:00,960 --> 03:31:03,760
But since this data, other companies

3631
03:31:05,600 --> 03:31:08,040
ship our data to other companies.

3632
03:31:08,400 --> 03:31:16,080
Okay. Wow.

3633
03:31:16,080 --> 03:31:19,880
So we go on this one
third is two things I need to work on.

3634
03:31:19,880 --> 03:31:23,360
First is also large window for Alexa,
and the second

3635
03:31:23,360 --> 03:31:26,960
is to declare the cookies illegal for you.

3636
03:31:27,200 --> 03:31:30,800
So on Monday
we will work on these two points.

3637
03:31:30,920 --> 03:31:32,520
Definitely.

3638
03:31:32,520 --> 03:31:34,520
It is all about advertisement, not equal.

3639
03:31:34,520 --> 03:31:37,640
It is all about business hub,
liquidity Hub.

3640
03:31:38,560 --> 03:31:38,920
Right.

3641
03:31:39,120 --> 03:31:42,000
So you see what third party cookies does.

3642
03:31:42,000 --> 03:31:46,400
Party cookies is basically an agreement
to two companies, right?

3643
03:31:46,680 --> 03:31:50,080
One company
says, right, definitely do this.

3644
03:31:51,360 --> 03:31:52,640
So one company says

3645
03:31:52,640 --> 03:31:56,880
we will collect some data for the users
and we will send this to table.

3646
03:31:56,880 --> 03:31:58,920
You get the privileges.

3647
03:31:58,920 --> 03:32:02,520
Another company says point,
give this data me in the billions

3648
03:32:02,680 --> 03:32:06,560
we will use of my own some prediction
algorithms, but it is linked.

3649
03:32:07,360 --> 03:32:07,880
Fine.

3650
03:32:07,880 --> 03:32:09,240
So that company says, all right,

3651
03:32:09,240 --> 03:32:12,360
you use your prediction algorithms and,
then we will show your data.

3652
03:32:12,520 --> 03:32:18,040
But the application point,
there's billions of dollars.

3653
03:32:18,040 --> 03:32:20,080
Who is giving who is giving the data?

3654
03:32:20,080 --> 03:32:23,880
One company where this data is collecting
from, from us,

3655
03:32:24,240 --> 03:32:27,840
we are accepting the cookies
the moment we exist in 20 hours.

3656
03:32:28,160 --> 03:32:30,320
Is it legal? It is legal.

3657
03:32:30,320 --> 03:32:31,680
It is legal.

3658
03:32:32,880 --> 03:32:34,920
It doesn't even there's
there's the meat problem.

3659
03:32:34,920 --> 03:32:38,520
You know why this can risk committee
rate of gold.

3660
03:32:38,520 --> 03:32:41,480
This guy, Mark Zuckerberg, there they ask

3661
03:32:41,840 --> 03:32:48,480
why you are playing with the privacy.

3662
03:32:48,480 --> 03:32:50,920
Remember
this monitor carbon has been called there.

3663
03:32:50,960 --> 03:32:53,160
They were asking that question next.

3664
03:32:53,160 --> 03:32:55,400
That's the main reason.

3665
03:32:55,400 --> 03:32:58,320
And without confirm,
you can't connect to your single right.

3666
03:32:58,560 --> 03:33:02,080
So now you'll see when it comes
to third parties, cookies, rain,

3667
03:33:02,200 --> 03:33:03,320
how things are working.

3668
03:33:04,560 --> 03:33:08,880
Let give you the best example.

3669
03:33:08,880 --> 03:33:12,280
This is the most used a search
engine nowadays.

3670
03:33:12,400 --> 03:33:15,120
Google on this planet.

3671
03:33:15,120 --> 03:33:16,560
On this planet. Great.

3672
03:33:16,560 --> 03:33:19,160
When you search anything in Google raid,

3673
03:33:19,480 --> 03:33:22,040
it makes the collection of the worse.

3674
03:33:22,240 --> 03:33:27,400
And today we have got this much searched
for this particular part right?

3675
03:33:27,400 --> 03:33:31,760
So for one particular part,
we got this much search, most used search.

3676
03:33:32,560 --> 03:33:35,040
It was data collection,

3677
03:33:35,040 --> 03:33:40,080
data engineering, data scraps,
trade data, predicting data.

3678
03:33:40,080 --> 03:33:43,320
In years of working here,
they are collecting the data.

3679
03:33:43,560 --> 03:33:47,800
So every minute, every day,
every month, every year, every end,

3680
03:33:47,800 --> 03:33:52,760
they're going to be collecting their data
from search engine, from Google Maps,

3681
03:33:53,160 --> 03:33:58,200
from Gmail accounts, from YouTube,
from all the places, from Google.

3682
03:33:58,200 --> 03:33:59,120
And I

3683
03:34:00,360 --> 03:34:01,520
we put all the things in there.

3684
03:34:01,520 --> 03:34:02,400
Great, great.

3685
03:34:02,400 --> 03:34:07,120
This is your density,
but Google can see your data and Google

3686
03:34:07,320 --> 03:34:11,400
see it obviously great YouTube,
your searching history, browsing history,

3687
03:34:11,760 --> 03:34:15,640
your every single thing what what you are
buying your seat on Google browser.

3688
03:34:16,040 --> 03:34:19,440
Everything is available
to Google right now.

3689
03:34:20,640 --> 03:34:21,240
Right.

3690
03:34:21,240 --> 03:34:23,480
So now you see all of these things.

3691
03:34:23,480 --> 03:34:38,120
They enable this part.

3692
03:34:38,120 --> 03:34:38,520
Great.

3693
03:34:38,640 --> 03:34:42,160
So now here you see they put microphone

3694
03:34:42,440 --> 03:34:46,160
right in the Google so they
they can voice your record as well.

3695
03:34:46,360 --> 03:34:48,600
They can record your voice is running.

3696
03:34:48,600 --> 03:34:51,840
So they have your voice.

3697
03:34:51,840 --> 03:34:54,840
The moment you put fingerprint,
they collect fingerprint

3698
03:34:57,920 --> 03:35:00,360
gunning, they collect your fingerprint,

3699
03:35:01,040 --> 03:35:04,960
they collect your voice, they've collected
all your browsing history.

3700
03:35:05,160 --> 03:35:06,320
They have your name,

3701
03:35:06,320 --> 03:35:09,800
they have your location,
they have every single thing about you.

3702
03:35:10,080 --> 03:35:14,200
Now, tell me
your data is being already shared

3703
03:35:14,200 --> 03:35:17,480
and you have been sharing
your data, have been sharing their data

3704
03:35:17,480 --> 03:35:21,080
with Google every single moment on

3705
03:35:21,120 --> 03:35:22,080
every single moment.

3706
03:35:22,080 --> 03:35:25,080
You're sharing your data with them,
correct them everything.

3707
03:35:25,320 --> 03:35:28,320
That's why Google Map GO provides.

3708
03:35:28,320 --> 03:35:32,120
Google provides
the API that created the API.

3709
03:35:32,120 --> 03:35:34,960
Explain to all over the world if you want

3710
03:35:36,520 --> 03:35:37,280
maps of

3711
03:35:37,280 --> 03:35:40,440
Google how many houses their streets,

3712
03:35:40,440 --> 03:35:43,920
their people, their locality,
their every single company.

3713
03:35:44,240 --> 03:35:48,560
First of all, to create the map made
to create an application like Google Map.

3714
03:35:48,560 --> 03:35:51,360
What you have to do,
you have to put a satellite in the space.

3715
03:35:51,720 --> 03:35:54,120
Then you have to collect the data
for all this space

3716
03:35:54,360 --> 03:35:57,920
that you have to into the data
and you have to make an application.

3717
03:35:58,080 --> 03:36:00,000
Then you have to send it, isn't it?

3718
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:03,000
And then the obligation really
in the very time digging deep.

3719
03:36:03,240 --> 03:36:03,800
Right.

3720
03:36:03,800 --> 03:36:06,880
So what they generally do
is to simply create application.

3721
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:11,160
They hire base from Google for Google,
they integrate their API

3722
03:36:11,160 --> 03:36:12,240
with the application.

3723
03:36:12,240 --> 03:36:15,960
Now they have all the flexibility,
all the president is from the Google.

3724
03:36:16,160 --> 03:36:19,120
So Google is building
this kind of space to work.

3725
03:36:19,280 --> 03:36:22,000
Google is selling this API
to this application,

3726
03:36:22,520 --> 03:36:25,200
to all the application
to all the companies now

3727
03:36:25,200 --> 03:36:28,240
millions of companies
are creating the application.

3728
03:36:28,400 --> 03:36:30,120
They are purchasing this API.

3729
03:36:30,120 --> 03:36:32,800
And the best part is
it's not a one time deal.

3730
03:36:33,080 --> 03:36:35,880
And then giving this APIs
to other companies.

3731
03:36:36,040 --> 03:36:41,120
What Google says you come, you want to use
how many times my API one hit

3732
03:36:41,280 --> 03:36:44,400
wants one click, so extend one click point

3733
03:36:44,400 --> 03:36:47,760
one $0 on me tens or maybe five.

3734
03:36:47,760 --> 03:36:48,520
Think.

3735
03:36:48,520 --> 03:36:52,640
Let's see, I have three for one click in
one application is average.

3736
03:36:52,760 --> 03:36:53,960
It's average there.

3737
03:36:53,960 --> 03:36:56,160
This application
make a hundred calls every day.

3738
03:36:56,160 --> 03:36:59,120
100 likes every day for one means $5,

3739
03:37:00,520 --> 03:37:01,680
one application, one

3740
03:37:01,680 --> 03:37:06,480
day making $5 to Google.

3741
03:37:06,480 --> 03:37:08,080
Just consider this.

3742
03:37:08,080 --> 03:37:10,160
Let's take a was case 1 million.

3743
03:37:10,160 --> 03:37:15,000
eBay's sold one day five for nothing.

3744
03:37:15,600 --> 03:37:19,760
This is the business
for Google, for nothing.

3745
03:37:19,760 --> 03:37:21,560
This is just one part.

3746
03:37:21,560 --> 03:37:23,400
This is just one part.

3747
03:37:23,400 --> 03:37:27,160
And this is the worst case,
even if you're doing nothing, nothing.

3748
03:37:27,160 --> 03:37:30,720
Still, they're making like millions

3749
03:37:33,240 --> 03:37:34,400
on it is happening

3750
03:37:34,400 --> 03:37:36,840
because of cashew, because of cookies,

3751
03:37:38,520 --> 03:37:40,200
industrial, despite

3752
03:37:40,200 --> 03:38:06,440
everyone.

3753
03:38:06,440 --> 03:38:07,080
Exactly.

3754
03:38:07,080 --> 03:38:11,120
Most of including.

3755
03:38:11,120 --> 03:38:13,440
That's the problem we all have.

3756
03:38:13,960 --> 03:38:17,320
We are shedding their data every day
but still complaining.

3757
03:38:17,320 --> 03:38:19,400
Don't share my information.

3758
03:38:19,400 --> 03:38:21,400
No one going to share the information.

3759
03:38:21,400 --> 03:38:23,800
You've already
share your information with everyone

3760
03:38:27,000 --> 03:38:31,280
right?

3761
03:38:31,280 --> 03:38:31,560
Right.

3762
03:38:31,560 --> 03:38:32,240
Based

3763
03:38:36,640 --> 03:38:37,440
any questions?

3764
03:38:37,440 --> 03:38:40,680
Okay. So far, global. You seem silent.

3765
03:38:40,920 --> 03:38:43,560
What happened?

3766
03:38:43,560 --> 03:38:44,480
If I use them

3767
03:38:46,040 --> 03:38:55,960
in a once?

3768
03:38:56,320 --> 03:39:00,840
You're not among us to get a job.

3769
03:39:00,840 --> 03:39:03,720
Let it be first. To get a job.

3770
03:39:03,720 --> 03:39:04,600
Anything can work.

3771
03:39:04,600 --> 03:39:08,280
All these things.

3772
03:39:08,280 --> 03:39:09,000
All right, Lucas.

3773
03:39:09,000 --> 03:39:15,000
Sorry to disturb you.

3774
03:39:15,000 --> 03:39:19,720
So I find this so I think.

3775
03:39:20,040 --> 03:39:22,160
Great. We have covered enough information.

3776
03:39:22,160 --> 03:39:25,680
I know it has been two and a half hours
without a break, and I would say to

3777
03:39:25,720 --> 03:39:28,600
you guys,
learning is also extracted here, right?

3778
03:39:28,840 --> 03:39:31,680
So we have covered
half an hour right from the Briggs

3779
03:39:31,840 --> 03:39:36,240
because we didn't do any break or they 20
minutes and 10 minutes pretty great.

3780
03:39:36,240 --> 03:39:37,440
We didn't make it.

3781
03:39:37,440 --> 03:39:41,160
So I think we have enough
if you have any questions you can ask

3782
03:39:41,160 --> 03:39:44,520
or maybe can have a bit class, no

3783
03:39:52,320 --> 03:39:53,840
split screen points.

3784
03:39:53,840 --> 03:39:56,040
I know that you know Schwinger
so saved them.

3785
03:39:57,000 --> 03:39:58,120
Saved them.

3786
03:39:58,200 --> 03:40:00,120
If you're saving right, it will work.
