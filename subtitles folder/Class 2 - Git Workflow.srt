1
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,200
Okay.

2
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,640
Hello. One.

3
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,760
Hi. I am Lily, Jimmy

4
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,800
and Lena.

5
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,920
And Lena and Anna.

6
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,640
I am Lupo.

7
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,840
Okay, so first of all,
are you guys able to hear me

8
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,800
out there?

9
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Okay, perfect.

10
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,760
And you can see my screen, too, right?

11
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,320
And the video.

12
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,880
Okay, perfect.

13
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:55,320
Perfect.

14
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,480
Great, great, great.

15
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:24,240
Hola, Michael.

16
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,320
Are you talking about Michael?

17
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:32,680
Right? See?

18
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,320
Are you

19
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:45,400
Hispanic?

20
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,480
Okay,
so, by the way, like you wrote Hispanic.

21
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:58,200
So I write it like his panic.

22
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,520
So Michael is panicking right now.

23
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,800
Okay, So let's see.

24
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,720
Still 55 students.

25
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,960
We need to wait,
I guess, for two, 3 minutes.

26
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,720
I mentioned that you guys should be

27
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,720
joining

28
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,760
Shark, but

29
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,240
let's wait for two more months

30
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,320
and then we'll start the session today.

31
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
We will be spending less time

32
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,200
chatting and in breaks
because we got a lot of stuff to cover.

33
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,360
And that's the reason

34
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:49,400
today we'll be doing a lot of work.

35
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah, actually, that's the problem.

36
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:12,880
Confused between evening and morning,
right?

37
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
Yeah, same here.

38
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,080
I'm even confused about the days. Right.

39
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,280
You know, these days.

40
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,880
Okay. Which days? Today.

41
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,520
And today's Wednesday, right?

42
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,760
Yeah, today's the second in the last class
with you.

43
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,640
Right.

44
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,840
Well, I suppose

45
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,840
this is how it is supposed to be,
but let's see.

46
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,200
Oh, I think that maybe we will be needing
one more class for debt

47
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,400
and we will see how today's session go.

48
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,880
And then I'll let you know
if I need to extend one class

49
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,840
or we are going to be good for, you know.

50
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,560
Yeah, but no, don't worry.

51
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,080
I'll, I'll be there with you and,
you know, coming classes

52
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,080
all the most really teaching
you selenium and all.

53
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,080
So I'll be taking classes for good again

54
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,320
when you are done with, you know, test

55
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,560
energy and cucumber.

56
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,360
So get totally comprises of seven classes

57
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,960
and 2 to 3 are
before you know in the start of that

58
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,200
and the rest of your
classes we schedule after

59
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,880
once you have

60
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,840
recovered you know
just energy and cucumber

61
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,640
and java

62
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,520
okay so yeah my timing was not correct.

63
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,320
I adjusted it today.

64
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,080
So that's why, you know, right now

65
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,120
you can slam.

66
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,720
I'm good.

67
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:59,640
How about you for on.

68
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,120
Okay, so let's wait one more minute
and then we'll discuss the homework.

69
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,840
So tell me,
how did you guys like all of you

70
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:18,200
try it out?

71
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,480
Okay.

72
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Leena,
I'm going to walk you through that. Okay.

73
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,440
So one thing
I was just going to the homeworks

74
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,440
that you guys posted, students
syntax tolerance gel.

75
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,680
One thing that I noticed is majority of
you have done it right,

76
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,680
but majority of you actually, you know,
you are in the wrong directories.

77
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,480
So I remember yesterday we discussed that

78
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,880
you need to decide
where to you want to create a repository

79
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,600
and that should be the one that contains

80
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,560
all the files of your Java project.

81
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,840
Right. Okay.

82
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,760
This is what we discussed yesterday,

83
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,880
but a lot of you

84
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,600
I saw that went inside s rc
and then you went inside.

85
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,640
You know com and then classes and there

86
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:23,840
you created a opposite free.

87
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,200
So was there any confusion about it?

88
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,720
Are you guys just, you know,

89
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:44,600
I did it by mistake.

90
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,120
That's

91
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,040
are you guys able to hear me?

92
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:10,680
Because I don't see any replies.

93
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,080
Okay, so I asked a question and

94
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:28,960
none of you replied, okay,
so let me repeat.

95
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,120
I said that I was going to your homeworks

96
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,440
and I witnessed that a lot of

97
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,680
you have done it correctly, but

98
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,680
some of you have made this mistake
that you chose

99
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,080
the wrong,
wrong place to create a repository.

100
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,320
Like remember I mentioned that

101
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,080
we need to be careful
where we want to create a repository.

102
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,360
It should be at the place where

103
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,760
all our Java codes are going to be so,

104
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,440
but a lot of

105
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,600
you, you did what you went inside,
you know, S.R.

106
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,400
C then com
and then you created the repository.

107
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:17,040
So this is what
you were not supposed to do?

108
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Yeah. I share your was correct.

109
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,600
So we so I think yours was also correct.

110
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,120
But some of you, you know,
you had this mistake

111
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:44,480
but that's, that's completely fine.

112
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,280
Albertini I think if, if I mentioned,
if I commented on that wrong

113
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,160
then means wrong.

114
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,040
If I did not comment, it means is correct.

115
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,960
Okay. Yes.

116
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,560
Today we will be learning
how to create the opposite tree.

117
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,600
Yeah, I'll be going over to that.

118
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,560
Okay guys.

119
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,680
So I think that.

120
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:06,960
Yeah.

121
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,720
Michael, you you went with way too far.

122
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,760
You should have stopped that job.

123
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,520
Is it okay, So don't worry, guys.

124
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,440
Today we will be reviewing that too.

125
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,800
And I hope
that it's going to get more clear.

126
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,720
Okay, So let's start our session
and we will start by

127
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,040
what we learned yesterday.

128
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,400
So first of all, guys, why do we need good

129
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
well, perfect

130
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,040
to keep track of our

131
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,280
Java course or they can be in

132
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,760
any other language, too, right.

133
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:11,640
And now let's come up with the question,
what is it?

134
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,040
And you'll get
are you already answered it?

135
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Git is a version control tool.

136
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,800
Why do we call get a volume control tool?

137
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,200
We discussed that because

138
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,560
when we added a code

139
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,200
every time it makes them amidst
it creates a new version of it.

140
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,040
Right?

141
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,040
And in order to have those all versions

142
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,760
saved on our computer,
we have a software which is good.

143
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,840
It keeps track of all of them.

144
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:49,440
That's why we call it a version
control tool.

145
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,400
Okay, so

146
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,400
when UNIX commands,

147
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,120
we learn one by one.

148
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,480
What's the first command that we learn?

149
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,400
It's the first one is PWT.

150
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,640
What does it do?

151
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,080
Yeah, Who am I was not basically,
you know, we won't be using that a lot.

152
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,240
So. Okay, so one by one, what does BW do?

153
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,960
Yeah,

154
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,360
exactly.

155
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,560
For the current location of terminal,

156
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,040
what's the second command
that we learn less

157
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,240
and what does let's do

158
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,640
listed contents of the folder in which

159
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,520
terminal is an

160
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:02,240
okay third 1cd

161
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,360
folder name.

162
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:16,800
What does this do?

163
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,040
It moves the terminal

164
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,280
to the folder

165
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,400
we mentioned.

166
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,120
Okay, at this point
I want to ask you guys one thing.

167
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,040
What if I write down D
and after that I give a folder name

168
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,360
which is not currently present
in the directory, which terminal is

169
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,720
which I really like.

170
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:51,000
Get Exactly.

171
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,120
It would tell me
no such file or directory.

172
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,720
Is there.

173
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,640
Exactly.

174
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,280
So are you guys clear about this?

175
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,360
Right that whenever you do c, d
and the folder name that

176
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,680
folder must be at that particular location
where the terminal is

177
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,840
perfect.

178
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,840
So now the last command

179
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,640
sorry, the second last command that learn

180
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,160
to the dot dot.

181
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,360
Perfect

182
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,240
moves the terminal

183
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,440
one step back.

184
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,920
And the fifth one was

185
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,720
c d tilde.

186
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,360
Right.

187
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:47,960
What does this command do?

188
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,600
Moves the terminal

189
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,800
200. Perfect.

190
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,640
What is open day?

191
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,920
Three days

192
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,920
OC main directory

193
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:29,480
where it lives.

194
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,200
Okay, so hundred trees, the location

195
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,720
there

196
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,120
when we start our terminal,
that is the location

197
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,960
where the terminal is by default

198
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,320
when we open it

199
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,000
is not the place where it is.

200
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,800
Okay?

201
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,720
Farhad It's not the place.

202
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,200
Forget is

203
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,600
it's the actually the location

204
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,760
where when you will open up your terminal.

205
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,840
The point from which it starts,
this is called your home directory.

206
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,720
Okay?

207
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,320
You will not go in detail
that what is the home directory right now?

208
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,920
Okay. Just, you know,

209
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,280
visualize it as such.

210
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,240
But now.

211
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,160
Okay.

212
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,480
So I guess anything else
that we discussed, guys, any anything else

213
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,080
or is this all.

214
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,880
I think that's all

215
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,560
we learned.

216
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,600
We are command
but that is just used to, you know,

217
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,760
clear the terminal.

218
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,840
And who am I told you

219
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,640
your name So.

220
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,840
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

221
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,640
We learned that.

222
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,120
What's our observatory?

223
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,240
Who can tell me that?

224
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:24,720
Very good.

225
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,400
Entered a storage.

226
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,200
Right.

227
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,040
And a let's get is a repository

228
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,480
right. It's

229
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,840
this video

230
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:58,560
repository.

231
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:58,840
Okay.

232
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,680
Get as vulnerable as a tree.

233
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,520
Okay, let's.

234
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,800
Let's.

235
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah.

236
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,120
Get is a tool that creates a repository.

237
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:28,120
So repository is actually part of get.

238
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,600
Yeah.

239
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,600
But the thing is that okay
let me explain it to you

240
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,640
more clearly

241
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,040
get is Yeah

242
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,880
that example of minion I get that but
that was just to clear out your concepts.

243
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,800
Actually when we install get that
particular repository that is created,

244
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,600
get is the one who is managing it
and doing every stop, right. So

245
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,360
if I talk
about, you know, computer in computer

246
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,280
is not going to install
a cover or something, right.

247
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,000
It there won't be any lock or something.

248
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,400
So it's just going to do what
it's going to create a folder for you.

249
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,480
Write a separate folder on your hardest,
which saves

250
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,400
all the data.

251
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,480
Do you agree?

252
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,960
Practically, there's not going to be
any cylinder or locker in the computer

253
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,400
get is just going to create a folder

254
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,960
where it can, you know, actually
save all the cores on your heart.

255
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,240
This.

256
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,400
Okay, So remember we talked about this.

257
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,680
We said get is up to let's say

258
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:57,600
version control to that

259
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,240
creates

260
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,760
a repository.

261
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,720
Okay so there is

262
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,640
this repository
located on our machines, right.

263
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,920
So we can see that it's

264
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,000
local repository surfing.

265
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,840
This means that you guys
did revise everything.

266
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,280
And I hope that you guys also watched
the video

267
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,440
that I showed right?

268
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,560
Okay, good. Good enough.

269
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,360
Did you guys learn from it?

270
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,320
Okay, perfect.

271
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,240
So this means that today's class
is going to go very smooth.

272
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,080
Okay, Have some. No worries.

273
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,280
You will be covering that in class on.

274
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,120
Okay.

275
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,640
So first of all, let's quickly
start our review, our homework.

276
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,440
Can someone just based

277
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,520
based on homework and chat
so that I can, you know,

278
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,320
show you that?

279
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,560
Sure.

280
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,920
If you your question
is going to be answered as we move on.

281
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:16,240
Okay.

282
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,560
No, I need the question.

283
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,600
Let me go to post start.

284
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,640
Let's see the question is.

285
00:27:26,640 --> 00:28:02,080
Yeah.

286
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,720
So the this
so this is the question for homework and

287
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,880
that briefly you know

288
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,040
I just two settings on my PC.

289
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,000
The problem in Slack
is that once you shift the channel,

290
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,120
it doesn't let you see the latest

291
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,080
comments. Okay.

292
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,520
Now I'm here for the purpose.

293
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,320
I know.

294
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,920
Just don't share your solution, guys
that don't share your solutions.

295
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,640
I have seen them all. Trust me.

296
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,240
I went to the channel
and I reviewed all your solutions.

297
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,000
Okay,
so the first thing that I'm going to do is

298
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,960
I'll open up my clips right?

299
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,240
Because most probably right now
I think I don't have any project.

300
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,640
So let's see if I have one

301
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:05,760
or not.

302
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:15,600
Yeah, clips.

303
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:15,960
Okay.

304
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,800
So I'll quickly just, you know, create
one project because I reinstalled my clips

305
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,120
and I don't have that Java visit,
so I'll create all of it.

306
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,320
You guys already have this project, right?

307
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:49,040
So you don't need to do it.

308
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,360
Okay,
So let's look at the question that we had.

309
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,600
Open your terminal
so simply, I'll go to search.

310
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,760
I'll open up my terminal.

311
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:07,160
Here it is.

312
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,960
Okay, Navigate to the folder where
you want to create that your transit free.

313
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,200
And I mentioned that.

314
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
Make sure you select the correct
directory.

315
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,160
You need to have it up
as a tree in the folder.

316
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,160
All the files
and folder of your Java project are

317
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,080
okay.

318
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,720
So what does this mean?

319
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,840
Where should I have my repository?

320
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:29,680
Which

321
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,080
we need to first of all, select

322
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,440
the point
where we want to create a repository.

323
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,320
And I mentioned that it.

324
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,240
This folder should be the one
which contains our Java project

325
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,600
and our Java project is in Eclipse. Right?

326
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,480
So first of all, what I'll do,
I'll say, okay, this is the project

327
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,040
that I want to create a repository for,
so I'll right click on it.

328
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,400
I'll go to properties

329
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,320
and I'll check the

330
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,280
location of this project.

331
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,800
So this is the location, right?

332
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,160
So this means that I need to create
repository inside

333
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:30,200
Java base. It.

334
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,760
Okay, so now

335
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,560
I'll open up my terminal and I'll see that
what's the current location?

336
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,280
So I'll do TWD

337
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,800
It says that it is in C users i.t user.

338
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,440
So what should be my next step?

339
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,200
What should I do?

340
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,560
I wanted to move to Atlas workspace,

341
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,360
so first I'll do else.

342
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,240
I'll see if eclipse workspace is in there.

343
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,720
Yes it is.

344
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,120
So now

345
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,560
if I wanted to move to Atlas Workspace,

346
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,240
I'll do CV at Lip's

347
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,480
Workspace.

348
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,640
Okay, good enough.

349
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,040
Now I want to do

350
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,680
pWt again to see if it has moved
into Atlas Workspace.

351
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,400
It has.

352
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,040
The next thing that

353
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,520
I want to do is to move to Java Basic.

354
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,240
So else again

355
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,480
and Java Basic is there.

356
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,800
So I'll do

357
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,080
Java based.

358
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,440
It. Okay.

359
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,120
Now at this point I'll do PWT.

360
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,400
I'll see my terminal is inside

361
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,840
Java Basic, right?

362
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,480
Yes, Jamie, you can you can simply use

363
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,640
KDR also, but you will
you should do that when you are exposed.

364
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,360
Okay.

365
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,000
In the start

366
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,120
I recommend that you use these commands
so that you know, you get more of an idea.

367
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,720
You can skip that, obviously.

368
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,240
Okay, so now I am inside Java busy.

369
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,360
I'll do else.

370
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,280
And this is the place where my binary
and source code are, right?

371
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,680
So we discussed yesterday
that we should create a repository

372
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,400
where all our Java project
files and codes are.

373
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,600
So should I go inside
FRC and then creator of the

374
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,320
or should I

375
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,480
created at this particular point

376
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,280
created now?

377
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,000
Right.

378
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:55,680
Perfect.

379
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,120
Okay.

380
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,520
So that was the homework
let's we'll continue our class

381
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:31,320
at from this point.

382
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,320
Okay so do you guys remember that
we discussed yesterday

383
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,920
that whenever we want to store our codes,
we will tell get to do that

384
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,640
and it is going to label
it and place it in the repository.

385
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,360
Right?

386
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:51,400
So there is one small thing
that we need to have in there.

387
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,040
We need to delegate that.

388
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,200
What is the
who is the actual person who is

389
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,240
working right now

390
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,720
and what is the email address
that he is using?

391
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,720
For example, let's say

392
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,840
there can be multiple users
who are using the same system

393
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,880
and working with it.

394
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,440
So what they need to do,
they have to configure it.

395
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,600
They have to pass their own users
username and email address.

396
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,120
So the very first step that we have to do

397
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,120
is we need to configure git.

398
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,960
Don't worry about that hassle.

399
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,760
I'll explain it to you later.

400
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,520
So before we start using it,

401
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:46,640
we need to configure it.

402
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,520
This configuration
is all only going to be done

403
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:56,200
once.

404
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Once you have configured your get,
you guys do

405
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,240
not need to consider it again

406
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,960
unless and until you uninstall it.

407
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,400
Okay.

408
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,800
Because you are the one
who is working on your computer

409
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,120
and you will be continuously working on
that just in case.

410
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:16,000
If you want to change your username
password, then you, you may,

411
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,800
you know, change the configuration,

412
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,760
but else you won't need that.

413
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:34,360
So are you guys ready to configure, get?

414
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,040
Okay, so the first configuration is

415
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,120
to give our user name.

416
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,800
This can be done using the command

417
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,080
get configured

418
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,040
dash dash global

419
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,560
user name

420
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,800
and after that you are going to pass

421
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,120
and the user name

422
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,680
and whatever you want to.

423
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,880
Okay,

424
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,000
So I'm going to copy this command

425
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,360
and I'm going to paste it into life chat,

426
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,120
copy it and

427
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:48,240
along with me, open up your terminals.

428
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,080
Do not paste it yet, okay?

429
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:59,680
Do not paste it.

430
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,440
Have you guys open up your terminal?

431
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,280
Okay.

432
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,800
First of all, let's go to the home
directory

433
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:25,200
using CD Tilde,
let me know when you guys have done that.

434
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,240
No clear is just going to clear.

435
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,240
You know your terminal and two Tilde

436
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,760
is going to bring the term
of that at home.

437
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,440
Okay. Now

438
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
you can paste the command

439
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,080
or, you know, type it manually, get config

440
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,320
dash, dash global

441
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,760
user dot name.

442
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,360
And then after that, in inverted

443
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,480
commas,
you are going to give your own user name.

444
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,320
Okay.

445
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,160
So I have given my username

446
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,280
so you are going to write yours.

447
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,320
Once you have written this press enter

448
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,000
and let me know.

449
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,640
This command
is not going to give you any output.

450
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,360
Okay.

451
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:45,680
So there should be no error, no output.

452
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,880
We need to give good

453
00:39:48,920 --> 00:40:04,280
our email address.

454
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,520
I should write with small g

455
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,760
straight the screenshot.

456
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:25,080
I was sure the screenshot.

457
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,360
Okay.

458
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,760
So for that we have get on the dash. Dash

459
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,000
guys who are having issues in that.

460
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,320
Can you share your screenshot in support?

461
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,800
And also over here
you need to show the screenshot to others.

462
00:40:46,800 --> 00:41:20,000
I can not help you out.

463
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,840
Give me yours is good.

464
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:33,480
There's no I don't see a problem in there.

465
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,640
Do I make up user name or use user
name from it?

466
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,160
You have to give

467
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,400
a user name.

468
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,120
It can be your own user name.

469
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,320
You need to make it up,
but make sure that it

470
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,200
so you don't write one like writing one.

471
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,360
That said, I my own user name,
you can give your nickname or whatever,

472
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,400
just don't type in user name.

473
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,800
Okay.

474
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,720
Helmet your problem is first of all,

475
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,880
I told you to do CD Tilde.

476
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,360
It was CD space that you did CD
Tilde direction.

477
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,800
Okay.

478
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,120
The next problem
is that you use get config

479
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,360
dash dash global user name
and you give my user name.

480
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,520
Whereas I mentioned
that you have to give your own user name.

481
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,480
Okay.

482
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:35,640
And that's your problem.

483
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,160
Okay.

484
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,400
So I see that
what you guys are doing wrong.

485
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,760
Okay.

486
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,760
So stop
everything about whatever you are doing.

487
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,160
Stop everything and listen to me, okay?

488
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,000
Give me one minute.

489
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,240
Everyone, please.

490
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,280
Please, guys, just stop typing and doing
whatever you are.

491
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:07,200
Just just pay attention
to what I'm going to say right now.

492
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:14,880
Do I have your attention?

493
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,280
Okay, Very good. Now, listen to me.

494
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,200
This is really easy, okay?

495
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,160
This stuff is actually very easy.

496
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,760
We are just doing configuration.

497
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,960
You will be making mistakes if you are not
going to follow my instructions.

498
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,480
It's okay.

499
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,840
So just hear me out first.

500
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,240
I am sure that I'm speaking.

501
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,240
So I'm giving you time.

502
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,520
Hear me out First,
make sure that your command on

503
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,440
desktop has run perfectly fine
and then only follow the next step.

504
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,120
Okay. First of all,
you need to hear me out.

505
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,200
So I'm going to do the configuration again
for you guys.

506
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,600
And this time I really want you guys to,
you know, keep up with me, okay?

507
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,240
We can do this together
and we can quickly wrap this up.

508
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,640
Are we on?

509
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,800
Okay, so let's do it in this way.

510
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,680
Okay.

511
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,880
Let's let's close our terminals,
Let everyone close their terminals.

512
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,160
Let's do it from scratch.

513
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,520
Okay. Close your terminals.

514
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,160
And now open it up.

515
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,480
Now open your terminals.

516
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:41,560
Let me know
when you have opened your terminals.

517
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,080
Very good.

518
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,840
Very good. Okay.

519
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,920
Everyone is done with that. Now

520
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,360
we need to configure our using them right.

521
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,080
The command to do that is

522
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,240
git config dash

523
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,400
dash global user dot name.

524
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,280
And then in inverted commas
you are going to give a user name

525
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,520
that you want.

526
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,240
Okay.

527
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,200
Now make sure that user name
is not having spaces.

528
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,160
It can have space,
but make sure it does not okay

529
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,040
and make sure that these spaces
are also kept clear of this.

530
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,000
This is very sensitive,
guys, these commander, very sensitive.

531
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,120
You cannot write them without spaces.

532
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,240
Okay, So you are going to have error
if you are going to give spaces.

533
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,280
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to send this to you

534
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,560
as it is
so that you do not make any mistake.

535
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,760
Okay, I'm going to send it to you,

536
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,040
but make

537
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,760
sure that you replace the user name
that you want

538
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,400
with the correct user
name of your own twice.

539
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,520
I'm going to do that also in front of you.

540
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,680
So I'll open up my terminal

541
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,600
and I'll paste this command over here.

542
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,200
Let me know when you have pasted
this command.

543
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,240
Okay? Do not press enter.

544
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:24,120
Do not do anything else.

545
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,960
Now delete
only the stuff that is between inverted

546
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:44,080
commas.

547
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:44,400
Okay.

548
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,520
Let them make sure
that you do not make any syntax

549
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,360
mistake.

550
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,080
Okay.

551
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,440
After you have deleted it is anymore
everyone still

552
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,440
this one's with me.

553
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,720
You guys have deleted everything and

554
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,080
between the inverted commas
are we go to this point.

555
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,400
Now let's write down
the user name of our own twice.

556
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,800
So my name is Muslim,
so I'll be giving the user name

557
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,760
of my own name.

558
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,520
Yes, it is Dash. Dash Global.

559
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,360
I, I think that it's double dash
but not showing

560
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,840
over here that it's double dash.

561
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,840
Okay. So yeah, I think

562
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,320
on pasting it did not show up right?

563
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,720
So we'll correct it.

564
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,000
Let me know
when you guys have written down

565
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,320
the username

566
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,640
then.

567
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:52,440
Now make sure that this Dash global
is actually dash dash.

568
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,560
Just make sure of that

569
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,080
after giving the name user name,
just make sure that this is dash.

570
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,440
Dash.

571
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,800
I think in copying and pasting
it did not go right.

572
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,760
Are we all good?

573
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,200
Is everyone has everyone
to enter their username and this dashed

574
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,440
dash made this correction okay,

575
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,440
now let's press enter.

576
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,800
This camera should run without any output

577
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:50,640
and please do not do anything else.

578
00:48:50,640 --> 00:49:02,600
Mohammad shared a screenshot.

579
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,480
Okay. Really good. Thank you guys.

580
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:14,160
See it and helped you write.

581
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,880
Now we know how to

582
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:17,880
you know

583
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,520
how the process should go.

584
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
Manmohan, I'm waiting for you.

585
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,200
Just simply share the screenshot.

586
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,880
Yeah, in notes it's

587
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,680
at least two,
but it's actually combining them.

588
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,040
But I should do this.

589
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,160
Nice. I think more a

590
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,440
okay, so

591
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,600
decode was to have posted in the support.

592
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,720
Okay. It's not.

593
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,040
I did.

594
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:19,880
Come on

595
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,360
did call big.

596
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,360
Okay so you are having no space
between configure

597
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,640
index dash global

598
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:43,200
gesture issue.

599
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,080
Okay guys. So make sure that you are
having the correct spaces.

600
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,400
Come on.

601
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:55,160
It is simple, right?

602
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,600
Kazim. You can also follow, follow it.

603
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:09,360
Whatever we are doing, the

604
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,280
okay, so Mohammad,

605
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:21,600
you are not having a space in between
configuring that as global.

606
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,160
Okay, So is there anyone on the support?

607
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,320
Let's see what caches there, I guess.

608
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,600
Okay, so gas, please help the student.

609
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:34,120
And I think I have spent
a lot of time on this.

610
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,200
Guys. This this is simple, right?

611
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:48,920
So we need to move forward forward.

612
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,960
What is this output like?

613
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,560
Are you on your on your terminal

614
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,160
to open up your terminal again and

615
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,840
and show me the output?

616
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:16,080
It means that you have entered
the wrong syntax

617
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,160
since

618
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,680
we are not going to do email part
right now.

619
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,600
Guys, I don't want you to.

620
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:56,280
I don't want you guys to, you know,
some of you lagging behind

621
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,560
and some of you moving ahead
because this is just the starting of.

622
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,200
Yeah, I don't want you to be confused
about it, so we'll move slow.

623
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,240
Okay.

624
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,320
How many of you are still having problem?

625
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,680
Raise
your hand. Let's get to work quickly.

626
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,440
Okay, Let's go. Get over it.

627
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,200
To how many of you are having a problem?

628
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,440
One to anyone else.

629
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,320
Okay, fine.

630
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,000
Those of you are having a problem.

631
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,240
I'll do it again.

632
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,280
Just follow me
very, very vigilantly. Okay?

633
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:35,960
Open up

634
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,600
your terminals.

635
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,960
Open up your terminal.

636
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,960
Once you have opened it up.

637
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,920
Now what you need to do.

638
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,160
I'll. I'll. I'll tell you.

639
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,600
Yeah. Open up your terminals. Right.

640
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,520
Everyone who was having problem.

641
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,040
Okay. Now

642
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,080
type in. Get

643
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,560
then give space,

644
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,680
then confirm

645
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,320
after config again space.

646
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:40,840
Then you need to type in dash dash.

647
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:47,520
Then you have to write for space Global.

648
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,440
Then you need to give space
and type in user dot

649
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:53,880
name.

650
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,840
And then after that inverted commas

651
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,920
you have to give your user name.

652
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,200
And I mentioned that
please do not have space

653
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,680
in your user name,

654
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,560
so I'll give the user name

655
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,760
and I'll closed in what it comments.

656
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,280
Okay.

657
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:30,640
Now press enter.

658
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:39,840
Okay.

659
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,960
Now we need to configure our email address
also.

660
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,760
Let's quickly do that Tenga.

661
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,520
See your you guys will be making just this
index mistake.

662
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,880
Please, please make sure
that you are not making any mistake.

663
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,080
I have written everything.

664
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,680
If there is an error, make sure
that you are writing the correct syntax.

665
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,480
Andrew.
Your error is going to get resolved.

666
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,720
Don't panic.

667
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,560
Daunting
that okay. It's not working for me.

668
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,760
What should I do?

669
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,920
Just make sure that you are writing down,
you know,

670
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:20,720
the correct syntax.

671
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,680
Yeah. Just take a deep breath. Okay.

672
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,200
So now the next command that we have
is did

673
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,760
config dash, dash global

674
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:37,360
email dot address.

675
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,000
No. No.

676
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,280
Its user dot email.

677
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,520
And then you need to in place of your

678
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:53,400
user name,
you need to now give your valid email.

679
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,480
So I'm going to give my world an email

680
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,880
and you are going to give your own valid

681
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,200
email.

682
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,480
Answered that assignment.

683
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,160
Don't worry.

684
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,520
After that press enter.

685
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,400
Let me know when you are done with this.

686
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,080
Come on guys.

687
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:19,360
It should be real quick now because it's
the same one as you typed above.

688
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:26,520
Just its user dot email.

689
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,640
Okay, good.

690
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,640
So what does this do?

691
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,640
We are telling it that
whatever caused you were will be saving.

692
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,720
You need to mark them by my username
and by email.

693
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,160
Okay.

694
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,720
So this is the
just the basic configuration that we made.

695
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,080
It's a one time thing.

696
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,200
You will not be doing it ever again.

697
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:58,680
Okay.

698
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,920
Yeah, you are good. Go. Okay, perfect.

699
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,640
Ten got.

700
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,440
Now let's move forward.

701
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,080
Okay, guys. So

702
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,560
tracking our first project

703
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,480
using get.

704
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,760
So let's start the interesting part
and which is start

705
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,080
to track our first project using it.

706
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,120
Okay.
This was the configuration that we made.

707
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,840
Now, the first step that I need to do is

708
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,320
I need to open up my eclipse, right?

709
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,280
Because this is the place
where my Java codes are

710
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:44,200
right?

711
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:48,520
Okay, so now

712
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,680
what should be my very first step

713
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:00,560
is who's going to tell me

714
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:01,800
the first step

715
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,400
is this first step to navigate my terminal

716
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,680
to the folder
where I want to create the repository

717
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:35,280
right? So

718
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,080
this is my project,

719
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,080
Java visit, which I want to, you know,
keep track of.

720
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,520
I'll open up properties

721
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,920
and this is the path
to which I want to navigate.

722
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,480
So we have done it over and over again,
guys.

723
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,440
So I want you to quickly be able
to navigate to this point.

724
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,920
So I'll do PWT right now.

725
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,960
For me, it's it users outside c d

726
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,720
eclipse workspace

727
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,360
and then see the

728
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,320
Java basics.

729
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:22,200
And once I am inside Java, this is out
to LS to make sure that bin and SRT ad

730
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,880
are there at this point.

731
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,560
For those of you
who do not have Java visit,

732
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,600
you can go inside any project

733
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,800
that you have on your

734
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,520
eclipse.

735
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:42,360
Okay.

736
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:46,120
But make sure that you have reached
the current location.

737
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:47,480
Okay.

738
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,680
Once you guys have done this, let me know.

739
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,760
I'm giving you one minute
to reach this point so that we can,

740
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:02,640
you know, all work together.

741
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:52,560
Very good.

742
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,440
Auto capitalization
is working at this point.

743
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,240
Start me.

744
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,200
Okay, so now I'll open up my terminal.

745
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,880
I know that my terminal is right now
at the correct location.

746
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,880
I want to create a repository
at that point.

747
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,840
So I simply use
the common good space in it

748
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,560
and I'll

749
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:24,600
press enter.

750
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:30,960
Now I'll be shown a message
initialized, empty, get repository

751
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,280
in c users i t users equity floor space

752
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:52,800
no job it don't get.

753
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,160
Okay.

754
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,440
Have you guys done this?

755
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,800
All of you

756
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:02,360
successfully initialized repository.

757
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,360
So running this command
is going to make the repository over there

758
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,280
very simple and very easy.

759
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,200
Right.

760
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,920
And these serious
being in the support. Okay

761
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:19,640
Michael

762
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,640
you are good
it seems that initialized good repository.

763
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,680
Some of you may be seeing some hints
and warnings.

764
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,560
Don't worry about that.

765
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:58,760
Okay.

766
01:03:58,760 --> 01:03:59,000
Okay.

767
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,120
Once we have created the repository,
now what we want, we want to

768
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,080
get to save our codes in that that one.

769
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:07,680
Right?

770
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:19,000
This is what we want.

771
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:19,720
Okay.

772
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:26,880
For that, we have just two commands.

773
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,600
Get add space dot

774
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,720
and the other command is

775
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,360
get comment

776
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:43,600
dash M along with a commit message
that we have to make.

777
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,240
What is a commit commit is actually

778
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,720
saving our course to the repository.

779
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,680
Okay.

780
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,520
What is the comment

781
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,520
saving codes to the repository.

782
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,480
So whenever I see
now that we need to make a commit,

783
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,840
what does this mean?

784
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,400
Is if you are having problems support,
you need to post in support.

785
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,040
So whenever
I see you need to break a commit,

786
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,480
it means that you need to save
go to the repository.

787
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,880
Very good.

788
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,120
So now let's open up our terminal

789
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,000
and now let's do it.

790
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:37,040
Add space dot.

791
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:41,520
Make sure that there is space
between get and add and add

792
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:57,720
and dot.

793
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:06,200
Let's press enter.

794
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,960
Don't worry about that
if you like the master,

795
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,720
but I have not explain anything yet. Okay.

796
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,080
Just make sure that you are following me
step by step.

797
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,800
You are not missing out on a step.

798
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:23,080
Only you have to make sure of that.

799
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,800
It may be different for, you know,

800
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,560
some of you and me.

801
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,880
That's totally fine.

802
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,320
This is because of,
you know, different values and stuff.

803
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,640
I explain to you later.

804
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,200
Okay,
so the next command that we discussed

805
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,920
in order to save our codes in
repository is good comment.

806
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:46,840
Dash M with the message.

807
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,160
Let's first

808
01:06:50,640 --> 01:07:04,800
comment.

809
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:18,840
Let me know
when you guys have written this. Yes.

810
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,600
With space.

811
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,320
With space is everything
should have space.

812
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:27,120
Get space command space, dash and space

813
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,800
in what it commands
and in there commit message.

814
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,040
Now press enter.

815
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,440
You'll see something like this
message master would come in

816
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,680
first command
Something like this will appear.

817
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,640
Yes, that one dash not not double dash.

818
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,440
Okay.

819
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:51,080
This is the proof
that you have successfully

820
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:55,360
saved your code in the repository.

821
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:08,400
So tell me, guys, is it difficult?

822
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,640
All right. So easy

823
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,040
now if you want to.

824
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,240
Okay, I'm leaning. Don't worry you.

825
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:21,440
I'll be going going over to it
multiple times.

826
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,080
Just make sure that you get
your issue resolved immediately.

827
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,080
Mine says authorized entity own unknown.

828
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:32,960
Yes. The manner that is because you
I think you did not

829
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,120
maybe configure your good gate correctly.

830
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:40,720
Okay.

831
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:41,240
Okay guys.

832
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,920
So now if you want,
get to show us everything

833
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,320
that it has saved in the repository.

834
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,720
We have a command for that.

835
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:55,680
Also.

836
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,720
And what is that command?

837
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:18,080
It is good space law.

838
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,840
So I want you guys to write down,
get space log

839
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:31,400
and press, enter.

840
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,360
Now, do you see that?

841
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:37,560
It says that author is Muslims Hardy

842
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,120
whose email addresses this one

843
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,840
date is Wednesday October.

844
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,000
Whatever time you're

845
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,280
and along with the

846
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:56,040
message dated please.

847
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,120
So now do you see that
what we discuss about get

848
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:06,440
how it's automatically doing that
we just need to type in some commands

849
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,480
and it's going to take your everything,
labeling them

850
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:21,680
and whatever.

851
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:26,760
Yes. And Maria, it's correct for you.

852
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,280
That's fine. That's fine.

853
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,720
If you are having other,
you know, a lot of classes, that's fine.

854
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,960
The only thing is that

855
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:43,760
you should be displayed message.

856
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,880
Okay, Fatma, your problem is that
you have not configured

857
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:52,800
your terminal correctly.

858
01:10:52,800 --> 01:11:05,720
Jimmy Most probably because
you have not considered it correctly.

859
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,240
Yeah. I think you, you did not do this
crap.

860
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,160
Okay, so

861
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:12,440
what is this?

862
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,960
We will learning it

863
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,560
when we move out in the past.

864
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:20,320
Okay. So at this point
I want to tell you guys something.

865
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,720
I just wanted to show it
very quickly to you that.

866
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:24,760
Making permits in the repository

867
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:27,280
and by commit,
I mean saving your codes in the app.

868
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,000
It is really simple.

869
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,400
So you guys get really comfortable
when we move forward.

870
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,680
Now what we will be doing is
we will be understanding that

871
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,040
how it's actually working at the back end,

872
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:46,200
you know,
if if we know how to do something,

873
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,720
just, you know, without knowing in-depth
that what is happening at the back end,

874
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,080
it's going to be really problematic for us
when we don't deal with our stuff.

875
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,880
So it's important also to

876
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,800
learn that how the things are working
when we are working with these commands.

877
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:12,000
Do you guys agree?

878
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,160
So we must learn that too.

879
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,680
We are going to jump into that and today
we will be going over to this a lot,

880
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,360
making some bad comments,
creating repository and, you know,

881
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:27,440
running these commands and again and again
get add dot get come in.

882
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,200
We will be running these commands
again and again.

883
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:36,320
So those of you who are still, you know,
having struggling, do not panic, okay?

884
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,320
You will get along.

885
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,640
So let's do one thing at this point.

886
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,240
Let's go for a break.

887
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,160
And meanwhile

888
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,240
I can resolve, you know, help out students
who are having difficulties.

889
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,400
And after the break, we'll continue
with our lesson and will, you know,

890
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,360
try to learn everything else.

891
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,480
So are we good?

892
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:03,240
Let's let's go for a great guys
for 15 minutes.

893
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,000
Okay. So I am your new great manager.

894
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:11,720
That role is, you know,
now should be transferred to me.

895
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,600
Eight of five.

896
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:27,680
So let's meet at.

897
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,120
Yes. You mean you can.

898
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,480
Are you guys back?

899
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:36,120
I'm back from break.

900
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,200
Okay. Never left. Wow. Great.

901
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,400
Hardworking students. Good. Okay, guys. So

902
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:43,680
in the break,

903
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:48,680
I hope that everyone issues resolve
and you guys are now have now successfully

904
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:51,320
configured your good
and made the first comment

905
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,240
that is saving the codes in your app
observatory.

906
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,800
I am I write about it

907
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,360
very good.

908
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:07,320
Very good.

909
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:15,400
Now we will be doing step by step.

910
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,320
Okay so attend to that.

911
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,360
I'm sorry, but your what you need to do is

912
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,600
you need to press control. See,

913
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,520
that is going to take you out of this.

914
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,520
And the command is actually get come
a dash and push to make whatever you see.

915
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,680
This sign is actually my cursor
that is being you know

916
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:41,880
displayed.

917
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:42,440
Okay, guys.

918
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:46,080
So anyone who is still having issues
please support is the way to go.

919
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,760
Now We will be moving forward. Okay.

920
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,560
I'm still giving
you guys support in the live chat

921
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,520
because this is just
the starting of our class with kid

922
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,080
and you know, I don't want you guys
anyone to be left behind.

923
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,240
I want all of you to be with me
when I go into the actual concepts.

924
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:08,400
So now it is that time, and I hope
that I did my best to bring you all

925
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,440
to the point where we can actually start,
you know, the technical stuff.

926
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,400
So from now onwards,

927
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:19,080
please be very vigilant,
be very attentive.

928
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,000
I don't want you guys
making any syntax mistake and

929
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,040
such kind of mistakes because

930
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,240
we have spent a lot of time on that
and clearing that out by now.

931
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:33,640
It should be really you know, you guys,
you guys should be comfortable with that.

932
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:34,880
Okay.

933
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,040
So whatever I do you have to follow that.

934
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,680
You guys have to follow that. Okay.

935
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:42,120
And you have to understand
what I'm telling you.

936
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:47,000
So I'm going to close this terminal

937
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:55,320
and I want you guys also to do the same.

938
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:02,360
Yes. Regarding as long as I'm recording.

939
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,960
So let me know when you have closed it.

940
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,160
Okay, good.

941
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:08,240
Now open up

942
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:19,560
your eclipse.

943
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,440
Have you guys open up your eclipse?

944
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,160
Done.

945
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,720
Okay, so here's what we are going to do.

946
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:31,160
We will be creating a new project,
a new Java project from scratch,

947
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,320
and we will write down some code in it

948
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:39,240
and then we will track it using get. Why?

949
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,400
Because I want that.

950
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,840
All of you should have that project. Okay.

951
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,800
So right now let's pick on file

952
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:52,840
New and then Java project.

953
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,280
I hope that by now you guys know
how to create a Java project, right?

954
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,560
That's simple. So

955
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,160
let's give up the name, get

956
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:32,400
project.

957
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,160
Okay. So it says that. Yes.

958
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:35,760
Okay.

959
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,720
So did project with a lowercase,

960
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:55,520
which.

961
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,400
Okay.

962
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:11,160
Are you guys done to this point?

963
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,320
Jimmy It shows you new project.

964
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,920
You have to just flip on the I good.

965
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:23,640
Do you guys have this now on your system.

966
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:27,280
Okay so now let's do this

967
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,640
right click on our SIRC

968
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:35,760
and let's create a new class.

969
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:54,600
Right click on SIRC, new class.

970
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,680
No, no,

971
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,040
we can.

972
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,080
But you know, we are learning it.

973
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:01,080
We are not focusing right now on the

974
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,480
you know coding stuff.

975
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,600
It's just,
you know, just creating a project.

976
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,680
So just go with the class right away.

977
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,400
Let's do it.

978
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:11,760
Good.

979
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:12,840
You want

980
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
okay.

981
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,720
And let's click on finished

982
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:51,000
get zero one.

983
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:59,880
You can limit any anything you want to.

984
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:04,040
Okay, guys, I simply created a project,
a Java project,

985
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,760
and I created one class in it.

986
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,680
Okay. Nothing else. It's simple.

987
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,160
You guys already have done it
multiple times.

988
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,080
So I'm.

989
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:16,080
I'm supposing that you know, it.

990
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,160
Okay, so let's write down

991
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:22,440
a very, very, you know, basic code in it

992
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:46,120
actually.

993
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:46,920
Okay.

994
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,040
So I just wrote down system
that out of print.

995
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,280
Alan Hello Joe Batch 11 Nothing difficult,

996
01:20:53,280 --> 01:21:09,000
nothing complicated.

997
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,760
Okay, so now let's, you know,

998
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:15,840
let's assume
that this is the code that we wrote

999
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,680
and now we want to

1000
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:42,320
track it.

1001
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,080
Okay?

1002
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:48,920
So in order to track this project,
what should be my first step, guys?

1003
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,240
What should the first step?

1004
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,560
You only know it.

1005
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,520
We have done it like 15 to 16 times now.

1006
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:03,120
At least. Yes.

1007
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,520
Perfect. Miriam.

1008
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,320
Very good.

1009
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,800
Navigate.

1010
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:09,560
All right.

1011
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:11,520
Terminal

1012
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,520
two location there.

1013
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:22,000
We want to create the representing.

1014
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,520
So now I'm going to do this. How?

1015
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,960
First of all, I'll open up my eclipse.

1016
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,240
Then I will.

1017
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:34,320
Right on get project
and I'll click on properties.

1018
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:35,720
Okay.

1019
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,680
Who is going to tell me that what I did so

1020
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:43,560
why did I do that?

1021
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,000
That I went to great project in my place.

1022
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,960
I clicked on properties and this

1023
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,280
because I want the location
where my project is right

1024
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,120
Simple.

1025
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:02,400
Okay, so what should I do now?

1026
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,960
I want to navigate my terminal over here,

1027
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,440
so I'll open up my terminal

1028
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,000
pwt I two users.

1029
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,920
Alice

1030
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,560
Now for me it's Eclipse

1031
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,560
Workspace.

1032
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,640
Okay, I'm inside Atlas Workspace
and now Ellis

1033
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,880
BWT again, I am inside it.

1034
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:41,400
Perfect.

1035
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:46,640
Now let's add in to see that I have
the folder get project Angela Bissett.

1036
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,680
So now which command do I use to

1037
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,680
change my folder?

1038
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,880
What will be my command

1039
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,440
CV and what will be the name of folder?

1040
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,160
Yes, perfect CD

1041
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,800
Good project.

1042
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,640
Okay,

1043
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:10,960
now I'll do Ellis again.

1044
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:15,160
So guys, is this the right location
where I want to create the repository

1045
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:28,200
repository?

1046
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,000
Yes, this is the right location
because I want my repository

1047
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,960
to have everything
which is inside this project.

1048
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:41,960
Okay, So

1049
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:46,640
now I'll also explain you guys,
everything that is actually happening.

1050
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:51,040
I just closed that back
pain lane to minimize eclipse and

1051
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:53,760
you know,

1052
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,440
I'll open up the whiteboard

1053
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,360
and I'll just draw some stuff

1054
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:32,040
for you, okay?

1055
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:37,480
So over here
I will try to make you guys visualize

1056
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:40,320
what is actually happening at the back
end of it.

1057
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,400
Okay.

1058
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,120
So if I open up quickly
the location of my project

1059
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:49,920
and Explorer,
uh, you guys don't need to do that.

1060
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,000
I'm just doing it.

1061
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:51,720
Show it to you.

1062
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:57,600
Okay.

1063
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,800
Okay. So this is what I get project.

1064
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,720
And over here, I have some files,

1065
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,600
dot settings been SA C-class bad

1066
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:13,680
dot project right.

1067
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:17,200
So I can copy dispatched

1068
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,840
and I can see that this folder is actually

1069
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,160
the current folder
that we are dealing with

1070
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,600
and it has.

1071
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:37,200
Let me draw this
folder buying binary file.

1072
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,600
Let's limit binary

1073
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,640
and the source file.

1074
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,440
And what other files do we have?

1075
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,000
Dark last that dark project and settings.

1076
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:51,880
Okay.

1077
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,760
For now, I'm just ignoring these files off

1078
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,320
with the extension dot flashback
dot on dot settings.

1079
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:03,360
Okay.

1080
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:07,840
I'm just ignoring them.

1081
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:14,160
Are you guys with me?

1082
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:23,360
Very good.

1083
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,680
Okay, so we have moved our terminal
to this location

1084
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,160
right?

1085
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:34,120
So what I'll do

1086
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,520
if I want to

1087
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:42,560
create a repository over here,
what I'll do.

1088
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,720
Do you guys remember
what was a step that we do

1089
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,520
get in it.

1090
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,880
So number two step is get in it

1091
01:27:53,840 --> 01:28:03,840
to create a repository.

1092
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,400
So let me first show you that
what will happen when we do get it.

1093
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,200
So let's say I run the command git in it

1094
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:17,800
as soon as

1095
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:25,560
I run the command, get it in this folder.

1096
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,920
What happened is there comes a new folder

1097
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,280
and this folder is

1098
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:38,760
dot git.

1099
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:43,480
As soon as I run
the command, get in there,

1100
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:48,240
it creates git creates
a new folder called DOT.

1101
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:54,360
Get in the location of my project.

1102
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:55,640
Is it understood?

1103
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,400
Yes. Sebastian.

1104
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:02,000
Just you know of giving you guys
the concept.

1105
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:08,360
Okay, so let's do this

1106
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:19,280
and also visualize it.

1107
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:23,040
I'm going to type and get in it

1108
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:28,400
and I'll press enter.

1109
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:28,720
Okay.

1110
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,000
So I need to go to view

1111
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,760
and click on Hidden hidden items

1112
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,120
and then I'll see a dot git folder.

1113
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:41,160
It's hidden,
so I have to make it visible view

1114
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,000
and then click on hidden items from Mac
users.

1115
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,960
You can

1116
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:50,760
command Shift
DOT is going to show you hidden files

1117
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:12,720
for hard.

1118
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:15,320
If if you created a new project

1119
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,960
and you never used git in it,
then you should not be having it.

1120
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,840
Okay.

1121
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:24,840
It means that you did not follow
the instructions correctly.

1122
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,440
So what you can do is
you can just delete this folder.

1123
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:31,680
So guys, deleting this border
going to actually delete the repository

1124
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:37,080
and you can initialize it again.

1125
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:40,040
Okay, So let's continue

1126
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,440
at this point.

1127
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:47,520
Now you guys are mature enough
to understand

1128
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:51,480
the architecture of it.

1129
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:55,000
So now let me explain you
the architecture update before we move

1130
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,800
any further.

1131
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:12,600
So what do you understand
by the architecture?

1132
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:15,600
When I say architecture object,
what what do you guys understand

1133
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,280
the structure, right?

1134
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:22,800
How it has been actually
so good has actually at three

1135
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:24,600
stage

1136
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:38,400
architecture.

1137
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:43,920
Now let's have a look at that
as soon as we run, don't get command.

1138
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,080
This folder does create.

1139
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,520
This folder creates incentives

1140
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,400
folder behind the scenes,
which is not visible to us.

1141
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,480
What is happening.

1142
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,840
These two things also are created

1143
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,080
inside this folder.

1144
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:06,880
One is called the staging area
and the other one is called

1145
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:21,560
the repository.

1146
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:26,200
Okay guys, are we good to this point?

1147
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,680
Everything in this make making sense,
right?

1148
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:35,600
Okay, so

1149
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,960
this is called staging area.

1150
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,160
This is called repository.

1151
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:43,200
You get to know that how they are working

1152
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:46,960
and the area where our original files are.

1153
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,960
This area is called
what do we call this area?

1154
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,640
Does anyone know

1155
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,040
working directory

1156
01:32:56,040 --> 01:33:13,160
or folder?

1157
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:17,720
Okay, so when I run the command git in it,
it says that initialized

1158
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,000
empty
git repository in this particular folder.

1159
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:25,080
So this means that up to this command,

1160
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:30,360
the condition of my folder
is that there is s, rc, Ben and DOD

1161
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:34,160
with the empty string area
and an empty repository.

1162
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,880
Do you guys agree with this

1163
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,840
is understood?

1164
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,360
Perfect.

1165
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:49,200
Okay, so now I am going to explain to you
that what is a staging area

1166
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:58,400
and what is our approach?

1167
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:06,080
First of all, let's talk about working
directory.

1168
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:10,160
The place there are codes

1169
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:14,200
are Java files, are

1170
01:34:15,480 --> 01:34:19,880
the staging area.

1171
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,720
Okay, who knows that?

1172
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:36,480
What is a staging area?

1173
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,120
So who's going to tell me that?

1174
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:47,400
What's a staging area?

1175
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,480
Okay, so staging area

1176
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,840
is the place

1177
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:57,480
where we add

1178
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:04,960
all the files, codes or folders

1179
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:22,640
which we want to send to the repository.

1180
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,760
And what is it you represent pre

1181
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:40,200
storage, which contains

1182
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,360
all our comments and what our commits.

1183
01:35:46,360 --> 01:35:56,440
Guys, we learn that. Yes.

1184
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:59,880
So staging area, let's move back to this.

1185
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,440
It means that everything
that goes into the repository

1186
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:07,160
first has to go to the staging area

1187
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:09,440
and then it is

1188
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:15,880
it goes to the repository.

1189
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:19,080
This is what is actually happening inside
get okay,

1190
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:23,640
we are just visualizing it
Fahad I'll put answer you that.

1191
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,000
Why do we need that?

1192
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,480
But right now

1193
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,760
just go with the flow.

1194
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,040
No, we can answer that.

1195
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,640
It's prep area.

1196
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,400
I should answer that

1197
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,040
so why not?

1198
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,440
Will get to know

1199
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,560
real get to know.

1200
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:44,800
Okay.

1201
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:49,800
But just for now, tell me that
are you guys clear with this concept

1202
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:54,120
that when we use the get in it
command staging area and rapport created

1203
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,000
and everything
that we want to send to Apple

1204
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:00,800
first, we it to staging area
and then the repository.

1205
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:05,280
So how many steps
how many stages are involved,

1206
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:10,200
how many studios there for the code three.

1207
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:13,040
So three stages working directory for code

1208
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,080
staging, area for code
and the rapper of code.

1209
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,200
So there are three stages
that that are involved.

1210
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:19,560
Right.

1211
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,160
So that's why I

1212
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:31,720
get is called a three stage architecture.

1213
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:36,720
Okay So now let's move ahead
and all the questions

1214
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:37,800
that you guys are having.

1215
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:38,920
They will be active.

1216
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:39,720
Okay,

1217
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,280
pass them.

1218
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,160
I'll be going with that.

1219
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,720
But not right now.

1220
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:46,360
After some time, I'll be dead.

1221
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,520
Just go. Go with it.

1222
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:55,040
What we're going to be doing.

1223
01:37:55,040 --> 01:38:01,200
So now let me open up my notes and let's
go ahead.

1224
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:02,840
So what is the next step, guys?

1225
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:05,360
When we want to

1226
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,200
save our code

1227
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,960
after creation of the repository

1228
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,320
what's the next step?

1229
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,960
Let's use the command

1230
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,560
git add dot.

1231
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,160
And what does this command do?

1232
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:35,360
Can anyone tell me?

1233
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:39,480
It adds the file, add the files

1234
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:56,240
to the staging area.

1235
01:38:56,240 --> 01:39:03,480
Okay.

1236
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:08,400
Now, before I do that,
I want you to let you guys know

1237
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:14,200
one very, very important
command that we have in it, and that is

1238
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,840
git status.

1239
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,040
You know, we talked about that.

1240
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:24,960
It is, you know, just like a Post-it
and we can communicate it to it.

1241
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:30,200
So at any point in time,
if you want to ask the status of our app

1242
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:33,080
as it pre,
we can only use the command get status.

1243
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:34,840
It saves nothing.

1244
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:38,000
It does. No, it only tells us that.

1245
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:44,600
What is the status of your app physically.

1246
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:45,360
Okay.

1247
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:46,320
I shall not.

1248
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:49,200
Not right now. Not right now.

1249
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:50,520
Follow me.

1250
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:53,280
Don't do anything unless I have done it.

1251
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:55,320
Okay.

1252
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:57,640
So what do you guys think?

1253
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:01,920
That if at this point I run the command,
get status

1254
01:40:02,240 --> 01:40:05,760
before running it at dawn,
what is going to happen?

1255
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:07,760
What is the status of my app?

1256
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:15,840
Is it.

1257
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,040
It's empty, right?

1258
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,480
The staging area.

1259
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,640
What's the status of the staging area?

1260
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,240
It's all empty.

1261
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:28,360
So the get status is going to tell me that

1262
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:37,040
the files are not being tracked.

1263
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:42,920
Do you guys agree with that?

1264
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:46,000
Okay,
so let's let's, you know, test it out.

1265
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:55,040
So if I do at this point, get status,
what does it say?

1266
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:58,160
Let's forget about on branch
Master for now.

1267
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:00,200
I'll tell you. Okay.

1268
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,560
Whenever we move forward,
it tells me no comments yet.

1269
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:08,080
Yes, we do not have any comments.

1270
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,280
Okay, good

1271
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:12,760
untracked files,

1272
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,480
but it should mean
that you have some untracked files

1273
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,720
in your working area.

1274
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:21,840
What are those on untracked file?

1275
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,920
It's showing us that bin s RC

1276
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,680
and some files that, you know, a dot

1277
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:32,640
extension, dot
class, that dot project and dot settings.

1278
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:34,280
So if I

1279
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:38,280
open up my actual explorer,
we can see that yes,

1280
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:42,520
there are dot settings
bin SRT, dot last that

1281
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:47,600
and dot project.

1282
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,080
These are appearing in red.

1283
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,720
The files that appear in red,

1284
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:59,040
these are the ones that are indicated
that they are not being tracked.

1285
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:10,560
Okay.

1286
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:21,480
Up to this point, guys, any confusion?

1287
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:26,640
Let me also write down the files
bit dot extension.

1288
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:30,760
I skipped them initially,
but just to make everything more

1289
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:44,440
clear, we I have lost that.

1290
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:47,320
And what else files do I have?

1291
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:50,200
Settings and dot project

1292
01:42:51,840 --> 01:43:04,800
so it's

1293
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:35,280
okay.

1294
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:38,320
Use the command get status

1295
01:43:39,240 --> 01:43:42,800
to view the current status

1296
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,200
of repository

1297
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,320
files shown in red

1298
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:59,280
on untracked files.

1299
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:00,120
Okay.

1300
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,720
Now we we discussed that we can use

1301
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:08,160
the command gate add dot and if you add
all the files to staging area.

1302
01:44:08,760 --> 01:44:13,680
So what if I want to add
just one file to the staging area?

1303
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,200
I want to save only one file.

1304
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:19,000
I want to keep track of only one file.

1305
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,560
So which command do I have for that

1306
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,480
section?

1307
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:34,320
I can use the command for

1308
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,120
git add file name

1309
01:44:55,120 --> 01:44:59,400
and it will only add this massive file
to the staging area.

1310
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,880
So Let's go ahead and try that out.

1311
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:03,720
Okay.

1312
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:06,600
So what if I run the command

1313
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,720
git add

1314
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:15,320
and let's say S or C?

1315
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:17,760
What if I run this camera?

1316
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,760
What do you guys suppose will happen?

1317
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:27,360
Can someone tell me?

1318
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:30,040
Okay, Martin,
you are saying that SRS will go to Apple?

1319
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,080
No. What will happen

1320
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:37,320
as soon as we do get add, SASE

1321
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,680
get is going to make
a copy of the file SASE

1322
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:49,520
and it is going to move it
into the staging area.

1323
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:52,560
Okay. So this is what is going to happen.

1324
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:58,680
Okay, let's do it and visualize it.

1325
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,440
Git add

1326
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,520
s or C,

1327
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,720
and after that I'm going to press enter.

1328
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:08,880
Okay, so

1329
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:12,840
get add s RC shows me no output.

1330
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:16,160
I want to know whether SRT has been moved

1331
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:19,080
into the staging area or not.

1332
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:24,040
How can I do that now?

1333
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:26,080
I have the command of good status.

1334
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:31,120
I can use that to know
what is the current status of the tree.

1335
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:51,920
So I run the command, get status,
so get status is going to return me.

1336
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:54,600
What can someone tell me

1337
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,800
looking at the,

1338
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:07,400
you know, diagram, I think that it should
tell me that SRT has been tracked

1339
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,120
where has been dark last bad dot setting

1340
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:14,440
and all projects are being untracked
right.

1341
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:16,600
Simple, simple enough.

1342
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,640
This is what I am expecting to see.

1343
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:20,080
So let's see.

1344
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:24,400
Get status and I'll press enter.

1345
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:25,560
So it says that

1346
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:31,520
no commits yet because

1347
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,960
our app was empty

1348
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:35,960
and it says

1349
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:43,560
changes to be committed so whatever is to
be committed should be in staging area.

1350
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:44,280
Right.

1351
01:47:44,360 --> 01:47:47,120
So it means that whatever we see in green

1352
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:50,480
color is in the staging area.

1353
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:51,600
Right

1354
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,640
here I see SASE

1355
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:03,120
get a WAN and SA symbol for dot Java.

1356
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:06,640
Basically these are the inside files
that it is showing.

1357
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:09,320
So we have actually RC in the staging area

1358
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,800
and the files dot
last that dot prior dot setting

1359
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:23,040
and then are still being untracked.

1360
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:31,400
Okay.

1361
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:36,360
Now what I want to do, I want to just see

1362
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:40,280
my SRT in the wrapper.

1363
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,480
This is what I want to do

1364
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:53,880
so I can run the command.

1365
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,360
Good comment.

1366
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:59,400
Dash M and after the M

1367
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:02,360
dies, after the m, we place a message

1368
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:06,160
and that message should be comprehensive
enough

1369
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:11,360
to, you know, make the person
who is looking at it

1370
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:15,160
understand
that what is during the comment.

1371
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:23,520
So what do you suggest that
I should name it.

1372
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,120
I can name it first
trim it or I can also say

1373
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:32,520
only contains SIRC.

1374
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:35,160
And I say that too.
Don't you think it's a better

1375
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:39,880
command message?

1376
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:43,760
Okay, so if I run this command,
what is going to happen?

1377
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:48,920
It is going to make a copy of the SRT
and just chilling area and it is going to

1378
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:51,720
just simply place it in the report

1379
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:54,880
and it is going to label it

1380
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,440
with what things it will label it.

1381
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:01,360
Can someone tell me

1382
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:22,840
commit name, date time,

1383
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:33,960
user name, email, address.

1384
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:34,800
Okay,

1385
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:38,360
so now let's do it
actually on the terminal.

1386
01:50:38,360 --> 01:50:43,880
Let's have a look.

1387
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:45,880
Good comment.

1388
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,800
Dash M

1389
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,080
contains Essar Steel.

1390
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:34,080
Let's run this command.

1391
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:34,960
Okay.

1392
01:51:35,640 --> 01:51:37,240
It showed me no output.

1393
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:42,360
I want to know
the status of my proposal tree.

1394
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:46,800
What's what has happened
is everything that I can see.

1395
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,320
Is everything correct or not?

1396
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:52,000
I can run the command, get status right.

1397
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:53,760
Okay.

1398
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:58,960
So tell me guys, without running,
tell me if I run get status,

1399
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:01,880
what will be the output

1400
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:12,440
near?

1401
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:18,720
Please support channel.

1402
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:19,440
Okay.

1403
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:22,360
So my output should be
that it should tell me

1404
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:25,480
what are the files.

1405
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:28,280
It should tell me that
what are the changes

1406
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:32,360
that needs to be committed
and what is there in the repository?

1407
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:33,080
Right.

1408
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:35,640
These are the stuff that it should me,

1409
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:40,920
it should give me all the information
about what has happened.

1410
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:44,080
So let's let's run, get status and see

1411
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:49,320
it's status.

1412
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:53,720
Now, when I look at status,
it's it's saying that

1413
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,440
you just have untracked files in which

1414
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,920
SRT is not included.

1415
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,280
It's neither in the staging area.

1416
01:53:05,640 --> 01:53:09,200
It means that it's in the repository
already.

1417
01:53:10,680 --> 01:53:11,280
Okay.

1418
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:17,040
Makes sense.

1419
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:21,840
Now, let me move
you back to previous status over here.

1420
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:27,760
It shows me that changes to be committed
and it was showing them in green color.

1421
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:32,640
So when we come
in, those changes did disappear from

1422
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,400
it disappears

1423
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:43,240
from the get status.

1424
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:47,240
Okay so for a had we noticed that
just because

1425
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:51,240
the bin folder is not in Untracked

1426
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:55,440
Oak is not in Untracked,
it's not in staging area.

1427
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:59,800
So where can it be now?

1428
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:02,640
There's only one, one stage that is left.

1429
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:05,040
But it can be. It can be in wrap. Right.

1430
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:22,720
So how soon can you show
your screenshot in the support?

1431
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:26,240
And I'm sure that
is there to help you out.

1432
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:27,440
Okay guys.

1433
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:30,280
So at this point. Yes.

1434
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,920
Yes I show it does at this point.

1435
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,880
Let's take a break for one minute.

1436
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:36,480
Take a deep breath and we have

1437
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:40,440
all you know, done a great job.

1438
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:46,440
Let's appreciate ourselves.

1439
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:46,680
Okay.

1440
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:52,160
So you see, we just ran all the commands
that we did in the first half,

1441
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:56,480
but now we actually that
how it's working at the back end, right?

1442
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:59,640
You guys think that this was difficult?

1443
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:04,200
Is anyone who thinks
that these concepts are difficult

1444
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:21,520
are not understanding them.

1445
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,480
All right. And don't worry.
I'm going to give you more examples.

1446
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:27,080
More and more examples in today's lesson

1447
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:31,360
is, you know, a just to this.

1448
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:35,560
So we will be practicing it more and more
and you guys will be comfortable with it

1449
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:46,320
if you understand how it is working right.

1450
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:49,680
If you understand this flow,
then trust me,

1451
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:56,040
you won't be having any difficulty.

1452
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,520
Yes, it will. You guys will get good.

1453
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:01,000
I know if the first time.
Okay, Don't worry.

1454
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,240
Just make sure that you understand
the concept.

1455
01:56:03,240 --> 01:56:11,640
Okay?

1456
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:13,720
Okay. So let's practice some more.

1457
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:15,640
Okay.

1458
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:18,480
Let's do the practice till this point.

1459
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:33,640
Are you guys all with me?

1460
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:36,120
There is no packet, Michael.

1461
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:56,040
I just created the class directly.

1462
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:59,640
Hashim,
get your issue resolved and catch up.

1463
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:00,480
Okay?

1464
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:04,480
We are just going to repeat everything

1465
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,440
for errors.

1466
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,560
Guys. Support is there for you. Okay.

1467
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:18,880
Make sure that you post screenshots
in the support, okay?

1468
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:26,680
And you'll get help.

1469
01:57:26,680 --> 01:57:29,120
Okay. So now let's do this
guys. Let's do this.

1470
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:32,280
Let's open up our terminals.

1471
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:37,560
Tell me that if I want to view everything
that I have in the repository,

1472
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:42,520
we discussed that we have one command
for that which is that

1473
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:47,600
in the repository?

1474
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:48,400
No, no, no.

1475
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,800
I'm not talking about

1476
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:51,440
the folder.

1477
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:53,720
I'm talking about the repository.

1478
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:56,600
Get lol get log as a command

1479
01:57:56,600 --> 01:58:01,000
that gives us all the commits
that are there in the represent.

1480
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,040
Okay,

1481
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:06,800
so at this point if I run get low,
what do you guys expect to see?

1482
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:13,400
How many comments are going to be there?

1483
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:16,560
Only one or less one get logged

1484
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:22,880
and I see that there is one commit with

1485
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:28,360
the author name,
email address, date mentioned

1486
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:34,120
and the comment message.

1487
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:37,480
Okay, so this is 1b30259.

1488
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:41,240
Whatever this is, it's a it's

1489
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,920
going to be different for each
and every one of you.

1490
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:47,600
It's actually, you know, a code

1491
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:50,640
that get has for it for saving.

1492
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:54,680
It's come at that's
how it labels the command for itself

1493
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:58,840
and it's going to be

1494
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:03,000
unique for every comment.

1495
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:03,960
No, I haven't.

1496
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:08,640
You can not.

1497
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:14,720
Yes, I show like a barcode.

1498
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:15,280
Okay, guys.

1499
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,480
So let's move forward. Let's move forward.

1500
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:18,280
Okay.

1501
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:21,120
What we want to do next

1502
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:25,920
now I want to add the rest of the files,

1503
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:31,280
then class batch settings
and projects to my repository.

1504
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:35,040
You guys are going to guide me that
How am I supposed to do that?

1505
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:43,240
So what's the first step?

1506
01:59:43,240 --> 01:59:44,600
I need to run the command.

1507
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:54,600
Get add dot.

1508
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:55,920
What is this going to do?

1509
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:58,960
As soon as I run
this command, it's going to take

1510
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:20,040
everything that is there

1511
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,920
in your working directory

1512
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:38,160
and it's going to take it in
the staging area.

1513
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:41,360
So now if I do get

1514
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:45,480
status, let's run,

1515
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:48,920
get status before running,
get that dot just to make sure

1516
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:52,360
that you guys are reminded
that these are the untracked files.

1517
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:52,720
Okay.

1518
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,800
Now if I do get

1519
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:59,920
at dot instead of file
name, I'm using dot.

1520
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:00,600
Right?

1521
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:02,760
And if I press enter.

1522
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:04,720
So this operation has happened.

1523
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:10,920
Everything is in the staging area.

1524
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:14,960
I want to make sure that my gate
is not cracking everything.

1525
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:21,920
Which command should I be using?

1526
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,760
Get status right.

1527
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:28,080
So I'll open up my terminal
and I'll say get status

1528
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:31,720
and I'm expecting
now that everything is going to be green.

1529
02:01:33,480 --> 02:01:33,760
Okay.

1530
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:37,760
It says that changes to be committed
and it's showing me

1531
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:40,640
all the files that are

1532
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,720
on track

1533
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:45,240
now. It's showing me in green

1534
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:47,920
and telling me that it is now
cracking down.

1535
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:52,080
Okay, Now I want to

1536
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:56,200
make a new comment

1537
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:58,240
where I have

1538
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,360
all these files

1539
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:25,160
where I'm

1540
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:28,520
just picking them up
guys too, because I have less space

1541
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:38,040
now. So

1542
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,760
your syntax
error, this is going to be your indexer.

1543
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:44,480
Okay, so for that I have a command

1544
02:02:45,240 --> 02:02:48,360
get commit dash and I can see that.

1545
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,080
Let's give the message

1546
02:02:52,080 --> 02:03:04,360
all the files committed.

1547
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:09,520
So let's open up our gate
and try to do that.

1548
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:13,440
Yes, well, cash is doing the support here,
so get

1549
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:16,880
comment dash m

1550
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:20,200
contains

1551
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:58,320
all the files.

1552
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:00,640
Okay, guys, now if I run, get stat

1553
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,480
without running the command, tell me that,
what do you expect?

1554
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,800
You'll see

1555
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:15,840
because

1556
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,920
at this point you're working directory
and your app wizardry

1557
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:25,280
are at the same level
they exactly the same files.

1558
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:26,000
Right.

1559
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:29,680
So you'll see nothing

1560
02:04:29,680 --> 02:04:30,160
less.

1561
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:32,680
One good status

1562
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:36,000
and it will say nothing to come it working

1563
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:47,280
tree is clean.

1564
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:51,960
Now if you want to view your repository
and see how many comments

1565
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:55,920
are there in it,
which command are you going to use?

1566
02:04:57,320 --> 02:04:59,760
Git log

1567
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,280
and I'm expecting to come.

1568
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:06,800
It contains s rc contains all the files
and if I have a look at this,

1569
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:10,000
I have to commit
and in my logs also I have to

1570
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:38,600
comments. So

1571
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,080
let's take a break guys

1572
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:44,720
for 2 minutes to line 15.

1573
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:46,680
In fact, the three minute.

1574
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:48,200
Let's take a break for 3 minutes.

1575
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:52,680
Meanwhile,
I'm going to help you out with the stuff.

1576
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:56,880
If anyone is having problems,
I can help you out to

1577
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,520
two 915 guys.

1578
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:07,680
We got 3 minutes.

1579
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:10,760
Anyone still struggling with

1580
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:13,440
with a command somewhere?

1581
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:17,400
Send the screenshot to me.

1582
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:17,960
Okay.

1583
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:20,360
We anywhere in loss conditions
and the screenshot

1584
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,600
screenshot of those

1585
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:38,400
been shot.

1586
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:40,440
Send the screenshot in life. Okay.

1587
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:43,200
Because I cannot switch the

1588
02:06:46,760 --> 02:06:47,600
oc Illini.

1589
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:49,680
Your problem is simple, right?

1590
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:53,160
Let me. Let me answer to that once.

1591
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:55,680
Okay.

1592
02:06:55,680 --> 02:07:02,000
You have.

1593
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:02,560
Okay.

1594
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:07,320
You forgot to actually close the inverted
commas, right? Yep.

1595
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:08,000
Come on Dash.

1596
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,960
I'm only contains srt.

1597
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:15,440
After that you did not put the inverted
commas and you press enter if you do such.

1598
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:21,320
So get opens up, decode something this
and you won't be able to exit it.

1599
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:25,280
So try control see all Colin Q

1600
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:29,400
equals Colin Q are controlled.

1601
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:33,400
It will take you out of this loop and then
you can reenter the correct comma.

1602
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:35,040
Okay.

1603
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:42,480
I hope that that is going to resolve
the problem.

1604
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:54,000
Okay, Mustafa, for you.

1605
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,920
Mustafa you are good.

1606
02:07:56,120 --> 02:07:58,640
You just made one comment.

1607
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:00,640
You did not made the other promise.

1608
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:05,360
You have no errors, but you did not, I
guess, stop wallowing in between you two.

1609
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:06,040
Some reasons

1610
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:25,680
assume your problem is that I

1611
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:30,520
think that you created the repository
at the wrong location.

1612
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:32,600
You need to do less and make sure

1613
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:37,680
that only been an ACR over there
because you see a lot of files are there.

1614
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:42,480
It seems like you created your app
was it read inside

1615
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:48,120
you know your home directory

1616
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:55,720
just leaning on Mac try calling Q

1617
02:08:59,480 --> 02:08:59,880
okay.

1618
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:02,720
Apple for you

1619
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,840
you have no issues.

1620
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:09,960
You are good.

1621
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:12,640
Okay guys, so

1622
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,880
I hope that

1623
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:17,400
by now

1624
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:19,200
okay you did

1625
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:23,960
okay.

1626
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:25,160
You are good to go.

1627
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:25,760
Okay.

1628
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:28,680
You made the comment, right?

1629
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:39,280
It's their perfect.

1630
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:41,200
You just skip the second comment.

1631
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:43,000
But that's fine.

1632
02:09:43,320 --> 02:09:44,240
You can

1633
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:49,360
continue doing what we are going to do
and then after the class,

1634
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:55,200
you can catch up
this step in the recording.

1635
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:56,200
Okay, guys. So

1636
02:09:58,240 --> 02:10:01,080
now the next step that we learning,

1637
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:04,520
usually this stuff

1638
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:07,680
we have learned up to
this was the trust me hardest.

1639
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:11,040
Now after this,
everything is going to be simple

1640
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:13,080
and not get complicated.

1641
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:19,200
Okay, so what if now in my looks good
After saving this,

1642
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:24,000
I woke up next day
and I started to make changes in it.

1643
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,000
I added system dot

1644
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:40,480
intel and it made some changes.

1645
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:43,320
Let's say I made this change and

1646
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:48,360
I'm going to save it.

1647
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:49,080
Okay?

1648
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:58,240
I saved it.

1649
02:10:58,240 --> 02:11:02,640
At this point,

1650
02:11:02,640 --> 02:11:06,160
I made the change in my Java code.

1651
02:11:06,720 --> 02:11:09,880
Is this change changed file

1652
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:16,640
in the repository?

1653
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:17,960
No, it's not.

1654
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:23,320
There.

1655
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:25,760
So I'll represent change with red for now.

1656
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:26,840
Okay,

1657
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:33,280
so this is the file that we have.

1658
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:36,600
So if I now run git status,

1659
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:39,640
what do you think is going to be

1660
02:11:40,240 --> 02:11:51,200
the response of my get?

1661
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:52,920
Okay, don't tell me the colors.

1662
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:55,760
Tell me logically
that what should get be telling me

1663
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:57,960
it. You

1664
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:01,080
tell me that your file has been modified,
Right?

1665
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:03,080
Okay.

1666
02:12:03,360 --> 02:12:06,720
It should not tell me on time
because it's already tracking it.

1667
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:09,880
It should me that the file
has been modified

1668
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:13,440
right?

1669
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,520
Unplugged means that it's.

1670
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:19,120
It's in the working right has never ever

1671
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:22,800
added in in the staging area
or the repository.

1672
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:27,360
Whenever we made changes in our code,

1673
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:32,480
which we have already saved it's
modification right.

1674
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:36,760
So this time, if I open up my terminal
and I say

1675
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:42,360
get status,

1676
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:46,280
it shows me two files modified

1677
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:51,760
SRT and BIN and the modified is also shown

1678
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:59,320
in red color.

1679
02:12:59,320 --> 02:13:01,200
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

1680
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:03,360
Let me explain something.

1681
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:08,560
Try to read this
What it is say changes not stage four

1682
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:14,200
come in and it's telling us
that it has modified files.

1683
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:18,360
Before it was telling us untracked files
now is telling us

1684
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:22,920
modified files right.

1685
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:23,720
Okay.

1686
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:28,280
Who is going to tell me
that I made changes

1687
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:31,640
in only one file, which is SRT?

1688
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:35,880
Why am I getting the changes
Also in bin file?

1689
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:42,120
Who can tell me that?

1690
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:43,920
No, that's okay.

1691
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:45,960
Let me tell you that. So

1692
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:50,040
bin files,

1693
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,680
then files are actually binary files

1694
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:56,400
and they are totally dependent
on your system.

1695
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:59,040
Okay, It's going to be different for you.

1696
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:03,560
It's going to be different for me when
I really make some changes in our codes

1697
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:09,120
are binary files automatically change,
even if we are not making any changes.

1698
02:14:09,680 --> 02:14:24,480
Okay.

1699
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:27,280
So that's the reason
that we are being shown that

1700
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:34,840
there are some changes in bin files.

1701
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:38,160
So let me also color my bin file

1702
02:14:38,320 --> 02:14:41,800
because it's also, you know, changing.

1703
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:57,880
Okay.

1704
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:00,720
At this point, I want to,

1705
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:06,480
you know,
add these up digit changes in my apple.

1706
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:31,760
So which command should I be using?

1707
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:37,240
I should be using it at DOT.

1708
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:37,560
Okay.

1709
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:42,120
So using this command, get add
dot is going to make a copy

1710
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:44,840
of the SRT file

1711
02:15:45,600 --> 02:15:47,960
and it's going to add it

1712
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:53,400
to this changing area.

1713
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:56,520
It's also going to take a copy of bin file

1714
02:15:57,160 --> 02:16:01,080
and it's going to add it
to the staging area.

1715
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:01,800
Okay.

1716
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:06,160
So at this point,
the question is that whether these files

1717
02:16:06,160 --> 02:16:09,000
dot last that dot settings dot project

1718
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:13,640
are these files going to remain there
or are they going to be

1719
02:16:13,640 --> 02:16:39,120
deleted from here?

1720
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:40,280
Okay. So

1721
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,200
for conceptual purpose, remember,

1722
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:47,440
for conceptual,
we will say that they will remain there.

1723
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:48,880
Okay?

1724
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:59,840
They are going to remain there.

1725
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:00,520
Okay.

1726
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:04,320
So now let's add the files

1727
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:09,360
where the command did at DOT.

1728
02:17:09,360 --> 02:17:10,120
Okay?

1729
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:13,600
So it shows me no output

1730
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:16,320
if at this point

1731
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:23,840
I use get status,

1732
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:29,120
what do you guys suggest will happen?

1733
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:34,760
What should be the output of my terminal?

1734
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:35,080
Okay.

1735
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:36,000
Which files?

1736
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,480
It will show me

1737
02:17:39,600 --> 02:17:44,600
in green and let untracked files.

1738
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:48,680
Are you sure about it?

1739
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:50,160
Okay, let's try that out.

1740
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:53,040
So you guys are saying
it should show me two files

1741
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:57,400
in green color?

1742
02:17:57,400 --> 02:18:00,480
Yes, it does. It shows me that

1743
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:03,280
these are the two files that needs to be

1744
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:06,600
committed.

1745
02:18:06,600 --> 02:18:09,240
Okay, so

1746
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:14,680
now I want to commit these files.

1747
02:18:14,680 --> 02:18:30,840
Which command am I going to allow?

1748
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:38,960
Updated SRT, and then, Okay,
I'm going to put this message.

1749
02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:40,240
Look at running.

1750
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:42,440
This command is going to do what?

1751
02:18:42,440 --> 02:18:46,440
It's going to make a copy of everything
that is there inside

1752
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:51,560
the staging area

1753
02:18:51,560 --> 02:18:53,760
and it's going to create a comment,

1754
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:55,800
a new comment

1755
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:04,800
DOT project is supposed to be there

1756
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:14,520
and it's also going to label it
with, you know,

1757
02:19:15,360 --> 02:19:17,920
commit name and everything that we learned

1758
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:40,880
before.

1759
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:44,160
So let's do get

1760
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,360
commit

1761
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:47,920
dash m

1762
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,560
and at this point, let the answer

1763
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:56,480
put the message contains
bin and se are see

1764
02:19:58,360 --> 02:20:00,160
updated right

1765
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:06,360
let's press enter.

1766
02:20:06,360 --> 02:20:07,200
Okay.

1767
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:10,880
Now I want to make sure that my repository

1768
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:16,200
nothing else
which is on track, modified or updated.

1769
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:21,000
I sure I'm going to reply to your
and to yours to just wait

1770
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:24,800
so I can run get status right.

1771
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:26,840
So running at status
is going to return me.

1772
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:36,680
What at this point can someone tell me?

1773
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:38,160
Nothing. Right.

1774
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:43,920
So if I run with status,

1775
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:47,720
my working tree is clean.

1776
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:49,600
Okay. I want to see

1777
02:20:50,760 --> 02:20:52,360
de commits in

1778
02:20:52,360 --> 02:20:58,320
my repository.

1779
02:20:58,320 --> 02:20:59,680
Get locked

1780
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:01,160
said now.

1781
02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:04,160
Shows me three commands, all

1782
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:06,200
with the message and

1783
02:21:07,760 --> 02:21:10,120
the first one appears at the bottom.

1784
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:21,200
And then so on.

1785
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:21,360
Okay.

1786
02:21:21,360 --> 02:21:24,960
So now
this cycle is going to repeat someone.

1787
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:26,800
Someone asked me.

1788
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Yes. Every time he makes some changes.

1789
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:35,800
We will have to add them to
the staging area, will have to come back.

1790
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:38,000
That's okay.

1791
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:43,000
This is something
that we will have to do continuously.

1792
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:46,520
And now let's let's deal

1793
02:21:46,520 --> 02:21:50,960
with one more scenario.

1794
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:56,240
Let's create a new, let's say, file
over here in this folder.

1795
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:59,280
I'm going to create a new file

1796
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:02,360
and I'm going to name it

1797
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:18,440
text file.

1798
02:22:18,440 --> 02:22:23,720
In fact, I think creating a text file is
going to be difficult for you guys on Mac.

1799
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:25,920
So let's do it.

1800
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:26,680
Let's do it.

1801
02:22:26,680 --> 02:22:31,480
From the clips.

1802
02:22:31,480 --> 02:22:36,520
Let's go to that project
and let's do new and let's do class.

1803
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:37,440
Okay?

1804
02:22:37,440 --> 02:22:41,160
So I want you to click Kid project.

1805
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:41,800
Okay?

1806
02:22:41,800 --> 02:22:44,080
At this at this point, did project

1807
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:47,400
and click on new and click on class

1808
02:22:48,120 --> 02:22:58,520
and name text.

1809
02:22:58,520 --> 02:23:00,680
So I want the source folder to be good.

1810
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:01,560
Project

1811
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:04,000
everyone.

1812
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,720
I want you guys to do this. Okay?

1813
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:09,520
I want you make the source folder.

1814
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:12,120
Did project and

1815
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:14,400
create a class and name a text.

1816
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:17,320
Let me try it. If it.

1817
02:23:17,320 --> 02:23:23,920
Yes it does.

1818
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:28,640
So let me repeat right
click and get Project new

1819
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:31,960
and then class.

1820
02:23:31,960 --> 02:23:32,760
Okay.

1821
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:36,680
Make sure that your source folder is

1822
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:40,000
get project

1823
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:45,000
type in the name text

1824
02:23:45,000 --> 02:24:01,320
and click on finished.

1825
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:02,840
No, nothing. Nothing.

1826
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:04,920
You need to. You need to select nothing.

1827
02:24:05,560 --> 02:24:05,880
Okay.

1828
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:10,320
So what we just did,
we created a new file, right

1829
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:14,680
We just created a new file in this folder
in our working rectory,

1830
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:24,360
which is text dot Java.

1831
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:27,520
This is what we did, guys. Right?

1832
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:31,200
We just created one new file.

1833
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,200
Okay, Now I want you to tell me

1834
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:39,120
what will be the
status if I run get status

1835
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:41,760
without running a command.

1836
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:44,960
Actually, I want you to tell me this

1837
02:24:57,680 --> 02:24:58,800
exactly

1838
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:03,600
because we added a new file,
which is not yet in the staging area.

1839
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:04,520
All render apple.

1840
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:08,440
So this is going to see
that there is one untracked file.

1841
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:12,560
So let's check that out right.

1842
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:16,240
Get status.

1843
02:25:16,240 --> 02:25:22,920
There you go.

1844
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:26,040
It shows us that this file text or Java

1845
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:34,960
is on track.

1846
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:38,720
Now, again, if you want to track this
file, guys, what what I need to do

1847
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:50,440
is, Abdul,

1848
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:57,400
you are getting this because you created
your file in the wrong location.

1849
02:25:57,400 --> 02:26:03,760
I told you
specifically to go to new class,

1850
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:06,160
and then you need to remove SIRC.

1851
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:13,480
I mentioned.

1852
02:26:13,480 --> 02:26:17,000
Okay, so we have, you know, to

1853
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:20,280
to match us to do that I can use good

1854
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:23,160
add text or java or I can use get add dot.

1855
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:29,720
Will that make a difference?

1856
02:26:29,720 --> 02:26:31,520
It wont make a difference.

1857
02:26:31,520 --> 02:26:35,480
Why can someone tell me the reason
that why it would make a difference

1858
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:39,000
at this point?

1859
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,080
Only at this point

1860
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:44,600
because it is the only file
that is a b on track.

1861
02:26:44,600 --> 02:26:49,040
So if I use get that done, it's
going to take every file which is only one

1862
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:52,520
or so.

1863
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:56,560
Let's do it at dot.

1864
02:26:57,480 --> 02:26:57,680
Okay.

1865
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:10,760
Now if I do get status guys,
what should be the output output?

1866
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:13,440
The text files should be turned
into green,

1867
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:23,440
showing that it is in the staging area.

1868
02:27:23,440 --> 02:27:24,360
Right.

1869
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:28,760
So now again, what I want is
I want it to have in the repository.

1870
02:27:29,280 --> 02:27:41,320
So this

1871
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:51,480
and it will make a new comment

1872
02:27:52,200 --> 02:27:53,160
and it will label it

1873
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:59,400
also, we are running this command commit.

1874
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:02,720
Let's say
the message just time is going to be

1875
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:07,200
new file

1876
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:15,080
text dot java.

1877
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:18,320
So if I open up my terminal
now and I type in, get

1878
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:21,400
comment bash m

1879
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:26,240
new file

1880
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:37,400
text dark shower.

1881
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:37,880
Okay.

1882
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:41,400
So I again made a syntax mistake, right.

1883
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:46,920
I forgot the semi semicolon the start
so I have to quit it.

1884
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:47,760
Okay.

1885
02:28:47,800 --> 02:28:50,400
You can either use column Q or control

1886
02:28:50,400 --> 02:29:17,600
C, okay.

1887
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,760
Now at this point, if I do get log,

1888
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:26,640
I can see all the,

1889
02:29:26,960 --> 02:29:31,160
you know, all the full commits.

1890
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:32,880
So I made full commits, right?

1891
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:36,200
If I want to make sure I can simply have

1892
02:29:36,440 --> 02:29:40,720
a look at my wiggle
dragging on one, two, three,

1893
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:45,680
four and everything is in synchronization.

1894
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:47,160
Okay, so what is the question?

1895
02:29:47,160 --> 02:29:51,480
If there were many files
still we would use could come dash m

1896
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:54,000
I said, What do you mean?

1897
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:58,320
That if you have many you mean to say that
you have many files in this staging area

1898
02:29:58,320 --> 02:30:04,720
that needs to become added? Yes.

1899
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:08,040
Remember, get commit M What it does is it

1900
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:11,040
picks all the file in the staging area.

1901
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:12,120
It it is.

1902
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:14,160
Is it not going to differentiate that?

1903
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:15,960
Okay, let me pick one.

1904
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:18,680
And this answers the question of amma

1905
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,800
y first staging area graphical

1906
02:30:25,480 --> 02:30:27,760
because if we want to make a

1907
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:33,360
decision that we want
only few files in our comment,

1908
02:30:33,360 --> 02:30:37,760
then we have to send them first
to staging area because Repository

1909
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:41,200
is going to pick complete code
in the staging area.

1910
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:53,280
So okay,

1911
02:30:53,320 --> 02:30:59,760
so enough practice
or do you guys want to practice or.

1912
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:03,600
MUHAMMAD I'm afraid that once
the commit has been made,

1913
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:07,760
you cannot do that.

1914
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:10,680
Is there any command to

1915
02:31:11,520 --> 02:31:12,120
to do what?

1916
02:31:12,120 --> 02:31:15,120
To select good dash? M

1917
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:15,840
I don't get it.

1918
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:17,640
So that to file.

1919
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:21,120
Okay, this is what I told you.

1920
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:22,560
No, get commit.

1921
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:29,840
M is going to take everything
that is in the staging area.

1922
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:30,880
That's the reason, guys.

1923
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:32,880
That's
the reason you have staging area. Right?

1924
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:37,320
So for example,
if you just want to have text or Java

1925
02:31:37,560 --> 02:31:40,560
your repository, what you can do is

1926
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:44,880
you can use only send text
or generate in the staging area.

1927
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:53,480
Okay.

1928
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:53,920
Silence.

1929
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:56,360
That is going to be our next topic.

1930
02:31:56,360 --> 02:31:57,720
Okay. Not now.

1931
02:31:57,720 --> 02:32:02,400
We are not discussing it right now.

1932
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:04,560
How created class to on that?

1933
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:08,160
Do you want me to tell you
that how I created text on Java

1934
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:11,240
or this one gets you don't want that

1935
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:20,840
simple you need to click on

1936
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:23,600
SRT new file is to you know,

1937
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:28,080
create it over there good or too

1938
02:32:28,080 --> 02:32:30,600
I did not create get

1939
02:32:32,080 --> 02:32:34,120
okay test for Java

1940
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:36,480
for creating test for Java click on

1941
02:32:36,480 --> 02:32:39,600
get project go to new

1942
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:42,240
and political class

1943
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,760
by default it is going to show you that

1944
02:32:45,400 --> 02:32:50,240
this source folder is
see just delete it from over there

1945
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:53,880
and then we have a name
and click on finish.

1946
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:56,760
This is not did correct corrected.

1947
02:32:56,760 --> 02:32:59,040
But why I did it because

1948
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:03,760
it's hard for you
create a file on Mac attacks.

1949
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:08,960
Well so in order to save that hassle
I just created it directly

1950
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:09,800
from all the there.

1951
02:33:09,800 --> 02:33:13,680
The purpose was to show you guys
how the gate is working.

1952
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:14,400
Okay.

1953
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:19,080
So don't,
you know, think that this is something

1954
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:22,000
you should do or this is something
you will be doing in Eclipse?

1955
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:25,240
You should all
only focus on the get barred.

1956
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:28,480
Okay, So

1957
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:31,480
let's what else do

1958
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:50,480
we have for today? So

1959
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:57,240
okay, guys, so tell me, is the workflow

1960
02:33:57,360 --> 02:34:05,680
Get clear to all of you.

1961
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,560
Is I clear about that?

1962
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:09,960
What's a working
directory? Was a staging area.

1963
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:27,600
What's the apple?

1964
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:31,320
Okay, so you are not clear about
what's a staging area

1965
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:37,080
and what's the apple?

1966
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:42,400
You're not clear about this.

1967
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:43,760
It's going to work.

1968
02:34:43,760 --> 02:34:47,160
If you remember this workflow,
everything is going to go going, okay,

1969
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:54,360
sure.

1970
02:34:54,360 --> 02:34:59,320
Okay, let's do one thing.

1971
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:01,560
Let's now just delete one file.

1972
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:04,400
Let's just export Java.

1973
02:35:04,400 --> 02:35:06,000
Okay?

1974
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:09,600
I deleted text or Java from my folder

1975
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:15,280
and let's also do it in the eclipse.

1976
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:17,280
Let's right click on it.

1977
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:20,760
Let's click on the lead and click on.

1978
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:21,600
Okay,

1979
02:35:22,320 --> 02:35:39,400
So text or Java has been deleted.

1980
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:44,880
So we had this file text or Java
and I simply deleted it from the

1981
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:46,560
eclipse.

1982
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:49,040
Okay.

1983
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:55,680
Now if I do get status
without running anything on time,

1984
02:35:55,880 --> 02:36:14,360
what do you guys think
is going to be the output?

1985
02:36:14,360 --> 02:36:21,200
Okay, so Aleena and Jimmy,
you guys are saying nothing.

1986
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:25,440
First of all, tell me is at this point

1987
02:36:26,040 --> 02:36:29,680
working directory
and the ripple are at the

1988
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:42,720
at the same level
or is there any change is

1989
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:48,600
there is a change and what changes that

1990
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:56,840
it's the deletion

1991
02:36:56,840 --> 02:37:00,600
in this
we have text or Java and our last commit,

1992
02:37:00,920 --> 02:37:04,160
but now in the working library
we do not have text or java.

1993
02:37:04,440 --> 02:37:10,360
So do you expect that
good should be smart enough to track this?

1994
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:14,160
You expect it to be smart enough?

1995
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:15,720
It should be right.

1996
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:17,960
So let's do this status

1997
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:22,040
and see what it shows us.

1998
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Look, we see

1999
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:28,720
it says that changes not stage four.

2000
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:32,960
Commit
You have deleted a file, text or Java

2001
02:37:32,960 --> 02:37:42,720
and you need to make these changes
in the repository.

2002
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:49,080
So when you delete the file,
it shows up in red with the message,

2003
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:54,960
delete it.

2004
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:57,160
Okay. Okay, Jimmy, That's fine.

2005
02:37:57,280 --> 02:38:00,280
That's why I told you that
with the concept that you have.

2006
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:03,080
Okay, come with the concept that you have.

2007
02:38:04,680 --> 02:38:06,720
Not by running it

2008
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:16,360
how to make changes in the repository.

2009
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:18,600
What? What do you mean by that?

2010
02:38:18,600 --> 02:38:20,160
What's your actual question?

2011
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:22,600
I don't understand it.

2012
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:24,760
Like changes that we just made,

2013
02:38:24,760 --> 02:38:30,280
how to select them.

2014
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:32,880
Okay, we are we are going to do that now.

2015
02:38:33,640 --> 02:38:37,800
We we we ran get status
and it shows us that, you know,

2016
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,320
this file has been deleted.

2017
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:44,440
So what we want
to do, we want to have this

2018
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:48,920
working
directory state in the staging area.

2019
02:38:49,280 --> 02:39:08,240
So which command should I rather?

2020
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:10,240
So let's try that out.

2021
02:39:10,240 --> 02:39:13,440
Let's try get at dot

2022
02:39:18,840 --> 02:39:20,160
and now this one

2023
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:26,040
get status.

2024
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:32,280
So what it did is
it took the state of the working day pre

2025
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:37,800
and it reflected everything over there
and it updated the changes

2026
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:42,440
it said that deleted text or Java.

2027
02:39:42,440 --> 02:39:45,840
So at this point
after running it to add dot

2028
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:49,920
Dexter Java is going to get deleted
from the staging area.

2029
02:39:49,920 --> 02:40:06,960
Also.

2030
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:07,400
Okay.

2031
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:18,440
So at this point, is it
going to get deleted from the wrapper?

2032
02:40:18,440 --> 02:40:21,480
No, all everything
is there in the staging area.

2033
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:24,480
So if we want to now

2034
02:40:24,480 --> 02:40:29,400
have this in the report,
do you guys think that we will have

2035
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:32,960
to make a new commit or we can
somehow make changes in the previous

2036
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:47,040
commit?

2037
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:49,040
Yes, you are right about it.

2038
02:40:49,040 --> 02:41:00,640
We will have to make a comment.

2039
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:01,320
I'll tell you.

2040
02:41:01,320 --> 02:41:10,120
Why is that so?

2041
02:41:10,120 --> 02:41:10,800
I'll tell you.

2042
02:41:11,880 --> 02:41:13,720
It's nothing to be confused about.

2043
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:14,760
It. Okay.

2044
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:17,880
So when you run this,
everything that is there in

2045
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:21,600
the staging area is going to come to

2046
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,840
a new commit.

2047
02:41:29,840 --> 02:41:33,600
And guys in this new commit,
do we have any text

2048
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:34,800
or Java

2049
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:41,880
knows?

2050
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:45,360
So we have reflected the changes

2051
02:41:45,360 --> 02:41:55,760
in the working in the repo.

2052
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:59,600
I'll tell you I shall we
we have reflected the changes

2053
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:03,640
that are in the working tree in the repo.

2054
02:42:03,640 --> 02:42:04,880
Look at the classes.

2055
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:06,960
One, two, three, four. One, two,
three, four.

2056
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:09,480
Everything is the way that is seen.

2057
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:11,520
Nil haven't be reflected in

2058
02:42:14,160 --> 02:42:16,560
what have happened to the text or java

2059
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:20,280
in the previous commit,
but it's not in the new commit.

2060
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:20,920
Right.

2061
02:42:20,920 --> 02:42:24,960
I'll tell you why is that so?

2062
02:42:24,960 --> 02:42:30,960
Okay, so first let's do it
and then it will come to that question.

2063
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:35,040
So let's honor terminal write down, get

2064
02:42:35,840 --> 02:42:38,080
commit dash am

2065
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:42,400
text file

2066
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:48,320
dot java, delete it.

2067
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:52,080
Okay, let me know once you have done it
and then I'm going to answer your question

2068
02:42:52,080 --> 02:42:55,560
that why we do
we have to make a new commit

2069
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:59,160
and why is it not deleted
from the previous

2070
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:07,920
commit?

2071
02:43:07,920 --> 02:43:11,160
Okay, so

2072
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:14,280
now I'm going to tell you

2073
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:16,360
I'm going to actually answer the question,

2074
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:20,080
which is that, hey, when I deleted text

2075
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:24,160
Java from working directory,
it got deleted from the staging area.

2076
02:43:24,560 --> 02:43:28,320
Then why is it not deleted
from the previous commit?

2077
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:30,120
Why is it making a new commit?

2078
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:46,800
This is the question right?

2079
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:49,680
You guys get the question right.

2080
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:50,480
You understand that?

2081
02:43:50,480 --> 02:43:58,800
What the question is all of you.

2082
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:02,400
Okay, so now tell me that what if

2083
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:05,560
next door Java one of the feature

2084
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:09,920
which was in version three

2085
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:13,000
but you don't want that feature and in for

2086
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:17,560
so do you want get two
also deleted from version

2087
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:18,400
three

2088
02:44:24,360 --> 02:44:26,120
so good is smart enough

2089
02:44:26,120 --> 02:44:29,280
to take care of that right

2090
02:44:29,320 --> 02:44:31,520
Get to smart enough what it will do

2091
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:35,560
next time you make changes delete
something.

2092
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:38,400
It is going to say,
Hey, make a new comment

2093
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:42,760
because I don't want to you to lose
anything that you have done in the past.

2094
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:48,080
So remember,
should keep track of all the history,

2095
02:44:48,600 --> 02:44:51,160
everything that you have done till point.

2096
02:44:51,480 --> 02:44:52,680
That's the reason

2097
02:44:52,680 --> 02:44:56,640
you cannot go back and delete some commit
once you have committed it.

2098
02:44:57,040 --> 02:45:13,920
It is not going to allow you to do. Yes.

2099
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:16,240
Let me if I can.

2100
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:19,800
Do you want to have
look at some repository on the internet,

2101
02:45:20,960 --> 02:45:25,040
someone's repository.

2102
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:29,400
Okay, let me show you that
I have not taught you about GitHub of yet.

2103
02:45:29,400 --> 02:45:31,680
You'll be doing that in next class.

2104
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:36,080
But let me just show you one of the
repository and show you the comments.

2105
02:45:36,080 --> 02:45:39,480
How how do the look of some real time

2106
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:40,800
project

2107
02:45:50,640 --> 02:46:06,800
this is okay.

2108
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:11,840
So this is all repository
and the number of comments

2109
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:14,040
that are there is 720 do

2110
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:19,720
so there are 722 commits

2111
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:24,080
that are there.

2112
02:46:24,080 --> 02:46:27,360
And the interesting thing is
that I can go back to anyone

2113
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:33,760
which everyone I want to,

2114
02:46:33,760 --> 02:46:36,360
but these are all the commits
that are there.

2115
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:40,200
And you know,
if you look at the commit message

2116
02:46:40,200 --> 02:46:44,920
couple more glitch
fix commit time number six 2020

2117
02:46:45,720 --> 02:46:50,960
and less would be decimal to
double it was an overkill so

2118
02:46:52,320 --> 02:46:53,160
kind of that

2119
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:56,280
all the comments are there
and everything is being documented

2120
02:46:56,760 --> 02:47:00,840
so that's how helpful you get

2121
02:47:00,840 --> 02:47:07,200
is for you.

2122
02:47:07,200 --> 02:47:11,960
Okay so does it make sense, guys,
whatever we have learned today,

2123
02:47:11,960 --> 02:47:25,400
are you all comfortable with that?

2124
02:47:25,400 --> 02:47:26,960
Okay, perfect.

2125
02:47:27,160 --> 02:47:30,720
So what I'll do

2126
02:47:32,320 --> 02:47:34,680
is okay, even if you close the terminal.

2127
02:47:36,120 --> 02:47:38,280
Okay Awesome. I'm going to guide you.
Just.

2128
02:47:38,280 --> 02:47:39,200
Just be here.

2129
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:41,560
Even if you close the terminal
at this point,

2130
02:47:42,120 --> 02:47:45,040
it's not going to make everything loose

2131
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:50,160
for you. Why?

2132
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:52,120
Because you have everything
in the repository.

2133
02:47:52,120 --> 02:47:55,680
So what if you want to again
work in this project

2134
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:58,240
and with the same repository,
what you are going to do?

2135
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:00,400
Can someone tell me

2136
02:48:09,840 --> 02:48:12,920
you need to open up the terminal

2137
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:17,680
and you need to now navigate

2138
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:20,760
where you created your apposite tree?

2139
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:24,400
Okay, so for me it was

2140
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:37,200
just for me it was at this workspace

2141
02:48:38,280 --> 02:48:41,400
and then I had to

2142
02:48:41,400 --> 02:48:43,680
get Project it right.

2143
02:48:43,680 --> 02:48:47,040
So this was the place
where I created the repository, right?

2144
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:50,200
So do I do do I need to use

2145
02:48:50,200 --> 02:48:55,840
Git in it again?

2146
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:58,520
Do I use do I have to use get init again?

2147
02:48:58,520 --> 02:49:01,200
No, because the repository
is already there.

2148
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:03,280
So if I do get lost,

2149
02:49:04,720 --> 02:49:06,600
everything has been shown.

2150
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:11,960
If I do get status,
everything is being shown.

2151
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:15,880
This means that
if I was accidentally to my terminal

2152
02:49:16,040 --> 02:49:19,400
I can resume my work from wherever I left

2153
02:49:19,400 --> 02:49:28,720
left.

2154
02:49:28,720 --> 02:49:29,000
Okay.

2155
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:32,640
So you type in initials

2156
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:34,840
and then press step.

2157
02:49:34,840 --> 02:49:40,800
It's going to automatically complete it
for you.

2158
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:46,800
Okay, So tomorrow, what we are going
to do tomorrow, we will be

2159
02:49:48,040 --> 02:49:48,960
learning

2160
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:54,360
GitHub.

2161
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:56,760
So I'll share these notes with you.

2162
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:59,520
I have the architecture of get explained

2163
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:03,600
how to track the project

2164
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:07,680
step by step each command
with the functionality.

2165
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:10,240
I have written it. Okay.

2166
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:12,840
What are going to be your errors I'll

2167
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:16,120
I have also mentioned them.

2168
02:50:16,120 --> 02:50:18,720
What are the common mistakes that you have
that you will make?

2169
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:20,080
I have mentioned them.

2170
02:50:20,080 --> 02:50:23,480
So as I promised to you guys
that you don't need to make notes.

2171
02:50:23,480 --> 02:50:27,360
I got that cover
so you don't have to worry about it.

2172
02:50:29,280 --> 02:50:30,320
No, no, not tomorrow.

2173
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:30,800
Sorry.

2174
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:33,720
That that was something mistakenly said.

2175
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:38,280
Okay, so before we end our session,
there's something else

2176
02:50:38,280 --> 02:50:42,760
that I wanted to
I Yes, A suggestion for all of you.

2177
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:44,560
Tomorrow is going to be a review class.

2178
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:48,280

had today, the video that I sent you,

2187
02:51:16,120 --> 02:51:19,040
if you followed that,
if you listened to that and tried to do

2188
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:22,320
everything that I explained in there,
it's only

2189
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:25,320
19 to 20 minutes.

2190
02:51:25,360 --> 02:51:27,880
You'll get the whole lecture out of it.
