1
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
Aisha explicitly told me

2
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,680
to record this class.

3
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,680
Still, I don't remember.

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,360
Good morning, everyone.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,520
Good morning.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,880
All right.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,360
The maps are data structures

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,960
that can support the data
in the form of key value pairs.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
Is it cold in Pakistan?

10
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,400
I think it's six degrees centigrade

11
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,920
or something like that.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,640
Oh, it's got two degrees

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,640
in here.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,400
Yep. It's

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,880
actually not bad, but it's very good
weather to enjoy at three

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,160
in my place.

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,600
So we discussed

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,280
many different types of maps
in the last class.

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,840
Can you guys tell me the names?

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
I thought in Pakistan, always hot.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,480
We have winter
like now for one month in December.

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,400
So there are

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,760
three

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
famous

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,600
types of maps.

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,840
By the way, just to tell you,
there are more

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,520
than 125 types of maps in Java.

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,400
But we will be learning three
or maybe four of them.

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,280
Okay.

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,480
There are so many
types of Java maps in Java.

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,440
And if
you guys want to learn more about that,

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,920
you can search
for the implementation of that.

33
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:28,640
So let's say, for example, if I

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,120
the map interface

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:50,160
and if I am on the

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,480
if I hold on the control button,
only three please.

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,960
Otherwise will be a mess.

38
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,800
So if you hold on the control button
and if you go to the map interface

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,480
and once you are in the map interface,

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,600
if you click control I and B,

41
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,760
then it will show you all the classes

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,560
that implement this map interface.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,840
So they are all maps actually.

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,840
Why there are so many types
because they are very

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,880
heavily used in all of Java.

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,160
They are super, super fast to search

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,560
and you can store multiple types
of data inside these maps.

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,000
No, no, we are not

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,680
going to we're going to do the additive
typing here.

50
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,960
So abstract, do a little bit

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,680
map, abstract hash to map.

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,440
So you guys see this terminology as well.

53
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,800
If the if classes abstracts.

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,000
So these double guys,
they are putting this abstract

55
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,840
word explicitly before this abstract
art treble map.

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,240
So they are all these abstract classes.

57
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,520
And then

58
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,440
there are so many types in here.

59
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,640
But we will be learning only three
or maybe four of them.

60
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,320
Here we go. Link to hash map.

61
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,920
Link map lazy sorted to map lazy map. Did.

62
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,920
Maybe you guys should use

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
these maps.

64
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,920
Lazy method Lazy search map is a good

65
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,600
list.

66
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,880
Order to map logical message contacts
app expression map property.

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,720
Okay. But we will not be discussing maps.

68
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,240
So I am telling you so that you guys
don't tell in the interviews that

69
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,760
Hey guys, there are three types of maps
and we will know all about the map.

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,280
There are these hash
map, the map and it's so good.

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,360
Why are you guys talking about lazy?

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, so

73
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,640
the famous ones, they are the

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:19,600
hash map.

75
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,640
In the hash map

76
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
and then the

77
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,560
free map.

78
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:40,040
Right.

79
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,520
So this map, the

80
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,640
that that extension,
it can also be and defiles

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,040
and defaults.

82
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,520
I will use lazy maps

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:19,040
from now on all the time.

84
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,720
But what is

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,280
what is the property of this hash map?

86
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,000
If you're like me, some Western men,

87
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,240
maybe you should create
a Facebook page as well

88
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,360
and then maybe monetize it

89
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,240
to have some income from there as well.

90
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,600
It's e is single value can be duplicate.

91
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,360
It does not maintain the insertion
order of key elements.

92
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,240
So insertion

93
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,920
or not is not

94
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,520
maintained.

95
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,640
And when should we use the hash map guys

96
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
starting there to do that?

97
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,520
The hash map.

98
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,760
So yes,

99
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,440
it does not maintain the insertion order,
but it's super, super fast.

100
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,040
So when we need good

101
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,160
performance

102
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
and we

103
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,680
don't care about the order of the data,

104
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,720
we should use hash map.

105
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,800
And this is the type of map
that you guys will

106
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,160
most probably be using in the industry

107
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,800
for speed. E

108
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,840
end type of map laws

109
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:31,280
laying the hash map.

110
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,440
It maintains the insertion
order of the key elements.

111
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,200
So in

112
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,200
session

113
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,000
order is

114
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,320
maintained

115
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,760
law in

116
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,360
requirement.

117
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,800
Then a

118
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,360
hash map

119
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,240
much better

120
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,560
in version speed,

121
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,760
then three maps.

122
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
So by key,

123
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,920
yes, everything is maintained in the maps

124
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,480
by TS.

125
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,040
So the data structure, this map
that the structure it operates on gives.

126
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,600
So in insertion order is not

127
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,520
is maintained in the linked hash map,

128
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,360
but it is lower in performance

129
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,400
than a hash map,
but better insertion than three maps.

130
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,600
And what do I mean?

131
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
When we insert the data in the hash map,

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
we get the best possible speed.

133
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,240
When we retrieve the data from the hash
map, we get the best possible speed.

134
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,960
But they are a little bit behind

135
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,360
in in how the store did that in memory.

136
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,840
They sometimes they occupy.

137
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,680
So there is a concept of memory management
in the operating systems as well.

138
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,960
So they will be starting the data
in in kind of a scattered form.

139
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,760
But this link, the hash maps,
they will be storing the data

140
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,040
in a linear fashion, but

141
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,520
sometimes the retrieval is

142
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,320
not as good as these hash maps
and the three maps,

143
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,760
they will give you faster retrieval speed,

144
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,560
but not a good insertion speed. Why?

145
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,040
Because every time we insert
a new piece of data in the tree map,

146
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,360
first it has to find its location.

147
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,280
Because remember, they store the data
in salted form so fast, that tree

148
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,480
map has to find the perfect location
for that newly added data.

149
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,520
And then the insertion happens.

150
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,480
So they kind of first compare that element
with all the existing elements

151
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,640
that are present in the tree map,
and then they decide

152
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,960
where to put that newly inserted that.

153
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,280
So that's why the insertion is slow,
but retrieval is fast.

154
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,960
It all those elements
in the ascending order, ISIS.

155
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,200
So in such an order is maintained,

156
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,240
but it is slower in in performance
than a hash map. But

157
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,600
or maybe I should say it is

158
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,120
slower when it comes to

159
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:54,120
retrieve the data.

160
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,720
So insertion order is maintained,
but it is slower

161
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,600
when it comes to retrieve the data

162
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,040
as compared to

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,920
a hash map.

164
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,240
But back to insertion speed,
then three maps.

165
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,200
All right.

166
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,560
So we want to use

167
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,000
when we need to

168
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,880
maintain the order of the

169
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,080
after backup, when we need to maintain

170
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,120
the insertion

171
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,520
order of detecting it.

172
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,560
And then we should be going
with the limit, the hash map.

173
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,680
So what we are compromising in here,
we are compromising a little bit of

174
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:03,920
retrieval speed, but the insertion order
will be maintained. Then

175
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,560
we discussed about the

176
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:17,240
three maps right.

177
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,120
Three maps

178
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,040
for the data

179
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
started to fall.

180
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,520
Insertion is slow,

181
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,280
retrieval is

182
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,560
fast. Yes.

183
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,600
We will remember all of these rules
for the interviews.

184
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,200
Yes. So

185
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,160
it's a very famous interview question.

186
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,680
I was also asked about these maps
in my interview several times.

187
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,600
So they will be asking that,

188
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,560
hey, guys, what is the difference
between a tree map and a hash map?

189
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,240
When I showed you the tree map,
When I showed you the hash map.

190
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,200
So you guys should really focus in here.

191
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,800
So there are three types of these sets
that we have discussed.

192
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,720
And there are three types of the maps
that we are discussing

193
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,240
right now.

194
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,920
And you guys don't need to remember,
actually, if you focus on on the

195
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,480
on on how a data structure
is doing something right,

196
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,200
if something is sorting the data
that we are inserting inside back,

197
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,040
definitely it will be taking more time
to find out that

198
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,240
that perfect location of newly newly

199
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,040
the data that we are going to insert
please explain

200
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,640
not suitable for thread safe
operation in context of the maps.

201
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,120
Okay. I meant that.

202
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,600
So guys focus on on the properties
and from these properties

203
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,880
you guys can derive the benefits
and the advantages and disadvantages

204
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,640
of these maps.

205
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,120
So tree maps in the

206
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,400
store story
that are in, in, in sorted form.

207
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,320
So insertion is slow

208
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,560
because

209
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,080
tree map has to

210
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,520
compare the data

211
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,760
with existing elements.

212
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,040
Right.

213
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,200
So let's say if you are

214
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,200
so if let's say there are maybe

215
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,160
102 houses right
there, let's take the example of house

216
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,080
and they are numbered like ten below 15.

217
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,000
So on the

218
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,280
200, 300 and then let's add
this lot is empty, right?

219
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,400
Or maybe less than 50.

220
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,920
Now, if a new element comes in

221
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,960
so they are so let's put it 500.

222
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,720
So right now they are all in sorted form
right then 1250 increasing

223
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,720
order 2200 350
Now if a new element comes in the 75.

224
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,280
So the tree map, what it will do for us,
it will compare it with ten.

225
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,640
Okay, it's greater than ten.

226
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,760
Let's check the next next element.

227
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,320
If we get to that, well,
let's get the next elements to get it.

228
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,640
And here it will say, okay,

229
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,760
this element is greater than this one,
but it's a smaller than this to this 200.

230
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,520
That means I should
put it somewhere in here.

231
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,120
So you
guys, to see why the insertion is low?

232
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,760
Because tree map has to find that location
first.

233
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,800
It has to compare the element
with existing elements

234
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
to find a perfect location.

235
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,800
Otherwise,
the data will not be in the sorted form.

236
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,280
So this extravagant that tree
map has to go to

237
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,680
it makes the insertion slope

238
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,120
so the existing data elements.

239
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,520
So it has to compare the data
that existing elements

240
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,000
births of are

241
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:25,480
insertion is slope,

242
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,240
but retrieval is fast.

243
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,320
Now that that

244
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,440
read the safety.

245
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,720
Let me first explain that

246
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,880
y in link the hash map retrieval is slow.

247
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,760
So, Alona, you remember the link the list,
the link listed that we discussed

248
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,920
when we were discussing the list,
what was the disadvantage of link list?

249
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,000
If I have

250
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,640
to go to the next element,
what I have to do,

251
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,080
I have to first
go to all the previous elements.

252
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,400
Right?

253
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,920
If I am storing their type in a link,
the hash map.

254
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,280
So the linked hash

255
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,800
map internally, it is a link
to list of the stored in that.

256
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,240
Now the link list, it only remembers
the address of the next element.

257
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,760
Right? It does not know
the location of the last element.

258
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,440
If I have to go to the last element,
I must.

259
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,720
I trade to all the elements
that are present

260
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,320
before that.

261
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,160
So if I have to go in here,

262
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,440
I cannot go in here directly in the link
list.

263
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,520
This node, if I am
this is my starting node.

264
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,720
If I want to go in here first,
I have to go in here.

265
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,520
Then this node will tell me
the address of the next node.

266
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,160
Then I will go in here.

267
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,400
Then in here, then in here, and then
finally I can raise to this element.

268
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,200
Now, if there are maybe,
let's say, 1 million elements before

269
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,760
and before this element,

270
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,200
I have to go through all those 1
million elements.

271
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,760
That's why they are slow.

272
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,840
But on the other impact, on the other side
where this hash map is doing,

273
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,040
hash map using the special function
called the hash function.

274
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,040
The beauty of that cache function
is that the

275
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,280
then the data will be stored

276
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,040
in the form in the lesson this is are that

277
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,000
computer memory will be stored.

278
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,480
All the data

279
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,800
you guys will be using the hash
maps, lost hash maps super, super fast

280
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,760
for searching, for storing, for retrieving

281
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,600
super, super fast.

282
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,680
If you don't care about in such an order,
if you don't care about sorting,

283
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,280
always go with the hash maps
most widely used data type.

284
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,680
So the beauty of these hash maps
is that they using the hash function

285
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,960
and this hash function,
it is built on very hairy matter.

286
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,920
You guys don't need to go into the detail,
but in simple words,

287
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,520
you guys can understand this
if I give the key.

288
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,200
So the the the map,
it stores the data in the form of

289
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,080
let me actually

290
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,720
recommend.

291
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,280
Right.

292
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,400
So this

293
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,560
let's say this is our storage area.

294
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,480
We are studying Google
and there are so many memory locations.

295
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,040
They are also part of memory cells in here
right.

296
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,120
So these memory cells,
they all have addresses of, for example,

297
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,440
this is the address
it has addressed and so on.

298
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,720
B, maybe 15, maybe 12.

299
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,760
So this hash function,
what is the beauty of this

300
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,560
hash function if we give it the key?

301
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,840
So in, in, in hash map,

302
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,880
we stole the data in the form of

303
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,960
is there are no values, right.

304
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,880
Like this.

305
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,120
So this is key one, this is two,
this is three.

306
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,360
This is for right.

307
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,280
If I give the key to this function,
it will add the output.

308
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,200
It will tell me the task of the data
that is stored will be number one.

309
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,680
It's on memory location ten.

310
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,640
So I don't have to go through any link

311
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,800
list or any three map or anything either

312
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,280
directly be jumping on that exact memory
location.

313
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,800
We have that is stored for that specific.

314
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,040
If I give it the value of three,
it will tell me that

315
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,960
that the value for the key
number three is 15.

316
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,480
So the the the beauty of this hash map
we give the key,

317
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,560
it directly gives the address
where we where the data is stored.

318
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,400
Okay.

319
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,640
And there is a complex
math behind there and how it all works.

320
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,120
But we we don't need to

321
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,640
go into those details.

322
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,680
So that's why they are passed

323
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,800
all the things.

324
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,080
So now that that parent safety right

325
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,120
then we guys

326
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,680
let's see.

327
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,800
But since it is a function
input can be more than one

328
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,200
but only one output.

329
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,640
But since it is a function,
input can be more than one,

330
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,760
but only one output,

331
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,200
not only one output for different inputs,

332
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,640
the outputs will be different,
but they can collide.

333
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,280
Damir If you are asking asking
about collision, a collision can happen.

334
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,600
And in that case, what do we do?

335
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,320
We create a linked list.

336
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,680
So let's say for example.

337
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,560
So guys, this is only for the it.

338
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,440
So let's say a key is being mapped

339
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,280
to to the same output number.

340
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,200
So what will happen this, this map,
it will grow this way

341
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,680
in the form of a linked list.

342
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,000
If one input is being

343
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,560
if multiple inputs are being map
to the same output,

344
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,960
there will be a collision
and to award that collision

345
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,000
the data scientist they have created
and they will add these.

346
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,640
This map will start to grow

347
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,720
in the form of a linked list
for that specific memory location.

348
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,040
And then it maps
1 to 1 in the sense of location collision.

349
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,200
Yep, it can happen.

350
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,880
So the they

351
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:04,360
they also have a solution for that.

352
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,400
Okay so guys let's imagine this scenario.

353
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:17,640
So this is related to traffic safety.

354
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,000
So guys
what language are those two using guys?

355
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,480
It's the mathematics.

356
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,880
So guys, have you guys noticed that

357
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,640
when a new iPhone comes
in, you guys see long rows of people

358
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,840
standing out outside of the stores
to buy a buy sometimes

359
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,880
those iPhones right.

360
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,640
So as sometimes in our real life

361
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,000
as sometimes in our real life,
what can happen?

362
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,720
The resources can be limited,

363
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,040
but maybe multiple
people want to access that same resource.

364
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,440
Now, if there is no organization,
what happens is

365
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,880
if there is no organization,
what can happen?

366
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,000
There can be a fight right?

367
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,840
So in in programing,

368
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:22,200
if you are storing a piece of data,
if you are storing a piece of data,

369
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,040
you guys already know
that these days are computers.

370
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,200
They can have multiple brains,
multiple CPU cores.

371
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,440
Right? Multiple CPU processing.

372
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,040
So it's kind of having
multiple brains, but

373
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,360
having the same memory
we are with stored the data.

374
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,280
So if you are writing your programs
in such a way

375
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,680
that you want to utilize
the underlying power of your CPU,

376
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,320
what can happen?

377
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:02,120
So let's say, for example,
there is a very big list

378
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,040
and that list is stored inside direct.

379
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,560
Okay, on then there may be a map.

380
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,840
Now there are,
there are maybe 5 million elements.

381
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,560
So 1 to 1 million

382
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,040
are stored in here.

383
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,720
Then from

384
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,040
one zero, 1

385
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,520
million to 2
million are stored in here and then so on.

386
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,840
So now if you try to process
this very big list

387
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,240
using a single simple from your computer

388
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,960
and let's say to process
the 3 million entries

389
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,560
we need left at 30 minutes.

390
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Now, tell me, guys,
if I am processing this list

391
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,080
with only one CPU,
how much time it will take?

392
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,160
It has 3 million elements
and I am using single sip

393
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:18,120
you to, let's say,
maybe find an element from this list.

394
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,520
So if

395
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,440
1 million

396
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,800
elements required

397
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,480
30 minutes to process, guess

398
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,120
how much time? 3 million entries.

399
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,800
We are ten days.

400
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,640
90 minutes.

401
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,680
Right.

402
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,000
You can also

403
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,920
imagine maybe I am trying to build a house

404
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,200
and there is only one worker
that is working right now.

405
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,280
And if that worker keeps on working,
it will take maybe

406
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,480
for him to construct that house,
Maybe it will take six months or one year.

407
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,920
If I double the number of workers guys,

408
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,120
if I double the number of C bills

409
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,760
that will start
and this data, how much time it will take.

410
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,240
Now, 45 minutes

411
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,880
prior to the time will be reduced by half.

412
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,560
If I again increase the number of

413
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,400
workers to three.

414
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,800
So initially it was taking 90 minutes 90

415
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,520
divided by three,
how much time it will take?

416
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,320
Now it will take 30 minutes.

417
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,120
Right.

418
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,120
So what we want to use, what we want to do
because we have extra

419
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,120
C bills in our memory, you can you

420
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,280
can think of excessive use as

421
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,720
workers working on something.

422
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,320
If I double if I utilize all of my CPU.

423
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,200
So right now in my laptop,
I have six CPU cores.

424
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,000
You guys can also find out

425
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,840
about your CPU cores.

426
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,680
So for example, if I to the task manager

427
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,920
on my computer

428
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,840
and if I go 13 800 x

429
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,120
so it shows me that there are six goals

430
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,280
in my processor

431
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,240
and there are logical
there are 12 logical processors.

432
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,360
Okay, this means each worker you can think
of like each worker has four hands.

433
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,680
So not only the number of workers,
they are six,

434
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,560
but they also
they are double in efficiency.

435
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,400
And if you guys notice in here,
there is something that is called

436
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,000
as ten X, okay.

437
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,280
Now, what is this terms
and what are these processes?

438
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,160
Each program

439
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,440
that is running right now on

440
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,680
my computer, for example, Slack

441
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,720
Chrome intelligence world, Zoom,

442
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,960
all the programs
running in the background.

443
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,920
For example, if there is an email,
I automatically get the notification

444
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,840
how there is a program
that continuously keeps on checking

445
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,960
if there is a new email or not. Yes.

446
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,240
So right now, my on my computer,

447
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,840
there are 282 programs
that are running right now.

448
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,480
And each program internally

449
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,120
can use multiple symbols

450
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,400
to make things faster.

451
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,760
For example, if I try to maybe on Intel,

452
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,720
if I am executing two programs
or on Google Chrome,

453
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,800
if I am opening four tabs or six tabs
eight tabs on one tab, I am running

454
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,240
maybe YouTube on the other tab,
I may be running Netflix.

455
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,560
How all of these they are separate,
separate, different tasks.

456
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,400
If I want to run them in parallel,

457
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,840
I want that many workers

458
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,120
so you guys can think of
these workers as terrorists.

459
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,600
Now, the whole

460
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,920
story why I'm explaining this
is that when you are writing

461
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,800
such programs,
which can utilize the complete power

462
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:46,080
of a computer, all the logical cores,
all the threads, what can happen?

463
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,720
There can be a fight, right?

464
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,360
If there is only one store that is selling

465
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,080
the iPhones right.

466
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,440
And if my baby multiple people,
they all want to access this store

467
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,000
and at the same time,

468
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,320
there can be a fight.

469
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,800
So what happens
is that to avoid this fight,

470
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,120
we have a concept that is called terror.

471
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,040
Safety

472
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,280
that to stab safety.

473
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,840
Black Friday and

474
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,840
back to train safety makes sure

475
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,200
that there is no for a fight
and everything goes slowed.

476
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,320
The person who comes
first should get the iPhone first, right?

477
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,680
The person who comes after
that should get the iPhone after that.

478
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,760
And it keeps track of all those persons,

479
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,600
all those workers
who are looking for the same resource.

480
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,000
These maps,

481
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,680
for example, the train

482
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,640
map, it does not have that organization.

483
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,640
It does not have that mechanism
to ensure this

484
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,480
this this organization.

485
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,520
That's why we say it's not thread safe,

486
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:15,120
because if multiple staples
are trying to access this dream map,

487
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,600
if there is a dirt outlet, 50 million LTE
elements are stored in a tree map

488
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,680
and you want to utilize
the full power of your computer

489
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,680
and you make use of carriers,
there can be a fight

490
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,000
because there is no organization
organizing

491
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,600
mechanism in in three maps.

492
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,120
There are other maps
which have this organization.

493
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,600
So 1050 you guys can think of maybe
a bodyguard, a security guard holding

494
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,280
a big a giant stick in his hand

495
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,960
who make sure that everything
is organized.

496
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,080
So these teams built
and they don't have that again, they act

497
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,760
without security guards.

498
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,320
So that's why we say they are not Tazi.

499
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,120
I hope it makes sense.

500
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:22,280
How do you guys able to relate it?

501
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,920
Okay,
so all these maps that we have discussed,

502
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,680
the hash map
they linked, hash map dreams, they are

503
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,120
all without that security guard.

504
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,600
They are all not tried safe.

505
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,560
If you want to make sure
make sure they had safety and safety.

506
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,160
Now I know what is going on Friday.

507
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,000
Well, can you tell me the name of map
that has this

508
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:53,000
this of safety?

509
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,440
So the
it was presented in the slides, right.

510
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,600
Did you guys go to the slides

511
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,600
that read safety the bill?

512
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,800
The question going to be
it was asking if actually it was present

513
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:14,240
in the slides.

514
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,280
That means you guys are not going
through the slides, right?

515
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,960
And then you complain.

516
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,440
Hall And we are jumping from the window.

517
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,920
Nothing is making sense.

518
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,240
We are about to die, blah, blah, blah,

519
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,560
because you guys are not setting right and

520
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,920
so that that hash

521
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,720
map is called hash table is are transitive

522
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,400
hash table plus implements a

523
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,840
hash table
which makes a map squares to values,

524
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,360
hash table implements the map interface

525
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,880
like the other.

526
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
So hash double is similar

527
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
to hash map, except it is synchronized

528
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,400
or we say it is safe.

529
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,720
All we hope is magic

530
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,280
hash table.

531
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,000
But we didn't learned that say that
that's all about the hash stable

532
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,520
all same all the methods are same
everything is same

533
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,640
if just cannot safe

534
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,680
two classes at the same time.

535
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,720
Java plus selenium one should have been
finished, then started.

536
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,440
So don't worry.

537
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,280
This is the second last class of Java.

538
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,200
Farhad.

539
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:41,360
So when you guys will be done
with the, with the Java,

540
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,080
is there anything else that you guys
want me to explain from this slide?

541
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,440
Bill Is there anything else
that I didn't explain in the last

542
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:55,960
class?

543
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,720
So tree maps, rapid retrieval,
slow insertion

544
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,080
on synchronized mean, not save,

545
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,080
which means it is not suitable
for tattoo safe operations.

546
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,600
Next Sunday's last, I think.

547
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,720
Yes I have just to be on safe side.

548
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,520
I have already started one more class
or the next Sunday

549
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,200
will see if we need that class or not.

550
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,320
Yes, I requested that class.

551
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,160
Yes, we need.

552
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,040
After

553
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,280
Java,
you guys will be starting the test and

554
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,760
putting all your knowledge of Selenium
and Java together

555
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,000
in the form of a beautiful project
that will do many,

556
00:37:40,000 --> 00:38:07,560
many different things.

557
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,000
I hope the best of that's things
we have covered.

558
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,480
Are there any questions,
guys, related to maps?

559
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,280
It is more concept, but we do our best

560
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,800
and practice a lot, not anything.

561
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,480
We should definitely have a class
to review.

562
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,360
The whole Java would feel good examples.

563
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,960
Lobo deck.

564
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,560
We will arrange after you guys are done
with the your other classes.

565
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,960
So at the end of the course
we will ask you.

566
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,600
We will have a poll
and then you guys can request to specific

567
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,040
sessions on specific topics.

568
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,160
So let's see if something is not clear
from Java or Selenium

569
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,840
on manual testing,
you guys can all request those topics.

570
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,280
So when you will be revising
all the material for your interviews,

571
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,040
if something is not clear,
we will be having a poll

572
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,440
and then we will be having additional

573
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
additional topics.

574
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,200
And then you guys can obviously ask
for your favorite instructor

575
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,600
to have that session.

576
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,680
So there will be no distinction off
of hopefully of instructors

577
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:16,680
as well.

578
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,120
What we're doing with hash
table are we're using

579
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,360
to make like it as has three
just missed that part.

580
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:30,120
No the only thing with the hash tables
how simple they are class safe.

581
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah they have that security guard
who makes sure that whoever comes

582
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,280
first gets against the data first.

583
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,440
Those hash tables.

584
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,320
Otherwise, everything is same.

585
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,040
And they make sure that with the help

586
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,600
of a synchronized keyword,
when we are done in three months,

587
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,320
we are going to ask for the
how to put intel over it again.

588
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,080
Yes. Alright

589
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,400
guys, are you guys ready to start the

590
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,400
working with

591
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,160
files class? So

592
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,400
why is still showing

593
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,320
on the calendar that they're either
Java class on the second?

594
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,920
Because I just started back

595
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,440
now so that if something is not clear,

596
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,600
maybe we can discuss that
in that last class.

597
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,080
My import still didn't work.

598
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,120
Some of what I posted in the course
announcement 30 minutes before the class

599
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,800
that if someone is having issues,
please let me know.

600
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,840
But anyhow, she was there.

601
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,480
Ask him to,
connect to your laptop or computer.

602
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,720
And so for this working with files,
we will not be needing those jobs.

603
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,960
But be after the break.

604
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,400
Make sure that everything is working
as you are to connect with my friend

605
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,120
from Bastian.

606
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,480
Got his job recently. He is very happy.

607
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,440
Encourages me to.

608
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,040
Oh, by the way, the best
and they had the last class with me are

609
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,000
on today Saturday.

610
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,520
Right.

611
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,480
So they had last
class was on on Wednesday.

612
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,720
They still have to prepare
for their interviews.

613
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,160
We still have to teach them
how to make resumés.

614
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,960
They are still left

615
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,040
with Docker class database classes,
but they are they were so impatient,

616
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,560
they started applying
and they have started getting their jobs.

617
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,560
Maybe I will invite some of the best
and students as well.

618
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:56,760
Then we will be having the skill classes.

619
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,360
Please don't tell, don't

620
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:02,200
tell his name, otherwise
he will be on the newspaper next day.

621
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,080
All ladies are interested in.

622
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,560
They may write it.

623
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,600
I'm just kidding.

624
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,440
Yes, you guys can tell the name
and maybe if you know them,

625
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,400
you guys can have a meeting
or you guys can set up some kind of things

626
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,800
to ask about the experience
and everything to learn about.

627
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:29,080
Maybe you guys are how to improve
your learning experience and all that.

628
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,320
You guys can discuss that

629
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,880
I will invite.

630
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,880
I am waiting at least 2 to 3 students

631
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,720
so that all of them
they can share their experiences.

632
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:46,480
I have experience working as a journalist.

633
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,360
All right.

634
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,520
So today's class is very easy as always,

635
00:42:50,880 --> 00:43:00,600
right? So

636
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,560
tell me, guys, this tell me this.

637
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,080
I know said that

638
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,200
I. I like that easy pie.

639
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,240
No, no, it's actually easy.

640
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,160
There are three things
that if you guys know

641
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:27,480
about those three things,
this class is super easy.

642
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,240
So assignment.

643
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,320
They don't wait for the course to end

644
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,880
before they can start having practice
or preparing for the interviews.

645
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,240
So Russell want the job

646
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,040
now? Soon they start preparing for be

647
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,440
for the interviews
and everything as they are learning

648
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,640
because so for example,
when you guys will be learning

649
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,080
cucumber understanding,
what I expect from you is that you are

650
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,320
you are also revising
at least 3 to 4 slides per day

651
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,200
from Java or manual testing or selenium
and all back don't rate.

652
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,400
That would be once because we learned

653
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,160
then we will revise everything
and then we will prepare for that.

654
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,200
Please don't do that.

655
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,840
You guys will not be able to do that
because it will be huge

656
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,320
and it be very huge material
and it will take like for example,

657
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,200
one month, it can take one month
if you are trying to prepare

658
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,920
all of that at at the at the end.

659
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,480
So try to break it down and try to have
your breakfast side by side

660
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,240
or don't wait for the course to.

661
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,120
And it will be very difficult.

662
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,320
You All right, guys? So you are saying

663
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,400
if I have to let's say guys

664
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,160
read the data from a file or a computer
manually, Right.

665
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,520
So what do I need?

666
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,280
What what do I need to know fast
if I have to?

667
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,120
Let's say I read a file from my computer.

668
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,280
What is the first thing
that I should know?

669
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,520
The location. Right?

670
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,920
First,
I must navigate to that specific file

671
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,640
that to that specific folder
where that that file is located.

672
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,480
Right.

673
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,840
So what do I do?

674
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,480
First,
I need to know the location. Right. So.

675
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,360
Okay, once
I know, once I know the location,

676
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,760
let's say from I want to read this file.

677
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,920
Now, what is the second thing
that should be present on my computer?

678
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:30,840
If I want to read the
Excel files, the program and

679
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,520
an appropriate program must

680
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,720
be installed on my computer
if I want to read a specific type of file.

681
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,600
Right.

682
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,040
For the PDF files, we have PDF reader
right for the text files.

683
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
We have the text file Editor's.

684
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,680
For example, on Windows
we have Notepad plus plus.

685
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,080
I would add the metadata
for the Java files we have intended

686
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,720
for Excel files. We have Microsoft Excel.

687
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,880
So all of these files well, for example,
if I tried to

688
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,560
use maybe PDF Reader to excel files,

689
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:12,000
can I do that?

690
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,160
No. Right. Some programs.

691
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,880
Yes. This port opening multiple files,
but not all of them.

692
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,560
Right.

693
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,440
So what happens is that

694
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,240
first we need the location of the file
that we want to read.

695
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:30,600
The second thing we must use
appropriate program to open that file.

696
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,800
Right.

697
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,480
And the third thing I must know,

698
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,280
I must have a little bit knowledge
about the structure of that file.

699
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,480
I want if I want to layer the data,
for example, in Excel files,

700
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:51,160
Excel files the data.

701
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,000
I hope everyone has an interaction,
previously had an interaction with Excel.

702
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,040
So for Exemplify, talk
about the structure, all the Excel files,

703
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,320
they are divided into workbooks
and all the workbooks that they have.

704
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,600
Then these shared and all this year,

705
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,600
then they have these columns
and rows, right?

706
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,840
Is there anyone who don't understand this
all the,

707
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,080
all the files,
they can have different structures, right?

708
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,640
If I am writing a program
that that can read the data successfully,

709
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,280
I must also have an idea
how that file is storing their data.

710
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:30,960
Right?

711
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,760
What is the internal
structure that file is using?

712
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,840
So, for example, in Excel files.

713
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,000
We have workbooks inside the workbooks.

714
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,360
We have sheers inside.

715
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,520
This year we have rows and columns
right in text files.

716
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,040
We don't have that much complex structure.

717
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,880
The files stores
the data in the form of rules, right?

718
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,880
So I can start creating row by row,
but different file.

719
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,120
They can have different structure.

720
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,240
So we choose to also keep that in mind.

721
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,160
Right? So

722
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,400
let me

723
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,840
let me write down those points for you

724
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,160
to read

725
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:16,280
the data from a file,

726
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:21,800
we must have below

727
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,000
things right.

728
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,440
Number one

729
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,200
part or

730
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,200
location

731
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,520
of the file

732
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,080
on are some people.

733
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,600
And the second thing

734
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,760
appropriate

735
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,600
program must be installed

736
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,680
on the stomach.

737
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,600
We would go to read the back from the

738
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:15,480
file, for example,

739
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,320
or Excel Sex.

740
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,120
I hope this is the correct extension
we use.

741
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,360
We use

742
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,800
Microsoft Excel

743
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,680
for not PDA files.

744
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,440
We we can use

745
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,800
Adobe Reader, right?

746
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,280
Because fixed followed order.

747
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,480
Right for

748
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,680
law to be free files the way

749
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,200
we can use

750
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,200
not read it.

751
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,040
So every file is kind of have have

752
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,840
that has that specialized

753
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,360
program.

754
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,560
The third thing

755
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,160
we must also know a little bit

756
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,880
about the

757
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,240
vector of that

758
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:30,760
file.

759
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,360
For example, in

760
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,880
Excel files,

761
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:41,960
data is stored in the form of

762
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,560
workbooks and

763
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,200
workbooks.

764
00:50:52,200 --> 00:51:06,400
Workbooks here rows and columns.

765
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,120
So we must also know a little
about the structure of that file.

766
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,400
For example, in

767
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,600
Excel Files,
the data is stored in the form

768
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,520
of workbooks key,

769
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,760
and then inside.

770
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,720
Inside in the form of workbooks.

771
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,920
Inside

772
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,040
workbook.

773
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,800
We have

774
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,440
Fields one inside

775
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,520
here we have

776
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,120
a role and

777
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,240
columns or

778
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,200
cells or columns.

779
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,800
They are also cells or sometimes in Excel.

780
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,080
So are these three parts player guys.

781
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:11,880
Is there anyone who is confused
about these three points?

782
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,000
Only, Only now learn how similar it all.

783
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,960
You guys having any issues and any.

784
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:28,560
Okay, now we will try to do the same thing
but with the Java program.

785
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,760
Okay we will try to do the same thing
but with Java programs.

786
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,680
So the first type of files

787
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,320
that we will be learning

788
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,280
how to deal with,
those files are called property files.

789
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:49,720
And before I can show you that,
why we know

790
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,040
we are learning these properties files,
tell me this, guys.

791
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,920
You guys have started learning selenium.

792
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,440
And if there is a website

793
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,680
required for you to enter the username
and password,

794
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:08,720
we are you storing
that username and password right now. So

795
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,120
we will learn

796
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,040
the export as well.

797
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,200
You are you guys storing those usernames
passwords

798
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,760
you are allowed
and all that inside the code,

799
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,960
inside the java,
some kind of java variable,

800
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,680
maybe a string variable.

801
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,560
Okay.

802
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,960
And once you guys are done
with the programing or writing that

803
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,560
selenium script,
you guys will be pushing that

804
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:49,800
go to the GitHub right?

805
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,360
So tell me

806
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,960
on the companies, if you do that,

807
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,240
if you have a username and password,

808
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,280
if anyone has the access to your code,

809
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,360
will he also be having access
to username and password

810
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:08,440
for specific websites from your code?

811
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:15,960
Is it a good idea or bad idea?

812
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,280
It's a very bad idea because in companies,

813
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:25,240
every employer will be given separate
credentials.

814
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,360
Why separate credentials?

815
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,280
Let's say you are given the
you are given username and password of

816
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,080
maybe a specific website or database
and what do you do?

817
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,600
You try to delete the data
from the database or you try to look

818
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,640
for private data on your database.

819
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,360
So if you try to do
and if you have your separate

820
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,360
username and password,
companies will be able to track you,

821
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,160
they will be used,
they will track your username and password

822
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,160
and they will know which employee

823
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:05,000
accessed the private data
or tried to delete some data

824
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,560
or try to mess up
with any of their things.

825
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:13,040
The infrastructure,
the servers, the databases, the programs.

826
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,080
So each employee in companies
in real life, they are given

827
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,480
separate usernames and passwords
for the emails, for the database

828
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,640
is for the application and servers
for staging server production servers.

829
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,480
All of you will be having your separate

830
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,480
username and password for everything

831
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,520
so that

832
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,880
if anything goes wrong in
any of the areas, they can track it down.

833
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,640
Whoever this is.

834
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,120
So for example,
if I showed near the whole database,

835
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,760
they will be able to find out who did it
because so that

836
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,880
so if you guys

837
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,440
will be having a separate username
and password,

838
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,640
you don't, you never want to share
those usernames and passwords.

839
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,120
You will be definitely

840
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,800
you will be using those usernames
and passwords for your testing,

841
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,440
but you will never be sharing
with your colleagues.

842
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,160
Right.

843
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,200
Because using your username and password,
they can do something wrong

844
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,200
and then you guys will be in deep trouble.

845
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,520
So when you guys will be writing scripts,

846
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,160
maybe you are working on a banking
application, right?

847
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,200
So you are testing a specific part
which stores the

848
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,800
maybe the pins of the credit cards
or debit cards.

849
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,560
Right?

850
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,520
So it's a very,
very sensitive information.

851
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,080
So only few trusted employees
in the companies, they are given access

852
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,680
to the separate they create separate
usernames and passwords

853
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,480
and only using those usernames
and passwords, that data can be accessed.

854
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,240
So what do they do if they are writing
some kind of script scripts?

855
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:03,520
They never want to put that data
inside the code, right?

856
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,760
Otherwise everyone will be able to see
that username and password

857
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,240
from the repository
because it repository is kind of a shared.

858
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,840
Everyone will be pushing that to that
get reports.

859
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,000
The others will be cloning.

860
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,240
From that multiple people
will be working on the same project.

861
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,680
So we need some mechanism to separate out

862
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,240
some information from our code.

863
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,920
We never, never we never ever put

864
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:32,640
a sensitive information inside core,
but we do

865
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,960
we always put that information
in some kind of files,

866
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,200
and then

867
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,960
we write our Java code in such a way

868
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,480
that can read that information
from the files.

869
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,480
When we have to test that script,

870
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,120
we place that file on a specific folder.

871
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,560
Once the testing is done,
we deliver that file,

872
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,880
okay, Or we don't share that file
with anyone else.

873
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,880
So that's how we we separate out

874
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,880
our data from code.

875
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,000
It's very important.

876
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,360
The second reason is that if you put your
usernames and passwords inside the code,

877
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:21,000
sometimes you will be testing
your code on production server,

878
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,760
some sort of study on production,
sometimes on the staging servers,

879
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,480
sometimes on the unity servers, sometimes
maybe on US servers, All those servers.

880
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,000
They also have different
usernames and passwords.

881
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,240
So every time you push your code

882
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,440
to the next environment,
to the next server, you guys have to

883
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,960
change the code, updated
the username and password inside the code.

884
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,880
Now that is also not a good idea.

885
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,320
Can you guys tell me why changing code
when moving from one environment

886
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,120
to another environment is not a good idea

887
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,080
and why it is not allowed

888
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,120
Bugs and security.

889
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,080
Right?

890
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:12,720
Something was working perfectly fine
on the development environment, right?

891
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,560
When you had to test
that you changed something

892
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:20,080
inside of the code from some developer
or the testers.

893
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,840
They can modify the code, right,
to maybe leak the data

894
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,000
or to to to write some kind of virus.

895
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,880
So once the code is deployed
on the developer server, even before that,

896
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,960
it goes through a proper mechanism
that is called

897
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,600
a review architects or hired team members.

898
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,160
They they tested that code that would call
a developer has written

899
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:49,880
once that code passes the review,
no one is allowed to change that code

900
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,880
until there is a proper
testing done by AQR.

901
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,480
And he reports a bug.

902
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,680
And that bug is also discussed
with the team lead architects.

903
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,720
Then a new fix is created
the code exchange.

904
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,760
Again, it goes through the review
and then all the process repeats.

905
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,200
We never, ever changed the code
just because sometimes

906
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,120
we testing on other words or sometimes on
staging server, sometimes on production.

907
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:18,680
Right?

908
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,520
It can introduce
bugs. It's a very bad practice for

909
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,880
security purposes. So

910
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,480
what do we do for those reasons as well?

911
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:31,440
We also store the credentials in a file

912
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,000
when we have to best
that code on a staging server.

913
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,040
We update the credentials inside the file

914
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,680
and we place that file
on a specific location.

915
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:47,880
And in our Java program
we instruct out of our program

916
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,120
to always read the data
from their specific folder.

917
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,520
So from environment to environment,
we will not be changing the Java code.

918
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:01,440
We will only be updating those files
with updated credentials.

919
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,720
Can you show all text in the note?

920
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,240
This one you mean

921
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,320
or you want me to write

922
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,440
that down on the notes

923
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,120
is the environment is a part
of our testing environments.

924
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:19,160
Are dev environment
staging part of what we know

925
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:20,960
part of

926
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,360
Look, Alexia, here is the note here.

927
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,640
Here are the notes.
Let me write it down on the note.

928
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,840
The things that we have just discussed.

929
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,640
Why store

930
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,480
sensitive

931
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,640
part of separating
the codes is the environment.

932
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:49,680
Environment part of separating the code.

933
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,640
No code is always the same,

934
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,600
no matter on which environment
it executes.

935
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,360
We Never write separate code
for separate environments.

936
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,240
Code is same.

937
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,760
The files can change, the data can change,

938
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,480
but code will always be same.

939
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,480
Whether you are accessing,
editing or deleting it, it will be same.

940
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,880
There will not be a single character that

941
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,080
that will be changed from one environment
to the other environment.

942
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,560
You have to write your code in the form,

943
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,960
like you have to write genetic code
that can work on all the environments.

944
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:32,000
But once that the that code passes
the review, you will not be allowed

945
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,320
to change that code, right?

946
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,520
Otherwise every developer can write
a piece of code that can steal

947
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,480
all the sensitive data off the credit
card.

948
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:39,880
Right.

949
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,600
And can send that to his email.

950
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,680
Right.

951
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:51,600
So that then that is not allowed.

952
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:59,920
So why store sensitive data?

953
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,200
Why we

954
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,520
to learn about

955
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,360
file handling?

956
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,320
And by the way, this reading
and writing that out to file, it's

957
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:24,080
called file handling in Java.

958
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,240
We store sensitive data in

959
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,520
in files instead

960
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,760
of for food that no

961
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,640
one can

962
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,240
access.

963
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,240
And that data

964
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:52,080
will write the code inside

965
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,160
Java programs

966
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:03,400
to read the third in for at runtime from

967
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,960
some kind of

968
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,240
of file.

969
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:21,360
Perform the best thing.

970
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,320
So we try to be coding
tied to Java programs to read that info

971
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,320
at runtime from some kind of

972
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,800
file,

973
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,120
perform the testing

974
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,560
and once

975
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:43,560
everything is done, we

976
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:55,440
delete those files.

977
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,600
So why is store sensitive the time file

978
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,920
instead of work
so that no one can access that data?

979
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,480
We write the code inside the our programs
to read their data

980
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,560
at runtime from some kind of file.

981
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,600
Perform the testing.

982
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,720
Once testing is done, we deliver the data

983
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,240
to the

984
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:32,400
second reason.

985
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,600
When you guys know about the

986
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,720
about the specific type of testing

987
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,920
in which we use a lot of data,

988
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,440
is there any free wording
for the operator?

989
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,160
I could not find it.

990
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,280
I think there is a free virgin

991
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,720
use preview in Mac.

992
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,720
This there is almost nothing else
you will need.

993
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:59,520
You can also use some similar programs
to read your files. Yes.

994
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,320
So guys, do

995
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,040
you know about the data
testing terminology in which we use?

996
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,960
Use a lot of data to test.

997
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,000
Let's say for example,
if you have to test a field

998
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,440
and let's say that field

999
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,560
should only allow maybe

1000
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,960
eight characters and

1001
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:27,000
there should be a uppercase letter,
a lower case letter,

1002
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,600
maybe a special character
or some kind of other rules

1003
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,880
for how how you guys will
test these kind of things

1004
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,760
is like
stress testing, something like that.

1005
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,760
So you will generate

1006
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,040
these different types of data

1007
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,680
inside an Excel file

1008
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,800
in a column that sometimes will be having
uppercase lowercase,

1009
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,480
a number of special characters

1010
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,840
length more than their length,

1011
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,240
less than their specific number
of characters and all that.

1012
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,160
And you all that data from the Excel file,

1013
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,400
you insert that back to inside the fields

1014
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,800
and you check if that field allows
that specific data or not,

1015
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,280
or sometimes if you guys have you guys

1016
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,600
visited that a syntax extremist website

1017
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:28,360
for your selenium scripts.

1018
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,920
So that web site has

1019
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:36,160
first name, last name, employee's
date of birth, the joining date

1020
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,080
and all the sorts of the
there are huge amounts of info.

1021
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,640
Sometimes you have to enter

1022
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,760
huge amounts of data
inside those forms to test them out.

1023
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,080
So what do you guys think?

1024
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,640
Is it a good idea
to put all that data inside the code

1025
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,640
or we should create
maybe a separate file format as

1026
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,280
separate file?

1027
01:07:59,280 --> 01:07:59,960
Right.

1028
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,640
Because if there are new rules,
you don't have to change your code

1029
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,040
or you just introduce that new data
inside of that separate

1030
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,920
that Excel file and your program,
it will be genetic program.

1031
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,840
It will pull the data from different
different fields from your Excel file.

1032
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:22,160
It will pull that data inside those fields
and your testing will be done.

1033
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,280
So you just need
to update your Excel files.

1034
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:28,240
If there are new rules
when will be testing these forms

1035
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,520
like like applications?

1036
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,920
So in the industry,
you guys remember the first rule

1037
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:39,760
of programing, right?

1038
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:43,200
So we really never want to
change the code.

1039
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:50,840
You guys don't remember
the first rule of programing?

1040
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,240
No, no, no.

1041
01:08:52,240 --> 01:09:05,240
That is not the first rule of programing.

1042
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:10,560
Why this is not playing.

1043
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,080
Oh, here we go.

1044
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:19,120
No, no.

1045
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:24,680
Maybe this one we would.

1046
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,240
It works.

1047
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:32,160
Don't like it.

1048
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:32,800
Here we go.

1049
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:35,840
So if we have something, if

1050
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:40,320
if your seniors have written something,
you never want to change that.

1051
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,200
No, no. They.

1052
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,480
This is the actual
first rule of programing.

1053
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,520
If it works, don't touch it.

1054
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,200
The entity that I notify

1055
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,320
the change everything else,
but don't touch your code.

1056
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,360
You never know.

1057
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,760
Use danger something,
and the next time it will not work.

1058
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,560
Okay, It will not work.

1059
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,000
So now we want to change the code

1060
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:05,040
as less as possible.

1061
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:05,960
Okay?

1062
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,800
We never want to change the code.

1063
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,640
If something is working, we.

1064
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,840
We can change the data
or we can change anything but not equal.

1065
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,400
Because right now you guys are writing
very small programs, writing

1066
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:22,200
15, 20 lines, 30 lines
in real life in the industry,

1067
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,360
you will be interacting
with large amounts of code, write them

1068
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:27,640
maybe

1069
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,640
a thousand lines of code in a single file,

1070
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,280
3000 lines, thousand lines of code
in a single file.

1071
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:39,360
So if you mess up something, it will take
forever to to figure out to fix that.

1072
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,840
So instead of inspecting every text,
sending keys,

1073
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,320
we can put all that inside file
and write a genetic code.

1074
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,760
So this is what you guys will be doing
in your frameworks.

1075
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,920
The cucumber Framework Best
and the Framework.

1076
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,440
This is what you guys will be doing.

1077
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:59,680
Nicole maintains a good balance. Yes.

1078
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,760
How long will it take to finish the code?

1079
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,240
There will be tile.

1080
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,080
There will be one of

1081
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,240
developers and testers in big companies
who will be writing

1082
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,560
that much amount of code.

1083
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,640
And it takes years to develop that code.

1084
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:20,920
It's not one person or not,
not the task of a single person.

1085
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,920
So don't worry about it. You will.

1086
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,240
Guys will be introducing small new changes
or writing

1087
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,400
maybe small new files inside that you
you don't have to write all of that.

1088
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:37,800
Otherwise, if you guys have to write
all the framework, then it means that

1089
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,600
the company will be needing
you for next 10 to 15 years.

1090
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,240
It's good on your pocket right?

1091
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,120
You you are hired for next ten years
if you have to do all of that.

1092
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:49,840
No, no.

1093
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,160
It is very good movie actually.

1094
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,280
Isaiah. Right?

1095
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,720
You tell them,
Hey guys, it will take ten years

1096
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,920
and they are not going to fire you
for the next ten years.

1097
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,200
The reason is that

1098
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,360
most work, most probably

1099
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,400
because you guys have not written
so much good.

1100
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,720
The code that you guys
will be writing, only

1101
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,360
you will be able to understand the code
so you won't.

1102
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,440
You may try to hire someone else to do it,

1103
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,080
to change that order,
to understand that code.

1104
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,480
It will not make sense for them.

1105
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,400
Yeah, because the purpose
of the salary of the equity

1106
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,920
I am a little person to
because that you guys will be writing.

1107
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,160
No one else will be able
to understand that

1108
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,800
I know company.

1109
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,960
There are four developers in that company.

1110
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,760
They are working a project and the boss.

1111
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,160
I don't know what went wrong.

1112
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,840
He fired them and what they did.

1113
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,000
They changed the variable names and,
the method names to their nice

1114
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,200
to their nephew names
and their children names.

1115
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:09,120
Somebody is calling Isaiah for parameters
that have been passed to sortable.

1116
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,200
And so one is it
it doesn't make a list and

1117
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:19,320
so that also happened in small teams.

1118
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,680
So that's why they will not be firing you.

1119
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:26,560
I would definitely do that.

1120
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,040
Don't you know about salary environment?

1121
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,800
I think they are also offering
good salary.

1122
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:44,200
Some of the previous best students,
they got government jobs.

1123
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,920
I will always remember
for one for polymorphism.

1124
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:53,200
So when we have two best forms

1125
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:58,720
and so they are called web farms,

1126
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:02,520
when once when we have
good best web forms, we

1127
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,200
don't

1128
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:11,360
put all the best thing in back.

1129
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:16,880
The mean inside the code, we create

1130
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,240
files

1131
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,240
for that, read the

1132
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,680
backed out from those files and

1133
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,600
test those web

1134
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,160
forms.

1135
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:36,600
As this ever happen.

1136
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,880
Two or more students
hired for one company.

1137
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,160
Yep. Yep.

1138
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,360
They they understand government positions
are more relaxed, don't you think? Yes.

1139
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,800
Well, in all the countries everywhere
the government job is

1140
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,520
if the that everyone is looking for
like for example, here in Pakistan,

1141
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:01,680
if you are earning like 200 K per annum,
no one cares if you are competing.

1142
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,680
The guy who had the government salary,

1143
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,640
all the people, they will prefer

1144
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,200
that person or a person
whose name maybe, let's say 100.

1145
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:10,640
Okay.

1146
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,720
So even if you are earning like 20

1147
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,760
and if it is a government
job, everyone will the back

1148
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,160
no pressure

1149
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
protection.

1150
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,120
Yeah, it's a lifetime job, right?

1151
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,960
Normal job is the lifetime job.

1152
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,280
You don't have to do anything. Be relaxed.

1153
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,360
Don't do anything. No one will ask you.

1154
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,360
There's all governments
work, like in private sector.

1155
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:45,400
You have to work in a lot of miserable.

1156
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,960
You don't have to work

1157
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,960
dog security, laziness

1158
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,600
and all that.

1159
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,080
Can you repeat last one?

1160
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,440
So I was saying that if

1161
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,960
a family is looking for a groom
for how to gun.

1162
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,920
They will always prefer a guy

1163
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,160
who has a government job
over a guy who has a private job.

1164
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:12,680
I think.

1165
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,560
Is it clear now

1166
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,440
because of stability and the relaxed ness

1167
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:23,880
and because if you are a government
employee, you can have links

1168
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,280
in all the other departments
and everything will be super, super easy

1169
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:32,840
for you
in all the all in all your culture. Yep,

1170
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,520
It's the culture.

1171
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,040
In our culture, it is not the case.

1172
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:43,000
That means your government
must be very super, super government.

1173
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,200
So which country you are talking

1174
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:52,520
about your hometown? Yes.

1175
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,920
If we know he is a government,
we know he is bribery. Yep.

1176
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,280
Yep. That's also the case.

1177
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:09,000
They are made a lot of money
from other sources.

1178
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:09,520
Or you.

1179
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,800
You are specifically talking
about your family.

1180
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,080
I was not spared specific.

1181
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,360
We're talking about this.

1182
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:20,040
I was talking about a general behavior
off of paper.

1183
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:21,600
Jai Pani.

1184
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,040
Here we go in here.

1185
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:32,080
You know a lot, right?

1186
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,320
So in government sector, if less, because
they have lengthy processes, right?

1187
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,440
If you want your process to get super,
super fast,

1188
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,000
you pay them a little amount of money,
they call it type money.

1189
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:47,160
And then you, you, you will be done
with your task super, super quick.

1190
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:48,640
All right. So

1191
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,080
it files for that

1192
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:56,040
raid the data from those files
and test those that forms.

1193
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,240
Okay.

1194
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:01,800
So you guys know why
we need to learn about files, right?

1195
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,560
Why we should learn how to stored
and read that fine part of the files.

1196
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:14,240
So let's have a break.

1197
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,960
And after the break, we will.

1198
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:24,600
We will learn how to read a file.

1199
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:31,160
Oh 1127 1142

1200
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,040
When need to ask Lobo?

1201
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,000
Lobo, are you here?

1202
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,000
Yes, we are. Good.

1203
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,120
So we have a green dude from Lobo.

1204
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,440
We can be on break

1205
01:18:53,040 --> 01:19:06,360
de coffee.

1206
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:08,400
It's Booster.

1207
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,520
Your Highness.

1208
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:15,040
All right, guys, please be back

1209
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,760
by 1143.

1210
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,600
Stakeout.

1211
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:24,800
Go take some fresh air, coffee, tea.

1212
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,040
And reminding me about the recording

1213
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:44,160
time that works Now.

1214
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,240
That's great. One. Can you also try that?

1215
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,360
Are we going to homework?

1216
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:53,400
Oh, I didn't.

1217
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,760
Yep, yep, yep. Definitely. Definitely.

1218
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:01,720
Let me first go through the tasks.

1219
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:07,080
Then you guys send me this statement
for the tasks.

1220
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,240
Let me check what it does.

1221
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,360
We did that building one right

1222
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:12,840
The next.

1223
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:18,600
Next one, create a map of countries
with capital.

1224
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:19,120
This one.

1225
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:27,600
But we have to start from this one right?

1226
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,120
My student cousin.

1227
01:20:29,120 --> 01:21:08,480
You guys are both single
working on your own.

1228
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,800
Do you guys are not

1229
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,640
reacting to memes from Sebastian?

1230
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:17,880
It can discouraging
and we don't want to do that.

1231
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,000
Let me get let me be

1232
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:44,760
it was all right

1233
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:50,280
so create a map of countries
with its capital

1234
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,040
that will store countries
in alphabetical order.

1235
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,520
But in all keys and values

1236
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:01,640
parameter entry map using for each loop.

1237
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,400
And I prefer

1238
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:05,840
print

1239
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,880
all values from a country map
using for each loop.

1240
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:15,560
And b I prefer.

1241
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,680
Can you guys send me the map

1242
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,880
that that has or so

1243
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,360
should I store the countries in the keys

1244
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,320
or should I store B capitals in the keys?

1245
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,920
We are too lazy to choose the emoji
to react, so we waiting for someone else

1246
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,720
to react request

1247
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,680
Microsoft
actually high height of the lazy people.

1248
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,600
So they intentionally hired lazy people.

1249
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:53,280
Microsoft
because lazy people they can always try.

1250
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:58,600
They they can always find a way to do that
task in in in less effort

1251
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,080
in future time out
without going through that tired process.

1252
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:07,240
So they are always thinking
about the smarter and shorter ways.

1253
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,000
Believe me, it's not a joke.

1254
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:18,960
They literally hired lazy people,
so maybe you guys should apply.

1255
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:21,440
It's time to start applying over the

1256
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,120
and Amazon.

1257
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,520
They they give you 5,000 USD

1258
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,480
if you want to leave the Amazon.

1259
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,720
So did they say that we intentionally
we are paying the employees

1260
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,360
to leave the Amazon
because we don't want those employees

1261
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:56,760
who don't want to work on Amazon.

1262
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:00,840
So we have to store the

1263
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,760
know.

1264
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,400
Whoever did this is not correct.

1265
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,080
You see, if we do this, the countries

1266
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:11,400
will be in the place of values

1267
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,520
and we will not be able to store them
the thought to them.

1268
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:16,920
Right.

1269
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,680
Store countries in alphabetical order.

1270
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:25,240
If I store them in in these values,
I will never be able to store them.

1271
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,160
Right.

1272
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,320
So can you guys send me and my.

1273
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,280
Yes, this one looks good.
So this is not the correct approach.

1274
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:36,200
There is a way there is a way to store
the values as well.

1275
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:38,080
It's your homework.

1276
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,360
Try to do that.

1277
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,280
You are allowed to use Google
and everything.

1278
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,000
So this is the correct one, right?

1279
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,440
Because now the keys, they are countries

1280
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,920
and the tree map,
it actually starts with that.

1281
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,200
Our based on keys, not on values.

1282
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:57,160
So it's important to know.

1283
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:01,680
Okay.

1284
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:05,440
To create a map of countries
with this capital

1285
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,880
that will store countries
in alphabetical order.

1286
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,400
That's
why we are putting the country's first.

1287
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,800
Okay.

1288
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:17,080
But into all keys and values

1289
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:22,320
from a country map using for each loop.

1290
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:29,040
And I tried to.

1291
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,880
So which type of arbitrator I can use guys

1292
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:36,200
which type of I try try can use

1293
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:40,640
to get all the keys
only if I only need the keys,

1294
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,560
which type of iterator
I should get from this map

1295
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:56,480
so I can get the key set.

1296
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,960
I can first go to the key
set if I am only interested.

1297
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,720
So those who have done it
with the help of entry, start

1298
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,880
and restart can give you both keys
and values.

1299
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:08,400
Right?

1300
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:14,520
Print all keys and values from a country
map using for each loop and iterator.

1301
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,720
So for example, I can see

1302
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,920
capital daughter

1303
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:25,160
which type of start I showed that guys

1304
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,520
can you guys name desert
that I that will return me both

1305
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:33,520
he and will values

1306
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,200
near the entry said pride

1307
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:41,000
entry asset has all the keys
and the values

1308
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,360
it can store bought the keys
and in a single

1309
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,880
dad perspective can you guys name that
that structure that hold

1310
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,040
both keys and values

1311
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,880
know there was that
there was an other interface

1312
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,120
inside of the map that can hold both keys
and values.

1313
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,440
The entry interface right

1314
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,760
so if I say I to

1315
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,160
in here

1316
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,640
what I will be getting,

1317
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,520
I will be getting and I iterator

1318
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,720
and the type of iterator works

1319
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:32,160
through the builder type.

1320
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,640
First I should have

1321
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,000
iterator and inside of that typewriter

1322
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:43,200
I will be having a

1323
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,480
B and threes.

1324
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:51,240
And inside of those entries
I will be having

1325
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,960
two string type

1326
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:55,920
values.

1327
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:56,920
Right?

1328
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,640
So this entry said

1329
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,880
and on top of that
I am calling the iterator.

1330
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:08,040
So I created an inside and by trader
there will be entries

1331
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,880
and each entry consist of strings

1332
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,880
in the form of keys and values.

1333
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,440
Now I can use that for each loop right

1334
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:23,280
in with the apparatus
I can use for it, or I can save for each.

1335
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,240
And what should I specify in here?

1336
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,000
Guys?

1337
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:31,040
I should specify map door

1338
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,880
and three

1339
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,560
spring

1340
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,080
string.

1341
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:42,320
So I will be getting a single entry
one by one From this.

1342
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,360
I tried to write

1343
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,520
forcefully.

1344
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,080
I should because I want to use
before this loop.

1345
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,120
I should use

1346
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:00,880
a setting here.

1347
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,240
Yeah.

1348
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,800
So this fact it has the map and trees

1349
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,120
and each one of them contains
two string values.

1350
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,720
One as the E and the other.

1351
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:14,440
Well,

1352
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,360
so now if I say

1353
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:21,360
and three dot get e,

1354
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,000
I will go to B is right.

1355
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:29,560
And if I say

1356
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,440
entry three dot get value

1357
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:41,600
I will be getting D value.

1358
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,120
And if now particular this program

1359
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:58,800
so I get my data in here.

1360
01:29:59,160 --> 01:29:59,560
Okay.

1361
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:01,760
Is it clear guys?

1362
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:14,040
How is it working?

1363
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,480
So this entry is hard.

1364
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,600
It actually returns us, is set

1365
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,920
and inside there,

1366
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:26,440
except first we have entries

1367
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,440
and inside each entry

1368
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,880
we have a single key
and its corresponding value.

1369
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:38,600
So using before each
we are grabbing a single key and the value

1370
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,480
we printed, we grab the next one,
we print it, we grab the next one,

1371
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:46,720
and then we print it.

1372
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,720
How do you put the by alphabetical order?

1373
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,480
I used to be three map.

1374
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:53,400
I used to

1375
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,520
remember it automatically source the data.

1376
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:04,200
When we insert the data inside the map.

1377
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:10,320
Now is it clear?

1378
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:15,000
Okay, put into all the values

1379
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:19,960
from a country map
using for each loop and the iterator.

1380
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:23,080
So how how can I print
using the operator as well?

1381
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:27,600
So how can I printed using the iterator
as well?

1382
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,880
What I can do?

1383
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,320
I can.

1384
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,760
So it should not be an idea
that it should be a set

1385
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:55,080
up, grab it

1386
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:57,840
that and

1387
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:03,560
so now I can get the iterator as well

1388
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:10,960
and I can print out using the iterator.

1389
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,800
So I will say while

1390
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,000
which method
I should use inside to be wild condition

1391
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,800
guys from the iterator to check
if there are any elements left.

1392
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:26,280
The has an x right
I prepared or has a next

1393
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:30,120
and then

1394
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:32,760
each element has this and three

1395
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:43,920
and three

1396
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,520
which are how can I get to the entry using
which method from the

1397
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:51,120
I get I can get the entries one by one.

1398
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,440
The next method right.

1399
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,520
I pray to

1400
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:56,960
dark next.

1401
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,440
So this I printed it actually
returning it, returning me an entry

1402
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,480
and again using this entry

1403
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:08,800
I can see and three dot e

1404
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,080
and and three

1405
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:33,960
you get two.

1406
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,960
So I get these values
with the help of for each loop

1407
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,600
I get these values with the help of

1408
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:47,160
my data.

1409
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,000
Is it clear right

1410
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,160
now if I all are,

1411
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,800
if I am only interested in values base,

1412
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:05,160
if I am only interested in values

1413
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,960
which type of
set I should ask from the map

1414
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:18,360
collection by

1415
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:25,960
either tradeable. Now.

1416
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:28,800
So if I am only interested

1417
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:34,120
in the values,

1418
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:37,360
I can say

1419
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,360
capital dot

1420
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,160
values.

1421
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,400
Right.

1422
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,160
And I can also directly use

1423
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,080
the entire default
to look, for example, for each

1424
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:00,200
instead of storing it in a variable.

1425
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,160
And then that's the same thing I can say

1426
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:08,480
what type of value I will get right, what
type of variable I should write in here.

1427
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,440
Back end, store the value

1428
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:26,240
that that string is the wrap

1429
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,520
is wrapped around

1430
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,720
a collection, right?

1431
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,720
And inside of that collection we have

1432
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,800
the what is this returning?

1433
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:58,280
It's returning a collection right?

1434
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,240
Oops, sorry.

1435
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,360
Yep. Yep.

1436
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:06,440
So this collection, each collection
contains

1437
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,440
a single string value, Right?

1438
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:16,440
And that value is actually the value
that we have stored in here.

1439
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:21,800
For example,
this Washington, Paris, Rome and Qatar.

1440
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,320
So if I print out that value

1441
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:32,280
in here, I will be I will

1442
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:35,720
only be getting the value this time,
nor the keys,

1443
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,120
only the values.

1444
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:44,640
And if I am interested in and I trade,
that's why I need an operator.

1445
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:48,320
If I am planning
to change this size of the collection

1446
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:51,240
so I can see

1447
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,480
capital dot

1448
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:59,280
values, this will return me a collection.

1449
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:04,520
And on any of the collections the
if I need the greater I can call this.

1450
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:13,920
I prefer method.

1451
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,360
So I try to

1452
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:20,360
and then the type of the variable

1453
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:23,120
will be I greater

1454
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,240
and inside the separator,
what I will get is

1455
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:32,920
I will be getting a string.

1456
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,080
Right.

1457
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:36,960
But look, this string is wrapped around.

1458
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:39,240
Let me

1459
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:43,040
let's call it I may be values.

1460
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:44,000
I click

1461
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,240
so it returns a collection.

1462
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:55,720
And on that collection
I am calling the iterator,

1463
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,800
which will return me
the iterator containing the

1464
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,840
strings.

1465
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:04,800
And again, same.

1466
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,960
I can see.

1467
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,000
I can again
use those three methods of value.

1468
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,640
The typewriter has an X

1469
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,960
and value

1470
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:20,600
iterator dot

1471
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:35,720
next like this.

1472
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,600
So this is using this set for each loop

1473
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:43,160
and this is using the iterator

1474
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,680
and they both e
then value same as this one.

1475
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:52,720
If. All right,

1476
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:56,840
I'll get any question guys.

1477
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,040
How do you concatenate them

1478
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:04,680
with this
plus plus operator and this double code

1479
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,280
same from third Java class concatenation

1480
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:14,600
string concatenation.

1481
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,880
Are there other tasks?

1482
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,120
Is there any

1483
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,880
create a collection of integers
in which you can prove duplicates?

1484
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,880
Try the logic
to find the sum of all the elements

1485
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:44,320
right.

1486
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:48,960
So which collection can store
the Which collection can store

1487
01:39:48,960 --> 01:40:00,320
duplicate elements right.

1488
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,880
Add a list or the list. Right.

1489
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,160
I can use any of them.

1490
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:11,920
So let's use the ArrayList

1491
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,560
and I will be storing number.

1492
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,800
So let's use number

1493
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:21,880
for the number meal.

1494
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:23,160
Add a list

1495
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:25,800
last I heard a few numbers.

1496
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:32,520
Maybe then that

1497
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,680
that I can store duplicates in here.

1498
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,800
And now, if I want to sum them

1499
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:43,680
and declare a sum
variable, initialize it to zero.

1500
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,600
How can you define it low?

1501
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:50,880
Because I am only iterating
through the element.

1502
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,520
So in theory the number

1503
01:40:55,240 --> 01:41:11,240
of numbers and then some equal to number,
we can print that.

1504
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:21,840
How so?

1505
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,800
I get 30, so I am able to store duplicates

1506
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:29,440
and then I roll the logic to find the sum

1507
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:37,640
to create a map that will store employee
names and salaries.

1508
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:41,120
I write a logic
to retrieve an employee who gets

1509
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:46,160
highest salary.

1510
01:41:46,160 --> 01:42:14,960
The to

1511
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:18,040
create a map that will store employee

1512
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:21,440
name and salary. Okay

1513
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:26,400
the right logic to retrieve an employee
who gets the highest salary.

1514
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:32,680
So let's first create a map so.

1515
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:37,040
Let's use the hash map
because it is most widely used map.

1516
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:39,000
And the key.

1517
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,720
Should I store the name as a key or should
I store base

1518
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:57,200
salary as a key?

1519
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:02,400
The lost loop is also called
for each loop. Yes.

1520
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:06,000
Yes. Enhanced for loop
is called for each loop as well.

1521
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:11,600
I did also collection and linked list
and you go back for a second.

1522
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,120
You want me to go in here

1523
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,080
what I did wrong?

1524
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,160
No, it was not wrong.

1525
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,680
The passport affected is. Sorry.

1526
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:22,080
Can I see one more time Pass to the

1527
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:30,000
Let me know once you guys are ready

1528
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:47,520
so that we can move forward.

1529
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:56,960
But can we move forward?

1530
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,400
I think he has left.

1531
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:01,880
Okay. Okay.

1532
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:06,680
So store the names of all the back.

1533
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:09,280
We will be needing a string

1534
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:12,560
and for this salary is let's use the

1535
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:14,720
integer. Okay.

1536
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:25,920
You guys can also use doubles.

1537
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,520
INT yep.

1538
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:34,280
All right.

1539
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:36,400
So let's insert some that

1540
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:17,000
this time

1541
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I want to perform a comparison
based on the values.

1542
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:22,080
Right.

1543
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,920
But what I also want is that so let's

1544
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:35,280
say for example, so for example

1545
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,040
two persons
they can have duplicate salaries

1546
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:43,920
via so values
they can duplicate, but they cannot.

1547
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:47,440
So I have to get a, B
key and P value, right?

1548
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:50,120
So one of the ways
to achieve this is, let's say

1549
01:45:58,040 --> 01:46:01,000
I can initialize a variable in here

1550
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,920
to store the name of the employee

1551
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:10,040
who earns the most, and then

1552
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:14,480
I can store

1553
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,080
max salary as well.

1554
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:22,280
But let's initialize it from zero.

1555
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:26,440
And now what I will do, I will
I trade through this map one by one,

1556
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:29,640
I will check a b values

1557
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:32,640
and whoever has the maximum value.

1558
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,880
If I find

1559
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:40,360
an employee who earns more than that,
I will update both of these values.

1560
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:45,240
So for example, if I write a 40 loop.

1561
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:51,240
All right, what I can get,
I can get an entry said

1562
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:53,160
right and

1563
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:58,880
and present

1564
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,400
returns mean both keys and values, right?

1565
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:06,680
So keys are in the form of things
values are in the form

1566
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:15,480
all in map

1567
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:21,440
and I can say employee map dot

1568
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,200
entry set.

1569
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,040
So this entry set it will return to me

1570
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,640
and is one by one

1571
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,200
and each entry will contain a key

1572
01:47:33,480 --> 01:47:36,560
as the name and a value
in the form of this set.

1573
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:39,640
And what I want to do, I want to check

1574
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,320
if because these they cannot be negative.

1575
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,840
So we are writing simple logic.

1576
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:48,440
So if the

1577
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:54,960
if the value that I am getting,

1578
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:59,480
if it is greater than max salary.

1579
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:02,920
So the that
I have initialized with my variable,

1580
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:07,720
if it is greater than there,
I update my salary dog

1581
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:11,280
Max salary is equal to MP

1582
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:14,840
naught.

1583
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,240
Get that right.

1584
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:20,440
So I only update this salary variable

1585
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:24,480
once I find a value
that is larger than what

1586
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,960
I have already stored
and I am starting from zero.

1587
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:28,560
Right.

1588
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:31,560
So I am sure that salaries
they cannot be negative,

1589
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:34,120
so they will always be
something greater than zero.

1590
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,200
And if this is the case,

1591
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:39,280
I also want to update

1592
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,320
the max to salary employee name.

1593
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,080
Right.

1594
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:46,360
So I also want MP dog back

1595
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:51,600
and once I am done
iterating through this map,

1596
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,640
I will be having the employee

1597
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:58,680
with the maximum salary

1598
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:04,920
right.

1599
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,560
And then I want an equal to sign

1600
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:13,000
and then a dollars sign and then the

1601
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:17,280
max. By

1602
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:25,920
the way, if I execute this,

1603
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:31,320
I get 130.

1604
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:35,160
Maybe
I should ask it to an integer as well

1605
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:41,040
so that I don't get that feel like

1606
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,840
I got to

1607
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,320
so that I don't get that feeling.

1608
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:07,640
Do you guys understand how it is working
or you guys want me to debug it?

1609
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:17,000
Because it can be a little tricky
for some of you.

1610
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Okay.

1611
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:24,200
So whenever I want to debug the code work,
what should I do first?

1612
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:38,000
What should be my first step?

1613
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,880
I even have difficulty
determining the data type inside loop. So

1614
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,880
this entry said Mohammed.

1615
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,960
It will always return you a map dot entry.

1616
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:54,480
So first I must place a debug point

1617
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:58,080
line 29.

1618
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,640
It will be now it will.

1619
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:02,720
Let me debug it for you.

1620
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:05,840
So once I have placed the debug point,

1621
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:09,800
I can click on this icon and can see it

1622
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:20,520
deeper.

1623
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:21,560
Let me deliver this.

1624
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:22,640
What is

1625
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,320
all right.

1626
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:37,520
So if I want to go to the next line,
I will say

1627
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:45,040
should I step over or step into place?

1628
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:48,960
If I want to go to the next line

1629
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:54,720
in two over

1630
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,240
in two

1631
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,760
over 5050

1632
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:08,800
or over, move

1633
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,760
in to

1634
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:19,160
when you are not debugging your code.

1635
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,240
Right.

1636
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,920
50% of your answers, they are wrong.

1637
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:27,040
So I should say
step over into is if you want to see

1638
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,960
into is
used, if you want to see the execution

1639
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:34,680
inside a method,
if there is a method, call on a line

1640
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:39,800
and you want to see how that method
executor to the code inside.

1641
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:43,320
But then we use the into method
that is, I'm telling you,

1642
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:47,400
if you don't practice
it will be very, very hard for you.

1643
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:49,800
Java will be very, very hard for you.

1644
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:53,320
Please practice reading 3 to 4 slides

1645
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:56,480
daily and please practice.

1646
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:59,640
So I see a step over

1647
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:04,400
and then if I say if I want to check

1648
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:07,760
what this empty target
value is returning me,

1649
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:21,040
what I can use, I can use a lot, right?

1650
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:25,120
So I right click and I say add to what is

1651
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:29,280
so now this empty door to get value.

1652
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:32,960
It is returning me 120 here

1653
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:39,040
and what is inside my Maxwell view
right now is it's zero, right?

1654
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,160
I initialize it with zero.

1655
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:43,280
So is 110 okay.

1656
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:48,240
Greater than zero? Yes.

1657
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:51,200
So I will go inside the loop.

1658
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:54,120
I will get back 110.

1659
01:53:54,120 --> 01:53:57,640
Okay. And I will
store that of the max cell

1660
01:53:58,920 --> 01:53:59,400
and I

1661
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:03,600
also get MP dot get the key right.

1662
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:06,240
The MP right now contains Smith

1663
01:54:06,920 --> 01:54:10,560
and that Smith will be stored
in max a cell

1664
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,080
we employ

1665
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:16,800
next time

1666
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,840
when I will be doing the second iteration.

1667
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:24,480
I got to be value, which is John

1668
01:54:25,600 --> 01:54:28,800
and John has a salary of one Kon-Tiki.

1669
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:33,880
Now I have an employee that earns the law.

1670
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:38,320
Ben Smith
So should I update this Max salary

1671
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:45,440
and employer name or not?

1672
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:51,200
I have an employee, so previously
I stored inside the max salary.

1673
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:53,480
I store 200 and 110. Okay.

1674
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:58,080
Inside of the max employee name
I stored previously Sumit

1675
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,080
because it was greater than zero.

1676
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:05,520
Now I have another employee, John,
which is earning even more.

1677
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:09,440
So should I update these variables Value?

1678
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,160
Yes. Right.

1679
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:13,280
Because I want to get the max.

1680
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:18,960
If I don't, if I get a max value,
if I get a higher value,

1681
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:23,760
then the value that I already stored,
I should upgrade that, right?

1682
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:28,080
That's how I will be getting to the most
maximum salary and employee name.

1683
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:33,680
So I say okay, if max salary previously,

1684
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:38,120
which was 110, if it is greater than 120.

1685
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,400
So it's true.

1686
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:43,400
I now instead of me, I store

1687
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:49,080
the inside of the name, I store John
and inside the salary I store one config

1688
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:52,000
because I have found a person
that earns more right

1689
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:55,400
from what I have stored previously.

1690
01:55:56,280 --> 01:55:58,440
Now I do the next operation.

1691
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Next I get John

1692
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:04,640
is John are earning more than John.

1693
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:08,040
So previously I stored John and 128

1694
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:10,880
is this John earning more than that?

1695
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:16,360
No. So I am playing to the values. No.

1696
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:21,800
So this condition will fail
and I could be next employee.

1697
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,440
I only upgrade
if I get even bigger values right

1698
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,680
and therefore
I will be getting to max values.

1699
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:30,320
So I do it again

1700
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:33,600
and then I get Jean right.

1701
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,320
Jean is earning 130, right?

1702
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:44,080
So should I update the values now? Yes.

1703
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:47,760
So I go inside this condition, right?

1704
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:50,760
I observe the values
and then I keep on going.

1705
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:54,840
If I find even higher salary, I update.

1706
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:58,120
If don't, I don't try and therefore I get

1707
01:56:58,120 --> 01:57:00,760
the maximum salary and employed name.

1708
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:04,960
Is it clear now?

1709
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:08,160
So somebody is just debugging big guy
when saying sorry,

1710
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:11,040
I found the person who earns more

1711
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:21,680
and then we add the all the salary here.

1712
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:22,720
Yes. For hard.

1713
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:25,800
Yes, you can add them as well if you want.

1714
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:29,760
You can declare a variable in here
for example.

1715
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,960
Oh for example some of

1716
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:39,400
the double sum is equal to zero.

1717
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:42,400
And before oops, zero.

1718
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:46,280
And before you perform the
if condition, you say sum

1719
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:50,600
is equal to sum plus

1720
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:56,480
MP dark get really right like this.

1721
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:01,160
And then maybe if you want to print out
that as well,

1722
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:09,160
you can also do that.

1723
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:09,520
Yeah.

1724
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,920
So I get this

1725
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:15,200
sum as the

1726
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:20,000
okay, because how we can do it.

1727
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:24,360
But why we write into Max
just to avoid that zero.

1728
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:30,240
If you don't want to do this,
you can also do that.

1729
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:33,400
Maybe instead of

1730
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,880
instead of double.

1731
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:38,840
I should use integer in here. Okay. Extra.

1732
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:40,560
Extra step. Unnecessary step.

1733
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:45,360
I was doing unnecessary extra steps.

1734
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:45,880
Okay.

1735
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:51,720
And for in here
as it was across by mistake,

1736
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:55,720
I thought we were storing initially values
in if almost doubles.

1737
01:58:56,040 --> 01:59:00,880
Okay.

1738
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:01,480
All right.

1739
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:03,440
Are there still any any questions?

1740
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:10,080
Nice.

1741
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:19,080
Are there other are there more tasks?

1742
01:59:19,080 --> 01:59:36,680
Can you send me the next task? No,

1743
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:39,120
there are no

1744
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:42,880
not create a map of Best Buy store.

1745
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:46,640
You assign somewhere
between 20 and 30 tasks every Sunday.

1746
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:51,240
So there are always.

1747
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:55,000
So I think you guys are not doing
any of these tasks.

1748
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:58,560
I just assign them
and then follow them in the next class.

1749
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:01,000
Right.

1750
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,520
You guys are playing with me.

1751
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:06,480
I Oh, that.

1752
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:09,000
Let us assign as many task as we want

1753
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:12,200
because we will not be doing them early

1754
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:27,720
and he will be doing them right.

1755
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:28,720
Okay.

1756
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:33,120
We spend so much time doing the tasks

1757
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:36,600
that we care about the or be it be as

1758
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:42,440
my period is not going to be in Java.

1759
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:46,360
Most probably we I will be
I will be writing

1760
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:51,600
most of my coding in Python

1761
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:54,000
and all that is mostly

1762
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:02,640
based on Python.

1763
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:03,800
Okay.

1764
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:07,560
Create a map of best Buy store, place

1765
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:12,480
item ID and item name into example item by

1766
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,120
item deeper into

1767
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:18,000
the retrieve All Eve and values

1768
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,760
from a best to buy map using

1769
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:25,000
this one is easy right base.

1770
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:27,360
We have just to all this one in here

1771
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:31,680
where we focus.

1772
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:36,520
This is same using the end
to start to get all the needs and values

1773
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:43,480
I had and it will solve this.

1774
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:52,200
Can you, Katrina, can you send me record?

1775
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:58,200
The complete code is the same for
let's let's not waste time.

1776
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:00,520
It's the same store same code, right?

1777
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:08,040
Creating an entry set
and then retrieving the value.

1778
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:11,160
Well,
I do tasks with unnecessary console then.

1779
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:21,600
Right?

1780
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:26,640
So from this map
we are getting the entry set right

1781
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,400
and are returns us these and the values

1782
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:33,840
in the form of entries.

1783
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:36,080
I can be form of entries.

1784
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:41,400
And then what we can do from
these entry is we can write a follow

1785
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:45,320
to get all the give and well, right
same cold,

1786
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:52,320
same as before.

1787
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:55,920
So I get all direct like this, you see

1788
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:59,320
the same same task as before.

1789
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:02,960
Is there anyone who was confused
or was unable to do that?

1790
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:08,200
Maybe this is what has confused you right.

1791
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:12,880
What should be the type of variable
in which we store this entry set?

1792
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:13,680
Right?

1793
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:15,840
So there is an easy way of doing that.

1794
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:19,280
So for example,
if you guys are unable to figure,

1795
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:22,320
figure out the type of variable

1796
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:26,160
until you can help, you just

1797
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:29,920
press all to enter, press

1798
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,880
all the entry and click on this introduce
local variable

1799
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:39,480
and replace all occurrences that's
intelligible right bit types for you.

1800
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:43,160
Automatic you need even if they are

1801
02:03:43,160 --> 02:03:47,120
super super complex.

1802
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:50,920
You guys don't have to worry about
the types, but you really should know

1803
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:52,080
the types. Guys.

1804
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:55,600
You should not be dependent
too much on, be on the IDs,

1805
02:03:56,960 --> 02:03:59,800
but just in case, if you don't remember
or I don't know,

1806
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:02,120
unable to figure out,

1807
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:08,400
you can use intelligent.

1808
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,200
I gave it to batch ten guys.

1809
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:14,160
They were also not able to do it.

1810
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:19,120
Yeah, because they are away from Java
like maybe four months

1811
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,880
to 3 to 4 months

1812
02:04:27,880 --> 02:04:33,760
of the.

1813
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,040
Now we can speak

1814
02:04:37,240 --> 02:04:38,160
and they are still

1815
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:41,960
getting the jobs right.

1816
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:52,120
Are there more tasks?

1817
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:54,280
Yes, still more tasks.

1818
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:59,640
How many tasks file there?

1819
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:02,640
I am not following due to

1820
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:09,280
who gave you some of the tasks.

1821
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:09,960
Forget today.

1822
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:11,240
I am not going to.

1823
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:13,360
I will only give you one or two tasks.

1824
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:17,200
6 to 7 is

1825
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:22,480
I didn't name a possible.

1826
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:29,640
This is the last one right?

1827
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:31,440
No, this is second last.

1828
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,200
Maybe

1829
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:36,520
third last

1830
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:39,240
stay level.

1831
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:41,960
Oh, now I understand your pain.

1832
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:50,560
Sorry, guys.

1833
02:05:50,560 --> 02:06:02,960
Second, second, second, last.

1834
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:03,840
I don't remember

1835
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:08,640
seeing the entry sub interface
with map background we show on the slides.

1836
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:11,040
Can you explain a little bit.

1837
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:13,120
Yes. I think
it's not presenting these slides,

1838
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:16,960
but if you guys are interesting
seeing that

1839
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:21,960
map dot entries,
for example, you can click on this entry

1840
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:23,520
and here

1841
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:26,280
it is present inside this map interface.

1842
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:29,080
It's an interface inside another interface

1843
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:34,320
and all the classes
which implement the map interface,

1844
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:42,480
they also implement this entry interface.

1845
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:48,400
The Imagine jobs task
that I Apple, the Selenium slides.

1846
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,800
Other schools will be possible

1847
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:58,440
not only guys years,
just three more months.

1848
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,440
I know it's hard.

1849
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:09,160
It's very hard.

1850
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:10,160
2.5 months.

1851
02:07:10,160 --> 02:07:13,080
You guys are in 3.5 months

1852
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:18,480
into the course.

1853
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:30,160
Forgot Kelson has the.

1854
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:33,320
Maybe next time we should say that
this course is only for singles

1855
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:40,320
who are long,
who are single for a long, long time.

1856
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:43,920
Right. It's

1857
02:07:48,080 --> 02:07:49,360
so great.

1858
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,120
Is there any chance you can show us?

1859
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:52,520
Rappel 209?

1860
02:07:52,520 --> 02:07:53,880
Yes. All or not required.

1861
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:56,600
We are at the end of the class

1862
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:59,120
and you will forget that
at the end of the class

1863
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:05,240
that we are going to have to show
that Bertuzzi tonight.

1864
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:08,080
I will not agree. Let's see.

1865
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:09,120
I am using this.

1866
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:11,080
Thanks for the big for so long.

1867
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,360
You remember Alexi.

1868
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:14,320
Alexi left at the end of the class.

1869
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:17,760
I never showed him
the encapsulation exam, but

1870
02:08:18,240 --> 02:08:23,200
still this day.

1871
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:24,000
I'm just kidding.

1872
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:30,520
I will show you
at the end of the class. Oh,

1873
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:33,480
creative person

1874
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:36,480
class with falling private fears

1875
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,440
named, last name, age and salary.

1876
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:42,000
That is all I ask.

1877
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:42,800
That is not met.

1878
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:46,200
It is doing is mastering.

1879
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:48,160
Yes, maybe I am lucky.

1880
02:08:48,160 --> 02:09:07,400
Otherwise CBC would have killed me by now.

1881
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:09,680
I am planning to have a wife like this

1882
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:28,960
who can watch my

1883
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:37,080
and she

1884
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:48,000
invite is

1885
02:09:56,840 --> 02:10:02,320
just all the way.

1886
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:11,480
See is good.

1887
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:13,520
Going to please

1888
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:22,680
just put it in there see it will work.

1889
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:24,920
Well it is.

1890
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:28,080
And both the all the way that way.

1891
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:31,960
No. So.

1892
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:34,680
Okay, let's get back to the class.

1893
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:37,840
So name, last name and sadly,

1894
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:43,880
yeah.

1895
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:49,400
Okay.

1896
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:52,680
So same name

1897
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:56,880
and then spring.

1898
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:58,680
Last name.

1899
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:02,720
But don't give her Mac. But

1900
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:06,480
it's all by the way,
I was reading about the weird.

1901
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:09,760
There was the chief
just there was a gesture to celebrate.

1902
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:14,560
It's very good for your health.

1903
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,480
You did it.

1904
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:24,680
And then, oops,

1905
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:29,600
double salary.

1906
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:30,880
And these matters.

1907
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:33,000
They should be private, these fields.

1908
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:39,360
They should be private.

1909
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:40,800
No, it's not.

1910
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:46,080
Don't encourage us.

1911
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:49,120
It makes you laugh
and love exceeds your life.

1912
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:53,720
No, I I am laughing even without the V.

1913
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,520
I don't know why.

1914
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:59,600
I mean, during my job,

1915
02:11:59,600 --> 02:12:03,600
my manager and I used to make
a lot of jokes about me.

1916
02:12:03,600 --> 02:12:05,920
There was also guys like me.

1917
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:09,040
We used to have a lot, but

1918
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:11,960
a lot of fun.

1919
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:15,160
Okay, so they feel they should be private
because

1920
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:20,040
believe me, this programing job,
it can be very stressful.

1921
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,680
So this humor and all that extra necessity

1922
02:12:24,520 --> 02:12:27,960
create person class
with falling private fields.

1923
02:12:28,240 --> 02:12:32,360
Name Last name is salary variables.

1924
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:35,920
Variables should be in this list
through the constructor.

1925
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:39,320
All right, so

1926
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:44,760
I can say it and insert right.

1927
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:47,120
And then I can click on constructive

1928
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:50,840
and I can create a constructor.

1929
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,760
Easy peasy, right?

1930
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:54,680
Easy peasy. W

1931
02:12:55,160 --> 02:12:58,120
My Muslim friend said that
liquor is not at Albert.

1932
02:12:58,440 --> 02:13:01,200
Holy book
never mentioned anything about Weird.

1933
02:13:01,200 --> 02:13:03,200
So he said I am still doing lot

1934
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,520
so years

1935
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:15,960
out and insert on my keyboard.

1936
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:18,760
If I press that I get this generate

1937
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:23,280
window

1938
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:27,400
and I get this.

1939
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:31,920
I think as a as a medicine it's good,
but otherwise it's not good in any way.

1940
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:41,880
If someone is trying to justify
he's wrong.

1941
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:42,600
All right.

1942
02:13:42,600 --> 02:13:54,200
So I created the constructor,

1943
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:56,720
Dark Chocolate 85%.

1944
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,440
And what is 85%?

1945
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:00,360
Cotton.

1946
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:01,680
Good.

1947
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:10,280
Like muscle.

1948
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:13,320
Oh, coconut dark chocolate. They are.

1949
02:14:13,320 --> 02:14:14,800
They are good for

1950
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:19,440
to 5% fiber.

1951
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:19,880
Okay.

1952
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:23,560
We created
we constructor inside the class.

1953
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:29,360
Also create a method
to print the user details. Okay

1954
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:36,200
that is there.

1955
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:42,960
So public Lloyd

1956
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:47,280
putting you the info

1957
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:54,480
and then we can see and name

1958
02:14:56,480 --> 02:15:03,600
plus last name

1959
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:15,640
in he.

1960
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:17,760
He has already told me that is good.

1961
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,880
I don't know how to go.

1962
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:21,760
I don't know anything,
so please be careful.

1963
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:23,960
So I mentally prepared

1964
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:31,480
and to

1965
02:15:31,480 --> 02:15:39,080
print out this. Oh

1966
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:42,840
in the past class create a map

1967
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:46,200
that will store the key in ascending order

1968
02:15:47,720 --> 02:15:49,000
in that map store.

1969
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:50,760
Personal ID

1970
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:52,760
and a person object.

1971
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:55,040
Print it. Object or details.

1972
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:57,920
All right, So

1973
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:03,400
inside main class, we have to create

1974
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:07,600
which type of map I should create.

1975
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:10,480
I told my husband the same thing. He

1976
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:15,680
the 3D map.

1977
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:16,080
Right.

1978
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:18,680
But coffee maps distort the data in the

1979
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:22,640
spark data form.

1980
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:25,680
So what should be the type off
the in here guys

1981
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:33,480
in pages.

1982
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:33,680
Right.

1983
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:37,760
I can use integers or strings
whatever and as a value.

1984
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:42,600
I am going to store sun object in here.

1985
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:45,920
So what should to be my type?

1986
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:48,560
The type should be person,

1987
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:51,440
not the string class.

1988
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:54,560
We specify the name of the class

1989
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:59,240
whose object
we will be storing as keys and values.

1990
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:02,040
Here we don't specify distinct

1991
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:09,000
and then new

1992
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:13,600
green.

1993
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:17,520
And then
I can see a person mapped or bought

1994
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:23,760
and then maybe one

1995
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:28,920
and the new person.

1996
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:30,600
And then

1997
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:38,240
to insert that

1998
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:50,200
ID in to suit

1999
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:52,360
wanted to

2000
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:58,480
oh, it should be in here.

2001
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:10,000
But is fairly

2002
02:18:10,320 --> 02:18:14,480
or to not

2003
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,040
has anyone creating these objects then
you guys and me, maybe we can speed up.

2004
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:23,720
Can you please. Person code.

2005
02:18:23,720 --> 02:18:41,600
Yes. Look me up on your side by side,

2006
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:43,680
including me

2007
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:08,320
of new person.

2008
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:10,600
I can see some

2009
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:31,520
one person

2010
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:34,680
who will then

2011
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:43,440
put some pretty

2012
02:19:43,920 --> 02:19:44,880
creative person.

2013
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:49,080
Class would be create
constructor inside the class

2014
02:19:49,440 --> 02:19:54,640
method and we create a map
that we store in that map entirety.

2015
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:56,880
But each object details.

2016
02:19:57,960 --> 02:20:01,040
So if I want to bring to the details

2017
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:04,680
what I try to do it like you're doing it

2018
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:06,960
and they don't work it work. Why?

2019
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:08,760
Why did it work?

2020
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:11,920
It should work.

2021
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:28,320
You see, my marina has done the same way.

2022
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:32,160
So I am getting the values from this map,

2023
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:36,120
storing in a collection
of persons and then

2024
02:20:38,480 --> 02:20:41,480
for each value

2025
02:20:41,480 --> 02:20:52,520
I am printing the user.

2026
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:59,160
So I get all the details in here.

2027
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:01,160
Problem with costing

2028
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:05,080
should not be a problem
with costing as well,

2029
02:21:05,480 --> 02:21:08,600
because we are storing the person's object

2030
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:11,680
and we are getting the person
same the same objects back.

2031
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:16,400
The costing is happens
when we are storing a different data type

2032
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:21,320
and want to convert it
to a different type.

2033
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:24,920
Are there more staff guys?

2034
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:27,000
I am about to die.

2035
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,240
Please say there are no tasks.

2036
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:36,200
Is it clear right.

2037
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:37,400
One more.

2038
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:39,080
Yes. We have

2039
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:44,160
or right.

2040
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:44,680
Listen me.

2041
02:21:44,680 --> 02:21:48,320
The requirement.

2042
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:51,760
Can you explain Line 17 to 20?

2043
02:21:52,600 --> 02:21:53,560
This one

2044
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:55,920
someone This one

2045
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:03,920
All I am creating the objects in here.

2046
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:05,920
The person objects.

2047
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:09,280
And then I am using the put method
to store those objects.

2048
02:22:09,880 --> 02:22:11,920
To store those objects?

2049
02:22:11,920 --> 02:22:16,600
Yes. Just the long way
to do the same thing.

2050
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:20,920
Just along with this.

2051
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:28,520
It's my solution.

2052
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:41,400
It's also good.

2053
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:51,160
Okay.

2054
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:53,400
And we move to the not next task.

2055
02:22:53,800 --> 02:23:17,280
Are there other questions?

2056
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:22,440
Create collect the collection
that will store single unique objects

2057
02:23:22,440 --> 02:23:28,080
of string type in which order preserved
right A logic to conclude

2058
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:30,680
which collection stores

2059
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:33,800
the unique objects. Guys

2060
02:23:37,240 --> 02:23:39,600
Which class inside the collections

2061
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:42,320
framework store b unique elements.

2062
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:44,760
It does not allow

2063
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:46,760
no no list in the entire

2064
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:49,960
the list we can store duplicates

2065
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:51,280
sets.

2066
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:55,320
Right and which type of set

2067
02:23:56,960 --> 02:23:59,960
result the order.

2068
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:04,240
There are three types of searches right?

2069
02:24:04,240 --> 02:24:06,560
So you said no, it will sort your data.

2070
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:08,840
It's the Lincoln set.

2071
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:09,520
Right.

2072
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:12,640
That preserves the order

2073
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:16,240
so I can see a set

2074
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:18,440
and I am storing single values, right?

2075
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:21,680
The single string values

2076
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:32,360
linked to exact.

2077
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:36,480
Have you guys created the
I have you guys added some values.

2078
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:39,600
Can you send me that code
to speed up this task

2079
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,520
alone and you created a list.

2080
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:58,200
List can have duplicates.

2081
02:24:58,240 --> 02:25:00,040
That's why we cannot it.

2082
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:03,800
At least we should go with the search.

2083
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:05,160
I think you guys don't

2084
02:25:06,480 --> 02:25:07,760
read it.

2085
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:10,200
It's just a name. Thank you.

2086
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:13,320
I think a lot of the mistakes
in programing they happened

2087
02:25:13,360 --> 02:25:16,560
because we don't read the questions
totally

2088
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:19,480
right. Mm.

2089
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:21,520
Okay.

2090
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:24,520
And now we have to concatenate
these values.

2091
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:24,880
Right.

2092
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:28,600
So let's say string

2093
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:33,040
values initially.

2094
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:34,680
Let's say yes.

2095
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:36,240
Okay.

2096
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:39,240
So I can say for each

2097
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:42,800
string fbr inside the insert

2098
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:49,160
values, the values of the two values

2099
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,680
plus SD

2100
02:25:54,560 --> 02:25:58,600
who I am doing something wrong in here
device.

2101
02:25:58,600 --> 02:26:02,440
I says it will give me correct results,
but it's not good for

2102
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:03,840
the performance reasons.

2103
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:05,080
Can you guys tell me?

2104
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:07,440
Look, look, can I improving the score.

2105
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:10,920
I try to

2106
02:26:12,480 --> 02:26:13,920
because this size

2107
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:16,880
change is is for how to correct.

2108
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:28,000
Are we changing the size here?

2109
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,760
No, we are not changing
beside this string builder.

2110
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:32,880
Right.

2111
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:38,320
I am making changes
to this same variable again and again.

2112
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:40,040
Right.

2113
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:41,240
I am updating.

2114
02:26:41,240 --> 02:26:43,160
I'm trying to upgrade this value.

2115
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:47,000
So what will happen
internally each time will go

2116
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:50,600
and check the memory
if that value exists in the memory or not.

2117
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:53,760
Right. If I use string.

2118
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:56,760
So instead of this I should use

2119
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:01,360
string builder
and intel is saying the same.

2120
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:05,880
I can tell you saying convert the values
from strength to strength builder

2121
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:09,080
and once

2122
02:27:09,080 --> 02:27:12,280
you have those,
then you can guarantee nature.

2123
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:25,720
I can put into those out here.

2124
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:28,680
So I see all the values concatenated here.

2125
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:35,520
Is it clear right.

2126
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:48,400
Any questions from this task?

2127
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:49,120
Yep, sure.

2128
02:27:49,120 --> 02:28:12,280
So they're still good

2129
02:28:12,280 --> 02:28:16,360
if you're just putting out.

2130
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:17,240
Yes, it is good.

2131
02:28:17,240 --> 02:28:19,800
But if you have to

2132
02:28:19,800 --> 02:28:23,600
use these values further in your code,

2133
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:27,240
then you should consider
storing them in a variable.

2134
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:31,280
But it's also good for this task
if you have just printed them out.

2135
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:55,280
It's also good.

2136
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:58,920
You guys want a break
before we start the files or it's fine.

2137
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:05,280
We can start to be working with files.

2138
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:06,120
No break.

2139
02:29:07,240 --> 02:29:07,560
Okay.

2140
02:29:07,560 --> 02:29:15,240
Prints, Lubo.

2141
02:29:15,240 --> 02:29:18,440
Well, 53

2142
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:23,840
looks to be back by 110.

2143
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:32,760
Need to take my dog out.

2144
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:47,400
All our guys will be back by 110.

2145
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:48,640
He know which to produce.

2146
02:29:48,640 --> 02:29:50,600
Do you want me to book

2147
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:52,800
person?

2148
02:29:52,800 --> 02:29:55,680
Okay. With this person?

2149
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:57,720
Person? Person.

2150
02:29:58,200 --> 02:29:59,200
Not here

2151
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:06,720
actually.

2152
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:08,840
Let me push this code to the gear.

2153
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:18,120
So you guys,

2154
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:41,440
this is class 29, right?

2155
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:43,920
We are using the

2156
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:49,800
main branch or the master branch.

2157
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:56,280
Then you guys check
if you have got to update or not.

2158
02:30:56,280 --> 02:31:03,640
Okay?

2159
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:04,320
All right.

2160
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:20,880
Please be back by 110.

2161
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:21,480
All right.

2162
02:31:21,480 --> 02:31:24,600
So let's discuss the files

2163
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:29,840
finally, can

2164
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:36,840
I close these two files?

2165
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:48,200
Is there anyone who is still typing
or looking at these files?

2166
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:50,320
Yes or no?

2167
02:31:50,320 --> 02:31:54,840
Can I close this?

2168
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:56,280
Okay,

2169
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:00,680
so now you guys have the background,

2170
02:32:00,680 --> 02:32:03,840
necessary background for the files, right?

2171
02:32:03,920 --> 02:32:08,480
Why we need them
and how we do it manually.

2172
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:13,200
So now we will learn it.

2173
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:15,960
Be professional the programmer way.

2174
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:18,600
Right? You guys are pro and Java pros.

2175
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:21,920
So because we know Java
we will not opening

2176
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:24,960
and closing files manually anymore. Right?

2177
02:32:25,240 --> 02:32:39,160
We will be writing the code
for our both tasks.

2178
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:42,880
While I had you smiling,
I am always smiling.

2179
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:44,680
I don't know why.

2180
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:47,680
It's very rare that I am not smiling

2181
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:50,360
when I have enough sleep.

2182
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:54,800
I always smile.

2183
02:32:54,800 --> 02:33:12,120
Okay.

2184
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:22,600
More than three.

2185
02:33:22,600 --> 02:33:23,240
Alright guys.

2186
02:33:23,240 --> 02:33:26,520
So the first type of files

2187
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:29,160
that we will be learning

2188
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:31,800
as you are

2189
02:33:31,800 --> 02:33:34,920
attending this class,
only to remind me about the recording.

2190
02:33:35,240 --> 02:33:42,880
But yes, we are recording it with ACA.

2191
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:46,960
The only way to to make sure
that we record everything today

2192
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:51,560
because she will be here,
she will be going somewhere

2193
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:56,520
and she will not be able to attend
to complete class.

2194
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:57,200
Don't worry, I said.

2195
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:05,880
We've got we are recording everything. So

2196
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:12,440
so guys,

2197
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:16,840
to make things simple,

2198
02:34:16,840 --> 02:34:22,160
click on your project, okay?

2199
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:25,080
Because you guys will be making
a lot of mistakes.

2200
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,240
Right click on your project

2201
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,560
and then click on New

2202
02:34:32,040 --> 02:34:45,160
and then click on this directly.

2203
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:52,920
So you guys see this option, right
click on your project,

2204
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:58,320
then Neil then directly, and let's call it

2205
02:34:58,480 --> 02:34:59,640
five five

2206
02:35:05,160 --> 02:35:08,120
and let's now right

2207
02:35:08,120 --> 02:35:10,440
click and click on file

2208
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,840
and then create

2209
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:31,920
a file called config.

2210
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:34,640
You guys can name it anything config doc,

2211
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:38,680
but this extension should be
for all parties.

2212
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:40,280
Okay.

2213
02:35:40,280 --> 02:35:45,120
For all of these,
make sure the extension is not properties,

2214
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:49,080
but you can name your file.

2215
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:52,920
You can name it anything so

2216
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:55,000
config not

2217
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:59,240
properties.

2218
02:36:00,120 --> 02:36:03,640
I don't know where it goes.

2219
02:36:03,640 --> 02:36:07,560
It should be inside this
file files folder in here

2220
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:12,240
you can create a new one.

2221
02:36:12,240 --> 02:36:17,720
I had already, so I just got back.

2222
02:36:17,720 --> 02:36:20,560
What did I miss?

2223
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:22,320
Sebastian, I'm not going to tell you.

2224
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:22,960
What did you miss?

2225
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:25,320
You are five minute, five minute late.

2226
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:27,560
You have to give us all party.

2227
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:31,440
And then I will repeat everything for you.

2228
02:36:31,440 --> 02:36:36,000
Do we have a deal?

2229
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:36,720
Oops, party.

2230
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:40,080
Mine is showing like a little bar
graph. Yes.

2231
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:47,360
That means you have done it correctly.

2232
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:49,320
That means you guys have done it
correctly.

2233
02:36:49,320 --> 02:36:58,840
Why am I is not showing?

2234
02:36:58,840 --> 02:37:01,200
I think I have not installed that bluntly.

2235
02:37:01,960 --> 02:37:03,040
Let me check

2236
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:18,040
labels.

2237
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:19,560
Smart thing.

2238
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:22,640
Yes, I have installed it

2239
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:25,720
and still I don't

2240
02:37:25,720 --> 02:37:51,720
get that bar like icon.

2241
02:37:51,720 --> 02:37:53,720
There is a bug or something in my eye.

2242
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:54,920
Like you should see that

2243
02:37:55,880 --> 02:37:56,240
graph.

2244
02:37:56,240 --> 02:38:02,000
Like when I come
I'd show him how to do that right? Yes.

2245
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,440
Guys, please show me

2246
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:10,480
that you have done it incorrectly.

2247
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:11,520
You Google it.

2248
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:15,840
Can you repeat the config properties
doors about Oh my God.

2249
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:16,560
All right,

2250
02:38:17,800 --> 02:38:19,960
you guys,

2251
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:23,160
if any instructor
is going to do anything wrong.

2252
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:25,800
Right.
And you guys will not let him go anyway.

2253
02:38:26,040 --> 02:38:32,120
So a config dot property. Yes.

2254
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:35,600
Maybe my laptop is boxed with so

2255
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:40,200
yes it should be

2256
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:53,520
something is.

2257
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:54,520
Okay. Let me repeat.

2258
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:59,760
Can. Okay.

2259
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:02,680
So first I write it.

2260
02:39:02,680 --> 02:39:09,600
Actually let me type something.

2261
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:13,480
How to create

2262
02:39:17,680 --> 02:39:20,040
a party file

2263
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:23,480
in the intelligent

2264
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:27,600
right

2265
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:34,760
click on project.

2266
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:37,000
You can Neil

2267
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:41,520
directly

2268
02:39:47,520 --> 02:39:51,960
and directly there

2269
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:59,160
again, right click and

2270
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:01,800
click

2271
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:07,960
nail file

2272
02:40:07,960 --> 02:40:10,240
and you

2273
02:40:13,240 --> 02:40:15,760
extension

2274
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:18,400
you as

2275
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:22,040
properties.

2276
02:40:22,040 --> 02:40:27,000
It's funny how babies are trying to
please double master.

2277
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Maybe your laptop does not have properties

2278
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:33,360
and I got I I.

2279
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:36,840
Okay so we have to do these things so file

2280
02:40:38,280 --> 02:40:47,640
and then new file and then new

2281
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:52,480
so config naught

2282
02:40:56,280 --> 02:40:57,880
properties.

2283
02:40:57,880 --> 02:40:58,280
Okay.

2284
02:40:58,280 --> 02:41:01,640
And then you should see your file

2285
02:41:19,080 --> 02:41:20,400
here because

2286
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:23,440
now I also have

2287
02:41:23,440 --> 02:41:35,520
the graph, I do not have this file
folder I'm running.

2288
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:39,880
You can create one.

2289
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:41,560
You can create one.

2290
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:46,120
Go to the opposite,

2291
02:41:46,120 --> 02:41:50,480
create right click on your project
and then click on new

2292
02:41:50,480 --> 02:41:55,080
and then you can create this statically.

2293
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:55,400
Yeah,

2294
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:58,960
I know

2295
02:41:59,160 --> 02:42:03,800
you have installed so many plugins
inside my intelligent

2296
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:07,880
so you are ready for market.

2297
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:10,360
That's why there is this conflict. All

2298
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:15,240
and let's try to store B

2299
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:21,800
the sensitive data in here for example
so this property is files

2300
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:26,480
is it's stores D
that are in the form of key value pairs.

2301
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,640
So for example I can see

2302
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:32,320
a user name is equal to

2303
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:39,360
admin we don't need because

2304
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:44,360
and password is required to administer

2305
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:49,320
oh, let's have maybe

2306
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:53,760
boss one, two, three, something like that.

2307
02:42:53,760 --> 02:42:58,440
And we know once you guys have stored
this data inside this properties files,

2308
02:42:58,440 --> 02:43:02,680
so the properties for file
will always contain the data

2309
02:43:02,680 --> 02:43:04,680
in the form of developers

2310
02:43:06,880 --> 02:43:13,440
because it is a child,

2311
02:43:13,440 --> 02:43:17,440
because it is a child of the map
interface.

2312
02:43:17,440 --> 02:43:21,880
This properties class
that we will be using to raid this files.

2313
02:43:22,360 --> 02:43:25,480
It also implements the map interface.

2314
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:28,480
So all you guys done with these tasks

2315
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:37,920
now. So now we want to read this
file, right?

2316
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:40,120
We want to read the data from this fight.

2317
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:43,520
So what is the first thing that we need
on our computers

2318
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,320
If we have to read
the data from a file manually

2319
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,880
the bar to right?

2320
02:43:55,880 --> 02:43:58,560
So I will first

2321
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:01,920
brain, obviously brain.

2322
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:05,680
So I will be needing the box

2323
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:10,480
so I can get the part of this properties
file.

2324
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:13,120
Sorry, one more time config step.

2325
02:44:13,640 --> 02:44:16,120
So Omran, right click on your project

2326
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:20,160
then click on new and then directly.

2327
02:44:20,760 --> 02:44:23,600
If you do that, you can create this file

2328
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:29,120
as a bad entry in here.

2329
02:44:29,120 --> 02:44:32,280
And once you have created
do you have this files directory

2330
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:40,280
number
and do you have this files directory?

2331
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:42,440
Not then create one.

2332
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:43,840
What are you waiting for?

2333
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:48,160
The waiting from Obama that once
he will say then you will create that

2334
02:44:48,360 --> 02:44:56,280
directory.

2335
02:44:56,280 --> 02:44:58,680
Let me know once you have the directory.

2336
02:44:58,680 --> 02:44:59,520
Trump

2337
02:45:01,360 --> 02:45:02,640
okay, create files.

2338
02:45:02,640 --> 02:45:04,920
So now right click on your directory

2339
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:10,320
and then click on new and then file and.

2340
02:45:10,320 --> 02:45:12,040
Then you can give any name.

2341
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:16,200
And the the extension should be properties

2342
02:45:17,720 --> 02:45:22,040
like this and hit enter.

2343
02:45:22,040 --> 02:45:25,920
It will be good good
if you keep the name same like I am

2344
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:30,560
using config.

2345
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:32,560
Let me know once you see this file in here

2346
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:44,640
I'm run.

2347
02:45:44,640 --> 02:45:46,680
Do you see this file

2348
02:46:00,480 --> 02:46:01,840
is waiting on Biden's

2349
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:08,360
first.

2350
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:09,680
It's very simple.

2351
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:12,360
Right click and then new and then file.

2352
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:16,160
What is hard in

2353
02:46:33,280 --> 02:46:34,720
posting this portal

2354
02:46:34,720 --> 02:46:40,960
posting this portended.

2355
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:41,520
Please do.

2356
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:46,560
Please don't do this on your jobs. Yes.

2357
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:49,840
If you have a different name
for your project, it will be different.

2358
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:54,840
You will see something different in here.

2359
02:46:54,840 --> 02:47:01,080
Maybe that's the issue
that you are facing.

2360
02:47:01,080 --> 02:47:01,560
Okay.

2361
02:47:01,560 --> 02:47:07,960
Anyhow, okay,
so we need the part first, right?

2362
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:10,080
So I will right click in here

2363
02:47:11,720 --> 02:47:13,640
and I will say

2364
02:47:13,640 --> 02:47:26,880
copy part.

2365
02:47:26,880 --> 02:47:28,800
So do you guys see this option?

2366
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:30,360
But from Content Road,

2367
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:33,480
it's the guys

2368
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:41,920
like you get the bad 40 or driver.

2369
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:48,560
Do you guys see this option.

2370
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:52,120
Okay copy this and place inside in here

2371
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:57,080
save one more time.

2372
02:47:57,080 --> 02:47:58,080
£1 fish.

2373
02:47:58,080 --> 02:48:01,600
You want me to save false right click

2374
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:05,760
and then copy part reference

2375
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:10,280
I could manually.

2376
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:12,880
You are great for one

2377
02:48:18,360 --> 02:48:20,400
and then if you click on copy

2378
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:24,200
then you will see all you guys can type
in the name of the directory

2379
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:28,440
and the name of the file
with the extension.

2380
02:48:28,440 --> 02:48:30,760
But please don't buy the exact same thing.

2381
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:32,920
If you have created a file
with a different name,

2382
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:37,120
otherwise you will be getting an error.

2383
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:41,080
Yes. Like driver chrome driver

2384
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:54,400
Simon.

2385
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:59,040
Well, y you are to the y,
you are to grab the air from this side

2386
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:03,840
when you when you can get it
from this side, yes, it will work.

2387
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:06,480
But why you want to do that? It's

2388
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:11,840
okay.

2389
02:49:11,840 --> 02:49:14,480
So we have the part in here.

2390
02:49:14,480 --> 02:49:17,440
What is the next thing is that we need

2391
02:49:17,440 --> 02:49:19,960
I. So if the

2392
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:25,800
location of the file on

2393
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:31,960
in our project. Okay

2394
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:37,320
that is actually not the full party one.

2395
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,120
So he's using a rally.

2396
02:49:40,120 --> 02:49:42,120
So there are multiple types of parts.

2397
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:45,240
Really part absolute part.

2398
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:47,640
And there are two more types of parts.

2399
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:53,160
So we will be speaking
with the relative part in here.

2400
02:49:53,160 --> 02:49:54,240
It's easy.

2401
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:56,760
Okay, then I will teach you
how to the full part.

2402
02:49:57,600 --> 02:50:00,560
If the file is not stored inside the

2403
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:06,480
inside of your project, we will be needing
the other types of parts.

2404
02:50:06,480 --> 02:50:08,640
So I will show you that as well. Okay.

2405
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:11,520
But let's first try to

2406
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:14,240
start from this very simple, basic thing.

2407
02:50:14,240 --> 02:50:16,240
So this is the location of the file

2408
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:23,960
inside our broad.

2409
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:26,360
So we have moved.

2410
02:50:26,360 --> 02:50:27,360
So we have the part.

2411
02:50:27,360 --> 02:50:33,240
Now, when we have the part,
we also navigate to that folder, right?

2412
02:50:33,240 --> 02:50:35,560
Or to that file
where that file is located.

2413
02:50:35,560 --> 02:50:40,080
That kind of task is done
with this special class in Java

2414
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:43,520
that is called file

2415
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:47,400
input.

2416
02:50:47,400 --> 02:50:48,240
Steam

2417
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:51,360
file input scheme is equal to nil

2418
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:55,800
file input 15 and we passed the part here.

2419
02:50:56,440 --> 02:50:56,760
Okay.

2420
02:50:56,760 --> 02:51:19,160
Like this.

2421
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:21,600
So you simply you guys can think of

2422
02:51:22,560 --> 02:51:25,720
never be able to right now
when we do this file

2423
02:51:25,880 --> 02:51:30,600
or steam file costume,
we are actually navigating to this spot.

2424
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:31,240
Okay?

2425
02:51:31,240 --> 02:51:36,480
We are instructing the operating system
to go and check this.

2426
02:51:36,480 --> 02:51:40,080
This file exists or not, if it exist,
make a connection to that file

2427
02:51:40,360 --> 02:51:43,440
so that we can start reading the data.

2428
02:51:44,280 --> 02:51:46,520
So you will be getting an error right now.

2429
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:51,120
For now,
you can just select all two and enter

2430
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:54,840
and then say add exception to the method.

2431
02:51:54,840 --> 02:51:56,640
The signature.

2432
02:51:56,640 --> 02:51:59,520
So you will see
this file not found in here.

2433
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:01,360
Okay.

2434
02:52:01,360 --> 02:52:03,080
And then the error should go. Okay.

2435
02:52:03,080 --> 02:52:06,920
Do you guys see this same

2436
02:52:06,960 --> 02:52:08,360
file not found in here

2437
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:15,560
and the error goes away.

2438
02:52:15,560 --> 02:52:19,800
So we got the bar to
we navigate to that specific file.

2439
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:23,000
Now we need a special program

2440
02:52:23,080 --> 02:52:26,160
that understands the properties file.

2441
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:26,440
Right?

2442
02:52:26,440 --> 02:52:28,800
That can read the properties file.

2443
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:34,240
All to enter OneNote are entered
or you can just type it manually.

2444
02:52:34,560 --> 02:52:38,040
Right right close
and then file not found exception

2445
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:38,760
in here

2446
02:52:41,160 --> 02:52:42,640
or alternate alternate.

2447
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:43,680
Let me do it again.

2448
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:47,720
So if I remove this I will get the error.

2449
02:52:48,240 --> 02:52:49,800
What about the Mac Illini?

2450
02:52:49,800 --> 02:52:52,560
I told you to sell that Mac
and buy a Windows.

2451
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:55,000
Yes. Options.

2452
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,600
I guess they're soft and then enter.

2453
02:52:57,720 --> 02:53:01,960
Well, what is the alternative on the
on the on the Mac

2454
02:53:01,960 --> 02:53:05,760
for the old.

2455
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:07,440
You can click on the. Yes. Yes.

2456
02:53:07,440 --> 02:53:11,400
You guys can also do this
however your mouse over and then say add

2457
02:53:11,400 --> 02:53:14,880
exception
to the method signature options keep

2458
02:53:16,680 --> 02:53:21,200
options okay

2459
02:53:23,320 --> 02:53:27,120
yes Illini try washing your laptop
as I have.

2460
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:38,520
Just do you and your husband
the laptop as well.

2461
02:53:38,520 --> 02:53:39,640
Okay.

2462
02:53:39,840 --> 02:53:42,720
So are you with me still here?

2463
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:46,240
Is there anyone who is still getting
any issues at us or anything

2464
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:51,040
like that?

2465
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:54,160
No husband, no watching and

2466
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:57,560
then then vice someone else has a laptop.

2467
02:53:57,560 --> 02:54:04,760
Maybe your neighbor your friend, but left.

2468
02:54:04,760 --> 02:54:08,080
Okay,
so we have never get it to that that.

2469
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:11,520
But right now we need a special program.

2470
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:14,640
That special again it's a class in Java.

2471
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:17,840
Okay, so you guys see how useful
these classes are?

2472
02:54:19,440 --> 02:54:25,240
That class is called Properties.

2473
02:54:25,240 --> 02:54:27,000
Property is property.

2474
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:31,680
Is it built on new properties like this?

2475
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:32,680
So this is the

2476
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:37,440
this is that special program which will
help us read the data from this file.

2477
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:56,480
Okay.

2478
02:54:56,480 --> 02:54:58,560
I have five broken laptops.

2479
02:54:58,560 --> 02:55:03,960
If you guys need for practice,
I can give you for practice. Yep.

2480
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:06,720
Just creating the objects. 30.

2481
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:11,680
And now we can instruct this property
as class to load

2482
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:15,560
that file by saying property is not load

2483
02:55:16,680 --> 02:55:18,880
and passing this file in

2484
02:55:19,120 --> 02:55:25,320
stream object in here.

2485
02:55:25,320 --> 02:55:27,640
Then you guys will again
be getting in error.

2486
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:28,880
Right.

2487
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:32,720
And again you have hovered
your mouse, click on this bulb

2488
02:55:32,720 --> 02:55:36,640
and then say add exception
to the method signature.

2489
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:41,280
We will learn
what are these exceptions and how they can

2490
02:55:41,280 --> 02:55:47,400
effect are programs.

2491
02:55:47,400 --> 02:55:55,920
Are you guys done?

2492
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:58,880
Okay, so

2493
02:55:58,880 --> 02:56:03,720
now we are finally ready to read the data

2494
02:56:03,720 --> 02:56:06,440
so I can see

2495
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:09,600
property is door to get

2496
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:12,880
you guys see this get the method.

2497
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:14,960
It was also present somewhere else.

2498
02:56:14,960 --> 02:56:17,120
Can you guys tell me that's it.

2499
02:56:17,120 --> 02:56:21,000
This is the last class.

2500
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:22,440
This method.

2501
02:56:22,440 --> 02:56:25,880
That method was also present
somewhere in you guys.

2502
02:56:25,880 --> 02:56:26,720
Tell me

2503
02:56:28,600 --> 02:56:30,720
in the least.

2504
02:56:30,720 --> 02:56:34,880
It was also present in the map as well.

2505
02:56:35,560 --> 02:56:36,880
Map file.

2506
02:56:36,880 --> 02:56:41,160
If you guys are open
this property is class.

2507
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:45,720
You will see this is actually a child

2508
02:56:45,720 --> 02:56:49,200
class of hash.

2509
02:56:49,200 --> 02:56:54,000
So all the matters
that are present inside the hash map,

2510
02:56:54,240 --> 02:56:57,720
which are all the methods
which are present in map,

2511
02:56:57,720 --> 02:57:01,120
you guys can also use
those methods. Right?

2512
02:57:01,120 --> 02:57:06,240
Remember the inheritance concept.

2513
02:57:06,240 --> 02:57:10,080
So that's why we have this guide method.

2514
02:57:10,320 --> 02:57:16,760
And if I have to get
the value of a key in a map, what do I do?

2515
02:57:16,760 --> 02:57:19,080
I specify the key.

2516
02:57:19,080 --> 02:57:22,200
So internally, Java is storing

2517
02:57:22,200 --> 02:57:26,600
all of this desktop, the form of maps.

2518
02:57:27,560 --> 02:57:31,480
This is treated as e this as value.

2519
02:57:31,560 --> 02:57:33,240
This is E, this is value.

2520
02:57:33,240 --> 02:57:36,200
So if I want this user name
from this file,

2521
02:57:36,720 --> 02:57:39,600
I can simply say properties dot dead

2522
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:43,680
and I specify the property in here

2523
02:57:44,320 --> 02:57:53,880
and I should get the corresponding value.

2524
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:57,280
So I get admin same, same as maps

2525
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:00,520
because it's the job of map

2526
02:58:03,640 --> 02:58:04,320
looking open,

2527
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:21,680
look side by side.

2528
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:27,200
Okay, you are not going anywhere.

2529
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:29,560
I think this is also a bug in intelligent

2530
02:58:36,240 --> 02:58:39,080
so let's close and reopen it again.

2531
02:58:40,040 --> 02:58:42,480
You guys see excited side.

2532
02:58:42,480 --> 02:58:44,800
Maybe you have installed
too many extensions.

2533
02:58:44,800 --> 02:58:47,360
I should uninstall
some of them more intelligent.

2534
02:58:47,360 --> 02:58:58,800
Sometimes it does not behave correctly.

2535
02:58:58,800 --> 02:59:00,000
Oh no, no.

2536
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,120
It looks

2537
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:04,240
weird.

2538
02:59:04,240 --> 02:59:14,520
Well, they're fine having. Yes,

2539
02:59:15,720 --> 02:59:18,160
I remember those first days.

2540
02:59:18,160 --> 02:59:20,120
Those first days they are gone.

2541
02:59:20,120 --> 02:59:22,600
You guys are now. Pros null.

2542
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:24,800
Alexa, you have.

2543
02:59:24,800 --> 02:59:28,720
You must have done something wrong.

2544
02:59:28,720 --> 02:59:31,560
Yes. You remember guys in the maps?

2545
02:59:31,880 --> 02:59:35,840
These words, they
they are case sensitive to

2546
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:42,920
how many of you see

2547
02:59:42,920 --> 02:59:46,080
the value from this file?

2548
02:59:46,080 --> 02:59:48,360
This admin.

2549
02:59:48,360 --> 02:59:51,720
When you specify the

2550
02:59:52,320 --> 02:59:54,320
in you guys tell me the code

2551
02:59:54,320 --> 02:59:57,680
to get to get to this password
as well from this

2552
02:59:57,680 --> 03:00:01,200
file.

2553
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:05,040
Can you guys write the code to get to be
password as well and send me in.

2554
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:06,840
The live channel

2555
03:00:06,960 --> 03:00:12,000
is too hard.

2556
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,600
These are just three lines of code
Walmart.

2557
03:00:14,960 --> 03:00:17,800
Just kidding.

2558
03:00:17,800 --> 03:00:22,800
I told you this is an easy class.

2559
03:00:22,800 --> 03:00:26,520
All right, so from a map,
how do I get the value?

2560
03:00:26,520 --> 03:00:28,800
I say name of the map.

2561
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:32,000
Then I call the get method and I the

2562
03:00:33,720 --> 03:00:38,320
easy peasy right?

2563
03:00:38,320 --> 03:00:41,040
So I get the password. Well,
so this is simple.

2564
03:00:41,040 --> 03:00:53,400
This is how we read the files using Java.

2565
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:59,600
Is there anyone who is confused
or maybe some piece of code is not clear

2566
03:01:14,160 --> 03:01:16,560
as the file have to be called.

2567
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:19,800
The dot properties
are the it to work with a text.

2568
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:21,120
You know it will not work.

2569
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:23,720
BSD part.

2570
03:01:23,720 --> 03:01:26,040
It is only for properties file.

2571
03:01:26,400 --> 03:01:28,080
You can try that as well.

2572
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:31,920
Try it and let me know
when it changes the extension

2573
03:01:31,920 --> 03:01:35,400
of your file and try it
if it works or not.

2574
03:01:35,400 --> 03:01:40,200
I have never tried it, but 99
I am sure that it will not work like that.

2575
03:01:41,720 --> 03:01:44,440
So properties loading the

2576
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:47,160
that side inside properties object

2577
03:01:48,240 --> 03:01:50,880
from the file

2578
03:01:52,240 --> 03:01:58,360
and then I can get all the files
when I hit all controlled files.

2579
03:01:58,360 --> 03:01:59,000
This.

2580
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:03,560
So Mohamud, I told you about this
all I think 15 minutes ago

2581
03:02:04,080 --> 03:02:06,080
and you are clicking all to enter now

2582
03:02:10,680 --> 03:02:12,880
let me check why you got this

2583
03:02:16,320 --> 03:02:18,040
file part. Yes.

2584
03:02:18,040 --> 03:02:19,680
You have to select this first option.

2585
03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:22,280
Add exception to method signature.

2586
03:02:22,320 --> 03:02:25,080
The first one. Yes. You are doing it
correctly.

2587
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:37,960
Check the first option.

2588
03:02:37,960 --> 03:02:42,080
Let me know if you still face an issues
getting the

2589
03:02:44,920 --> 03:02:47,840
locks with the file as well.

2590
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:49,600
That's great.

2591
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:52,560
So value

2592
03:02:53,640 --> 03:02:56,280
menus or the

2593
03:02:58,080 --> 03:03:00,880
corresponding

2594
03:03:01,800 --> 03:03:03,080
fees.

2595
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:08,720
Okay, so we specify the key
and then we get the value back

2596
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:16,400
and then we specify the key
and we get value back.

2597
03:03:16,400 --> 03:03:19,560
Are you guys able to read
all of you are able to read this data

2598
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:31,320
from the files.

2599
03:03:31,320 --> 03:03:32,080
Okay.

2600
03:03:32,080 --> 03:03:35,520
So right now
we have this file inside the intelligent,

2601
03:03:35,720 --> 03:03:40,080
but I should be able to read the file
anywhere from my computer.

2602
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:40,880
Right.

2603
03:03:41,400 --> 03:03:52,480
So for example,
let's say this is a folder on my computer

2604
03:03:53,720 --> 03:03:55,760
and I have this configuration

2605
03:03:56,080 --> 03:04:04,600
property that check
what is presently not in here.

2606
03:04:04,600 --> 03:04:08,560
Okay, server
password, loop name, user name.

2607
03:04:08,560 --> 03:04:10,800
Let's try

2608
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:16,320
so you guys can create a new file
anywhere on your computer

2609
03:04:17,480 --> 03:04:20,800
and let me know once
you have created a file and

2610
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,800
has stored some data inside that file

2611
03:04:26,360 --> 03:04:29,560
to any folder you should know.

2612
03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:31,840
You know the location of that folder?

2613
03:04:32,200 --> 03:04:33,840
No, no, not any type of file.

2614
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:38,280
It's it should still be configuration
dot properties.

2615
03:04:38,280 --> 03:04:39,720
Okay. Name can be anything.

2616
03:04:39,720 --> 03:04:45,440
The extension should be properties.

2617
03:04:45,440 --> 03:04:49,400
So let's try to learn
how to read from anywhere on our computer.

2618
03:04:50,880 --> 03:05:02,760
Let me know once
you guys are done creating these files,

2619
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:04,680
those who are related to create the files.

2620
03:05:04,680 --> 03:05:05,880
Let me send you a file

2621
03:05:09,840 --> 03:05:12,800
while you need to create the Excel file.

2622
03:05:12,800 --> 03:05:14,880
No, you guys don't need to create
Excel files.

2623
03:05:14,880 --> 03:05:27,120
Just fill this properties file.

2624
03:05:27,120 --> 03:05:31,320
Are you guys done creating file
this properties file

2625
03:05:46,120 --> 03:05:47,880
is created automatically.

2626
03:05:47,880 --> 03:05:51,160
You didn't show us. Oh, it's simple.
Right?

2627
03:05:51,360 --> 03:05:51,800
Right.

2628
03:05:51,800 --> 03:05:55,200
Click then. Neon.

2629
03:05:55,200 --> 03:05:59,040
And then you can choose, let's say,
for example, text file,

2630
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,800
and then you can say config.

2631
03:06:03,480 --> 03:06:04,200
Oh, my God.

2632
03:06:04,200 --> 03:06:07,480
You are still maybe voice

2633
03:06:07,480 --> 03:06:10,640
config and the extension should be

2634
03:06:12,880 --> 03:06:14,560
properties

2635
03:06:15,400 --> 03:06:23,720
that suit.

2636
03:06:23,720 --> 03:06:27,480
Why do we need to do this
so that you guys know how to?

2637
03:06:27,480 --> 03:06:34,720
Read the files from anywhere,

2638
03:06:34,720 --> 03:06:37,640
anywhere from any computer,
any folder anywhere

2639
03:06:38,600 --> 03:06:40,920
to just create a file anywhere inside

2640
03:06:40,920 --> 03:07:02,880
your computer.

2641
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:08,160
Let me know once you guys are done.

2642
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:11,400
I hope the Mac users know how to create

2643
03:07:11,400 --> 03:07:14,960
a file with Dot Properties Illini.

2644
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,480
Do you know how to
create dot properties file?

2645
03:07:19,160 --> 03:07:21,320
Yes. Notepad is also good.

2646
03:07:21,320 --> 03:07:23,800
The American you guard Illini
how to do that

2647
03:07:26,120 --> 03:07:29,160
or use my file guys use use my file.

2648
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,240
Just copy and paste
this file on your computer

2649
03:07:32,240 --> 03:07:36,480
as the Mac users.

2650
03:07:36,480 --> 03:07:37,800
Just copy and paste this file.

2651
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:50,000
Download this violent story
to any of you on your computer.

2652
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:53,880
And yes,
I have shared it in the live questions

2653
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:12,840
so you guys can copy
this part to this file as well.

2654
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:16,680
You guys can also copy this right click
and then copy

2655
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:22,080
and paste it anywhere on your computer.

2656
03:08:22,080 --> 03:08:26,080
Just just copy this file and paste it
anywhere on your computer

2657
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:36,360
desk.

2658
03:08:36,360 --> 03:08:46,440
Let me know what you guys are done.

2659
03:08:46,440 --> 03:08:49,360
And also make sure, guys,

2660
03:08:49,360 --> 03:08:53,800
you have some data inside your file.

2661
03:08:53,800 --> 03:08:57,440
Now, let me create a new

2662
03:08:57,680 --> 03:09:00,560
demo for you guys

2663
03:09:32,400 --> 03:09:35,840
and from your previous demo,

2664
03:09:36,720 --> 03:09:39,920
just copy and paste this code

2665
03:09:43,360 --> 03:09:45,040
so create a new main

2666
03:09:45,040 --> 03:09:50,280
method and copy and paste the code.

2667
03:09:50,280 --> 03:09:52,320
And now

2668
03:09:52,840 --> 03:10:09,720
you have to be exceptionally.

2669
03:10:09,720 --> 03:10:14,680
Are you guys done creating a new file,
naming it config tool

2670
03:10:14,720 --> 03:10:20,600
config file
demo two and copying and pasting the code.

2671
03:10:20,600 --> 03:10:22,640
Okay, now go to that file.

2672
03:10:23,480 --> 03:10:25,520
So for example, this is.

2673
03:10:25,520 --> 03:10:27,720
Yes, just changed the part.

2674
03:10:27,720 --> 03:10:29,680
So the windows do your dirty.

2675
03:10:29,680 --> 03:10:32,280
You guys can just

2676
03:10:32,520 --> 03:10:36,440
right click in here.

2677
03:10:36,440 --> 03:10:38,520
No, because you are not using Windows 11.

2678
03:10:38,520 --> 03:10:39,480
So let's do this.

2679
03:10:39,480 --> 03:10:41,920
Just click on your file and then

2680
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:45,400
copy this part from here.

2681
03:10:45,400 --> 03:10:50,600
So this is the part of this file
on my computer, this

2682
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:55,440
and just go inside this address
bar on Windows.

2683
03:10:56,040 --> 03:11:00,480
And I think the Mac users,
you guys can right click and you click on

2684
03:11:02,440 --> 03:11:04,000
properties or something like

2685
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:09,360
that,
you will be able to get this path as well.

2686
03:11:09,360 --> 03:11:11,080
The Mac users.

2687
03:11:11,080 --> 03:11:14,040
Can someone tell you how the how we can

2688
03:11:14,040 --> 03:11:17,800
get to the part of a file on Mac

2689
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:26,640
or if you guys already know the part,

2690
03:11:27,400 --> 03:11:30,080
you can just copy it from here.

2691
03:11:30,080 --> 03:11:30,800
Okay.

2692
03:11:31,080 --> 03:11:34,800
This is called absolute part.

2693
03:11:34,800 --> 03:11:37,920
So now I just need to change

2694
03:11:40,720 --> 03:11:45,560
this part in here.

2695
03:11:45,560 --> 03:11:48,480
Okay. This one.

2696
03:11:48,480 --> 03:11:51,760
And you guys can use double backward
slashes or forward slash.

2697
03:11:51,760 --> 03:11:54,120
The both should work fine

2698
03:11:54,120 --> 03:11:57,600
like this.

2699
03:11:57,600 --> 03:12:00,120
So copy the part of your file

2700
03:12:00,640 --> 03:12:03,440
and a lot of you will be messing up things

2701
03:12:03,440 --> 03:12:04,520
in here

2702
03:12:07,680 --> 03:12:10,920
and district type config dot properties.

2703
03:12:10,920 --> 03:12:11,640
Okay.

2704
03:12:12,480 --> 03:12:28,560
Before these backwards issues.

2705
03:12:28,560 --> 03:12:34,440
So Jimmy, we are trying to read the file
from a different location outside of Intel

2706
03:12:37,320 --> 03:12:37,760
number.

2707
03:12:37,760 --> 03:12:40,320
Can you
show Illini how to get the part of a file

2708
03:12:41,520 --> 03:12:46,080
in Mac. Yes.

2709
03:12:46,080 --> 03:12:50,320
If you guys want to add some back
to inside that config file, it's fine

2710
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:54,800
if you guys don't want to do that,
it's also fine, but should at least be

2711
03:12:54,800 --> 03:12:59,120
one key and value pair
so that we know for sure

2712
03:12:59,120 --> 03:13:31,720
that this code is working fine.

2713
03:13:31,720 --> 03:13:34,200
So you can like Windows 11.

2714
03:13:34,320 --> 03:13:37,320
So what is the difference to Windows ten?

2715
03:13:37,320 --> 03:13:42,160
Don't recommend it to upgrade to Windows
11 now because it has a lot of bugs.

2716
03:13:43,160 --> 03:13:45,240
I regret upgrading it,

2717
03:13:45,240 --> 03:13:47,320
but I also like the sound,

2718
03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:50,520
the feedback, the look and feel.

2719
03:13:50,520 --> 03:13:53,800
They are all modern,
but it has a lot of bugs.

2720
03:13:54,360 --> 03:13:57,840
Maybe next three months or so.

2721
03:13:57,840 --> 03:13:59,880
Once they fix it, then you guys can.

2722
03:14:00,280 --> 03:14:06,120
With the Windows 11.

2723
03:14:06,120 --> 03:14:07,320
Yes, so many bugs

2724
03:14:23,680 --> 03:14:24,400
in Windows

2725
03:14:24,400 --> 03:14:27,000
XP was good, Windows seven was bad,

2726
03:14:27,640 --> 03:14:32,760
then Windows eight was good
or Windows XP was good.

2727
03:14:33,440 --> 03:14:36,600
Seven was bad, right

2728
03:14:37,320 --> 03:14:39,400
then Vista was good,

2729
03:14:39,640 --> 03:14:44,040
eight was bad,
ten was good and now 11 is bad.

2730
03:14:44,600 --> 03:14:48,120
And then but with good

2731
03:14:50,360 --> 03:14:50,960
system

2732
03:14:52,320 --> 03:14:53,880
for doors.

2733
03:14:53,880 --> 03:14:56,280
Vista was good.

2734
03:14:56,280 --> 03:14:57,320
I mean. Yes.

2735
03:14:57,320 --> 03:15:00,560
No, not that bad.

2736
03:15:00,560 --> 03:15:06,400
I mean, all the windows from Microsoft,
they are bad, right?

2737
03:15:06,400 --> 03:15:13,880
I used it for a very short period of time.

2738
03:15:13,880 --> 03:15:15,120
Vista was not good.

2739
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:24,600
Horrible.

2740
03:15:24,600 --> 03:15:26,200
95 was good.

2741
03:15:26,200 --> 03:15:28,680
What about 92?

2742
03:15:28,680 --> 03:15:31,320
But I have used Windows 95 as well.

2743
03:15:31,640 --> 03:15:32,920
I am that old.

2744
03:15:32,920 --> 03:15:37,440
Oh My God, Windows 95 and 98.

2745
03:15:37,640 --> 03:15:39,600
You have used both of them.

2746
03:15:39,600 --> 03:15:52,440
3.1 DOS.

2747
03:15:52,440 --> 03:15:55,440
That means you guys
have not specified the proper, but

2748
03:15:56,400 --> 03:15:58,440
those who are who are getting this

2749
03:15:58,920 --> 03:16:02,480
system cannot find bought file specified.

2750
03:16:02,480 --> 03:16:03,800
It means to you.

2751
03:16:03,800 --> 03:16:05,040
I did it correctly.

2752
03:16:05,040 --> 03:16:09,880
No, it's not correct.

2753
03:16:09,880 --> 03:16:10,720
Let me run here.

2754
03:16:10,720 --> 03:16:13,080
Let's let's see if I can find my.

2755
03:16:13,840 --> 03:16:15,920
You see, I also get nothing else

2756
03:16:20,800 --> 03:16:23,760
configured on the properties.

2757
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:25,520
Let me check if I have some dirt out.

2758
03:16:25,520 --> 03:16:40,720
Not inside that file.

2759
03:16:40,720 --> 03:16:43,320
I don't have any dirt in here.

2760
03:16:44,320 --> 03:16:46,920
Let me call the dirt

2761
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:51,120
from here.

2762
03:16:51,120 --> 03:16:53,760
Control and see.

2763
03:16:53,880 --> 03:17:00,560
Control we and then control this.

2764
03:17:00,560 --> 03:17:04,680
And then if I run my demo

2765
03:17:05,840 --> 03:17:08,840
now, I shouldn't get invalid capital C

2766
03:17:09,760 --> 03:17:12,960
No, I did not have any data time.

2767
03:17:12,960 --> 03:17:17,400
India, any issues with Mac users?

2768
03:17:17,400 --> 03:17:20,640
It works for me, but for me
I got it correctly.

2769
03:17:20,640 --> 03:17:23,800
And so now you guys can read the files

2770
03:17:23,800 --> 03:17:26,320
from anywhere your computer,
you have nothing.

2771
03:17:27,480 --> 03:17:28,560
That's great to me.

2772
03:17:28,560 --> 03:17:31,320
You are different from others, right?

2773
03:17:31,320 --> 03:17:32,400
You get nothing.

2774
03:17:32,400 --> 03:17:35,040
Others gets simple values.

2775
03:17:35,040 --> 03:17:38,240
I don't know what to do.

2776
03:17:38,240 --> 03:17:40,080
Mac users are not working.

2777
03:17:40,080 --> 03:17:43,040
Please sell your Macs
if you don't know how to use

2778
03:17:44,280 --> 03:17:46,840
and buy the windows one.

2779
03:17:46,840 --> 03:17:49,080
Actually, we were thinking of suggesting

2780
03:17:49,640 --> 03:17:55,400
the operating systems to the to the
to the students before joining the course.

2781
03:17:55,920 --> 03:17:58,680
But then we thought
maybe it be too much buying

2782
03:17:59,840 --> 03:18:03,720
a Windows laptop just for this course

2783
03:18:03,960 --> 03:18:06,200
in a nicer.

2784
03:18:06,240 --> 03:18:14,320
Can you show me the complete data.

2785
03:18:14,320 --> 03:18:19,080
No those who are getting issues
please post the screenshot here.

2786
03:18:20,520 --> 03:18:23,640
Half of you can post in here,
half of you can post on this.

2787
03:18:23,640 --> 03:18:24,920
Fortunately

2788
03:18:28,320 --> 03:18:31,120
for you

2789
03:18:31,120 --> 03:18:37,040
it means you guys are not specifying
the correct but board certified.

2790
03:18:38,120 --> 03:18:40,440
Make sure this c is lowercase.

2791
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:42,480
It is.

2792
03:18:42,480 --> 03:18:44,360
Make sure the c is lowercase.

2793
03:18:44,360 --> 03:18:46,480
My c is lowercase.

2794
03:18:46,480 --> 03:18:48,000
You have specified uppercase.

2795
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:49,880
Maybe that's the issue.

2796
03:18:50,760 --> 03:18:52,800
And now you have not passed

2797
03:18:52,800 --> 03:18:58,640
to configuration
dot properties at the end.

2798
03:18:58,640 --> 03:19:00,040
Therefore you are getting the issue.

2799
03:19:00,040 --> 03:19:01,840
Silva What is your issue?

2800
03:19:01,840 --> 03:19:05,120
So I was having the same issue,
but I had to add or add.

2801
03:19:05,280 --> 03:19:08,200
The ESD is also good
if it is working fine,

2802
03:19:08,200 --> 03:19:17,040
but I will suggest to stick
with the properties extension.

2803
03:19:17,040 --> 03:19:20,320
I got the same same really tired

2804
03:19:20,320 --> 03:19:29,960
also having the same issue.

2805
03:19:29,960 --> 03:19:35,080
I think maybe the C should be capital
you'll get your c is not capital

2806
03:19:36,880 --> 03:19:38,640
result up.

2807
03:19:38,640 --> 03:19:41,520
Get configured properties

2808
03:19:42,280 --> 03:19:47,160
so you guys can let me check

2809
03:19:47,160 --> 03:19:52,600
if it works.

2810
03:19:52,600 --> 03:19:54,840
I think it does not work
outside of intelligence,

2811
03:19:55,800 --> 03:20:01,200
but still.

2812
03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:04,880
So just copy this path
that you have written the Windows user

2813
03:20:05,560 --> 03:20:10,400
and inside this address bar
based with that fire that that part,

2814
03:20:10,520 --> 03:20:13,920
if that file opens,
that means you have specified the correct.

2815
03:20:14,640 --> 03:20:17,760
But if that does not open,
that means there is an issue

2816
03:20:17,760 --> 03:20:22,240
with the default.

2817
03:20:22,240 --> 03:20:27,160
It was configured, configured
or properties not to de to to extensions.

2818
03:20:27,400 --> 03:20:30,320
No remove and remove from end

2819
03:20:45,040 --> 03:20:46,880
with the door to exterior works.

2820
03:20:46,880 --> 03:20:49,080
Otherwise it feels

2821
03:20:49,680 --> 03:20:51,920
mind does not work without load.

2822
03:20:51,960 --> 03:21:00,120
The extreme.

2823
03:21:00,120 --> 03:21:00,440
Okay.

2824
03:21:00,440 --> 03:21:03,240
So those who are having issues

2825
03:21:04,760 --> 03:21:06,960
working outside of the intelligence.

2826
03:21:08,080 --> 03:21:10,440
So let's not go outside
of the intelligence.

2827
03:21:10,560 --> 03:21:14,360
Maybe I was too excited to show you
how to read the file from anywhere.

2828
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:16,000
Let's forget it.

2829
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:17,760
I didn't show anything.

2830
03:21:17,760 --> 03:21:19,640
This tool does not exist

2831
03:21:20,880 --> 03:21:22,680
for whatever reason, we can't create

2832
03:21:22,680 --> 03:21:25,280
or properties files outside of the Intel

2833
03:21:27,160 --> 03:21:29,000
or PowerShell.

2834
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:30,480
No, we can.

2835
03:21:30,480 --> 03:21:33,280
If. If I learn, if you allow.

2836
03:21:33,520 --> 03:21:36,640
So for example, on my

2837
03:21:36,640 --> 03:21:40,400
Windows machine
I have allowed to edit the extensions.

2838
03:21:40,880 --> 03:21:43,480
If you guys don't allow to edit
the extension,

2839
03:21:43,480 --> 03:21:51,360
I think the setting is available
somewhere in here.

2840
03:21:51,360 --> 03:21:53,840
You see this file name extensions.

2841
03:21:55,080 --> 03:21:56,840
I don't remember where it should be

2842
03:21:56,840 --> 03:21:59,360
on Windows ten, but there is this setting.

2843
03:21:59,880 --> 03:22:01,400
Yes, Windows by default.

2844
03:22:01,400 --> 03:22:04,640
It hides the extension.

2845
03:22:04,800 --> 03:22:06,400
You have to enable this extension

2846
03:22:06,400 --> 03:22:08,320
and then it will work

2847
03:22:15,120 --> 03:22:18,200
those so for which it is working with DOT

2848
03:22:18,720 --> 03:22:20,960
the it is because of this reason

2849
03:22:25,240 --> 03:22:27,480
as good of a language file

2850
03:22:27,640 --> 03:22:33,080
no us God from which files
we can get in for using method.

2851
03:22:33,360 --> 03:22:36,320
Oh. As you can see,
we are getting the info from properties,

2852
03:22:36,320 --> 03:22:37,640
files and text files.

2853
03:22:37,640 --> 03:22:45,960
Now it works.

2854
03:22:45,960 --> 03:22:48,640
Confident dot property is not pages

2855
03:22:49,200 --> 03:22:53,480
until you have pages file
and that is just copy and paste my file.

2856
03:22:54,240 --> 03:22:55,520
Okay. Let's let's.

2857
03:22:55,520 --> 03:22:59,520
Let's not worry too much about this
because we will be doing the same

2858
03:22:59,760 --> 03:23:02,200
the Excel file as well.

2859
03:23:02,800 --> 03:23:03,520
Okay.

2860
03:23:04,080 --> 03:23:06,840
So whatever is working for you is fine

2861
03:23:06,840 --> 03:23:14,040
for now.

2862
03:23:14,040 --> 03:23:19,440
Is file is like creating
a new folder on gnome.

2863
03:23:19,440 --> 03:23:24,400
It's actually something different.

2864
03:23:24,400 --> 03:23:26,040
Question Can we say a file

2865
03:23:26,040 --> 03:23:29,880
name with any name, but in intelligible
it must right on Filbert properties.

2866
03:23:29,880 --> 03:23:32,760
No, no.
We should write the same name in here as.

2867
03:23:32,760 --> 03:23:34,840
But if you are

2868
03:23:34,840 --> 03:23:38,600
giving a name Donald Trump to your file,
you should write Donald Trump.

2869
03:23:38,600 --> 03:23:39,000
Can you

2870
03:23:39,960 --> 03:23:43,200
not config dot properties Otherwise
how would your job.

2871
03:23:43,200 --> 03:23:46,520
I know that it has to find
the Donald Trump or configured

2872
03:23:46,560 --> 03:24:03,080
properties. Yes,

2873
03:24:04,680 --> 03:24:11,280
I cannot say that, but I.

2874
03:24:11,280 --> 03:24:12,600
Angela knows everything.

2875
03:24:12,600 --> 03:24:16,720
So guys, are you guys good? Yes.

2876
03:24:16,720 --> 03:24:18,600
I assume you guys are good.

2877
03:24:18,600 --> 03:24:21,960
Let's move forward.

2878
03:24:21,960 --> 03:24:24,840
So this is how we

2879
03:24:24,840 --> 03:24:26,880
will read the data from the file.

2880
03:24:26,920 --> 03:24:31,880
Let's now learn how to create new files.

2881
03:24:31,880 --> 03:24:32,240
Okay.

2882
03:24:32,920 --> 03:24:38,880
Let's learn how to create new files.

2883
03:24:38,880 --> 03:24:39,800
Not good.

2884
03:24:39,800 --> 03:24:43,400
Not me.

2885
03:24:43,400 --> 03:24:44,000
Okay.

2886
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,440
We will do this experiment
of creating the file

2887
03:24:46,440 --> 03:24:49,080
from our side of the integrity
using the Excel files.

2888
03:24:49,440 --> 03:24:50,400
Okay, let's.

2889
03:24:50,400 --> 03:24:53,960
Let's forget about this for now

2890
03:24:57,240 --> 03:24:57,920
you'll get

2891
03:24:57,920 --> 03:25:00,880
is working because you have not enabled
the extension.

2892
03:25:01,600 --> 03:25:04,720
I will show you how to do that.

2893
03:25:04,800 --> 03:25:07,120
How to record to inside,

2894
03:25:07,280 --> 03:25:09,400
how to record inside of the file.

2895
03:25:10,240 --> 03:25:12,280
Out to the code. What do you want? Record.

2896
03:25:12,280 --> 03:25:16,080
So we are already recording.

2897
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:18,400
So let's create a new

2898
03:25:19,560 --> 03:25:25,080
Java class.

2899
03:25:25,080 --> 03:25:26,520
Add info to the file.

2900
03:25:26,520 --> 03:25:31,280
That's what I am teaching you now.

2901
03:25:31,280 --> 03:25:34,640
So this is how we read the data
from existing files.

2902
03:25:34,680 --> 03:25:38,920
Now let's understand
how we can create these files

2903
03:25:38,920 --> 03:25:42,240
using programing. Oh,

2904
03:25:44,000 --> 03:25:46,040
yes, yes, I know,

2905
03:25:46,040 --> 03:25:49,160
but let's not go this

2906
03:25:49,960 --> 03:25:55,280
is so

2907
03:25:56,760 --> 03:26:00,240
if I have to create a file again,
I need to first

2908
03:26:01,080 --> 03:26:04,920
find folder or that location
where I want to create that file.

2909
03:26:05,040 --> 03:26:05,880
Right.

2910
03:26:06,120 --> 03:26:09,000
So let's create a file inside

2911
03:26:09,000 --> 03:26:14,280
this are the files folder.

2912
03:26:14,280 --> 03:26:17,120
So let me copy the path

2913
03:26:20,240 --> 03:26:22,760
from previous demo

2914
03:26:23,400 --> 03:26:27,120
or the part from the Windows machine.

2915
03:26:27,120 --> 03:26:30,320
So let's look and copy this one

2916
03:26:30,320 --> 03:26:36,680
from demo one, not from demo two.

2917
03:26:36,680 --> 03:26:40,120
So I want to create a file inside

2918
03:26:40,120 --> 03:26:42,640
this files directory

2919
03:26:43,560 --> 03:26:49,800
and I want to name that file.

2920
03:26:49,800 --> 03:26:52,200
Maybe Trump dot properties.

2921
03:26:52,240 --> 03:27:06,320
Okay, so now

2922
03:27:06,880 --> 03:27:10,800
I have this path in here right?

2923
03:27:10,800 --> 03:27:17,000
The next thing, the next thing that I need

2924
03:27:18,880 --> 03:27:22,480
is D So now is the concern of

2925
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:25,480
anyone facing bad connection issues

2926
03:27:25,480 --> 03:27:41,440
or only me?

2927
03:27:41,440 --> 03:27:44,880
Actually, in the bill
we intentionally did this

2928
03:27:46,080 --> 03:27:49,520
because the.

2929
03:27:49,520 --> 03:27:50,400
Okay,

2930
03:27:51,320 --> 03:27:53,840
let me let me try to be

2931
03:27:53,840 --> 03:27:57,000
spelling problem actually here

2932
03:27:57,000 --> 03:27:59,240
is how the

2933
03:28:00,600 --> 03:28:03,040
prime minister of India.

2934
03:28:03,040 --> 03:28:06,000
This is how it pronounces here.

2935
03:28:06,000 --> 03:28:09,800
So I have a part. Okay

2936
03:28:11,240 --> 03:28:14,520
And then now I need to

2937
03:28:15,600 --> 03:28:19,640
go inside this file to detect tree and

2938
03:28:20,880 --> 03:28:22,480
create this files. Right.

2939
03:28:22,480 --> 03:28:24,720
So what I will do, I will say

2940
03:28:27,680 --> 03:28:32,360
properties, properties,

2941
03:28:32,400 --> 03:28:37,120
new properties,

2942
03:28:37,120 --> 03:28:40,360
and I will say maybe properties dot

2943
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:43,360
but. Right.

2944
03:28:43,360 --> 03:28:46,080
Do you guys remember that would matter.

2945
03:28:46,080 --> 03:28:49,040
Same as maps support may be

2946
03:28:52,720 --> 03:28:54,800
user name as

2947
03:28:57,760 --> 03:29:00,360
a single 1 to 3

2948
03:29:01,440 --> 03:29:04,200
and maybe

2949
03:29:04,720 --> 03:29:07,920
put a password

2950
03:29:11,360 --> 03:29:13,520
as false.

2951
03:29:13,560 --> 03:29:17,520
One, two three.

2952
03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:17,760
Okay.

2953
03:29:20,400 --> 03:29:22,440
So I have a but

2954
03:29:22,440 --> 03:29:25,280
I am creating the object of this

2955
03:29:25,440 --> 03:29:27,520
special properties.

2956
03:29:28,600 --> 03:29:33,120
Then on that object
I am putting two fields in here right

2957
03:29:34,560 --> 03:29:35,760
now. The next thing.

2958
03:29:35,760 --> 03:29:39,080
So when we have to read the data
from a file,

2959
03:29:39,840 --> 03:29:43,920
we use the file import state.

2960
03:29:44,920 --> 03:29:47,400
But when we have to write the data

2961
03:29:47,400 --> 03:29:50,560
we use as different class
that is called file

2962
03:29:51,880 --> 03:29:59,280
output scheme.

2963
03:29:59,280 --> 03:30:01,560
And again, we passed default in here

2964
03:30:04,120 --> 03:30:05,160
and same again.

2965
03:30:05,160 --> 03:30:06,480
I will be getting an error.

2966
03:30:06,480 --> 03:30:09,720
So let me click on add
exception to the metadata,

2967
03:30:10,240 --> 03:30:26,320
letting me know what you guys are done
by putting this code up.

2968
03:30:28,320 --> 03:30:32,480
So now if I want to create a file
right now, I only have one file in here.

2969
03:30:32,760 --> 03:30:36,400
So now I will say a property is not

2970
03:30:39,600 --> 03:30:40,760
store

2971
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:44,760
and I will pause file, output frame.

2972
03:30:44,760 --> 03:30:49,400
And as you guys put comments in the gear
table, we can also put comments in here

2973
03:30:52,800 --> 03:30:54,960
creating in new file and maybe.

2974
03:30:55,960 --> 03:30:58,520
Yeah, and then I will be getting an error

2975
03:30:58,520 --> 03:31:02,160
and I have to be

2976
03:31:02,160 --> 03:31:04,720
method signature.

2977
03:31:04,960 --> 03:31:10,760
So now if I execute this code in new file
inside

2978
03:31:10,920 --> 03:31:13,520
directory should be created with this name

2979
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:24,440
and it should have these two fields.

2980
03:31:24,440 --> 03:31:26,760
So I see my file in here.

2981
03:31:26,760 --> 03:31:32,160
Now, if I open that file,
I see the comments on the first line,

2982
03:31:33,280 --> 03:31:36,760
then I see the date and time by default,

2983
03:31:36,760 --> 03:31:39,920
and then I see my fields in here.

2984
03:31:40,040 --> 03:31:48,000
Do you guys see the
you see new files are being created.

2985
03:31:48,000 --> 03:31:52,200
So this is how we read and write?

2986
03:31:52,200 --> 03:31:53,840
Yes. Let me show you. Okay.

2987
03:31:57,480 --> 03:31:59,520
Why is the file orange?

2988
03:31:59,840 --> 03:32:02,560
Because it is not added to the GitHub.

2989
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:07,320
I installed the GitHub I have configured
to get out my intelligence.

2990
03:32:08,040 --> 03:32:10,560
So you remember before we can use

2991
03:32:10,560 --> 03:32:13,440
anything in the gate,
we have to add that to the gate.

2992
03:32:13,640 --> 03:32:18,560
So if I added it will change it.

2993
03:32:18,560 --> 03:32:20,600
Now it is the real world application.

2994
03:32:21,240 --> 03:32:24,240
You guys will learn about real world
applications

2995
03:32:24,240 --> 03:32:28,080
when you will be building the frameworks

2996
03:32:28,920 --> 03:32:33,960
on Macintosh properties are not needed.

2997
03:32:33,960 --> 03:32:38,160
Can you go back?

2998
03:32:38,160 --> 03:32:59,160
Let me know if you guys are facing
any errors or issues.

2999
03:32:59,160 --> 03:33:00,800
No one is fixing any issues.

3000
03:33:00,800 --> 03:33:06,840
All is working fine.

3001
03:33:06,840 --> 03:33:17,360
That's great.

3002
03:33:17,360 --> 03:33:20,000
Alexa, you are using file input steam.

3003
03:33:20,000 --> 03:33:23,680
We have to use file output stream
this time because we are

3004
03:33:24,840 --> 03:33:32,840
only writing the that at this time.

3005
03:33:32,840 --> 03:33:37,760
And that's why you are having issues.

3006
03:33:37,760 --> 03:33:40,080
What will happen when we store it?

3007
03:33:40,440 --> 03:33:43,560
When we started this
then the file is created in here

3008
03:33:50,120 --> 03:33:52,520
where we can see the file is created.

3009
03:33:52,760 --> 03:33:54,840
You will see the file on this part.

3010
03:33:54,840 --> 03:34:03,240
The that you guys have specified in here.

3011
03:34:03,240 --> 03:34:05,800
I stored the user name first button.

3012
03:34:05,800 --> 03:34:07,400
The file password is first.

3013
03:34:07,400 --> 03:34:12,000
It's because you remember that hash table
map is also

3014
03:34:12,000 --> 03:34:18,200
it does not care
about the order of insertion.

3015
03:34:18,960 --> 03:34:21,800
So that's why you guys can see sometimes
password,

3016
03:34:21,800 --> 03:34:24,000
sometimes you name

3017
03:34:36,720 --> 03:34:44,360
a nice place post in this corner.

3018
03:34:45,120 --> 03:34:52,840
What did I miss?

3019
03:34:52,840 --> 03:34:56,680
Maryam you have to add this froze

3020
03:34:56,680 --> 03:35:00,600
and an Iowa exception in here

3021
03:36:04,840 --> 03:36:09,680
and we do any operation and the result
will be stored inside of the file. Yes.

3022
03:36:09,680 --> 03:36:17,280
Any your ideal life

3023
03:36:17,280 --> 03:36:28,360
Christmas tree.

3024
03:36:28,360 --> 03:36:30,720
Then you open the remote to on the decide.

3025
03:36:30,720 --> 03:36:42,880
Yep. For this class is easy, right?

3026
03:36:42,920 --> 03:36:43,240
Nice.

3027
03:36:45,240 --> 03:36:47,440
And it's kind of more interesting

3028
03:36:49,800 --> 03:36:54,640
than the other dialog classes.

3029
03:36:54,640 --> 03:37:06,720
Very easy.

3030
03:37:06,720 --> 03:37:15,800
Is there anyone else
who is still facing issues?

3031
03:37:15,800 --> 03:37:19,480
Make sure to show me

3032
03:37:19,480 --> 03:37:22,560
the screenshot.

3033
03:37:22,560 --> 03:37:24,840
It's fine. It's fine.

3034
03:37:25,640 --> 03:37:27,920
The code should be demo three.

3035
03:37:27,920 --> 03:37:31,880
Yes, right now
we are working on demo three.

3036
03:37:31,880 --> 03:37:34,280
This is the demo three. No.

3037
03:37:34,280 --> 03:37:34,800
Oh yes.

3038
03:37:34,800 --> 03:37:40,320
This 140.

3039
03:37:40,320 --> 03:38:08,280
I hope it's still readable.

3040
03:38:08,280 --> 03:38:09,040
Okay.

3041
03:38:09,040 --> 03:38:10,360
No issues

3042
03:38:13,080 --> 03:38:13,520
guys.

3043
03:38:13,520 --> 03:38:15,920
Is there anything that you guys don't
understand?

3044
03:38:16,000 --> 03:38:17,880
The code that I have written.

3045
03:38:17,880 --> 03:38:20,760
Please go to this code and let me know
if you guys don't understand

3046
03:38:20,760 --> 03:38:42,360
any of the line what that line is going.

3047
03:38:42,360 --> 03:38:44,640
You guys don't need to memorize
the syntax.

3048
03:38:44,920 --> 03:38:48,600
Just write how to read the data
from a properties file on Google

3049
03:38:48,960 --> 03:38:51,760
or just write how to write to the data
to the properties file.

3050
03:38:52,320 --> 03:38:56,040
And if you have understood the concepts,
hopefully you will be able

3051
03:38:56,040 --> 03:38:57,560
to successfully create that

3052
03:38:58,920 --> 03:39:00,440
program to read.

3053
03:39:00,440 --> 03:39:09,360
All right.

3054
03:39:09,360 --> 03:39:10,160
Yes. Monthly.

3055
03:39:10,160 --> 03:39:11,480
It looks good. Yes.

3056
03:39:11,480 --> 03:39:13,560
You have created this object, this one.

3057
03:39:13,800 --> 03:39:15,920
Yes. Write the rest of the code like this

3058
03:39:16,880 --> 03:39:19,920
and the file should be created

3059
03:39:30,240 --> 03:39:32,640
or allowed for seamless file
in first name.

3060
03:39:32,640 --> 03:39:35,800
So you guys can think of it like you see

3061
03:39:35,800 --> 03:39:42,120
how water flows in our into our houses
and how it flows out from our houses

3062
03:39:42,160 --> 03:39:45,800
from the sink.
If you have to read the data

3063
03:39:45,800 --> 03:39:49,800
inside your program,
we use the file input stream.

3064
03:39:50,320 --> 03:39:54,640
If you have to write the data
out of your Java program, you

3065
03:39:54,880 --> 03:39:57,600
you use the file output stream.

3066
03:39:59,080 --> 03:40:01,440
Yes. Putting out information,
something like

3067
03:40:21,360 --> 03:40:22,160
and I moved to

3068
03:40:22,160 --> 03:40:29,360
the next demo.

3069
03:40:29,360 --> 03:40:32,800
So next actually, let's create a utility

3070
03:40:34,360 --> 03:40:37,400
utility class
because you guys will be needing

3071
03:40:37,400 --> 03:40:43,320
these classes and meters inside
your inside your frameworks.

3072
03:40:43,800 --> 03:40:45,760
So go with this.

3073
03:40:45,760 --> 03:40:47,640
Let's go inside to see what is

3074
03:40:49,560 --> 03:40:52,440
and let's create

3075
03:40:54,200 --> 03:40:57,200
a new class and let's call it

3076
03:40:57,200 --> 03:40:59,240
file utils.

3077
03:40:59,640 --> 03:41:03,120
Okay?

3078
03:41:03,120 --> 03:41:06,440
Let me know what you guys,
you guys all have this utils package,

3079
03:41:06,440 --> 03:41:12,960
right?

3080
03:41:12,960 --> 03:41:15,560
Nope. Please
create one. Please create one.

3081
03:41:15,960 --> 03:41:17,400
It will be needed.

3082
03:41:17,400 --> 03:41:20,680
You guys will needed
needing it in your projects.

3083
03:41:21,960 --> 03:41:24,600
So the useful methods
that we will be learning,

3084
03:41:24,600 --> 03:41:26,520
I will be putting all those matters
in your code.

3085
03:41:26,520 --> 03:41:28,680
We overwrite the file of the same name.

3086
03:41:28,680 --> 03:41:31,520
Or would it resulting in a note
if I execute.

3087
03:41:31,520 --> 03:41:37,320
Let's say for example, if I re execute
this code, they'll say if I re execute

3088
03:41:37,320 --> 03:41:42,720
the score, the file will be overwritten,
it will be replaced.

3089
03:41:43,080 --> 03:41:55,680
We will not be getting an error.

3090
03:41:55,680 --> 03:41:58,680
There is one more thing, guys,
that I want to

3091
03:41:58,680 --> 03:42:01,840
show you.

3092
03:42:01,840 --> 03:42:02,920
Let's say

3093
03:42:04,360 --> 03:42:08,160
I have opened this file right?

3094
03:42:08,160 --> 03:42:09,760
This Excel file.

3095
03:42:09,760 --> 03:42:13,160
If this file is opened and if I try

3096
03:42:16,560 --> 03:42:19,360
to delete this, I get this add up.

3097
03:42:20,720 --> 03:42:21,160
Right?

3098
03:42:21,160 --> 03:42:24,200
It says action can't be completed

3099
03:42:24,200 --> 03:42:30,320
because file is open in the spreadsheet,
which means

3100
03:42:31,120 --> 03:42:33,480
if a program is

3101
03:42:33,480 --> 03:42:36,920
using a file on our operating system. So

3102
03:42:36,920 --> 03:42:41,920
right now we are dealing with the entities
which outside of our gala programs.

3103
03:42:42,920 --> 03:42:45,600
So as a responsible programmer,

3104
03:42:45,600 --> 03:42:48,600
when we are reading some data
from our files

3105
03:42:48,600 --> 03:42:51,360
or when we are writing the data
from our files,

3106
03:42:51,960 --> 03:42:54,840
we should also close those files.

3107
03:42:55,160 --> 03:42:58,280
Right now we are not writing any code
to close those files.

3108
03:42:58,680 --> 03:43:03,560
So for the proper way, a good programmer,
this is how it will do so.

3109
03:43:03,560 --> 03:43:04,600
It will also

3110
03:43:05,560 --> 03:43:07,560
close that file

3111
03:43:07,560 --> 03:43:10,200
once it is done
reading or writing the data.

3112
03:43:11,080 --> 03:43:14,920
We should also close that file
so that the other programs

3113
03:43:14,920 --> 03:43:19,120
on our computer, they can also interact
with that file freely.

3114
03:43:19,120 --> 03:43:23,760
If we don't close this file
and if our program is in execution,

3115
03:43:24,200 --> 03:43:27,360
no one else will be able to interact
with that file.

3116
03:43:28,120 --> 03:43:31,760
So should also write this file output
standard clause

3117
03:43:32,400 --> 03:43:36,560
once we are done writing the data
and let me do it in here

3118
03:43:36,560 --> 03:43:40,680
as well.

3119
03:43:40,680 --> 03:43:43,000
While import stream dot clause

3120
03:43:45,240 --> 03:43:47,360
and in here is

3121
03:43:48,280 --> 03:43:50,760
why I am writing this file in perfect
game,

3122
03:43:50,760 --> 03:43:54,640
not clause.

3123
03:43:54,640 --> 03:43:57,240
Is this utils or directory
or regular packet.

3124
03:43:57,240 --> 03:44:02,040
Instead I go to regular package.

3125
03:44:02,040 --> 03:44:11,320
It's the regular package.

3126
03:44:11,320 --> 03:44:14,440
All you guys done
creating this file utils class

3127
03:44:15,720 --> 03:44:18,320
when you call my name good programmer.

3128
03:44:18,320 --> 03:44:33,160
You're making me very happy.

3129
03:44:33,160 --> 03:44:35,880
So let's create a static method in here

3130
03:44:36,200 --> 03:44:39,080
to read the properties file.

3131
03:44:39,440 --> 03:44:42,880
So next time we will not be writing
these five lines of code.

3132
03:44:43,080 --> 03:44:46,720
We will write a method and every time,
if we have to read the data,

3133
03:44:47,120 --> 03:44:51,440
we will just be calling that method right?

3134
03:44:51,440 --> 03:44:56,720
I know how to do it again.

3135
03:44:56,720 --> 03:45:00,040
Was like how method the config

3136
03:45:00,040 --> 03:45:03,640
file properties for Sebastian.

3137
03:45:03,640 --> 03:45:06,400
Can you rephrase your question

3138
03:45:20,640 --> 03:45:22,800
for creating the util file?

3139
03:45:22,800 --> 03:45:29,600
Or if simply a double class?

3140
03:45:29,600 --> 03:45:32,880
Yes, it will be same as we have been using

3141
03:45:32,880 --> 03:45:36,240
the other methods.

3142
03:45:36,240 --> 03:45:38,640
So most of the time guys, the

3143
03:45:39,680 --> 03:45:43,200
config files,
they will be stored inside your projects.

3144
03:45:43,920 --> 03:45:46,440
Yes. Now we are kind of creating a library

3145
03:45:47,600 --> 03:45:48,840
so that we don't have to

3146
03:45:48,840 --> 03:45:55,360
write the code again and again.

3147
03:45:55,360 --> 03:46:00,920
I think in your project for
you guys will be calling it Configurator.

3148
03:46:01,080 --> 03:46:04,840
I don't know, so

3149
03:46:04,840 --> 03:46:11,440
let's call it.

3150
03:46:11,440 --> 03:46:14,240
Let me actually rename this
to Configurator

3151
03:46:14,240 --> 03:46:18,240
because it will be same as off
your it be easier for you.

3152
03:46:18,680 --> 03:46:20,520
So let's call it

3153
03:46:21,440 --> 03:46:23,440
config reader.

3154
03:46:24,200 --> 03:46:24,840
Okay.

3155
03:46:24,960 --> 03:46:28,080
So that it can match your the future work.

3156
03:46:28,440 --> 03:46:30,480
In the future
you guys will be creating the

3157
03:46:35,480 --> 03:46:37,720
you guys will be creating your projects

3158
03:46:37,720 --> 03:46:42,440
and in that project you guys will be
using these terminologies so that you can

3159
03:46:42,760 --> 03:46:46,040
it forward, you can straight away
use your files that you are creating.

3160
03:46:46,040 --> 03:46:48,120
So let's look for the enemy
to configurator

3161
03:46:50,320 --> 03:46:53,120
and let's write a method

3162
03:46:55,960 --> 03:46:58,480
the public

3163
03:46:59,640 --> 03:47:00,600
static

3164
03:47:03,520 --> 03:47:04,920
string

3165
03:47:05,640 --> 03:47:07,920
and it will return us

3166
03:47:08,200 --> 03:47:11,600
the value of that property

3167
03:47:11,600 --> 03:47:14,160
that we be passing

3168
03:47:21,480 --> 03:47:26,400
right?

3169
03:47:26,400 --> 03:47:28,200
So we will be needing it.

3170
03:47:28,200 --> 03:47:33,280
But right.

3171
03:47:33,280 --> 03:47:40,320
And then we will be needing a key, right?

3172
03:47:40,320 --> 03:47:46,080
Because all the data is stored
in the form of keys and values.

3173
03:47:46,080 --> 03:47:49,640
And once we have the part and the key,

3174
03:47:50,800 --> 03:47:52,120
what do we need that next?

3175
03:47:52,120 --> 03:47:52,920
Guys,

3176
03:47:54,040 --> 03:47:56,760
if I have to read the data, a config file

3177
03:47:57,480 --> 03:47:59,600
and I have bought and the key,

3178
03:48:01,000 --> 03:48:05,400
what should I do next?

3179
03:48:05,400 --> 03:48:08,080
The connection, the file input scheme.

3180
03:48:08,080 --> 03:48:08,840
Right.

3181
03:48:09,200 --> 03:48:11,120
So file

3182
03:48:12,840 --> 03:48:15,000
import stream

3183
03:48:15,240 --> 03:48:16,560
file input stream.

3184
03:48:16,560 --> 03:48:18,880
The important new

3185
03:48:19,080 --> 03:48:22,680
file input stream and I pass the box

3186
03:48:24,200 --> 03:48:25,200
in here

3187
03:48:29,360 --> 03:48:31,680
and for now

3188
03:48:35,240 --> 03:48:37,320
click on this more options button

3189
03:48:38,640 --> 03:48:40,320
and this time click on this.

3190
03:48:40,320 --> 03:48:42,320
Surround with the catch block.

3191
03:48:42,880 --> 03:48:46,080
Later on I will tell you what does this

3192
03:48:47,640 --> 03:48:48,320
catch blocks

3193
03:48:48,320 --> 03:48:52,360
me okay.

3194
03:48:52,360 --> 03:48:55,000
Or is it confusing, guys?

3195
03:48:55,000 --> 03:48:56,160
It is confusing you.

3196
03:48:56,160 --> 03:48:57,800
What is this try what is this?

3197
03:48:57,800 --> 03:49:01,160
Cache and all that

3198
03:49:05,520 --> 03:49:09,040
you guys don't need to worry
about Next classes about this, right?

3199
03:49:09,040 --> 03:49:10,480
Catch blocks

3200
03:49:14,080 --> 03:49:16,320
is just a type of block.

3201
03:49:16,320 --> 03:49:19,680
Okay. All right.

3202
03:49:19,800 --> 03:49:22,680
So come here.

3203
03:49:22,680 --> 03:49:25,480
Inside the file performed.

3204
03:49:25,480 --> 03:49:28,920
The next thing is.

3205
03:49:28,920 --> 03:49:30,720
Okay, so we have the file. Interesting.

3206
03:49:30,720 --> 03:49:41,360
What do we need next, guys,
I need to create the object. Try.

3207
03:49:41,400 --> 03:49:45,040
So property is property

3208
03:49:45,080 --> 03:49:48,320
is equal to nil property.

3209
03:49:48,360 --> 03:49:51,200
So right.

3210
03:49:51,200 --> 03:49:54,600
And then properties.

3211
03:49:54,600 --> 03:49:58,080
Dot Lord and I need to pass

3212
03:49:58,080 --> 03:50:01,200
the file file input, string.

3213
03:50:01,200 --> 03:50:03,200
What is this shortcut fight. Right.

3214
03:50:03,200 --> 03:50:08,280
So now if you hover your mouse over
the error, it will show you two options.

3215
03:50:08,440 --> 03:50:10,560
Click on more.

3216
03:50:10,560 --> 03:50:12,720
Yes, it is like and if conditions or one

3217
03:50:15,960 --> 03:50:17,560
and then you can select

3218
03:50:17,560 --> 03:50:20,320
replace file
found with the more generic one.

3219
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:21,560
Okay.

3220
03:50:21,640 --> 03:50:25,680
Basically
you can select any of these a first option

3221
03:50:25,680 --> 03:50:32,840
or the third option.

3222
03:50:32,840 --> 03:50:36,400
So I have loaded the ease

3223
03:50:36,400 --> 03:50:39,680
and value pairs inside
this property is object.

3224
03:50:40,200 --> 03:50:42,840
And how can I get the object

3225
03:50:42,840 --> 03:50:45,320
from this properties object?

3226
03:50:46,480 --> 03:50:49,680
I can say from is dark act

3227
03:50:50,560 --> 03:50:53,880
and I pass the key in here.

3228
03:50:53,880 --> 03:50:54,600
Right.

3229
03:50:54,880 --> 03:50:58,440
And then if I return

3230
03:51:00,720 --> 03:51:02,920
actually let me you will.

3231
03:51:02,960 --> 03:51:05,160
You will be getting an error.

3232
03:51:05,160 --> 03:51:09,120
So instead of doing let's

3233
03:51:10,920 --> 03:51:16,280
store
I will explain later why we are going.

3234
03:51:16,280 --> 03:51:20,360
Let's declare a value
setting a variable value in here.

3235
03:51:20,840 --> 03:51:23,520
Let's initialize it with

3236
03:51:23,520 --> 03:51:25,600
maybe null or anything.

3237
03:51:25,600 --> 03:51:31,080
You can slide it with anything.

3238
03:51:31,080 --> 03:51:32,960
How we fix load, add a

3239
03:51:34,920 --> 03:51:36,520
directory. Let

3240
03:51:36,720 --> 03:51:37,920
let's not do this.

3241
03:51:37,920 --> 03:51:40,680
I think it will confuse you.

3242
03:51:40,680 --> 03:51:41,520
Just delete that.

3243
03:51:41,520 --> 03:51:44,640
Try get block and

3244
03:51:44,920 --> 03:51:46,480
utilities

3245
03:51:46,720 --> 03:51:49,200
add method add to method signature.

3246
03:51:50,640 --> 03:52:05,440
Okay.

3247
03:52:05,440 --> 03:52:10,120
So this good it actually returns

3248
03:52:10,160 --> 03:52:13,080
the end object

3249
03:52:13,360 --> 03:52:17,840
if you want to get a string
you can use get property instead of get.

3250
03:52:19,040 --> 03:52:20,680
So use this approach.

3251
03:52:20,680 --> 03:52:22,960
I think that a better approach
will confuse you.

3252
03:52:22,960 --> 03:52:27,240
For now, I will teach you about that
by catch block and then we will use those.

3253
03:52:27,320 --> 03:52:27,560
Then.

3254
03:52:27,560 --> 03:52:30,960
Then we will change these methods to use
try and get blocks.

3255
03:52:32,160 --> 03:52:34,320
I think it's more simple and easy to read

3256
03:52:36,840 --> 03:52:37,320
it's easy.

3257
03:52:37,320 --> 03:52:40,480
Write this same thing, file in for same.

3258
03:52:40,480 --> 03:52:44,280
We are passing the path
then properties object.

3259
03:52:44,280 --> 03:52:47,280
We are creating object
and loading the properties and passing

3260
03:52:47,280 --> 03:52:50,360
the keys that will return as the value
and we are returning it

3261
03:52:50,360 --> 03:53:08,360
from this method.

3262
03:53:08,360 --> 03:53:18,800
Let me know once you guys are done typing
this code.

3263
03:53:18,800 --> 03:53:21,040
Can we write commands? Yes.

3264
03:53:21,080 --> 03:53:23,280
They they are the same.

3265
03:53:23,280 --> 03:53:24,200
Unless they are same.

3266
03:53:24,200 --> 03:53:32,160
For example, opening that

3267
03:53:32,160 --> 03:53:38,560
file,

3268
03:53:38,560 --> 03:53:41,800
creating the object of

3269
03:53:45,000 --> 03:53:47,480
properties class

3270
03:53:51,400 --> 03:53:56,640
loading, loading

3271
03:53:56,880 --> 03:54:01,240
all the property from that

3272
03:54:02,920 --> 03:54:04,920
file inside,

3273
03:54:06,280 --> 03:54:08,560
inside the

3274
03:54:09,360 --> 03:54:12,840
properties object

3275
03:54:24,720 --> 03:54:27,480
inverting the

3276
03:54:27,480 --> 03:54:29,880
value for

3277
03:54:29,880 --> 03:54:32,000
messy quick

3278
03:54:35,720 --> 03:54:38,840
e and

3279
03:54:38,840 --> 03:54:42,040
returning it.

3280
03:54:42,040 --> 03:54:44,560
So is it good now

3281
03:54:47,280 --> 03:54:47,640
the mean

3282
03:54:47,640 --> 03:54:59,280
you are getting any errors,

3283
03:54:59,280 --> 03:55:02,400
make sure that the key is in lowercase.

3284
03:55:02,720 --> 03:55:07,280
I think it's in uppercase online
then and on line 15

3285
03:55:07,280 --> 03:55:13,920
you are specifying in lowercase.

3286
03:55:13,920 --> 03:55:14,680
Okay.

3287
03:55:15,520 --> 03:55:20,240
So do you guys done typing this code

3288
03:55:29,680 --> 03:55:32,320
in any or remove that as well.

3289
03:55:33,360 --> 03:55:57,960
Make sure the code looks the same as mine.

3290
03:55:57,960 --> 03:56:01,040
That is. Let's do one more thing.

3291
03:56:01,040 --> 03:56:05,640
If someone is not providing this part

3292
03:56:06,720 --> 03:56:09,680
to this config dot properties,

3293
03:56:10,320 --> 03:56:13,680
let's by default I want to use this part.

3294
03:56:13,720 --> 03:56:16,680
So what should I do in here?

3295
03:56:16,680 --> 03:56:19,320
If someone is not providing
this string part

3296
03:56:19,400 --> 03:56:23,560
here, should still be able to call this
method by just passing this key.

3297
03:56:24,600 --> 03:56:27,240
What is concern that I should use in here?

3298
03:56:27,680 --> 03:56:31,520
I want to give this flexibility
to the user that he can call this raid

3299
03:56:31,560 --> 03:56:35,280
method by just passing maybe one argument.

3300
03:56:35,280 --> 03:56:41,080
Yes, the over loading right.

3301
03:56:41,080 --> 03:56:44,760
So if someone is passing

3302
03:56:44,760 --> 03:56:50,680
only the key,

3303
03:56:50,680 --> 03:56:56,320
I want to still return the value
from this default file.

3304
03:56:56,360 --> 03:56:59,880
Otherwise he can specify its own file
name.

3305
03:57:00,080 --> 03:57:00,520
Right.

3306
03:57:00,520 --> 03:57:04,920
So string key.

3307
03:57:04,920 --> 03:57:07,400
And do I need all of this?

3308
03:57:07,400 --> 03:57:11,360
Do I need to rewrite all of this code

3309
03:57:15,400 --> 03:57:19,160
inside this method?

3310
03:57:19,160 --> 03:57:20,280
Super

3311
03:57:20,840 --> 03:57:22,920
elect super is for the parent class

3312
03:57:24,360 --> 03:57:28,600
so I can all be read method,

3313
03:57:28,760 --> 03:57:32,600
but by passing to article
and as a part I can

3314
03:57:33,840 --> 03:57:36,800
I can pass files

3315
03:57:36,800 --> 03:57:38,880
then forward and then

3316
03:57:40,400 --> 03:57:43,080
config dot

3317
03:57:44,160 --> 03:57:45,840
properties

3318
03:57:48,560 --> 03:57:50,760
and then I will pass the key in here.

3319
03:57:51,360 --> 03:57:53,680
You remember how we

3320
03:57:55,880 --> 03:57:57,720
how we

3321
03:57:58,200 --> 03:58:02,280
re used the constructors
in that overloading example.

3322
03:58:02,720 --> 03:58:05,280
We don't have to rewrite all of this code.

3323
03:58:05,280 --> 03:58:07,080
I am just calling this.

3324
03:58:07,080 --> 03:58:09,600
Read the method from this. Read
the method.

3325
03:58:09,960 --> 03:58:12,720
They're passing
this extra argument in here.

3326
03:58:14,400 --> 03:58:16,800
So if Java is passing.

3327
03:58:16,960 --> 03:58:20,760
If only if someone is only passing
the key faster.

3328
03:58:20,760 --> 03:58:24,000
This method will be called
and inside this method

3329
03:58:24,000 --> 03:58:27,240
I am calling other method
and passing the to article.

3330
03:58:27,240 --> 03:58:29,880
Next. If someone is directly passing

3331
03:58:29,880 --> 03:58:32,160
the two arguments,
then this method will be called.

3332
03:58:32,880 --> 03:58:41,240
Do you guys understand
what is going on in here?

3333
03:58:41,240 --> 03:58:43,280
How the method overloading most guys?

3334
03:58:44,640 --> 03:58:46,960
Let's say you have to call this method.

3335
03:58:46,960 --> 03:58:49,760
How can I tell Joe
that I want to call this method

3336
03:59:00,600 --> 03:59:03,720
same name, but dual parameters.

3337
03:59:03,720 --> 03:59:16,200
And if I want to call this
method, I need to pass one parameter.

3338
03:59:16,200 --> 03:59:20,640
And what is happening inside this method?

3339
03:59:20,640 --> 03:59:26,280
I am creating this second
argument from my own right.

3340
03:59:27,600 --> 03:59:28,560
I am creating

3341
03:59:28,560 --> 03:59:31,400
this second argument,
am creating that part

3342
03:59:33,040 --> 03:59:34,680
in here.

3343
03:59:34,800 --> 03:59:39,760
And the key I am getting from here
and which method will be called.

3344
03:59:39,760 --> 03:59:43,440
I write of this line.

3345
03:59:43,440 --> 03:59:48,120
So actually let me let me show
by debugging here,

3346
03:59:48,120 --> 04:00:21,240
I think it will make more sense.

3347
04:00:21,240 --> 04:00:27,120
So in my run,
you have this one in my config,

3348
04:00:27,120 --> 04:00:31,080
I have this username right
and I want to get this value

3349
04:00:33,000 --> 04:00:38,880
so I will allow set config.

3350
04:00:38,880 --> 04:00:41,920
Then figure you do the trade

3351
04:00:42,720 --> 04:00:45,480
and if I pass this the username

3352
04:00:49,080 --> 04:00:51,600
and if I say add to method signature,

3353
04:00:51,720 --> 04:00:56,960
what value should I get guys?

3354
04:00:56,960 --> 04:00:58,240
I don't think so.

3355
04:00:58,240 --> 04:01:00,800
We will be able to make
to the Excel file assignment

3356
04:01:01,440 --> 04:01:02,160
today

3357
04:01:04,960 --> 04:01:06,000
guys.

3358
04:01:06,160 --> 04:01:11,240
If I say config reader dog trade
and if I pass the username in here,

3359
04:01:12,240 --> 04:01:12,800
what value

3360
04:01:12,800 --> 04:01:26,200
should I get?

3361
04:01:26,200 --> 04:01:27,800
Add meaning right.

3362
04:01:27,800 --> 04:01:31,680
And this time how many lines of code
I have written to read this

3363
04:01:31,680 --> 04:01:37,320
data?

3364
04:01:37,320 --> 04:01:41,880
Only one right?

3365
04:01:41,880 --> 04:01:45,600
So let's see if it works or not.

3366
04:01:45,600 --> 04:01:47,920
So I get this admin.

3367
04:01:47,920 --> 04:01:52,240
Now let's try to debug how,
how we are able to read this.

3368
04:01:52,240 --> 04:01:55,320
Start out
by just specifying one line right.

3369
04:01:55,320 --> 04:01:58,520
So I place the debug point first, then

3370
04:01:58,520 --> 04:02:01,760
I say debug

3371
04:02:03,520 --> 04:02:05,320
and now I want to check

3372
04:02:05,320 --> 04:02:08,040
what is happening inside this read method.

3373
04:02:09,680 --> 04:02:11,760
So should I click to step into

3374
04:02:11,800 --> 04:02:17,200
or step over?

3375
04:02:17,200 --> 04:02:21,800
I want to check what is how the code is
being executed inside this read

3376
04:02:22,240 --> 04:02:26,760
through takes a click step into
step over into right

3377
04:02:27,240 --> 04:02:32,640
and will take me to this method
or this method when I will be clicking

3378
04:02:32,640 --> 04:02:35,760
Stepping to really take me to first
method or the second one

3379
04:02:40,040 --> 04:02:41,480
second one and how does

3380
04:02:41,480 --> 04:02:44,240
it not that it should go to type
in the method

3381
04:02:50,040 --> 04:02:52,600
one on the right?

3382
04:02:52,600 --> 04:02:57,200
So if I click on Step Into
it shows me two options.

3383
04:02:57,200 --> 04:03:00,960
It says Hey, yes,
there you are calling this println method

3384
04:03:02,160 --> 04:03:04,040
and you are calling this trade method.

3385
04:03:04,040 --> 04:03:06,320
So which method do you want to go inside?

3386
04:03:06,320 --> 04:03:08,520
So I want you to go inside this, right?

3387
04:03:09,360 --> 04:03:12,360
So it takes me in here. Now,

3388
04:03:13,520 --> 04:03:16,200
in here I again calling the read

3389
04:03:16,200 --> 04:03:21,720
method about this time as a part,
I am passing files, select

3390
04:03:21,840 --> 04:03:26,600
config properties
and the key I have boss from here.

3391
04:03:26,640 --> 04:03:29,520
Now which method will be called

3392
04:03:33,960 --> 04:03:35,480
the one?

3393
04:03:35,480 --> 04:03:36,200
Right.

3394
04:03:36,200 --> 04:03:42,040
So again, if I say step into
I get inside this first one

3395
04:03:42,040 --> 04:03:45,360
and the path is a five dot config

3396
04:03:45,360 --> 04:03:47,880
and the key is username.

3397
04:03:48,480 --> 04:03:50,040
Now it will go

3398
04:03:51,880 --> 04:03:53,920
inside this config file.

3399
04:03:54,800 --> 04:03:58,160
When I say a file import
stream new file input theme,

3400
04:03:58,760 --> 04:04:02,640
then the object,
the properties files will be created.

3401
04:04:03,680 --> 04:04:05,400
All the

3402
04:04:05,680 --> 04:04:10,160
these and the values will be loaded inside
this object

3403
04:04:10,200 --> 04:04:14,040
and I will be able to get to that field
using that property.

3404
04:04:15,000 --> 04:04:15,320
Right.

3405
04:04:15,320 --> 04:04:18,280
So if I say next, next, next,

3406
04:04:19,800 --> 04:04:21,960
they problem in the second method is that

3407
04:04:22,440 --> 04:04:24,960
it assumes the part string,

3408
04:04:24,960 --> 04:04:28,480
but the first method gives you the option
to put in the path. Yes.

3409
04:04:28,800 --> 04:04:31,000
So we will we want behavior, right?

3410
04:04:31,840 --> 04:04:36,960
So that if someone is not passing
the part inside this read,

3411
04:04:37,320 --> 04:04:40,800
we want to read the data from the default.

3412
04:04:40,800 --> 04:04:45,000
But if someone is passing a specific part,

3413
04:04:45,480 --> 04:04:47,880
let's say, for example, if I pass

3414
04:04:50,160 --> 04:04:52,320
a specific port in here

3415
04:04:58,560 --> 04:04:59,520
now frame

3416
04:04:59,520 --> 04:05:02,640
from there it will be in the database.

3417
04:05:02,640 --> 04:05:05,640
So let me open that.

3418
04:05:05,640 --> 04:05:08,080
So if I, if I have this from

3419
04:05:13,920 --> 04:05:16,440
and if I specify this

3420
04:05:17,360 --> 04:05:19,680
from the DOT properties and let's say

3421
04:05:19,680 --> 04:05:27,920
I want to read this username,
so this time I am specifying

3422
04:05:27,920 --> 04:05:33,560
the path as well as the key
for which I want to get the data.

3423
04:05:33,560 --> 04:05:37,440
So will it still drain the data
from configured properties or this time

3424
04:05:37,440 --> 04:05:39,680
will it go inside this property properties

3425
04:05:45,960 --> 04:05:47,320
and at this time

3426
04:05:47,320 --> 04:05:53,320
will will
this method to be executor this time?

3427
04:05:53,320 --> 04:05:58,560
No, because now I am passing two things
and I will be.

3428
04:05:59,280 --> 04:06:01,080
This method will be followed right?

3429
04:06:01,080 --> 04:06:03,000
If I say

3430
04:06:03,040 --> 04:06:05,440
I execute this,

3431
04:06:06,120 --> 04:06:08,280
this time I get a similar one to take.

3432
04:06:08,760 --> 04:06:11,040
So with the help of overloading

3433
04:06:12,000 --> 04:06:14,160
and properties files,

3434
04:06:14,160 --> 04:06:18,720
I am able to give this flexibility
to the end user that,

3435
04:06:18,720 --> 04:06:23,080
if we specify, specifies
the path I read from that specific file.

3436
04:06:23,720 --> 04:06:27,800
If it does not provide the
but I read from the default

3437
04:06:27,800 --> 04:06:41,040
file is a clear guide
why I created this booted methods.

3438
04:06:41,040 --> 04:06:44,800
So when someone is not specifying
the path, I assume this part.

3439
04:06:45,920 --> 04:06:48,120
I assume this path.

3440
04:06:48,120 --> 04:06:48,400
Okay.

3441
04:06:48,400 --> 04:06:59,280
And I call method in here.

3442
04:06:59,280 --> 04:07:01,160
So do you have been teaching
for a long time?

3443
04:07:01,160 --> 04:07:05,120
I think you deserve rest.

3444
04:07:05,120 --> 04:07:11,680
If 15 motivators.

3445
04:07:11,680 --> 04:07:13,400
Oh Wrapper 209 okay.

3446
04:07:13,400 --> 04:07:15,080
Let me go to

3447
04:08:01,480 --> 04:08:02,760
by the way

3448
04:08:02,760 --> 04:08:05,320
these wrappers
for the interview questions.

3449
04:08:06,000 --> 04:08:08,480
They are also really

3450
04:08:10,280 --> 04:08:13,480
and now you guys should be able
to solve these.

3451
04:08:13,680 --> 04:08:14,760
Oops, we did it.

3452
04:08:14,760 --> 04:08:19,080
So you guys should now be able to solve
all of these interview as well.

3453
04:08:19,800 --> 04:08:29,440
So I will release these next week.

3454
04:08:29,440 --> 04:08:48,200
So wrap to zero nine.

3455
04:08:48,200 --> 04:08:50,840
Well, what a difficult thing to do.

3456
04:08:51,000 --> 04:08:53,120
It's easy peasy.

3457
04:08:53,280 --> 04:08:55,760
So let's first create the

3458
04:08:57,040 --> 04:08:58,600
public

3459
04:08:59,280 --> 04:09:02,520
standard, avoid the mean

3460
04:09:15,280 --> 04:09:17,440
and it says create

3461
04:09:17,440 --> 04:09:20,600
a list of map that is list.

3462
04:09:20,600 --> 04:09:23,280
And inside that list,
we should have a map.

3463
04:09:23,640 --> 04:09:26,440
And inside those maps we have,
we are floating

3464
04:09:26,440 --> 04:09:30,640
string and objects and call it that list.

3465
04:09:30,640 --> 04:09:30,840
Yeah.

3466
04:09:32,040 --> 04:09:34,680
So we how do we create list?

3467
04:09:34,680 --> 04:09:36,040
We say

3468
04:09:40,280 --> 04:09:42,000
ArrayList, right?

3469
04:09:42,000 --> 04:09:45,240
Oh, let's let's call it a list.

3470
04:09:45,240 --> 04:09:47,080
So list.

3471
04:09:47,080 --> 04:09:50,320
And inside that list we should have a map.

3472
04:09:51,720 --> 04:09:55,120
And inside that map we have to for

3473
04:09:56,440 --> 04:10:00,200
string and objects, right?

3474
04:10:00,960 --> 04:10:04,040
So let's call it object here,

3475
04:10:04,040 --> 04:10:06,880
and we have to call it

3476
04:10:06,880 --> 04:10:07,320
that.

3477
04:10:07,320 --> 04:10:11,040
The list is equal to new

3478
04:10:12,200 --> 04:10:14,440
exploded and a list.

3479
04:10:14,440 --> 04:10:17,600
Okay.

3480
04:10:17,600 --> 04:10:18,320
Something

3481
04:10:21,040 --> 04:10:21,640
like this.

3482
04:10:21,640 --> 04:10:25,320
And we have to do the import as well.

3483
04:10:25,320 --> 04:10:30,840
So this import is coming
from the util package.

3484
04:10:30,840 --> 04:10:33,240
So import

3485
04:10:35,360 --> 04:10:40,200
java or util and you guys can put a star

3486
04:10:40,200 --> 04:10:43,000
that means import everything
from this package.

3487
04:10:43,280 --> 04:10:46,120
Yeah.

3488
04:10:46,120 --> 04:10:49,160
All right. So a new release, right?

3489
04:10:49,160 --> 04:10:55,920
And then now inside this map,
we have to create this map as well.

3490
04:10:55,920 --> 04:10:56,760
So map

3491
04:10:59,760 --> 04:11:02,360
string and then

3492
04:11:03,280 --> 04:11:06,000
object and let's call it

3493
04:11:06,520 --> 04:11:09,680
Apple map is equal to continue,

3494
04:11:10,800 --> 04:11:13,880
maybe hash map or let's call it
plaintext now.

3495
04:11:14,160 --> 04:11:46,440
So you guys don't lose that. You.

3496
04:11:46,440 --> 04:11:47,160
I think not.

3497
04:11:47,160 --> 04:11:48,440
We'd be happy.

3498
04:11:48,440 --> 04:11:51,560
No, not happy anymore

3499
04:11:51,560 --> 04:12:00,400
anymore.

3500
04:12:00,400 --> 04:12:03,680
Not okay.

3501
04:12:03,720 --> 04:12:04,440
It will compile.

3502
04:12:04,440 --> 04:12:04,680
Fine.

3503
04:12:04,680 --> 04:12:08,320
Don't worry about.

3504
04:12:08,320 --> 04:12:12,400
So the I think the main thing
that might have confused

3505
04:12:12,400 --> 04:12:16,320
you is why we are using these objects
to store

3506
04:12:18,160 --> 04:12:19,800
values in here. Right.

3507
04:12:19,800 --> 04:12:21,840
For example, if I have to store 20.

3508
04:12:22,120 --> 04:12:24,840
Well, why I am using

3509
04:12:24,840 --> 04:12:27,080
an object right?

3510
04:12:27,080 --> 04:12:33,080
So this 20 is a double
and this quantity is an integer, right?

3511
04:12:33,080 --> 04:12:36,360
So if I have to store
multiple types of data

3512
04:12:36,920 --> 04:12:40,360
inside the same map, I can use

3513
04:12:41,640 --> 04:12:44,880
this object in here

3514
04:12:44,880 --> 04:12:48,960
they are English.

3515
04:12:48,960 --> 04:12:49,880
Oh, the edge

3516
04:12:55,040 --> 04:12:58,760
at that.

3517
04:12:58,800 --> 04:13:01,520
Okay, so we are good now.

3518
04:13:02,040 --> 04:13:05,880
So now I can store so create

3519
04:13:05,880 --> 04:13:09,840
apple map thing
and add below peers into it.

3520
04:13:09,920 --> 04:13:10,680
Right.

3521
04:13:12,160 --> 04:13:14,400
So items.

3522
04:13:14,400 --> 04:13:18,360
And then I should add so I should say

3523
04:13:20,480 --> 04:13:23,080
apple map dot port

3524
04:13:23,080 --> 04:13:25,440
so because I have

3525
04:13:26,480 --> 04:13:29,760
created this map of object type,

3526
04:13:31,560 --> 04:13:34,320
I can put anything in here.

3527
04:13:34,800 --> 04:13:35,400
Right.

3528
04:13:35,400 --> 04:13:41,600
I can put things I can put above right.

3529
04:13:42,240 --> 04:13:47,240
I can put integers whatever I want.

3530
04:13:47,240 --> 04:13:50,360
So the second is

3531
04:13:50,360 --> 04:13:52,560
for is

3532
04:13:55,120 --> 04:13:58,200
and it is currently for zero zero.

3533
04:13:59,120 --> 04:14:02,680
The third one is on 30

3534
04:14:04,560 --> 04:14:06,600
and that's the quantity

3535
04:14:07,680 --> 04:14:09,080
is ten.

3536
04:14:10,080 --> 04:14:13,080
Add apple map to the list right.

3537
04:14:13,080 --> 04:14:17,800
So once you have the Apple map,
I have to add this to the data list.

3538
04:14:17,920 --> 04:14:21,840
So I will say that to start add

3539
04:14:23,160 --> 04:14:26,160
and then I will say

3540
04:14:29,400 --> 04:14:31,680
and then create an orange map.

3541
04:14:31,680 --> 04:14:37,080
So this time let me copy
and paste this code in here.

3542
04:14:37,080 --> 04:14:39,000
Let's call it

3543
04:14:40,440 --> 04:14:45,680
orange map.

3544
04:14:45,680 --> 04:14:52,080
And in here the item will be orange.

3545
04:14:52,080 --> 04:14:55,000
The price will be

3546
04:14:57,400 --> 04:15:00,600
going to 1.99 in the quantity.

3547
04:15:00,600 --> 04:15:01,720
Okay. And then

3548
04:15:02,760 --> 04:15:05,720
and then add the orange map, the detector.

3549
04:15:05,720 --> 04:15:11,080
And so again, that values and

3550
04:15:17,640 --> 04:15:23,400
and then orange map, All right.

3551
04:15:24,360 --> 04:15:25,880
And then

3552
04:15:26,320 --> 04:15:28,440
create a loop

3553
04:15:28,480 --> 04:15:30,960
from that list.

3554
04:15:30,960 --> 04:15:34,600
Retrieve each key and store

3555
04:15:35,720 --> 04:15:38,680
in a variable,

3556
04:15:38,680 --> 04:15:43,320
calculate the sum of each object,

3557
04:15:44,240 --> 04:15:47,040
and then print the values of each
tradition,

3558
04:15:47,040 --> 04:15:50,400
same as shown below in the output.

3559
04:15:50,400 --> 04:15:55,080
So for example, calculate the sum
total, stored it in a variable called

3560
04:15:55,160 --> 04:15:59,000
total case after the loop
put into the value of total positive.

3561
04:15:59,640 --> 04:16:05,800
So items, the apple price is going to be
quantity is then subtotal is

3562
04:16:07,160 --> 04:16:09,120
200. Right?

3563
04:16:09,400 --> 04:16:14,800
Because we have to take this value
multiply with this quantity.

3564
04:16:14,840 --> 04:16:17,120
That's how we get to hundred.

3565
04:16:17,120 --> 04:16:19,600
And then we put in this line.

3566
04:16:19,600 --> 04:16:22,800
Then we pick the second map,
we get a big quantity

3567
04:16:22,800 --> 04:16:27,520
and we multiply it with the total quantity
and then we get that the total.

3568
04:16:27,520 --> 04:16:32,280
And then we also have
to get the full total in here.

3569
04:16:32,760 --> 04:16:33,480
Okay.

3570
04:16:33,560 --> 04:16:36,080
So can you guys do it now

3571
04:16:36,080 --> 04:16:42,720
or is still confusing?

3572
04:16:42,720 --> 04:16:48,480
It's easy peasy, right?

3573
04:16:48,480 --> 04:16:51,960
Okay. Let me let me play.

3574
04:16:51,960 --> 04:16:56,160
So let's create a variable of double total

3575
04:16:57,680 --> 04:16:59,440
and last initialize it

3576
04:16:59,440 --> 04:17:05,040
with zero.

3577
04:17:05,040 --> 04:17:07,920
And first
we have to iterate through this list

3578
04:17:08,960 --> 04:17:12,080
so that we can get all data from here.

3579
04:17:12,080 --> 04:17:12,400
Right?

3580
04:17:12,400 --> 04:17:16,560
So I can use the enhanced Guadalupe
because I am only retrieving the data

3581
04:17:17,200 --> 04:17:18,880
so I can write for

3582
04:17:19,920 --> 04:17:20,600
what does this

3583
04:17:20,600 --> 04:17:28,120
list guys?

3584
04:17:28,120 --> 04:17:28,760
Here we go.

3585
04:17:28,760 --> 04:17:31,640
Amateurs already done it

3586
04:17:31,920 --> 04:17:33,720
maps. Right.

3587
04:17:33,720 --> 04:17:37,320
So I from this list I will be getting

3588
04:17:38,440 --> 04:17:40,440
a map. Right.

3589
04:17:40,520 --> 04:17:41,160
So what?

3590
04:17:41,160 --> 04:17:44,520
I will be getting from this list,
I will be getting a map.

3591
04:17:44,520 --> 04:17:47,000
And inside that map, what do I have?

3592
04:17:47,000 --> 04:17:48,920
I have a string.

3593
04:17:48,920 --> 04:17:51,000
And this second

3594
04:17:51,000 --> 04:17:54,600
object, the second thing is object.

3595
04:17:54,600 --> 04:17:55,360
Right?

3596
04:17:56,640 --> 04:17:59,560
And let's call it anti

3597
04:17:59,960 --> 04:18:00,880
column.

3598
04:18:00,880 --> 04:18:02,400
And then

3599
04:18:03,440 --> 04:18:07,240
I need to pass this that listing.

3600
04:18:07,480 --> 04:18:08,160
Right.

3601
04:18:09,120 --> 04:18:10,520
So now

3602
04:18:11,360 --> 04:18:13,120
from this list,

3603
04:18:13,120 --> 04:18:15,720
I will be getting all the maps

3604
04:18:15,880 --> 04:18:21,840
one by one right.

3605
04:18:21,840 --> 04:18:24,200
So what I can do,

3606
04:18:24,200 --> 04:18:26,920
I can get

3607
04:18:26,920 --> 04:18:31,920
I can declare three variables right.

3608
04:18:31,920 --> 04:18:33,400
And then

3609
04:18:34,200 --> 04:18:36,720
so can I, can I use

3610
04:18:37,800 --> 04:18:42,240
if I want to get to be these
and the values inside this loop

3611
04:18:42,240 --> 04:18:45,280
from this map base from this map

3612
04:18:45,640 --> 04:18:49,680
I want both to be keys and the values.

3613
04:18:50,280 --> 04:18:52,200
So I use a loop.

3614
04:18:52,200 --> 04:19:09,360
Or should I go with the iterator?

3615
04:19:09,360 --> 04:19:12,440
I can use both. Yeah, I can use, but

3616
04:19:13,440 --> 04:19:15,240
both is fine, right?

3617
04:19:15,240 --> 04:19:17,520
But I will be needing another loop.

3618
04:19:17,520 --> 04:19:20,320
So if I say

3619
04:19:21,960 --> 04:19:24,600
if I say

3620
04:19:24,600 --> 04:19:27,560
four for this fact, the second for loop

3621
04:19:27,560 --> 04:19:30,600
that I am writing in here is to

3622
04:19:31,840 --> 04:19:34,280
the entries from this map.

3623
04:19:34,280 --> 04:19:34,640
Right.

3624
04:19:34,640 --> 04:19:36,480
It has multiple entries.

3625
04:19:36,480 --> 04:19:39,000
So I will say map

3626
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:41,120
dot entry.

3627
04:19:41,120 --> 04:19:41,760
Right.

3628
04:19:41,760 --> 04:19:43,560
So I have got the map.

3629
04:19:43,560 --> 04:19:45,960
But inside that map I have three things.

3630
04:19:46,280 --> 04:19:50,560
I have the item name, I have the quantity,
I have the price right.

3631
04:19:50,840 --> 04:19:53,640
So I also need to get all three of them

3632
04:19:53,640 --> 04:19:55,800
because I need to print the

3633
04:19:57,080 --> 04:19:58,480
first key and value pair.

3634
04:19:58,480 --> 04:20:00,840
The second key value pair
the third to give a bit.

3635
04:20:00,840 --> 04:20:03,480
And I also need to get the total.

3636
04:20:03,840 --> 04:20:05,880
So therefore I need all of them.

3637
04:20:06,280 --> 04:20:06,680
So there.

3638
04:20:06,680 --> 04:20:10,000
So I am getting a map entry in here

3639
04:20:10,240 --> 04:20:13,440
right.

3640
04:20:13,440 --> 04:20:16,480
So it's this thing
and the objects right inside this.

3641
04:20:16,480 --> 04:20:23,760
Each entry there is the string
and object, let's call it

3642
04:20:28,600 --> 04:20:31,640
maps indexed.

3643
04:20:31,680 --> 04:20:34,720
Call this one as the entry.

3644
04:20:34,760 --> 04:20:35,760
So how so?

3645
04:20:35,760 --> 04:20:38,240
Let's say I have this map from this map.

3646
04:20:38,640 --> 04:20:42,560
How can I get the entry set?

3647
04:20:43,080 --> 04:20:46,680
I can go to the entry start
by simply saying

3648
04:20:46,800 --> 04:20:50,960
the bias was simply specifying
the name of that list.

3649
04:20:50,960 --> 04:20:51,920
Right.

3650
04:20:52,440 --> 04:20:55,320
So I already have the map in here.

3651
04:20:55,320 --> 04:20:57,320
So I am saying map dot.

3652
04:20:57,320 --> 04:21:04,680
What should I write in here?

3653
04:21:04,680 --> 04:21:08,400
I should write entry and dissect

3654
04:21:09,520 --> 04:21:10,440
right.

3655
04:21:10,440 --> 04:21:12,640
So it will give me the entry.

3656
04:21:12,680 --> 04:21:17,960
Exact.

3657
04:21:17,960 --> 04:21:21,200
And now if

3658
04:21:22,240 --> 04:21:25,680
so, once I have the entry, what I can do

3659
04:21:25,920 --> 04:21:28,440
from the first entry I can see here

3660
04:21:29,800 --> 04:21:31,120
I can say.

3661
04:21:31,120 --> 04:21:33,840
And the dot exactly

3662
04:21:35,800 --> 04:21:36,720
right.

3663
04:21:36,840 --> 04:21:38,280
So this will return me.

3664
04:21:38,280 --> 04:21:39,240
Where is this?

3665
04:21:39,240 --> 04:21:42,120
So this will return me apple

3666
04:21:42,120 --> 04:21:42,960
right

3667
04:21:43,560 --> 04:21:45,360
in then. Plus,

3668
04:21:46,440 --> 04:21:50,280
if I see a space and if I say

3669
04:21:51,520 --> 04:21:54,840
entry or go to value

3670
04:21:55,960 --> 04:21:58,320
so this will return me items.

3671
04:21:58,560 --> 04:21:59,920
Then I need a column.

3672
04:21:59,920 --> 04:22:01,800
Actually I should put a column in here.

3673
04:22:01,800 --> 04:22:04,000
So then I need a colony in here.

3674
04:22:05,440 --> 04:22:07,880
So items column

3675
04:22:07,880 --> 04:22:11,240
and then a space and then the app.

3676
04:22:11,440 --> 04:22:12,280
Right.

3677
04:22:12,480 --> 04:22:14,600
And then another

3678
04:22:15,120 --> 04:22:17,320
at the ending here.

3679
04:22:17,320 --> 04:22:20,720
Now put this blessing here.

3680
04:22:20,720 --> 04:22:24,400
So let me first execute
all part of the course

3681
04:22:24,400 --> 04:22:25,800
so that you guys can understand.

3682
04:22:25,800 --> 04:22:29,440
So if I execute discord

3683
04:22:30,840 --> 04:22:34,240
so I, I got the items

3684
04:22:36,200 --> 04:22:49,760
and then the did

3685
04:22:50,080 --> 04:22:51,880
I add

3686
04:22:54,040 --> 04:22:57,000
or have orange

3687
04:22:58,440 --> 04:23:00,680
the apple

3688
04:23:04,600 --> 04:23:05,720
why I don't see

3689
04:23:05,720 --> 04:23:17,160
the other ones.

3690
04:23:17,160 --> 04:23:22,040
The second list should be orange map
and then divided map is added here.

3691
04:23:23,040 --> 04:23:25,680
I got this from here

3692
04:23:27,160 --> 04:23:28,640
and map

3693
04:23:28,640 --> 04:23:31,680
and three and three maps thought

3694
04:23:34,080 --> 04:23:37,320
entries and in here

3695
04:23:38,520 --> 04:23:41,880
I mean and these

3696
04:23:46,680 --> 04:23:47,600
that are this

3697
04:23:47,600 --> 04:23:53,400
that this line 14 to 16
what is wrong with line 14 to 16.

3698
04:23:53,400 --> 04:23:56,360
All you would need to do

3699
04:23:58,600 --> 04:24:02,360
orange and orange and orange.

3700
04:24:03,320 --> 04:24:08,280
Now it looks good. Yes.

3701
04:24:09,280 --> 04:24:11,760
So we get the items

3702
04:24:13,920 --> 04:24:17,880
from the Apple map
and we get the quantities

3703
04:24:17,880 --> 04:24:21,360
and the items are everything
from the other maps.

3704
04:24:21,360 --> 04:24:27,520
So now what we want to put into them
out on a single line.

3705
04:24:27,520 --> 04:24:29,040
So let's remove this.

3706
04:24:29,040 --> 04:24:31,800
And then from here

3707
04:24:33,280 --> 04:24:36,000
and let me put

3708
04:24:36,480 --> 04:24:41,160
it printer in here.

3709
04:24:41,160 --> 04:24:41,840
Oh right.

3710
04:24:41,840 --> 04:24:45,280
So I get items apple
and there should be a space

3711
04:24:45,320 --> 04:24:51,880
after the Apple MacBook back.

3712
04:24:51,880 --> 04:24:53,680
Okay, it looks good.

3713
04:24:53,680 --> 04:24:58,960
Now the only thing that I need to do is
I need to get this subtotal as.

3714
04:24:58,960 --> 04:25:02,600
Well right that subtotal
I will get by multiplying the keys

3715
04:25:03,200 --> 04:25:05,360
with the values.

3716
04:25:05,680 --> 04:25:06,920
Right. So

3717
04:25:07,920 --> 04:25:11,160
let me go in this subtotal as well.

3718
04:25:11,240 --> 04:25:14,080
So space

3719
04:25:14,080 --> 04:25:16,640
and then subtotal.

3720
04:25:18,000 --> 04:25:23,160
But actually why not put it in here

3721
04:25:25,000 --> 04:25:25,800
plus.

3722
04:25:25,800 --> 04:25:31,680
And then I need to get this

3723
04:25:33,360 --> 04:25:35,840
and this quantity

3724
04:25:36,960 --> 04:25:39,040
and this right.

3725
04:25:39,080 --> 04:25:41,760
So what I can do,
I can declare some variables.

3726
04:25:42,280 --> 04:25:45,360
So if I need to store

3727
04:25:45,600 --> 04:25:51,000
that inside this variable,

3728
04:25:51,000 --> 04:25:54,120
I can declare three variables in here.

3729
04:25:54,160 --> 04:25:54,800
Right?

3730
04:25:56,280 --> 04:25:57,840
So what I can do

3731
04:25:57,840 --> 04:26:04,720
supposed to be orange.

3732
04:26:04,720 --> 04:26:08,720
So what I can do, I can set string.

3733
04:26:09,760 --> 04:26:14,680
So I only I'm only interested in quantity
and then this price.

3734
04:26:14,680 --> 04:26:18,440
So what I can do, I can see

3735
04:26:20,120 --> 04:26:22,400
integer

3736
04:26:23,120 --> 04:26:24,560
quantity.

3737
04:26:25,200 --> 04:26:26,760
Okay.

3738
04:26:26,760 --> 04:26:30,360
And then let's initialize it with zero

3739
04:26:30,480 --> 04:26:33,440
and one more variable to hold

3740
04:26:35,040 --> 04:26:37,200
the price.

3741
04:26:37,640 --> 04:26:39,920
Right.

3742
04:26:39,920 --> 04:26:42,520
Next, let's initialize it with zero.

3743
04:26:42,520 --> 04:26:44,400
So what? What is happening right now?

3744
04:26:44,400 --> 04:26:48,120
I am getting all the values one by one
so I need.

3745
04:26:48,840 --> 04:26:51,440
And if condition in here

3746
04:26:51,440 --> 04:26:54,040
because it's happening
all inside that loop.

3747
04:26:54,040 --> 04:26:54,760
Right.

3748
04:26:54,800 --> 04:26:59,640
So I need to check if this key

3749
04:27:00,120 --> 04:27:06,280
that I am getting, if it is equal

3750
04:27:08,120 --> 04:27:09,600
to the

3751
04:27:09,600 --> 04:27:18,120
key price, then

3752
04:27:19,160 --> 04:27:23,080
I will update this price variable.

3753
04:27:23,080 --> 04:27:23,480
Yeah,

3754
04:27:24,360 --> 04:27:26,640
I will update this private

3755
04:27:28,040 --> 04:27:30,440
surprise will be equal to

3756
04:27:30,920 --> 04:27:33,800
the corresponding value

3757
04:27:35,280 --> 04:27:38,000
from here.

3758
04:27:38,000 --> 04:27:39,800
But now I get an error.

3759
04:27:39,800 --> 04:27:48,000
Why I get an error because this values
that I am storing in here.

3760
04:27:48,000 --> 04:27:52,440
They are stored in the form of objects,

3761
04:27:53,240 --> 04:27:56,320
but I am trying to assign it to the

3762
04:27:58,560 --> 04:27:59,840
integer variable.

3763
04:27:59,840 --> 04:28:05,400
So I need the cost thing in here right

3764
04:28:10,600 --> 04:28:11,160
guys?

3765
04:28:11,880 --> 04:28:14,120
Is it making sense?

3766
04:28:14,480 --> 04:28:16,960
Easy peasy.

3767
04:28:16,960 --> 04:28:20,280
This is not easy peasy.

3768
04:28:21,360 --> 04:28:22,840
Just just step by step.

3769
04:28:22,840 --> 04:28:32,360
Right.

3770
04:28:32,360 --> 04:28:34,080
Okay. It will be fine.

3771
04:28:34,080 --> 04:28:37,680
So inside me, if you guys remember

3772
04:28:38,280 --> 04:28:41,520
those wrapper classes
I told you about, the

3773
04:28:42,640 --> 04:28:45,000
about the methods to do the convergence.

3774
04:28:45,000 --> 04:28:47,480
Right.

3775
04:28:47,480 --> 04:28:53,040
So first, what I need to do,
I need to convert it to a string.

3776
04:28:53,720 --> 04:28:54,200
Okay?

3777
04:28:55,720 --> 04:29:00,080
And then
or you can try it directly as well.

3778
04:29:00,320 --> 04:29:00,720
Okay.

3779
04:29:00,720 --> 04:29:03,680
So, for example, if I say

3780
04:29:10,320 --> 04:29:12,400
double like this

3781
04:29:14,320 --> 04:29:17,040
and then surprise integer

3782
04:29:18,600 --> 04:29:19,840
integer.

3783
04:29:19,920 --> 04:29:25,280
Okay, so what will happen now?

3784
04:29:25,920 --> 04:29:30,640
It will be converted to integer
or what you guys can do

3785
04:29:31,680 --> 04:29:35,600
are you guys can use the methods
from these classes as well.

3786
04:29:35,600 --> 04:29:37,760
So for example,

3787
04:29:37,880 --> 04:29:42,960
this, there is this method to
explicitly perform this conversion, right?

3788
04:29:43,480 --> 04:29:46,640
So for example, if I call that

3789
04:29:48,160 --> 04:29:52,600
value a dark integer,

3790
04:29:52,600 --> 04:29:55,840
the true value of method.

3791
04:29:55,960 --> 04:30:00,840
So this method, what it will do,
it will pick this value.

3792
04:30:00,840 --> 04:30:07,920
So from in here,

3793
04:30:07,920 --> 04:30:10,360
so it will pick this value from here

3794
04:30:11,320 --> 04:30:16,160
and then it will try.

3795
04:30:16,160 --> 04:30:17,800
Is it uppercase or lowercase?

3796
04:30:17,800 --> 04:30:19,320
The value of

3797
04:30:22,680 --> 04:30:24,280
okay, here we go.

3798
04:30:24,280 --> 04:30:27,000
So this in order dot value off

3799
04:30:27,920 --> 04:30:31,160
it will take that specify value

3800
04:30:33,760 --> 04:30:37,680
and it will convert that to end integer.

3801
04:30:37,680 --> 04:30:41,240
And why we have to go through all of this,
we have to go through

3802
04:30:41,240 --> 04:30:45,360
because we want to store strings,

3803
04:30:46,320 --> 04:30:49,720
double and integers, all of them

3804
04:30:50,240 --> 04:30:52,920
inside a single map.

3805
04:30:53,720 --> 04:30:58,560
Okay. It's

3806
04:31:02,280 --> 04:31:04,360
it says

3807
04:31:06,840 --> 04:31:10,200
must do metaphor.

3808
04:31:10,200 --> 04:31:15,080
What do this class really last?

3809
04:31:15,080 --> 04:31:21,240
And you need to head back to my computer.

3810
04:31:21,240 --> 04:31:23,880
I would have done this in
in about in one week

3811
04:31:28,240 --> 04:31:30,440
I'll have the

3812
04:31:34,320 --> 04:31:35,120
it guys.

3813
04:31:35,120 --> 04:31:37,400
But all this
this is also the last of that.

3814
04:31:37,400 --> 04:31:41,040
But right now
you guys know all about casting.

3815
04:31:41,040 --> 04:31:43,160
You guys know about the maps.

3816
04:31:43,160 --> 04:31:46,240
You guys know about lists, right? So.

3817
04:31:46,240 --> 04:31:47,520
So it should be easy peasy.

3818
04:31:47,520 --> 04:31:54,040
No, Maybe you guys should try it
after the review class.

3819
04:31:54,040 --> 04:31:57,760
So let me let me just print out
the quantity.

3820
04:31:58,360 --> 04:31:59,000
Quantity.

3821
04:31:59,000 --> 04:32:02,400
And this is the last apple, by the way.

3822
04:32:02,600 --> 04:32:07,960
So you should expect at least this
from the last apple, right? I

3823
04:32:10,920 --> 04:32:11,840
don't say it will

3824
04:32:11,840 --> 04:32:17,080
be not introduce.

3825
04:32:17,080 --> 04:32:19,480
If this is not price

3826
04:32:21,360 --> 04:32:23,720
we should check.

3827
04:32:23,720 --> 04:32:29,960
It might be the quantity right.

3828
04:32:29,960 --> 04:32:33,160
And you guys will be laughing
on these codes

3829
04:32:35,520 --> 04:32:38,960
after a few months.

3830
04:32:38,960 --> 04:32:42,600
So if it is a quantity, then

3831
04:32:43,680 --> 04:32:47,640
what I need to do, I need to update

3832
04:32:48,720 --> 04:32:53,560
this quantity variable.

3833
04:32:53,560 --> 04:32:54,920
Oh, it should be a double.

3834
04:32:54,920 --> 04:32:58,560
By the way.

3835
04:32:58,560 --> 04:33:02,440
And the price can be points right?

3836
04:33:02,440 --> 04:33:05,000
So now I have to do the same

3837
04:33:05,880 --> 04:33:12,040
for the quantity.

3838
04:33:12,040 --> 04:33:15,200
I will feel so much better
if the people that already got

3839
04:33:15,200 --> 04:33:18,200
jobs can't solve it.

3840
04:33:18,440 --> 04:33:20,080
So you, you have Farhad,

3841
04:33:20,080 --> 04:33:29,800
you Guys can try it.

3842
04:33:29,800 --> 04:33:34,600
So I get the price,
I get to the quantity and simple.

3843
04:33:34,840 --> 04:33:37,800
Now I need to multiply that right.

3844
04:33:38,640 --> 04:33:43,200
So say price multiplied by

3845
04:33:44,520 --> 04:33:45,720
quantity.

3846
04:33:46,200 --> 04:33:49,360
All right, easy peasy.

3847
04:33:49,360 --> 04:33:53,840
Are we do this in job site?

3848
04:33:53,840 --> 04:33:56,600
Most probably
you guys will not be doing it,

3849
04:33:57,560 --> 04:34:01,360
but I created this so that deal buys it.

3850
04:34:01,400 --> 04:34:05,160
So it's a combination
of all previous concepts, the cost

3851
04:34:05,160 --> 04:34:09,120
being the the maps, the list, the

3852
04:34:09,200 --> 04:34:14,040
if conditions default, loads of order and
and follow the operators.

3853
04:34:14,480 --> 04:34:19,080
I tried you guys
so that you guys have to do everything

3854
04:34:19,080 --> 04:34:26,640
inside this trap. No

3855
04:34:28,320 --> 04:34:32,960
both of them
need to be able to get the exact output

3856
04:34:32,960 --> 04:34:36,600
order quantities
can't get in the quantities being once

3857
04:34:37,800 --> 04:34:38,200
a month.

3858
04:34:38,200 --> 04:34:40,680
Y y. No, we need

3859
04:34:40,680 --> 04:34:43,200
doubles for both of them

3860
04:34:50,040 --> 04:34:51,720
will not work

3861
04:35:00,880 --> 04:35:03,400
when we don't understand our concepts.

3862
04:35:03,400 --> 04:35:05,240
That will be like

3863
04:35:05,760 --> 04:35:07,880
quantity 10.0 in the solution.

3864
04:35:07,880 --> 04:35:11,600
All Okay. But is that

3865
04:35:26,280 --> 04:35:29,120
I misspelled it in

3866
04:35:35,280 --> 04:35:38,640
better than double or

3867
04:35:44,400 --> 04:35:54,640
double?

3868
04:35:54,640 --> 04:35:57,360
No, this subtotal is still zero.

3869
04:35:57,760 --> 04:35:58,520
Right?

3870
04:35:58,800 --> 04:36:00,240
No. Subtotal ten.

3871
04:36:00,240 --> 04:36:03,400
Subtotal ten.

3872
04:36:03,400 --> 04:36:06,720
No subtotal ten.

3873
04:36:06,720 --> 04:36:09,080
So I think I should

3874
04:36:12,360 --> 04:36:16,120
do this.

3875
04:36:16,120 --> 04:36:19,000
So be printed

3876
04:36:19,680 --> 04:36:21,360
after

3877
04:36:21,360 --> 04:36:28,880
we are done.

3878
04:36:28,880 --> 04:36:32,280
Maybe we will be needing variables to

3879
04:36:33,560 --> 04:36:37,560
store the other variables as well.

3880
04:36:37,560 --> 04:36:55,480
Right.

3881
04:36:55,480 --> 04:36:59,560
Or we can do this.

3882
04:36:59,560 --> 04:37:02,000
Let's keep it inside in here.

3883
04:37:02,000 --> 04:37:06,040
And let's be clear.

3884
04:37:06,040 --> 04:37:09,200
These two things outside of the here.

3885
04:37:09,560 --> 04:37:13,680
So we get the price,
we got the quantity and it

3886
04:37:13,760 --> 04:37:17,720
and then we instead
of printing the account

3887
04:37:19,880 --> 04:37:22,560
in here, let's print

3888
04:37:22,560 --> 04:37:26,400
this last part.

3889
04:37:26,400 --> 04:37:27,480
And here

3890
04:37:30,320 --> 04:37:33,680
I said two days x,

3891
04:37:36,360 --> 04:37:39,320
everything multiplied by 0.000

3892
04:37:39,320 --> 04:37:43,200
unpublished extrapolate,

3893
04:37:43,200 --> 04:37:46,280
please remove this wrapper.

3894
04:37:46,400 --> 04:37:50,240
Okay Let's assume you guys never

3895
04:37:50,240 --> 04:37:52,360
saw this, but

3896
04:37:55,880 --> 04:37:59,200
if I could help

3897
04:38:01,920 --> 04:38:06,000
it. Oh, my God.

3898
04:38:06,000 --> 04:38:08,400
And if

3899
04:38:08,520 --> 04:38:09,840
I don't think so.

3900
04:38:09,840 --> 04:38:14,400
You guys have understood
a single line of this.

3901
04:38:14,400 --> 04:38:17,040
Have you got a single line of this wrapper

3902
04:38:20,240 --> 04:38:23,400
that we have in the last 30 minutes?

3903
04:38:23,440 --> 04:38:38,040
Code up the line.

3904
04:38:39,600 --> 04:38:43,360
It's as you

3905
04:38:43,520 --> 04:38:47,200
you can tell me this before
we spent like 30 minutes, right?

3906
04:38:47,240 --> 04:38:51,840
You guys could have told me
right away in here that asked everything

3907
04:38:51,840 --> 04:38:55,600
that you are writing off,
but that nothing is making sense for us.

3908
04:38:56,320 --> 04:38:57,080
Tell me something.

3909
04:38:57,080 --> 04:39:01,360
Seriously, bro, if we are doing this on
the go, I will not waste my time anymore.

3910
04:39:02,360 --> 04:39:04,720
But this is not

3911
04:39:04,840 --> 04:39:06,880
what you guys will be doing on your dogs.

3912
04:39:07,880 --> 04:39:11,680
And dog is is is very simple jobs.

3913
04:39:11,680 --> 04:39:15,080
They are simple. It's

3914
04:39:18,920 --> 04:39:20,440
all their advice.

3915
04:39:20,440 --> 04:39:23,960
Take some rest.

3916
04:39:23,960 --> 04:39:27,240
Imagine you guys never saw
what I have shown

3917
04:39:27,240 --> 04:39:31,200
in the last 30 minutes.

3918
04:39:31,200 --> 04:39:33,400
But okay, this this was not the.

3919
04:39:33,640 --> 04:39:34,480
No, no, no.

3920
04:39:34,480 --> 04:39:39,200
It is the ad made to.

3921
04:39:39,200 --> 04:39:46,600
So let's say this was not okay,

3922
04:39:46,600 --> 04:39:50,960
but am I'm not allowed to solve
this one as well.

3923
04:39:50,960 --> 04:39:51,680
Right.

3924
04:39:51,760 --> 04:39:54,840
That means my of my efforts. They are not

3925
04:39:56,000 --> 04:39:56,440
real.

3926
04:39:56,440 --> 04:39:57,200
Right.

3927
04:39:57,200 --> 04:39:59,720
At least some of you of the
you guys are able to solve it.

3928
04:40:00,280 --> 04:40:05,240
So I think Simon was also able
to solve it.

3929
04:40:05,240 --> 04:40:07,400
Yes. There we had to quote

3930
04:40:11,160 --> 04:40:12,720
I would share the solution.

3931
04:40:12,720 --> 04:40:17,160
Just have a look at the solution.

3932
04:40:17,160 --> 04:40:20,320
Amid the miserable

3933
04:40:26,440 --> 04:40:28,960
IKEA is desperately waiting for big class

3934
04:40:28,960 --> 04:40:30,240
recording

3935
04:40:34,440 --> 04:40:35,600
that line that said

3936
04:40:35,600 --> 04:40:39,840
store them in variables confused me.

3937
04:40:39,840 --> 04:40:40,120
Okay.

3938
04:40:40,120 --> 04:40:42,600
I hope the mere the confusion is now gone.

3939
04:40:43,800 --> 04:40:48,320
Spent some time honored.

3940
04:40:48,320 --> 04:40:50,520
All right, guys, take some rest. Bye. Bye.

3941
04:40:51,160 --> 04:40:53,280
I was trying to capture them all.

3942
04:40:55,120 --> 04:40:55,840
Have a good day.

3943
04:40:55,840 --> 04:40:57,480
Survived this.

3944
04:40:57,480 --> 04:40:59,840
Bye bye.
