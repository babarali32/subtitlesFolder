1
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,680
All right, guys, let's get started.

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,760
I hope everyone is doing good

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,720
and everyone

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,040
got some rest and completed the homework

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,040
that I gave yesterday.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,360
So how was yesterday's

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,920
class, guys?

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,240
I'm pretty sure everyone loved it.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:56,960
Since we had a lot of stuff to talk about.

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
A new favorite word, pagination. Good

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,960
that everyone completed the homework

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,960
with calendars, text.

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,040
Any questions on the homework

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,040
was a little mixed.

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,160
But then why was it mixed?

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,440
Homework was easier than expected.

17
00:01:34,440 --> 00:02:12,800
Okay.

18
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,080
Sorry. You weren't at yesterday's class.

19
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,360
That's
why we didn't have a lot of fun yesterday.

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,240
Because you were absent?

21
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,360
No, Nobody wanted to talk

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:53,840
yesterday.

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,520
Let's see.

24
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,800
Locating by Exfat works

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:18,120
for web element.

26
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,440
Well, I didn't get the question.

27
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Why? Why? This is.

28
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,760
Oh. CheckBox has the tag input.

29
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,920
Okay.

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,800
Oh. Okay.

31
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,680
Let's check this out.

32
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,640
Okay.

33
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,720
So these checkboxes right.

34
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,240
Okay.

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,880
Let's see. Okay.

36
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,640
So you are.

37
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,320
Let me see.

38
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,440
So you locating the label? Right.

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,280
So you locating the label.

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,960
And when you click on it, it's.

41
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,400
It's getting checked.

42
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,760
Correct? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay.

43
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,600
I see.

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
All right, So here's the thing.

45
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,480
So when when developers built it.

46
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,200
Right.

47
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,880
So when developers built it,
they may throw

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,120
the label and the checkbox itself
on their each other.

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Or they they may.

50
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,320
They may do it
as simply as we have it in here.

51
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,200
Okay.

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,280
So the checkbox itself
has an input in here,

53
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,360
and the label has the label tag in here.

54
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,960
Right.

55
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,120
But even manual, you guys even manually
when you click in here,

56
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,120
if I click on pending approval,
it's getting checked.

57
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,120
Right.

58
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,600
So this is how this is configured, guys.

59
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,200
It's not. It's anything that we can do.

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Okay.

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,640
So this is how it is developed, guys.

62
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,240
Okay.

63
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,560
So even manually, if you click
on the label, the checkbox is getting

64
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,400
is getting
what's called is getting checked.

65
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,280
Okay.

66
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,600
So web element contains of two lines.

67
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,720
No, it's two different web
elements. Right.

68
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,240
One of them is the label off the checkbox.

69
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,640
The other one is the checkbox itself.

70
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,520
But they the functionality is

71
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,520
when you click on the label,

72
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,040
it it checks the checkbox as well.

73
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,360
Okay.

74
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,040
It's it's still two different,
two different elements considered.

75
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
Right.

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,640
But when you click on the

77
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,640
on the label,
it gets checked in the checkbox as well.

78
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,440
Okay.

79
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,920
So that's just a functionality?

80
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,840
Yes. Most of the time with checkboxes
and radio buttons, guys,

81
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,320
even if even if you click on the label,

82
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,000
the checkbox
and radio button gets selected.

83
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,400
Okay. So this is how it's actually built.

84
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,520
You don't have to go inside that
square and check it.

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,040
Okay.

86
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,760
And in

87
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,760
automation, guys, maybe so in automation.

88
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
So you have that if conditions. Right.

89
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
So if you locate the checkbox itself
with input,

90
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,240
you won't be able to have your
if condition.

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,360
So that's why you have to locate the label
so that you have

92
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,640
so that you have the text.

93
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,640
Okay.

94
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,280
All right, guys.

95
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,840
Any questions?

96
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,840
Any other questions?

97
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,600
Okay.

98
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,760
If not, let's do a quick recap, guys,
what we've done.

99
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,680
Last class,
we said one favorite word of pagination.

100
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,600
What else, guys?

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,760
I hope you guys are active.

102
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:35,240
More active today than yesterday.

103
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,600
The thing we have a lot to cover
today. Yes.

104
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,720
We will be covering a lot of stuff
today as well.

105
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,880
Okay.

106
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,880
So yesterday
what we did is we covered calendars,

107
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,640
right?

108
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay.

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,880
Type of calendars
and the pagination of the table.

110
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,200
Right.

111
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,080
So we did a couple examples
for pagination.

112
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,840
We saw what

113
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,480
how the web page

114
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,280
can behave when you change the pages
on the web tables.

115
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,880
Right.

116
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,280
And how what kind of errors we might get

117
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,000
when we change the pages,

118
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,320
when we navigating through the table
pagination.

119
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,760
Right.

120
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,320
Okay. So

121
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,920
and then we've talked
about calendars, guys.

122
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,880
So what does the calendar consist of

123
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,360
if we look in the HTML
guys, what what are we going

124
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,640
to see?

125
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,600
It's it's it's consisted of table, right?

126
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,000
It's similar to table.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,600
We have a header,
we have the tea body, right.

128
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,880
So and we have months and a year.

129
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,760
Right.

130
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,760
So the last time we covered the calendars
here, we had the month and a year

131
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,000
a stored inside that dropdown.

132
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Right.

133
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,440
So today we will be covering a little bit
different calendars.

134
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,120
It's not going to have any dropdowns.

135
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,320
It will have the same

136
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,320
the same structure as we had

137
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,040
last class with dates,
but not with a month and the year.

138
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,720
Any questions from the yesterday's
class guys?

139
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:54,440
Any questions from pagination?

140
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,440
The practice. Okay, good.

141
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,120
All right.

142
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,960
So I'm going to create a new packaging
here.

143
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
Instead, and what I will

145
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
do, I'm going to create a new Java class.

146
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,880
And I'll say

147
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,120
calendar handling.

148
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,640
Okay, So today we're going to be doing

149
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,320
we're going to cover
a couple of different topics.

150
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,280
So what we're going to do today, guys,

151
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,440
we will be handling
another type of the calendar.

152
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,520
Okay.

153
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,440
What we're going to do,
we will be working with the keyboard keys.

154
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,440
Okay.

155
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
We're going to do we're going to take
some screenshots, guys.

156
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,680
And what we're going to do,
we will be going over the actions class.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,640
Okay.

158
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,840
Four different things occur today, so

159
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,240
please pay attention, guys.

160
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
And in the second half of the class guys,

161
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,040
I want you guys to pay
really close attention

162
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,400
because we will be downloading
some jar files.

163
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,320
Okay. So

164
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,880
now let's get started.

165
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,600
And it's

166
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,400
okay.

167
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,000
So, calendars, right?

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,400
So let me go in here.

169
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,600
So we will be working with calendars on

170
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,560
this Web page,
which is the Delta Web page.

171
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:25,840
Right.

172
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,640
So if I click on the calendar,
you can see that

173
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,880
we have two different calendars right
away, two different months, two different

174
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,200
weeks in here. Right.

175
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,720
And the dates we have double.

176
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,720
So in the previous example that we did
yesterday,

177
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,880
the calendar only had one month's inside
that element.

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,440
Right.

179
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
But here we have to deal with both
and we have to keep everything

180
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,280
as dynamic as possible.

181
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,520
Okay.

182
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,360
So, first of all, guys,
whenever you navigate to this website

183
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,080
and you try to
when you click on the calendar,

184
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,720
what are you going to look for?

185
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,800
So let's say you take a vacation.

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,800
What are you going to

187
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,120
fix first in here?

188
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,800
So is it a date? Is it a year?

189
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:31,920
What are you looking for in here?

190
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Departure date and return date.

191
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,840
Okay. Say the year. Okay.

192
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,640
So from to date, The month.

193
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,680
Right.

194
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,840
First of all, what you need to do.

195
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,920
You need to get the right month. Right.

196
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,480
So the left side of your calendar
that we opened right now is going to be

197
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,960
what guys

198
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,560
current months.

199
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,840
But also even
even if I go next, next in here,

200
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,760
what am I going to have on the left side?

201
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,360
Guys?

202
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,640
Departure. Right. Departure date. Okay.

203
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,480
So what I'm going to do on the left side,

204
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,600
I will choose the departure, right?

205
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,520
And then on the right side,
I will choose the return date.

206
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,240
Okay, So first of all, whenever we open up

207
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,040
this calendar, what I need to do,
I need to pick the right month.

208
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,760
So let's say
I'm leaving in December, right?

209
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,720
I'm living in December. So my

210
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,000
my December has to be at the last.

211
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,640
If I'm leaving on 15th,

212
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,680
I need to click on this.

213
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,240
If I'm coming in January,
I need to click on this one.

214
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,240
Right.

215
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,040
So departure is going to be on the left
and the

216
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,920
what's called the return date
will be on the right hand side.

217
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,640
Okay.

218
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,680
Yeah.
You can arrive in the same month. Yes.

219
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,880
But with the with the implementation
today, today

220
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,800
that we're going to be doing,
we won't be arriving the same month.

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,080
Okay.

222
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,880
Because if you do it with the same month,
it's really easy to implement.

223
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,080
So we want something
a little bit advanced.

224
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,720
Right.

225
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,320
So, okay,

226
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,840
so now let's go back to our code.

227
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,960
And here

228
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,520
and let's

229
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,240
copy this

230
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,520
and let's change

231
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:07,040
the world.

232
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
Okay.

233
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,880
So when we navigate to the
to the Delta website,

234
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:21,440
what do we need to do first? US.

235
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,360
Okay, So we need to locate the element

236
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:42,440
which which element
that we're looking for in here.

237
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,320
First of all, what we need to do,
we need to expand the calendar itself.

238
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,360
Right.

239
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,840
So what I need to do,
I need to locate this calendar in here

240
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,800
and what I need to do,

241
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
I need to

242
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,080
click on it right so that I can get it
expanded.

243
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,200
Okay.

244
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:13,920
So let's see what we can use in here.

245
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,000
Or we go.

246
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,840
Seems like
there is an idea that we can use, right?

247
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,080
So let's take a look at the idea in here
or let's just

248
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,640
calendar label another label, Right.

249
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,080
Okay, that's fine. We can use this.

250
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,440
All right.
So let me copy this idea in here.

251
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,920
Let's go back to our script. Right.

252
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,040
So create a web element in here.

253
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,240
Calendar is equal to.

254
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,520
I forgot.

255
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,320
Find element.

256
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,880
I place this here,

257
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,120
and what I simply need to do

258
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,840
is simply need to click on it
so that I can have it expanded.

259
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,560
Right.

260
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,040
Okay, So let's go back in here.

261
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,720
Let's actually refresh

262
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,160
so that everywhere

263
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,640
everything gets the default.

264
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,800
All right.

265
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,320
So let's click on this.

266
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,760
All right.

267
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:22,880
All right.

268
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,600
So when I expand this, okay,
would I expand this?

269
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,760
So let's decide

270
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:40,440
when we'll leave in first.

271
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,040
It's October right now.

272
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:50,280
So let's go ahead.

273
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,160
It's October right now. So let's go.

274
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,280
Let's go in December.

275
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,440
Okay, Let's go in December
so that we can have more manipulation

276
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,480
inside the

277
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,280
inside the calendar.

278
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,560
Okay. So.

279
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,880
So before

280
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,680
I. Before I do anything, guys,

281
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,080
what I need to do,
I need to go to December.

282
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,160
Right.

283
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:28,560
In order to do so,
what do I need to do, guys?

284
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,440
I need to click the arrow. Right?

285
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,640
So what I need to do in order

286
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,160
for me to click the arrow,
I need to first locate this.

287
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,000
Right?

288
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,720
So let's locate this.

289
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,680
We have a text in here.

290
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,520
So what we can do,
we can simply create a next path, right?

291
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,080
So let's see. It has an

292
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,440
tag in here, and text

293
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,440
is equal to

294
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,000
next, right? It's one of one.

295
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,040
It is unique.

296
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,400
So what we can do is

297
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,200
we can simply copy that X path.

298
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,320
All right.

299
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,240
And let me create a web element,

300
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
next button,

301
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,560
and let's create this

302
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,240
X path.

303
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,160
There we go.

304
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,200
So we have this element, right?

305
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,480
So now, in order for me to go
to the right months, what do I need to do?

306
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:49,320
Guys?

307
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,400
Which

308
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,920
what do I need to have on hand right now?

309
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:03,480
Guys, it's like twice.

310
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,840
Well, right now,
if we click twice on this,

311
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,920
we know that it's it's
going to be a hard coding, right?

312
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,480
So we don't want to click twice, right?

313
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,000
What if we change the month later on?

314
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,200
So before we get to the month, guys,
what do we need to know?

315
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,840
We need to know the months.

316
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:30,120
What we have on the left side,

317
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:40,080
you don't see my screen.

318
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,440
Okay, I'll get All right.

319
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,800
Okay, guys.

320
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,920
So what we need to do,
we need to make do we need to know

321
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,640
the month of our departure first, Right?

322
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,240
So what I'm going to do, guys,
I'm going to go ahead in here

323
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,760
and I need to get this this month.

324
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,920
Right.

325
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,600
So what I can do in here

326
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,320
and we click until December

327
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,800
found not really right.

328
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,200
We won't be doing it this way. Okay.

329
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,680
So what I need to do in here,
how am I going to.

330
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,320
How am I going to locate this element?

331
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,080
Dice in here?

332
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,160
So I have a I have a span tag.

333
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,720
I have a text which is October,
but I want to keep this as dynamic

334
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,520
as possible.

335
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,040
How am I going to do this in here?

336
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,880
It doesn't matter
what text I have in there.

337
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:57,360
I need to locate that element.

338
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
Okay, Before we get text, how am I?

339
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,680
Am I supposed to locate this element

340
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,320
by simply class name?

341
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,680
Right. We have a class name in here.

342
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,840
Right. Okay.

343
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,760
So copy this.

344
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,400
All right, let's go back in here.

345
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,520
So what I am going to do is

346
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,720
departure months, right?

347
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,320
Is equal to driver.

348
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,680
The find element

349
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,760
by class name.

350
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,000
And I'll just paste this class
name in here.

351
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
So now this is my element.

352
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,320
So now what I need to do, I need to have
that element's value, right?

353
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,240
So I need to have
the text of that element.

354
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,760
So what I will do,
I will simply create a string in here.

355
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,800
Departure month text

356
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,920
is equal to

357
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,880
departure months.

358
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,360
Get text,

359
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,320
right?

360
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,800
We're not we're not clicking on anything
right now.

361
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,840
Right.

362
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,520
We will be clicking

363
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,960
a little bit later.

364
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,720
Okay.

365
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,400
So now, guys, okay,
so we opened up a we opened up.

366
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,760
Let's go back here.

367
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,400
We opened up a calendar in here.

368
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,560
So now we know when we'll leave.

369
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,600
We know
that we're leaving in December, Right?

370
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,760
But we don't know how many times I need

371
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,800
to click in here.

372
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,720
Okay.

373
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,160
So what do we have to use in this case
in order for me

374
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:53,200
to get to December in here, guys? Why?

375
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,960
Right. Because.

376
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Because in white loop,
you don't know how many times

377
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,040
you will be click
or how many times you will be iterating.

378
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,280
Right.

379
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,680
Okay, So let's go back in here.

380
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,960
So what I am going to do
is create a wire loop.

381
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,640
What am I going to have inside
my condition?

382
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:34,200
Guys in here, Boolean value.

383
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,240
Okay, What kind of what would be

384
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,240
visible text is not in December.

385
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,760
Okay.

386
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,360
Okay.

387
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,480
Really good. Right.

388
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,720
So what I will have and here

389
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,200
I need to compare the text that I got

390
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,800
and the x all departure months
that we want to go.

391
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,600
Right.

392
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,040
And in this case
it's going to be December.

393
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,840
So in order for me to perform
any action in here,

394
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,920
my months cannot be equal to December.

395
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,920
Right.

396
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,040
If it equal,
if it's going to be equal to December,

397
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,200
then I don't need to perform
any actions in here.

398
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,320
Right.

399
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,760
So in here, guys, what I need to do,

400
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,840
I'm just going to put an exclamation mark

401
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,840
and say that while my month
is not equal to December,

402
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,920
only then what I will do,
I'll go ahead and click

403
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,240
on the next button.

404
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,080
Is that clear, guys?

405
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,920
Any questions?

406
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,160
Okay, so now let me run this.

407
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,600
Okay, Let's run
this and see what we're going to have.

408
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,720
So if I run this right
now, what's going to happen

409
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,760
are we're going to stop

410
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,280
in December, guys?

411
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:13,200
Well, we should write.

412
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,880
Okay.

413
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Navigated here.

414
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,400
Okay.

415
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:33,240
What's going on, guys?

416
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,520
Okay.

417
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,240
I think it failed right now.

418
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,360
Line 20.

419
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,920
Okay.
It couldn't locate the element, right?

420
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,000
We have no such element exception.

421
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,160
Okay, So let's go back in here.

422
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,440
Let's check the element

423
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,560
again.

424
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:58,920
Okay.

425
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,000
There we go.

426
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,800
Input.

427
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,840
So see, guys, this is different now.

428
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,200
Okay,

429
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,000
so if you look in here, guys,

430
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,560
the ID that I chose before,
it was input return date.

431
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,920
Now it's input departure date y
because we have

432
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,720
we did some choosing in here.

433
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,000
That's why it might have changed.

434
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,680
Okay, so let me run this again

435
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:53,040
and see if this is going to change again.

436
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,840
Okay. Now it clicked.

437
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,800
All right.

438
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,240
You can see, guys, that it's
it keeps clicking

439
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:05,320
until the next button is what?

440
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,680
Until it gets disabled.

441
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Right. So it's key. It's keeping

442
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,160
to click
on this button until it gets disabled.

443
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,520
And you can see that
it's August 20, 22 already.

444
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
So we don't need this.

445
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,680
We only need December 2021.

446
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,640
Right.

447
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,120
So how can we fix this issue?

448
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,480
What do you guys think?

449
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,680
What is going on in here

450
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,680
and break the loop?

451
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,040
We don't need to break the loop
right in here

452
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,960
because whenever this condition
is not met,

453
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:51,480
it's going to be clicking.

454
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,520
If you put December 2021, it's
not going to work, right?

455
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,400
Because let's open this up.

456
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,840
So in here, guys, what we did,
we only located the month,

457
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
month
and a year are two different in here.

458
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:18,960
Okay, so we only located the month.

459
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,560
Any thoughts?

460
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,600
Nice.

461
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
Let's go back to the code.

462
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:44,480
And here.

463
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,640
Okay. So

464
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,960
could the year.

465
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,800
We don't need the year, right, guys?

466
00:29:52,800 --> 00:30:02,760
We don't really care about the right now.

467
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,680
Okay, guys, here's the thing in here.

468
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,520
When I go to my first iteration,
what is my month text in here?

469
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,240
Guys,

470
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,360
let's go step by step.

471
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,960
Okay, So when I first start my iteration,
I open up a calendar.

472
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,680
So I got the text right.

473
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,960
What is my text
in the first iteration, guys?

474
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,520
October. Right?

475
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,720
So, okay.

476
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
Does it equal to December?

477
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,200
No. Okay, I'm going to click. Okay.

478
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,560
So when I go to my second iteration,

479
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,160
what is my month in here guys?

480
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,120
Is it

481
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,560
is it November guys?

482
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,880
It is still going to be October

483
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,360
because after each iteration,

484
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,440
we're not checking
what text we have in here.

485
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,280
Okay.

486
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,800
We're
not updating the text inside our script.

487
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,280
So what we need to do in here
after we click in here,

488
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,680
we need to re assign this variable

489
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,040
and we need to get that text again.

490
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,560
Okay.

491
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,960
So now after second,
after the first iteration, I get the text.

492
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,520
It is November now.

493
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,080
So now we're checking November.

494
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,720
It's not December, so click Now it's going
now I'm going to get the text again.

495
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,520
And now it is December
and I will not go inside the Y.

496
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,560
Okay, So let's run this and see

497
00:31:48,560 --> 00:32:02,160
if this is going to work.

498
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,280
A navigated here. There you go.

499
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,960
So now what happened
is we stopped in December

500
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,160
and our December is at the left side.

501
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,480
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

502
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,240
Any questions on this?

503
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,160
Pretty easy, right?

504
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,120
Okay, so let's close this.

505
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,920
So now what we need to do in here,
we chose our we know where and what month.

506
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,800
We'll leave it.

507
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:42,120
Now, what we need to do,
we need to choose the departure date.

508
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,000
That is why
we don't get the expected outcome.

509
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,800
Absolutely right. Yes.

510
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,840
So here, every time you click
on the next button, what you need to do,

511
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,160
you need to get the text
so that this variable gets updated.

512
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,240
Okay.

513
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,560
If you don't do this,
this variable will always stay

514
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,520
as October.

515
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,240
Okay.

516
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,920
All right.

517
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,840
So now what we need to do is

518
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,320
we need to come up with a date
when we're leaving.

519
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,240
Right. So December 2021, in here.

520
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,280
So now what we need to do,
we need to start looking inside the dates.

521
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,840
All right, so let's go back in here.

522
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,760
Let's see what we got.

523
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,800
So this is my table.

524
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,640
All right, so where do I need to
go in order for me to start

525
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,840
what's called

526
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,120
to start choosing my date? Guys

527
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,360
t body.

528
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,240
Right. So

529
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,000
here, guys,
since this is the table, right?

530
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,960
And the same table is applicable
on the return guys,

531
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,040
so the only thing that I can go

532
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,600
is going to be the T body, right?

533
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,520
So we can simply find the T body
because it has a class attribute in here.

534
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,280
So let's check if this is going to be
unique enough for us.

535
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:19,840
Right.

536
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,880
Instead of going from the table,
what I can do in here,

537
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,360
I can simply go start with t body

538
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,520
and let's put a class in here.

539
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,360
C let me copy this

540
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,080
basis in here.

541
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,560
Okay, so this is one of one.

542
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,720
So pretty good.

543
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,480
It's unique
enough for us to use it, right?

544
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,800
So what do I need to do next?

545
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,920
So I located my body.

546
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,080
What is my next step?

547
00:34:52,600 --> 00:35:03,040
So I just leave it like this.

548
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,800
Store it in a less.

549
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,120
Okay. The whole body.

550
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,320
This is one element.

551
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,920
Why do I need a list?

552
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,000
We need to go through the data. Right.

553
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,600
So first of all,
I need to go through the rows in here

554
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,600
and then I have to go through the dates.

555
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,120
Right.

556
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,560
So there you go.

557
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,720
So now we have in here, I'm going through

558
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,120
each and every date in here. Right?

559
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,560
So let me copy this now. Okay.

560
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,360
So now what we can do with this,
We can store this inside

561
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:48,080
the list of web elements right?

562
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,880
Some element we can say

563
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,800
departure dates

564
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
for the

565
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,840
x path

566
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,720
is this X factor in here

567
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,040
and less import this list.

568
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,200
Util. Okay. What's wrong guys in here

569
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,280
find elements right now so

570
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,640
this should resolve the issue in here.

571
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,200
Okay. So what do I need to do next? Okay.

572
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,080
I have all the dates inside the container.

573
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,680
What am I going to do next?

574
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,320
We need to loop. Right.

575
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,360
So let's try to for loop in here.

576
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,560
All right.

577
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,000
So I am

578
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,080
iterating through elements

579
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,120
for departure date

580
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:55,240
departure dates, and here.

581
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,280
Okay, so now what date our leaving guys

582
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,680
want to go on? 19.

583
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,200
Okay, so let's go in 19th. Right.

584
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,360
So if we want to go on 19th, how,
how do we want to do this

585
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,360
and f condition.

586
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,680
Right.

587
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,160
So I'll put an f condition here.

588
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,680
So what I'll do departure date,
what I need to do

589
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,320
first I need to get the text
and then I need to compare it to the

590
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,240
my expected one and here.

591
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,320
Right.

592
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,840
And then what I need to do,
I simply need to click on it.

593
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,480
And after I click it, guys,
what I need to do,

594
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,160
I need to stop my iteration
and break the loop.

595
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,760
Right?

596
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,160
Okay, so now let's run
this and see if we can get December 19th

597
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:18,160
on our calendar.

598
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,440
December.

599
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,000
There we go.

600
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,160
So we clicked on 19th.

601
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,800
We navigate it to December
and we clicked on 19.

602
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,760
Right? Pretty cool, right?

603
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,760
So we don't know how many times
we need to click.

604
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,360
We set the condition, we built the logic,

605
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,800
and we don't have to do any hard
coding in here, right?

606
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,520
So we we chose
what day we're going to be departing.

607
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,440
So now what we need to do,
we need to choose

608
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,000
what date we will be coming back right?

609
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,760
So in this case, what we need to do,
we need to focus

610
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,480
on the right hand side of our calendar.

611
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,440
Right. So when are we coming back?

612
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,920
Now, guys.

613
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,240
When do you guys want to come back?

614
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,800
Never.

615
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Should we just buy a one way

616
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,520
ticket. So

617
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
a month vacation.

618
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,440
Okay, so let's come back on February,
right?

619
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,480
Depends where we go.

620
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,920
We don't. We don't even know that. Okay,
So we don't know.

621
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,280
We don't know where we go. And guys.

622
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,520
Okay, so

623
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,840
let's come back.

624
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,240
Let's come back. Maybe.

625
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,360
Yeah, February should be fine, right?

626
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,840
So if we want to come back in February,
you guys.

627
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:51,200
So what do I need to do in here?

628
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,840
Do I have to

629
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,840
locate this next arrow again in here?

630
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,240
Guys?

631
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:02,920
No. Right.

632
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,920
We don't need that because we already have
that variable stored in our code.

633
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,640
What I need to do, I need to locate
the month on the right hand side.

634
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,680
Okay?

635
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,440
Okay, So let's go ahead and see in here.

636
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,680
Okay,
So I think we can use this class in here.

637
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,240
So what I will do, copy this.

638
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,800
Go back in here

639
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,880
and I'll create another web element.

640
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,920
And I'll say return

641
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,040
months is equal to forever

642
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,120
find element

643
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,400
like class name

644
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,320
basis in here.

645
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,680
Right.

646
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,360
So and then what I need to do,

647
00:40:53,360 --> 00:41:02,080
I need to get the text right.

648
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,320
I want to try to find

649
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:15,120
elements.

650
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,720
Text. Okay.

651
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,320
All right.

652
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,640
Okay.

653
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,840
Do we have to locate the year as well?

654
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,760
Guys? And here.

655
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:34,120
What do you guys think?

656
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,720
No. Right.

657
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,640
Because we're looking at the first
February that is coming in our calendar.

658
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,760
We don't really care about the year.

659
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,000
Even even though
if you want to come back in January,

660
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,640
I mean, if February 2023,
you won't be able to go there right.

661
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,440
Because the I think

662
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,200
the calendars on the

663
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,200
slight website, they're only
for nine month or something like this.

664
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,760
Okay.

665
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,320
So you can't really book
any tickets in advance of three years.

666
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,200
Okay.

667
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,480
Okay.

668
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,560
So we're just going to be looking
at the next available temporary in here.

669
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,800
Okay. So I got the text.

670
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:25,360
What do I need to do now, guys, look

671
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,760
at the table.

672
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,800
We need another while, right?

673
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,120
So we need to start
clicking on the next button

674
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,480
so that we can get the right month
and the right,

675
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,640
the right calendar on the right hand side.

676
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,480
Right.

677
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,800
So what I'm going to do,
I'll have a while in here, Right?

678
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:53,480
And the same way as we did
in our departure.

679
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,280
So month tax is not equal to

680
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,240
February, right?

681
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,760
What we will be doing
will be clicking on the next button

682
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,920
and at the very same time,
what we need to do,

683
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,720
we need to get the text
after each iteration.

684
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,640
We didn't talk about the date yet.

685
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,760
We know that we're coming in February.

686
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,920
Now, what we want to know,
We want to know what date

687
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,200
we're coming back.

688
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,720
Okay, so here we're on February.
What date?

689
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:43,840
We're coming back, guys.

690
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,360
31st. Good one.

691
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,720
Yes, 31st.

692
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,440
Okay.

693
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,240
All right. So let's come back.

694
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,360
I'm 20, right?

695
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,440
So let's come back on 28th.

696
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,960
So what I am going to do now, let's locate

697
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,000
this.

698
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,320
Let's see.

699
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,280
Let's see the table in here.

700
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,160
Okay, So we got the table.

701
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,160
So the same way as we did with the other

702
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,280
or what's called

703
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,040
with the other table in here.

704
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,720
So what I can do, I can simply go ahead
and change that class name in here,

705
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,680
and I will, I will copy this

706
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,760
and what I can do.

707
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,960
I'm going to store everything in the Web
element and list of web elements.

708
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,200
All right.

709
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:54,000
And and dates, elements.

710
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,440
I express

711
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,760
pasted in here.

712
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,000
Right.

713
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,720
So once we have everything stored
inside the list, what I am going to do,

714
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,120
I will simply iterate
through each and every date.

715
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,640
All right, element

716
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,560
turn, date

717
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,360
dates in here.

718
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,680
And then what I will have I'll have an if

719
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,960
condition and here

720
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,400
I need to get the text

721
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,880
and then I need to compare with

722
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,480
this date that will be coming back

723
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
and then

724
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,040
I will simply be collecting and

725
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,520
breaking my information.

726
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,120
All right.

727
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,080
Okay.

728
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,880
So let's run this

729
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,280
and see if we can get the expected result

730
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,000
and navigating.

731
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:21,760
Now, December 19th, February 28.

732
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,840
Right. Pretty cool. Right, guys?

733
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,600
So we'll leave it on December 19th
and coming back on February 28th.

734
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,960
Okay.

735
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,800
Any questions, guys?

736
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,480
Any questions on how to handle

737
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,040
calendars?

738
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,000
All clear. Good.

739
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,400
So now the last thing that I want to do in

740
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,160
here is just to click the dump
button, right?

741
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,400
So what I am going to do

742
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,360
is just locate this.

743
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,160
There is a class name in here or just done
button, so I'm going to copy this

744
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,080
and I'll have another web element

745
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,600
forever

746
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,560
Elements, Last name.

747
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,320
It's all right then.

748
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,560
Button that.

749
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:37,840
All right, All right.

750
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,480
Okay, guys, Any questions on here, guys?

751
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,840
Hopefully not,
because it's pretty easy logic, right?

752
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,960
Getting focusing on the departure first.

753
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,680
Then we will be focusing on return
for a second

754
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,920
and we will be clicking on done.

755
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,080
Okay.

756
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,960
All right.

757
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,840
No question.

758
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,240
So let's move forward. Right.

759
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,000
So there's one more thing
that I want to show you guys

760
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,120
right now is

761
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,320
how to work with the keys on the keyboard.

762
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,600
Okay. While writing this script.

763
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,360
Okay.

764
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,280
So working

765
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:33,160
with keys.

766
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:38,160
Okay,
so let me grab something out the X path

767
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,600
for the audience.

768
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:42,960
Okay.

769
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,480
Good for

770
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,200
copy this.

771
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,280
Is it in here?

772
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:56,840
Okay.

773
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,160
All right, guys.

774
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,040
We all know this website, right?

775
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,280
We all
we did a couple of examples on this.

776
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,720
So let's see.

777
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:06,960
Let me open this up.

778
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,520
And you. Okay, guys.

779
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,240
So this is the website. We know.

780
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,280
We know the log in and password, right?

781
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,080
So what we're going to be doing in here,
guys,

782
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,480
we will be entering the username
and password right.

783
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,800
Can I sent the link or go

784
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,360
and the previous code.

785
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:44,200
There you go.

786
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:44,520
All right.

787
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,640
I guess so.

788
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,360
Here.

789
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,600
Well, we navigate here manually, guys

790
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,280
and I type in the first name.

791
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,560
How am I going to get to the next
available

792
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,160
textbooks without going in here by mouse?

793
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,360
Guys, just have a tab, right?

794
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,280
So if you click if you hit tab right now,
I'm going to be moving

795
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,960
to the next available textbox, right?

796
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,560
And then when I enter my password as well

797
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,280
without clicking on law again button,

798
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:27,200
what can I do in here, guys?

799
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,880
Enter Key.

800
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,160
Right?

801
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,520
So if I click enter, I will be logging in.

802
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,280
Right? So.

803
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,320
So there is a way to do this same thing,

804
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,600
which by writing is selenium, correct?

805
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,760
Okay.

806
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,560
So what we are doing in here,

807
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,920
we're navigating here,
we have a username and password, right?

808
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,480
So we're sending keys in here.

809
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,040
So after I send keys, guys, what I will

810
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,840
do, I will need to hit tab, right?

811
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,600
So it's going to be pretty simple In order

812
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,400
for me to hit the tab
after I enter my username,

813
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,280
I'm going to put a comma in here
and what I will do, I will do keys.

814
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,680
That tab.

815
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,000
But as you can see in here,
right after I type in keys guys in here

816
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,000
you can see there's
a lot of different keys

817
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,800
that you can use users tab and add in here
there is arrow down

818
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,680
last, there's a backspace in here, right?

819
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,720
So there's control,
there's delete, there's

820
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,640
a lot of different keys
that you can use from keys

821
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,240
from keys class.

822
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:39,880
Right.

823
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,360
So in this case
what I am going to do in here just hit tab

824
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,640
and after I enter my password in here,

825
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,080
what I need to do, same thing in here.

826
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,400
Keys that enter right here.

827
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,520
I'm clicking tab,
moving on to the next available text box

828
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,520
and then hit then enter
when I enter my password.

829
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,080
Right.

830
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,600
So let's run this

831
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,960
in here

832
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,000
you go.

833
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
We're locked in right pretty quick.

834
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,720
Right.

835
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,520
So if we're doing this right,
if we do tab,

836
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,560
if we do keys enter,
why do we need that clicking there, guys?

837
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,760
Why do we have to click on the log
in button

838
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,600
all without this one?

839
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,320
So after you tab without this.

840
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,360
No, that's.

841
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,640
There's no logic behind that.

842
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,080
Right.
What are you going to be sending keys for

843
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,480
or you mean right after this one?

844
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,120
Right after this one.

845
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,600
If you're talking about this one, it's
not going to happen because what

846
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,720
you need to do,
you're sending keys in here

847
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,760
and you want to know what element
you're sending it for.

848
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:45,120
Okay.

849
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,200
The point of the tab is
this is just an extra.

850
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,240
I want it to show that this exists.

851
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:59,520
Okay? Yes.

852
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,120
So yes, correct.

853
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,280
So if you click on tab,
you're switching the tab.

854
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,720
I mean, you're
switching the text boxes, right?

855
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:13,160
But when you switch the text box, you need
to tell selenium where to send the keys.

856
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:13,840
Right.

857
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,600
Still, you're just switching the

858
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,520
what's called your cursor

859
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,520
to the next to the next available
text box.

860
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,360
Okay. You're not finding that element.

861
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,320
Okay.

862
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,480
Because for you visually, you understand
that.

863
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,280
Okay, my personal is on this
on the next textbox,

864
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,320
but your selenium will not understand
that.

865
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,080
Okay.

866
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:43,000
So this is these keys that tab keys
that enter and everything.

867
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
These will work
most of the time with the robot class.

868
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,520
Okay.

869
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,760
If you use tab,
you have to find the element. Yes.

870
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,880
In any time
you will need to find that element

871
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,040
because your selenium
will not know what element you're on onto.

872
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:09,400
Okay.

873
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:09,600
Yeah.

874
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:15,160
So no point is just extra that so
that you guys know that this things exist.

875
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:16,920
Okay.

876
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,760
So you can manipulate with the keyboard
keys as well in your

877
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,560
in your selenium script

878
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,760
so far there's no point of tab in here.

879
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:30,920
Okay.

880
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,480
But if I click on Enter Guys

881
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,800
what's the point of having actual click?

882
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,160
So I don't have I don't have to locate
the login button in here

883
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,840
and I'm just hitting enter
and I'm logging in.

884
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,440
Okay,

885
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,480
but what would be the difference, guys?

886
00:55:52,480 --> 00:56:06,960
Is there anything that I'm going
to be missing at that point?

887
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,360
I want stored where

888
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,400
I want stored as a variable?

889
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Okay.

890
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,360
So okay, guys,
let's put the question like this

891
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,240
What's the point of doing keys
that enter and doing

892
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,760
log in button dot click.

893
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,280
What would be the difference between this

894
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
exactly?

895
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,680
You're testing
if the functionality of the button works.

896
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,120
Absolutely right. Okay.

897
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,000
So when you click in
here, when you have a log in,

898
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,440
log in, button, double click in here,

899
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,320
you testing the functionality
of the button.

900
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,080
Okay.

901
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,840
And when you hit enter,
sometimes when you hit enter, enter,

902
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,560
it might log in, but when you click
on the log in button, it might not work.

903
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,920
And your job is to find out

904
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,880
what actual functionality
that button is performing.

905
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,920
Okay,

906
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:51,320
any questions on that?

907
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,480
All right. No questions.

908
00:57:52,480 --> 00:58:09,760
Good.

909
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,040
Shouldn't you test both features?

910
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:12,600
Not really.

911
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,480
When you do an automation,
you don't have to do this, okay?

912
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,320
You don't have to do this kind of stuff.

913
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,280
When you're doing automation, it's always,
always

914
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,080
recommended to perform

915
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,640
to use the selenium methods
as click or send keys or whatever.

916
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:46,920
This yes, this is just a no.

917
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,120
This is an additional thing
that you should know, guys.

918
00:58:51,120 --> 00:59:06,840
Okay, I don't think you will be
using this, but this is just in case.

919
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,280
Yep. Click makes sense for automation
purposes.

920
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:21,800
That is correct.

921
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:29,360
All right, guys, any other questions?

922
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,240
All right, guys.
So what we're going to do now,

923
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,880
it's 805.

924
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,520
Let's take a quick break.

925
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,800
Okay.
We're going to take a 15 minute break.

926
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,880
And then when we come back, guys,
I want everybody to be ready at 820

927
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,440
because will be downloading some draft
files.

928
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,400
And I want you to follow me in that. Okay.

929
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,360
So we will be downloading some draft files
in order to take some screenshots.

930
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,600
Okay, guys.

931
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,920
So take a break right now.

932
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,920
Come back at 820.

933
01:00:05,920 --> 01:15:19,240
Cool.

934
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,360
Okay, guys, let's continue.

935
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,120
Yeah, I hope everyone is back

936
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,680
and let's get to downloading

937
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:36,240
some dark files.

938
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,040
All right?

939
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:38,360
Okay.

940
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:42,240
So first of all, guys,
please pay attention

941
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:46,320
to where I'm going to download it from
and how I'm going to import it.

942
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:51,080
I mean, I think you guys already should
know how to import some of our files.

943
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,920
Intelligent, right? Or to your project.

944
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,360
Okay, So

945
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:01,080
what I'm going to do in here, guys, I will

946
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,280
add the new tab of the chrome.

947
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,800
I will simply

948
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,200
type in maven repo.

949
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,240
Okay, enter.

950
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:16,120
So the first link that you have
is maven repository dot com.

951
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,120
Okay.

952
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,400
So I'm going to click on that.

953
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,080
Okay.

954
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,120
So is everybody navigate it to maven
repository guys.

955
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:30,120
Does everyone on the same page?

956
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,880
Okay, good.

957
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:32,400
All right.

958
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,040
So now there is a search bar in here.

959
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:39,120
What I am going to do,
I'm going to search for comments

960
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,360
space.

961
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,080
I'll make it enter

962
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:49,600
and you're going to see
a couple of common libraries in here.

963
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,800
Okay.

964
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,080
But what we need in here,
we need the first one.

965
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,800
Apache Common IO.

966
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,480
Okay, so click on the first link here.

967
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,560
Okay?

968
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,640
You should be seeing
all the versions in here.

969
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,840
Are we all on the same page?

970
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:12,160
Base?

971
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,440
Okay, good.

972
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,280
So now what I will get,

973
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,480
I think rather than the latest stable one,

974
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:42,160
I am going to click on the 2.8.0.

975
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:42,560
Okay.

976
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,520
You went to the page search for Common IO.

977
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,600
Okay.

978
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:55,800
And click on the Apache commas. IO.

979
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,080
It should be the same for Mac and Windows.

980
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:03,760
Yes. Okay.

981
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,080
Navigate to the link guys.

982
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:16,680
Okay.

983
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,160
Just complete the capture

984
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,000
in there.

985
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:20,960
Just click.

986
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,360
I'm not URL back and it should navigate it

987
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:36,800
to the right page.

988
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:40,880
Oh, because what you're doing is
you're you're,

989
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,040
you're accessing the chrome

990
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:47,680
which you open with your selenium.

991
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,440
Okay so that's why I probably.

992
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,400
Okay the version 2.80 in here.

01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,800
Okay. 2.8.0.

it's going to download this.

1005
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,720
If it's asking if it's harmful
and all that stuff, just click on

1006
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:41,680
Keep.

1007

Okay, good.

All right.

1053
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,360
So what I want you to do,
there is a plus sign at the bottom.

1054
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,800
Okay?

1055
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,520

You will see a couple of

01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,440
jar files in here.

1061
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,040
Okay.

1062
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,520

Okay, let's see.

Can you try a different browser?

1073
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,760
Seems like you're downloading an edge.

1074
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,760
Try chrome instead and

1075
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,960
see if that's going to work

1076
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:51,480
because seems like

1077
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:54,000
edge is preventing you
to download something in here.

1078
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,240
So you need to
you need to undo in settings

1079
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:03,640
and delete that.

1080
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,560
Yeah, that's a good one.

1081
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:10,000
Okay guys, we're all at the same
on the same page right now.

1082
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
So now what you want to do,
you want to navigate

1083
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:16,680
to the, to the place

1084
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,840
where your jar file is downloaded.

1085
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,000
Mine is already saved
inside the documents.

1086
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:27,240
So since you guys are just downloaded it,
it should be inside

1087
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:37,080
your downloads folder.

1088
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:37,880
Okay.

1089
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,520
If you do that, click

1090
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:43,120
when you navigate to download,

1091
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,200

1092
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,040
and click on open

1093
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,760

01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,000
That's yes.

1095
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:12,040
You could just apply and then click okay.

01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:12,480
All right.

1097
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:17,120
Once you've done this guys,
you will see this common IO in here.

1098
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,720

yeah, you could check that.

1102
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:49,840
That's fine.

1103
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:59,360
Yeah.

1104
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:02,280
All right. Okay, guys,

1105
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,880
You go to file,
you go to project structure.

1106
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,480
Okay?

1107
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,640
You make sure you are under the modules

1108
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:15,640

01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:29,880
out to test it a little tested later.

1130
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:32,360
Okay.

1131
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:45,040

Okay.

1133
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:48,400
Anyone behind guys

1134
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:25,480
cannot select the jar file.

1135
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:26,280
Okay. There you go.

1136
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:30,000
Refresh your page and retry
and it will appear.

1137
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,120
Okay, good.

1138
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,400
Try that and see if that's going to work

1139
01:29:44,480 --> 01:30:11,760
or let me see.

1140
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,280
Okay.

1141
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:17,280
So when you did it, when you went to
Project Structure, did you click on Jars

1142
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:20,200
or directories
or you clicked on different things?

1143
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:31,440
There's two more other options.

1144
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,240
Okay, You got it.

1145
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:37,200
Good.

1146
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:37,920
Okay.

1147
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,320
So everyone is good, right?

1148
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,320
Everyone in for it.

1149
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:47,520
All good.

1150
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,960
Okay, Nice.

1151
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,920
Okay, so what I am going to do right now,
I'm going to create a new class in here

1152
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,000
and I will name it as taking

1153
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:03,400
screenshots.

1154
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:08,760
Okay, So, yeah, we'll see
until it doesn't work later.

1155
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:11,080
Exactly. Good point.

1156
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:15,400
Okay, so now, guys.

1157
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,920
So now before we dive into taking
screenshots,

1158
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,720
let's finish up with calendars in here

1159
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:26,880
and let's go, I didn't create a notes.

1160
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,000
Okay, So let's create a file

1161
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,640
in here.

1162
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,480
Last notes to right

1163
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:45,080
as. All right, guys.

1164
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:49,080
So now let's put everything step

1165
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:52,320
by step on how to handle the calendars.

1166
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,640
This.

1167
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,240
Okay, so we have a calendar.

1168
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:01,280
What do we need to do first, guys?

1169
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,840
We navigate, let's say

1170
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,480
let's take an example
from the Delta, okay?

1171
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,240
So we navigate it to Delta.

1172
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:14,320
What did we do first,
we need to expand the calendar, right?

1173
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:18,640
So in order to expand it,
what we need to do, we can simply click

1174
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,560
on the calendar, right?

1175
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,760
So click on calendar.

1176
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,200
It's going to expand the calendar.

1177
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,400
Okay.

1178
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:28,600
All right.

1179
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,280
So now what do we need to do next?

1180
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:45,920
What are we looking for in here
on our next step?

1181
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:48,240
So we expanded the calendar now.

1182
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:52,360
So now we're looking for our month, right?

1183
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,480
We need to choose the month.

1184
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,440
Okay. So what we need to do,

1185
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,480
locate the month.

1186
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,720
And in our script, what we need to do.

1187
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,440
We need to get the text

1188
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:09,000
right.

1189
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,240
So once we got
the text would have everything on hand.

1190
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:21,360
What is the next step, guys,
we need to set a condition.

1191
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:22,320
Right?

1192
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:28,320
So our condition would be
if the desired text is not visible,

1193
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:32,400
what we're going to be doing,
we will be clicking on next.

1194
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:33,600
Right.

1195
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:39,240
So if the text

1196
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:43,280
is not

1197
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,440
visible right, what we're going to do,

1198
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:48,680
we will keep

1199
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,320
clicking on next.

1200
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:53,880
Right? Okay.

1201
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,240
Once with found our months,

1202
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:02,600
what do we need to do?

1203
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:06,360
Let's put it here as soon as

1204
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:13,680
we sound right.

1205
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:19,000
Our desired months.

1206
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,440
What do we need to do?

1207
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:24,880
We need to grab all the cells
from the table.

1208
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:25,960
Right?

1209
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,240
Grab all cells

1210
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,120
from the table.

1211
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,480
Right.

1212
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:38,360
And then once
we have all the cells inside, our list,

1213
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:45,720
what do we need to do?

1214
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,640
We need loop through the cells.

1215
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,360
Right.

1216
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,360
So the cells

1217
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:53,000
right.

1218
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:57,440
And then what we need to do in here.

1219
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:01,320
So we start looping in here and then once

1220
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,880
cell values
right, is matched with our condition,

1221
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:11,080
we're just simply going
to click on a matched date right?

1222
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:14,680
Once the cell value is

1223
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:19,080
matched, matched

1224
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:24,560
with our condition,
what we're going to do,

1225
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:29,520
we will click on the matched state.

1226
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,360
Okay, six steps
right on how to handle the calendar.

1227
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:38,760
We click on the calendar,
locate the month and get the text right.

1228
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:43,440
And then if the desired text
is not visible, what we're going to do,

1229
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:48,480
we will keep clicking on the next button
and as soon as we got the desired month,

1230
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,880
we need to grab all the cells,
stored them in a list of web

1231
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:55,200
elements, loop
through each and every cell, and then

1232
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:58,880
set a condition once that value

1233
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:04,160
our condition,
then we can simply click on that date.

1234
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,200
Right.

1235
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,040
Any questions on this, guys?

1236
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,440
Should be pretty straightforward, right?

1237
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:12,480
Okay.

1238
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,800
So now coming to the next topic.

1239
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,600
So we downloaded the jar
to take the screenshots.

1240
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,320
Jar file
will help us to save the screenshots

1241
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:26,680
inside our project or inside our computer,

1242
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:29,680
whatever it is inside our system.

1243
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:34,200
Right.

1244
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:40,480
Please put in the note which one?

1245
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,120
What do you want me to put on the note?

1246
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:48,680
The update.

1247
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:49,440
Okay.

1248
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:53,120
Get the text

1249
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,080
and keep

1250
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,920
updating text

1251
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:05,600
area.

1252
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:07,440
Okay guys.

1253
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,720
So now we we got the jar file, right?

1254
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:13,400
That's going to help us to

1255
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:16,720
save screenshots in our system.

1256
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:20,280
So now before we take any screenshots,

1257
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:24,280
I have a question that
why do we need screenshot in testing does

1258
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,720
testing for the record

1259
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:39,240
for proof of bugs right
to show the failure

1260
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,240
to have some documentation

1261
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:46,040
and to verify the test result?

1262
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,400
Okay. Very good.

1263
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:52,320
So basically
screenshots are taking for proof, right?

1264
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:55,480
To get some screenshots,
whether you have some errors,

1265
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:58,640
whether your test has passed.

1266
01:37:58,720 --> 01:37:59,320
Right.

1267
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:03,600
So in testing
it is very to take screenshots

1268
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,280
in order to prove that our test case

1269
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,240
covered the certain functionality.

1270
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:11,160
Okay guys.

1271
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:14,720
So let's put it in here.

1272
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:24,480
In testing
it is very important, important to take

1273
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,680
screenshots

1274
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,440
in order to prove

1275
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,360
that our test is

1276
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,800
covered.

1277
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,240
Certain

1278
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,400
functionality.

1279
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:49,920
Okay, so you take screenshots,
you show it to

1280
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:54,680
you attach it to your ticket
or you have it inside your reports.

1281
01:38:54,880 --> 01:39:00,200
So once nothing is not working,
you show it to the developers.

1282
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,960
You create defects
or you attach it to your ticket

1283
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:08,840
saying that, Hey, this is past
and this is my screenshot in here.

1284
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:10,080
This is the proof.

1285
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:20,640
Okay, Diego,
you guys already met Diego Ready

1286
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,600
to vote.

1287
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:31,280
Okay.

1288
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,760
Oh, manual testing. Okay.

1289
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,680
I thought he was only doing API.

1290
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:35,680
Okay, good.

1291
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:38,400
All right.

1292
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:42,320
Okay.

1293
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,880
All right.
So screenshots are very important, right?

1294
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,960
So in Selenium guys,
in order to take screenshots,

1295
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:53,160
we will be using take screenshot
interface.

1296
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:54,000
Okay.

1297
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,640
So it's going to be a little bit
of a different syntax

1298
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:00,760
that we will see in a usual scripting.

1299
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:01,480
Okay.

1300
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:06,840
But it's not a big deal guys,
so you don't have to really memorize that.

1301
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:10,000
Okay. Because we will be

1302
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,160
you be

1303
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:14,640
having common methods,
you will be building

1304
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:17,520
those functions in your common
methods class.

1305
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,760
Okay? So you don't have to really this.

1306
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,760
You just have to memorize the logic,
how everything works.

1307
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:29,880
Okay, so in selenium, in

1308
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:34,880
to take a

1309
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:36,960
screenshot,

1310
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:40,680
we will be using

1311
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,120
takes

1312
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:47,880
screenshot

1313
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,320
interface.

1314
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,960
Okay.

1315
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:52,720
All right.

1316
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:55,360
So now let's go

1317
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,760
and start our implementation.

1318
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:01,480
Okay.

1319
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,960
So what I want to do in here guys,

1320
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,080
let's actually go in here.

1321
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:14,680
Let's get the whole thing.

1322
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,000
Okay?

1323
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,760
So what we're doing here,

1324
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:21,120
we're navigating to the same website
as we've done in a previous, right?

1325
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:25,120
So and then what we,
what we're going to be doing

1326
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,520
after we're low again, What I want to do,

1327
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:31,920
I want to go ahead and take this
screenshot.

1328
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:41,280
Okay.

1329
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,840
Oh, screen recordings.

1330
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:45,000
Oh, okay. So that's a good question.

1331
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:48,880
So screen recordings,

1332
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:52,600
I seen it used in selenium,

1333
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:56,040
but I've seen it using different tools.

1334
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:00,360
Okay, so I've worked with Test complete
these are some

1335
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:02,800
outdated tools.

1336
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,400
They are used in government
projects. Okay.

1337
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:11,840
So most of the time to,
to record your screen,

1338
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:16,400
what your actions are,
you will mostly be doing that manual.

1339
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:20,120
Okay.

1340
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:22,200
But I haven't I haven't seen this

1341
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,880
happening with selenium, Java
and this kind of framework.

1342
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,240
Okay?

1343
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,000
If you're recording your screen,

1344
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,920
that means you're using
some completely different tool.

1345
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:35,160
Okay.

1346
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:35,800
All right.

1347
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:39,360
So now, guys, so everyone is clear

1348
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,920
what we're doing from line 12 to 19.

1349
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,200
Right?

1350
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:45,760
Any questions on this? We're not.

1351
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,200
Okay, good.

1352
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:54,320
Okay, So we're trying to log in
and take the screenshot.

1353
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,080
Okay.

1354
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,480
So first of all, what I need to do,

1355
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:02,280
I to create an object of the

1356
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:07,880
of the take screenshot interface.

1357
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:08,840
Okay.

1358
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:12,720
How do I, how do I create an object of the
an interface guys

1359
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,240
in Java Java

1360
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,040
with inheritance.

1361
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:27,880
Okay.

1362
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,800
What else need to make it indirectly.

1363
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:32,120
Right.

1364
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:39,120
Okay.

1365
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:39,600
All right.

1366
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:44,120
So what if guys have you heard of?

1367
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:48,200
I'm pretty sure you guys heard about down
casting and up

1368
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:54,360
casting in your Java classes.

1369
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:55,320
Right? There we go.

1370
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,480
Good. Okay,
so what I'm going to do in here,

1371
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,480
since the screenshot is an interface,
right?

1372
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,000
I'm going to

1373
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,200
down cast it

1374
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:10,240
so that we can match it to our web driver.

1375
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:11,960
Okay.

1376
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:15,240
Because we will be using this object

1377
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,880
in order to take some screenshots.

1378
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:19,200
Okay.

1379
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:25,240
So what I'm going to do in here,
I'm going to start with take screenshot.

1380
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:26,640
Okay.

1381
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:30,520
As is equal to right, we don't have a new

1382
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:33,520
or what's called new keyword in here.

1383
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:37,440
So what I will do, I'll do a down cast

1384
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,600
and here to the driver.

1385
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:44,360
Okay Any questions in here? This

1386
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,840
so you might get a little confused.

1387
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:51,640
It's okay guys.

1388
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,760
I'll try to explain it as

1389
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,200
as simple as possible.

1390
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:58,720
Okay.

1391
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:02,880
So we're creating an object
of take screenshots interface

1392
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:06,240
by down, casting it to the work driver.

1393
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,920
So now what I'm going to do in here,

1394
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,480
I am going

1395
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:15,440
to use the object that I just created

1396
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:23,280
and I will get the screenshot as okay,
so there is a method in here

1397
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,760
inside that take screenshot,
so I'm going to use this method.

1398
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,440
Okay guys.

1399
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,960
So there's only one method
that you can use in here.

1400
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:36,920
Okay, so now when I use this method, okay,

1401
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:42,680
I need to specify
what am I getting in return?

1402
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:48,080
Okay, so I need to specify my output type
in here.

1403
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:48,760
Okay.

1404
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:52,320
So inside the parentheses,
what I will do in here,

1405
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,440
so you can see it's asking me
to put an output type.

1406
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:01,840
So what I will do,
I'll start typing output type dot

1407
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,280
and I am getting a file back.

1408
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,800
Okay.

1409
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:10,440
So what's happening in here?

1410
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:14,600
I got this screenshot in a type of a file.

1411
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:19,560
Okay guys, is that clear?

1412
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:25,080
By using the object of this,
I am getting a screenshot

1413
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:30,120
and I am getting a screenshot
of a type of file.

1414
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:30,760
Okay.

1415
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:35,560
So once I get it right,
so I'm getting a file

1416
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:39,600
and I can assign it to a variable right?

1417
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,600
So where is it going to be saved?

1418
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,160
I'm coming to that point.

1419
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,000
Okay. Step by step dice.

1420
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Okay, so what I'm to do,

1421
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:54,440
I will store this
into inside the variable.

1422
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,920
So since I'm getting a file in return,

1423
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:02,160
I will be storing inside the file
variable.

1424
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,280
Okay.

1425
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,360
File I am.

1426
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,600
I'll name it as source file.

1427
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,280
Okay.

1428
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:10,160
Is equal to

1429
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:12,520
get screenshot.

1430
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:14,560
Okay, so let's import this.

1431
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,880
Okay. All right.

1432
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,640
So now here.

1433
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:23,920
What we did
we have is object of the take screenshot.

1434
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:29,680
We get the screenshot in here
and we are getting a file in return.

1435
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:30,840
Okay.

1436
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:36,040
So let me put a note in here.

1437
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:42,000
The screenshot is turn on this step.

1438
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:44,760
Okay. All right.

1439
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:46,560
So we took the screenshot.

1440
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,480
So now what I need to do,
I need to save it somewhere, right?

1441
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:54,200
So that I can go ahead and access it on.

1442
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,520
Okay.

1443
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,960
So what I need to do in here,

1444
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,320
I will be using

1445
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:04,120
a class which is called file utils.

1446
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:04,760
Okay.

1447
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:10,160
So the jar file
that, that we just downloaded, the common

1448
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:15,840
IO is going to help us to copy
save it inside our system.

1449
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:16,920
Okay.

1450
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:21,160
So what I'm going to do I'll do file
utils.

1451
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,040
Okay.

1452
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:26,440
And let's actually do this.

1453
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:30,680
You can see that it's coming from Apache
Commons. IO.

1454
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,440
Okay,
so that means downloaded that jar file.

1455
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,400
We uploaded it inside our project.

1456
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,960
Everything working fine.

1457
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:38,720
Okay.

1458
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:41,040
File utils dot.

1459
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:46,200
So when I put a dot in here,
we will have a lot of different methods.

1460
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:49,760
So the one I need to use is

1461
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:54,120
I need to copy the file.

1462
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:54,960
Okay.

1463
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:59,560
So for me to store this somewhere

1464
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:04,320
since I already have, let's go here.

1465
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,160
I already have a source file on hand.

1466
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,320
I need to copy this and paste it

1467
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:13,040
to the desired location.

1468
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:14,080
Okay.

1469
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:15,720
And how I'm going to do this?

1470
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:16,920
I'm going to mention this.

1471
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:19,520
Everything inside this parentheses.

1472
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,960
Okay,
so what I am going to do, first of all,

1473
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:26,280
what I need to mention is the

1474
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,640
the file that I'm working with.

1475
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:30,600
Okay?

1476
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:33,960
And that file is stored on line 22.

1477
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:34,920
Okay.

1478
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:37,840
So I'm going to copy this variable,
paste it in here.

1479
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:41,200
So I'm telling that I'm telling my

1480
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,240
my Java that, okay,
I need to copy the file which file

1481
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:50,160
this source file that I got on line 22.

1482
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,480
Okay So I'm copying this.

1483
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:55,760
Okay.

1484
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:59,880
So now what
I need to do, I'm going to copy this

1485
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:04,520
and I'm going to have
a completely new file

1486
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:07,520
in the new location.

1487
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,280
Okay?

1488
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:11,080
So what I will do in here, I'll do new

1489
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,160
file. Okay.

1490
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,920
So inside the parentheses now

1491
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:21,640
I need to put the destination of the file

1492
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:27,560
that I will be pasting.

1493
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:39,560
So what I am going to do in here?

1494
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:40,560
Yes. Seems like

1495
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:43,720
we uploaded it again.

1496
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,160
Okay.

1497
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:47,040
Like try to see
if you can re uploaded again

1498
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,720
or you can go ahead and check
that project structure

1499
01:50:55,720 --> 01:51:02,680
and you should be able to see this common
IO in here.

1500
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:03,200
All right, guys.

1501
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:09,320
So now in here I need to specify the path
inside my system

1502
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:11,520
where I want my

1503
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:15,000
my screenshot to be available for us.

1504
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:20,320
Okay, so if I don't specify
any folder outside of my project

1505
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,720
like we like we've done with drivers,
what it's going to do,

1506
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:28,480
it's going to get saved inside my project.

1507
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:33,440
Okay, so what I will be doing in here,
I'll put it past me.

1508
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:38,160
Okay, so I'll name it as screenshots.

1509
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:42,720
Okay, So this is this Smart bear, right?

1510
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,600
Smart Bear website.

1511
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:49,360
And what I will do,

1512
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:53,200
I will need to say admin log in.

1513
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:58,440
And whenever you're trying to save a file,

1514
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,680
you need to specify the extension
of the file.

1515
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:05,360
In this case,
we're getting a PG file in here

1516
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,680
so that we can view it later.

1517
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,520
Okay.

1518
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:13,680
Any questions on this, guys?

1519
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:21,320
Do you want me to repeat one more time?

1520
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:25,240
Yes. Okay.

1521
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:25,880
All right.

1522
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:29,320
So now, guys, let's start from line 21,
right?

1523
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:33,640
Creating an object of screenshot Dom,
casting it to the driver.

1524
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:34,920
Okay.

1525
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:38,040
And then what we're doing on line 22,

1526
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:42,400
we're getting the actual file on hand,
right?

1527
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,800
With taking the screenshot.

1528
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,240
It's not saved yet.

1529
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:47,640
It's nothing. It's just a file.

1530
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:50,280
Okay, so now on line 24,

1531
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,440
what I need to do,
I need to copy this file

1532
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:58,120
and I need to paste it to the location

1533
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:00,680
that I want it to, that I wanted it

1534
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,080
to be existent.

1535
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:04,680
Right.

1536
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:07,400
So what I did in here,

1537
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:11,840
I'm telling this
method that, Hey, this is my file

1538
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:15,120
and this is my path

1539
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,880
where I want that file to be saved.

1540
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:22,400
Okay, So inside my project, right,

1541
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,280
this screenshots
and Smart Bear will be created.

1542
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:32,800
Okay, so these are two new folders
that will be created automatically

1543
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:36,040
after my execution

1544
01:53:36,040 --> 01:53:39,480
and this file will be created inside

1545
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,640
these two folders.

1546
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:43,360
Okay.

1547
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,240
These two are random names.

1548
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:48,200
Okay.

1549
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:50,520
These are random names. Yes,
that is correct.

1550
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:51,400
Smart pair.

1551
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:55,560
I chose pair
because this is a Smart Bear website.

1552
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:56,400
Right.

1553
01:53:56,400 --> 01:54:02,680
So screenshots, we want to save all the
screenshots inside our screenshots folder.

1554
01:54:02,680 --> 01:54:03,280
Right.

1555
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:06,120
And then at the very end

1556
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:10,320
I just name it admin log in
because we're just logged in

1557
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:13,560
as an admin over

1558
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:14,480
why we have an error.

1559
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,320
I'm coming to that point guys.

1560
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:24,720
Okay.

1561
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:25,040
All right.

1562
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:41,280
Any other questions, guys, before we move
forward, where's the screenshot folder?

1563
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:43,480
Well, we didn't run it yet, right?

1564
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:47,400
So that's why it's not created yet.

1565
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:50,400
So the screenshots folder,
we don't have it.

1566
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:53,760
So if I run it, it's going to get created
automatically.

1567
01:54:54,560 --> 01:55:08,160
Okay. Yes.

1568
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:12,320
These files will be created inside our
our current project

1569
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,040
because we're not specifying
any different project.

1570
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,960
Okay.

1571
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:20,240
Or any different folder outside.

1572
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:23,640
So if you start from C folder

1573
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:27,560
and go on, go on,
it might get created in a different one.

1574
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:29,760
But here I don't specify anything.

1575
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:34,000
So we are creating everything
and saving everything

1576
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,320
inside our project.

1577
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:38,000
Okay.

1578
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:39,000
All right.

1579
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,560
So now we have an error in here
which is not going to compile.

1580
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:48,920
So what I will do in here,
Did you guys cover exceptions

1581
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:52,000
or any exception handling in Java?

1582
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,200
Okay, good. Nice.

1583
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:59,880
Okay, so I am going to do
how do you handle an exception in in

1584
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,400
Java class guys

1585
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,840
try and catch blocks.

1586
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:07,160
Right.

1587
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:10,320
So this is how
we will be handling this in here.

1588
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:13,760
So what I will do, I'll try.

1589
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:14,800
Okay.

1590
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:18,240
I'll try to

1591
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,120
copy this.

1592
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:23,520
Okay.

1593
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:29,360
And if that doesn't work, I'm
just going to catch the exception in here.

1594
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:30,120
Right.

1595
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:33,280
So I think it will throw us.

1596
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:37,040
I'm no exception in here,
if I'm not mistaken. Yes.

1597
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:39,440
So it throws an exception. What?

1598
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,280
What does it send for guys?

1599
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,360
What is it? Oh Exceptions stands for

1600
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:49,920
input output exception.

1601
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,400
All right, So since we're

1602
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,920
getting this screenshot, okay,

1603
01:56:57,040 --> 01:57:00,960
we're getting the screenshot
we're inputting and then we're trying

1604
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:03,960
to output inside our project,

1605
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:07,280
right so it might throw us an exception.

1606
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:11,000
So what I will do,
I'll do I'll exception in here.

1607
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:12,240
Right.

1608
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,600
And then what we will be doing

1609
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:17,280
will just want to

1610
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,800
print the secretaries.

1611
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:20,320
Right.

1612
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:22,600
Okay.

1613
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:31,560
Any questions, guys, on this?

1614
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:32,760
Okay, all clear.

1615
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:36,000
So now let's go ahead and run

1616
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:44,000
this.

1617
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,080
Why did it open for?

1618
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:50,520
Okay, guys, so open on other screen.

1619
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:51,120
That's fine.

1620
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:53,080
So we just logged in in here.

1621
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:56,720
Okay, so now let's take a look at our

1622
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:00,480
what's called

1623
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,600
at our project directory in here.

1624
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:07,080
So what changed in our project

1625
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:10,960
guys,

1626
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,120
we have a screenshots folder.

1627
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:15,240
All right.

1628
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:19,800
So if I expand this,
you can see there's a smart pair in here.

1629
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:22,160
The folder that we added. Right?

1630
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:25,680
And there is an admin log in PNG.

1631
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:28,320
So if I open this, you can see that

1632
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:34,080
you have a screenshot
over here already from that admin log in.

1633
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:41,160
Pretty cool right?

1634
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:47,120
So you don't have to go ahead and manually
take a screenshot while you're running

1635
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:50,920
everything you can just get the screenshot
at the very end of your step.

1636
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:52,280
Okay.

1637
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,640
So you just need to.

1638
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:59,360
This is as I said, guys, it's a little bit
going to be a little bit confusing,

1639
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:04,280
but it's okay.

1640
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:09,280
So that I think you have steps in here
in your role.

1641
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:12,640
Remove that s letter and it should

1642
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:19,800
work.

1643
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:23,120
Yes, that jar file was for screenshots.

1644
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:27,720
I mean, it was for having
copying and pasting,

1645
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,240
but these taking screenshots,

1646
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:35,160
this take screenshot
is coming from selenium.

1647
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:35,880
Okay.

1648
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:41,080
This is coming from
selenium style is coming from Java.

1649
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:42,040
Okay.

1650
01:59:42,040 --> 01:59:45,960
File utils is coming from comments that IO

1651
01:59:51,600 --> 01:59:53,880
or do you have the same issue in your

1652
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:58,480
in your your URL you need to make it htp.

1653
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:01,320
Okay, you have it https.

1654
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:11,360
That's why it's not working.

1655
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:22,000
Okay guys, any questions on how to take
screenshots, what else we use there?

1656
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:26,640
There are some plugins that we're going
to be using later guys, for Excel

1657
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:30,000
because you will be getting the data

1658
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,360
from Excel
and inputting inside your web pages.

1659
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:37,600
Okay,
So you will be having these input output

1660
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:47,960
jar files later on during the course.

1661
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:52,840
If it didn't create this
anything, just go ahead and refresh this.

1662
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:54,840
Okay. So go to file,

1663
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:58,080
reload all from disk.

1664
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:58,480
Okay.

1665
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:04,760
And that should pop up for you.

1666
02:01:04,760 --> 02:01:08,160
All right, guys, anyone having issues with

1667
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,640
getting the screenshot

1668
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,640
or is anything

1669
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,400
not clear

1670
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,720
or. Yes, try

1671
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:24,760
to try to store everything in PNG, guys.

1672
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:25,480
Okay.

1673
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:30,040
Because sometimes when you
when you start JPG

1674
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:36,560
and some people use Mac, it might get
a little bit of a problem on opening.

1675
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:44,640
Okay, so pkg would work for both.

1676
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:47,120
When we load it doesn't work.

1677
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:50,600
Let let's check your let's
check your intelligence.

1678
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:52,040
Okay. Send us a screenshot.

1679
02:01:52,040 --> 02:02:18,440
Let us see what's going on.

1680
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:19,320
What is the error.

1681
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:23,080
I want to see the whole error and s

1682
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:50,000
I think you have a space
in between in here.

1683
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,360
So try to reduce

1684
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:54,360
try to remove that space in here

1685
02:02:54,360 --> 02:03:05,520
and see if that works.

1686
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:08,640
All that works. Okay, let's see

1687
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:11,920
the okay.

1688
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:18,080
The path. Oh,

1689
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,640
okay, guys, please take it.

1690
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:24,120
Take a look at the at the error guys.

1691
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:27,760
It says driver
executable is not soundguys.

1692
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,240
Take a look at just system

1693
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:40,120
properties.

1694
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:42,240
It's failing on line 16 guys.

1695
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:44,840
So that means

1696
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:46,800
on line 14

1697
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:50,480
you have an S, you have this web driver,

1698
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:53,280
the D is capital for you.

1699
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:56,400
That is that is not correct.

1700
02:03:56,400 --> 02:04:06,080
Okay.

1701
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:09,240
So what will happen
if you don't create a new file?

1702
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:11,520
You won't get a screenshot, right?

1703
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,560
You won't have the populated

1704
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:33,000
inside your project.

1705
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,640
So if you want to do

1706
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:37,280
so, there is

1707
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:40,240
so most of the time, guys,

1708
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:44,880
you don't have to take a screenshot
of each page that you going to write.

1709
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:48,000
What you are concerned about is

1710
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,240
when your
test fails, you need to take a screenshot

1711
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:55,760
or when you test is passed
you need to take a screenshot.

1712
02:04:56,160 --> 02:05:00,360
Okay.

1713
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:03,560
It doesn't override the existing file. Oh.

1714
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:06,520
So if you want to run it in the

1715
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:10,080
in a different class,
in a different example,

1716
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:12,560
you need to change the name
of course. Okay.

1717
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:24,000
So if you don't change the name, it's
going to get over it.

1718
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Oh, that's going to be so.

1719
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,360
You mean in here we will have a file
that we have in storage?

1720
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:33,800
That is correct.
But that's going to be in Java storage.

1721
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:34,560
Okay.

1722
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:35,720
It's not physically.

1723
02:05:35,720 --> 02:05:38,400
We won't be able to see that.

1724
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:39,200
Okay.

1725
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:43,760
But in here, what we need to do,
we need to get it inside our project,

1726
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:56,480
and then we will be able to see.

1727
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:57,120
All right, I guess.

1728
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:15,720
Any other questions?

1729
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,680
Seems like not

1730
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:27,040
quantum mistake.

1731
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:59,400
Good.

1732
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:04,760
So if we copied on a folder.

1733
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:06,440
So the

1734
02:07:07,680 --> 02:07:12,040
the type of the data,
you need to specify it here.

1735
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:18,360
Okay.

1736
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:21,840
So you need to give it a name
and specify the extension

1737
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:32,760
in here. Yep.

1738
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:34,080
You can use the same thing.

1739
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:51,040
Exactly.

1740
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:54,920
So in order to get it inside
the inside the desktop,

1741
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:58,880
you need to go through each what's called

1742
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,680
through the C users desktop

1743
02:08:02,680 --> 02:08:05,560
and then the and then mentioned this.

1744
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,000
Okay.

1745
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,200
But even
even if you put it in the desktop, Right.

1746
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:15,400
So what would be the reason you need it
in inside your project

1747
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:16,920
in order to access it real.

1748
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:17,440
Quick.

1749
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:39,400
Right.

1750
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:39,640
All right.

1751
02:08:39,640 --> 02:09:03,920
I guess any other questions? In

1752
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:08,520
fact, no other questions.

1753
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:11,080
Taking screenshots

1754
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,360
for deleting. Yes.

1755
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,760
You can do it manually, correct?

1756
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:16,600
I'm not I'm

1757
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:20,480
not actually sure if
if we can delete them through selenium.

1758
02:09:20,480 --> 02:09:49,440
I've never done that myself.

1759
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:52,840
We will be when we start when we start

1760
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:56,320
going through the frameworks guys,

1761
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:58,560
you will have,

1762
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:02,440
you will have taking screenshots
automatically.

1763
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:07,920
You will set it up the way that you start
your test whenever it ends, it will

1764
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:12,120
get the screenshots with the new name
and everything will be dynamic.

1765
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:17,720
Okay guys, so you don't have to worry
about the this names

1766
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:21,720
and that it's getting overwritten
right now that it's hardcoded.

1767
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:26,040
Yes, it is hardcoded for now,
but when you start with your framework,

1768
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:30,880
you will have everything dynamic.

1769
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:33,240
Can you also select the area? No,

1770
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:37,720
you won't be able to do that

1771
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:54,560
so that you still

1772
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:58,440
if you still have a problem,
please ping this syntax support.

1773
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:04,160
Okay.

1774
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:05,280
It's failing on your

1775
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:09,720
on your line

1776
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:12,480
nine team
so that's not finding your elements.

1777
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:13,160
Okay.

1778
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:19,920
So please take a look at that.

1779
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:20,520
Oh, it worked.

1780
02:11:20,520 --> 02:11:27,600
Okay, good.

1781
02:11:27,600 --> 02:11:30,600
How to do it with pagination?

1782
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:35,160
Okay guys, as I said, right
So you taking the screenshot

1783
02:11:35,640 --> 02:11:38,640
at the very end of your test?

1784
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:39,480
Right.

1785
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:43,720
So as I said before, guys, this is just

1786
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:47,000
the hard coded version
of taking this screenshot.

1787
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:51,200
Okay, so since you say

1788
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:54,360
you want to take a screenshot
for each pagination,

1789
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:58,920
write for each pagination
when you move to the next page.

1790
02:11:58,920 --> 02:11:59,520
Right.

1791
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:03,160
So what can happen in there?

1792
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:05,760
You can use different tools. That's one.

1793
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:10,760
Or as I mentioned guys, you only need

1794
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:14,720
the screenshots
to be taken at the very end of your tests.

1795
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:15,560
Right?

1796
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:20,000
You don't need each step
to be taking the screenshot for.

1797
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:20,560
Right.

1798
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:24,760
So if you move one step
you don't need to screenshot, right?

1799
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:29,120
So what you need is
when you finish your test,

1800
02:12:29,720 --> 02:12:32,720
you need to know if it's or fail.

1801
02:12:33,720 --> 02:12:34,400
Okay.

1802
02:12:34,400 --> 02:12:36,760
So just one screenshot is enough for you.

1803
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:41,400
You don't need to go through each
and every step of the screenshot.

1804
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:45,400
If you have 25 steps in your
in your test case,

1805
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:48,960
you don't want to get 25 screenshots
right.

1806
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:53,920
What you want to do,
you want to e 30 a test case pass or fail.

1807
02:12:54,880 --> 02:13:11,480
Okay.

1808
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:25,320
All right, guys, any other questions?

1809
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:26,840
All right, cool.

1810
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:30,200
Okay, so now let's move

1811
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:39,280
to the new topic in here.

1812
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:41,400
How do you not overwrite the image?

1813
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:44,200
Just change the name in here, okay?

1814
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:54,360
Change name in here
and it won't overwrite.

1815
02:13:54,360 --> 02:14:00,680
Okay, so let me go to the notes now.

1816
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:01,840
Okay, guys.

1817
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:04,400
So now what we going to be doing?

1818
02:14:04,680 --> 02:14:11,400
We will be.

1819
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:15,000
We will be going over that action class.

1820
02:14:15,480 --> 02:14:20,400
Okay, So Anyone did research on actions
class guys?

1821
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:24,040
Does anybody know what actions class is?

1822
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:36,880
What we can do with actions, Class?

1823
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:39,240
Not really this time. Okay.

1824
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:40,520
All to interact.

1825
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:42,200
Exactly right.

1826
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:45,520
So actions is given by selenium

1827
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:50,040
to capture the keyboard and mouse events.

1828
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:53,400
Okay,
so what kind of mouse events do we have?

1829
02:14:53,400 --> 02:15:00,920
Guys?

1830
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:02,040
Okay, left click

1831
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:04,360
to scroll.

1832
02:15:04,360 --> 02:15:07,080
Right. Okay, right clicking.

1833
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:11,560
Okay, so you can,
you can move to an element, right?

1834
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:15,560
That means you're hovering your mouse
over some elements.

1835
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:16,760
Right? There we go.

1836
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:18,240
We have a right click.

1837
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:21,440
We also have double click right.

1838
02:15:21,680 --> 02:15:24,480
And what we have is we can drag

1839
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:27,720
and drop some elements, right?

1840
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:29,360
Okay.

1841
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:34,200
So these actions are captured
inside the actions class.

1842
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:37,560
Okay, so let's put it in here.

1843
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:41,360
Actions class, right

1844
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:44,960
is given by Selenium.

1845
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:48,720
Selenium to

1846
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:50,720
capture

1847
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:56,640
keyboard and mouse events

1848
02:15:58,120 --> 02:16:00,120
such as

1849
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:03,840
floating here, move the element

1850
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:09,640
right within drag and drop

1851
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:12,920
and then we can do double

1852
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:15,840
click in here within

1853
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:19,560
right click as well.

1854
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:20,280
Okay.

1855
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:23,280
So these kind of, this kind of actions

1856
02:16:23,480 --> 02:16:26,640
will be using actions first. Okay.

1857
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:30,960
So let's expand this and let me open up.

1858
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:35,120
Let me create a
new class and name is Actions

1859
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:39,920
Class statement.

1860
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:40,560
Okay,

1861
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:44,760
so this and here

1862
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:51,080
and what

1863
02:16:51,080 --> 02:16:55,200
I want to do, it's fine.

1864
02:16:55,280 --> 02:17:06,520
So let's actually set this one So

1865
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:17,120
or it's okay.

1866
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:25,720
So I know.

1867
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:26,040
All right.

1868
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:31,160
So I'm just going to change the URL here
for Amazon.

1869
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:31,640
Okay.

1870
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:36,240
So now let's go ahead and explore
a little bit inside the Amazon,

1871
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:38,680
see what kind of

1872
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:41,880
elements we got.

1873
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:42,400
Right.

1874
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:43,840
Okay.

1875
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:47,600
So in Amazon,
we've got a lot of different elements.

1876
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:51,840
We got a lot of links, dropdowns, buttons

1877
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:54,160
in here.

1878
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:56,560
We have images, right?

1879
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:59,000
So what we are going to do in here,

1880
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:03,360
so is you look at this element in here,
right.

1881
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:06,640
Hello. Signed account and lists. Right.

1882
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:08,680
So I'm not going to click on it.

1883
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:09,840
I'm not going to do anything.

1884
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:12,840
I'm just going to move my cursor on this.

1885
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:16,680
And you can see that the new element

1886
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:19,760
is popping up for us in here with a new

1887
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:23,360
with a new button in here to interact
with.

1888
02:18:23,600 --> 02:18:25,400
Okay, So I didn't click on this.

1889
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:30,360
I'm just hovering over my mouse
and what I see in here,

1890
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:36,200
I see new links,
I see a new button and I see new options.

1891
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:40,800
Okay, So what we're going to be doing
in here, we will navigating to Amazon

1892
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:46,520
and we are only going
to move over our mouse in here

1893
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:49,000
in order to see all the options

1894
02:18:49,880 --> 02:18:53,520
on our web page.

1895
02:18:53,520 --> 02:19:01,600
Any questions before we start, guys?

1896
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:03,280
Okay, good. So now

1897
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:05,280
let's go in here.

1898
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:07,760
So I navigate it to Amazon.

1899
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:12,520
What I need to do in here,
I need to know that element,

1900
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:15,960
the element that I am going

1901
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:18,240
to interact, right?

1902
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:21,560
So in order for me to know the element,

1903
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:24,080
what do I need to do? Guys

1904
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:30,480
locate the element.

1905
02:19:30,480 --> 02:19:31,200
Right?

1906
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,240
Are we moving too fast?

1907
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:44,920
Guys?

1908
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:47,160
Okay. All right.

1909
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:49,960
So what I will do in here,

1910
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:53,640
I will click on Inspect.

1911
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:54,120
Right.

1912
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:58,600
So what we trying to do,
we're trying to inspect that element.

1913
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:00,400
Okay.

1914
02:20:00,400 --> 02:20:04,040
So this is the element
that we will be interacting with.

1915
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:08,160
And again, guys, what I'm doing,
not clicking on this element,

1916
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:12,360
I am only navigating my cursor
on top of that element

1917
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:16,120
and I see new elements popping up in here.

1918
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:22,400
Okay, So what I need to do,
I need to click on this magic arrow

1919
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:26,440
and locate this element, right?

1920
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:31,680
So let's see.

1921
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:37,680
Come on.

1922
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:40,200
Okay. Again, you're

1923
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:47,200
okay.

1924
02:20:47,200 --> 02:20:50,280
So this is our element, right?

1925
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:51,600
And here

1926
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:55,880
we have a lot of different

1927
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:57,000
attributes in here.

1928
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,920
Which attribute do we want to use in here?

1929
02:20:58,920 --> 02:21:02,080
Guys?

1930
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:03,480
Idea. Right?

1931
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:06,400
Simple in here. We have an idea in here.

1932
02:21:06,400 --> 02:21:09,040
So what I am going to do, I'm
going to copy this.

1933
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:11,080
Okay?

1934
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:13,760
Go back to our script in here.

1935
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:16,080
So what I will do,

1936
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:18,200
create a web element, right?

1937
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:20,920
Saying that

1938
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:25,040
counts and less

1939
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:28,280
is equal to driver.

1940
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:30,520
That client element

1941
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:33,920
by ID and

1942
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:37,160
paste this in here.

1943
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:37,720
Okay.

1944
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:44,480
So now, guys, so I have this element
so we know that I don't want to click,

1945
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:47,280
I don't want to perform
any actions in here.

1946
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:49,840
What I want to do, I just want to

1947
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,160
hover over my cursor

1948
02:21:53,160 --> 02:21:56,160
on top of this element, not click

1949
02:21:56,480 --> 02:22:01,960
right and see this pop up in here,
the new options and this button.

1950
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:07,480
Okay, So for that,
we will be using an action class.

1951
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:10,640
Okay, So in order us to use an actions

1952
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:13,560
class, first of all, what we need to do,

1953
02:22:13,720 --> 02:22:17,400
we need to create an object of an action
class.

1954
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:22,200
Okay,
so what I will do in here simply actions,

1955
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:24,160
right?

1956
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:26,840
Action is equal to new

1957
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:29,560
actions.

1958
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:34,680
Okay, so creating an object,
let's import the class.

1959
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:37,920
Okay, so now we created an object.

1960
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:41,040
Okay, But then

1961
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:45,920
it's requiring us to put here
our execution.

1962
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:48,960
Okay? Our execution object.

1963
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:55,000
In this case, guys, what is the execution
object that we have in here?

1964
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,760
It is our driver, Right?

1965
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:01,320
So this is what we form our actions with.

1966
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:03,200
We click with send keys.

1967
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,920
This is our execution object.

1968
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:09,280
Right? So I'm going to copy this. Driver.

1969
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:12,000
What I'm going to do,
I will paste it in here.

1970
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:15,880
Okay,
So now what we have on hand right now,

1971
02:23:16,040 --> 02:23:19,200
we have an element
that we want to interact with

1972
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:24,680
and we have an actions class
object, right?

1973
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:28,200
So what I will do in here,

1974
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:31,680
I will use the actions class object

1975
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:35,840
that I created
now, and I will perform some more actions.

1976
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:38,440
Okay, So action.

1977
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:42,040
So if I hit DOT in here,

1978
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:46,280
you can see that there's a lot
of different methods in here.

1979
02:23:46,360 --> 02:23:50,920
We have before with double click right,
we have the regular click,

1980
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:54,200
we have contacts, click,

1981
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:57,440
we have move to element,
we have click and hold guys.

1982
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:00,560
Okay, so we have drag and drop in here

1983
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:04,080
as well.

1984
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:07,920
Okay, so what I am going to do,

1985
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:11,600
I am going to choose moves to element.

1986
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:14,600
Okay So if I choose move

1987
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:17,320
to element, it's going to ask me

1988
02:24:17,720 --> 02:24:21,840
to, to pass in here

1989
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:25,000
the element that I want to interact.

1990
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:29,000
Okay, so in this case, the element
I want to interact

1991
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,960
with have stored already on line 19.

1992
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:35,720
So I'm going to copy this
now, paste it in here.

1993
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:38,200
Okay.

1994
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:40,600
Handing over the responsibility. Exactly.

1995
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:44,160
So basically I'm telling my actions, Hey,

1996
02:24:44,400 --> 02:24:47,920
now you perform
some actions instead of my driver.

1997
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:48,320
Okay,

1998
02:24:49,800 --> 02:24:53,160
so now I'm using move to element, right?

1999
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:58,640
And I need to specify the element
that I need to interact with.

2000
02:24:59,280 --> 02:24:59,960
Okay.

2001
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:05,840
Once I do this, now what I want to do,
I want to perform this action.

2002
02:25:06,040 --> 02:25:09,320
And in order to do this, what I will do,
I will simply

2003
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:11,880
go ahead and perform.

2004
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:13,760
Okay.

2005
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:17,280
Any questions, guys, on this is

2006
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:24,880
pretty straightforward and easy, right?

2007
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:28,520
So basically,
you looking for your element, you create

2008
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:31,840
an object of your actions, actions, class,

2009
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:34,920
and then you perform your actions.

2010
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:37,880
Okay, So let me run this

2011
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,760
and see what
we're going to have on our Web

2012
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:46,720
page. Why?

2013
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:55,520
Just come in here.

2014
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:56,280
All right.

2015
02:25:56,280 --> 02:26:01,080
So you can see, guys,
we navigated to Amazon in here, okay?

2016
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:05,600
And you can see that we had that

2017
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:08,320
new option popping

2018
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:11,160
up in here with this
with the sign in button.

2019
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:16,040
And this pop up was showing right now that

2020
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:19,560
we manage.

2021
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:27,160
No, you won't be able to manage
the speed of the move. No.

2022
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:31,600
All right, guys, any questions?

2023
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:41,280
Any questions on how to move your cursor
to a specific element?

2024
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:42,840
19 to 21.

2025
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:45,600
So on line 19,

2026
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:48,240
what we are doing here, right.

2027
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:53,480
So we're locating the element
that we need to to interact with.

2028
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:55,800
Okay.

2029
02:26:55,800 --> 02:27:01,600
And then what we need to do,
we need to create an actions class object.

2030
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:06,400
Once we do that by using the object
we just created,

2031
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:10,040
we are moving to an element and

2032
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:15,240
we need to specify
which element we will be moving to.

2033
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:15,720
Right.

2034
02:27:15,720 --> 02:27:19,120
So in this case, we have it
sort of on line 19

2035
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:22,720
and in order to make this happen,

2036
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:27,920
we need to perform that action.

2037
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:38,320
Okay.

2038
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:39,600
Okay, cool.

2039
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:56,480
Any other questions, guys?

2040
02:27:56,480 --> 02:27:57,240
Okay, good.

2041
02:27:58,280 --> 02:27:58,840
All right.

2042
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:05,320
So now let's go back to our problem.

2043
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:07,240
Let's go to this website.

2044
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:10,760
Okay.

2045
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:13,800
So in here, guys,

2046
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:16,320
what we will be doing,

2047
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:18,880
we will be dragging this guy

2048
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:21,360
and dropping it over here.

2049
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:26,240
Okay So it will be navigating
to this website.

2050
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:27,760
What we're going to do.

2051
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:33,240
We will be getting dragging this element
and dropping on the other one.

2052
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:36,120
Okay. So

2053
02:28:36,120 --> 02:28:38,880
essentially this

2054
02:28:43,680 --> 02:28:44,080
quick.

2055
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:47,400
Okay. All right.

2056
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:55,160
So now let's get back in here
and create a new class.

2057
02:28:55,160 --> 02:28:56,000
Okay.

2058
02:28:56,960 --> 02:29:00,360
So this name is Drag

2059
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:06,600
and then

2060
02:29:14,280 --> 02:29:15,480
copy is

2061
02:29:21,160 --> 02:29:23,520
and it's

2062
02:29:23,560 --> 02:29:30,960
just the usual.

2063
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:31,960
Okay, guys.

2064
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:35,280
So we're navigating to that

2065
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:37,080
to this website, right?

2066
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:39,240
So let's

2067
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:42,160
go ahead, take a look at.

2068
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,480
Yeah. Okay.

2069
02:29:43,480 --> 02:29:47,520
So first of all,
what I need to do is I need to have

2070
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:50,800
the elements on hand,

2071
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:53,960
right In the previous example,
what we've done

2072
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,760
is when we navigated

2073
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:01,360
to the Amazon,
what we need to do is we need to store

2074
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:05,520
that element that we want to interact
inside the variable.

2075
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:07,680
Right? Same thing in here.

2076
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:11,840
What I will do,
I will inspect this page and

2077
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:15,480
I will need to locate

2078
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:19,080
the elements
that I need to be interacting with.

2079
02:30:19,080 --> 02:30:19,560
Right.

2080
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:21,840
So which element

2081
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:37,880
I need to interact with guys in?

2082
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:39,240
Drag me to my target.

2083
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:43,920
Okay, so one of them is this one.

2084
02:30:44,280 --> 02:30:46,360
Do I need the second element in Here goes

2085
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:50,520
Yes. Right.

2086
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:54,120
Because I need my target element as well.

2087
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:55,640
Right.

2088
02:30:55,640 --> 02:30:58,480
Okay. So let's go one by one. Right.

2089
02:30:58,760 --> 02:31:04,080
So I have this in here, so let's copy
this ID, right.

2090
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:06,080
It has an ID, so that's good.

2091
02:31:06,080 --> 02:31:09,520
Let's go back in here.

2092
02:31:09,520 --> 02:31:10,760
Where? Element

2093
02:31:12,680 --> 02:31:15,880
right next to

2094
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:19,800
drag ball is equal to the driver dot fun

2095
02:31:19,880 --> 02:31:23,440
element by I.D.

2096
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:27,960
and paste this in here.

2097
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:29,120
All right.

2098
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:32,840
And then let's take a look
at the second element that we have.

2099
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:36,000
It has idea as well.

2100
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:39,800
So I'm going to copy this back

2101
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:46,320
above element.

2102
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:53,440
Drop a ball right.

2103
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:56,640
So the driver

2104
02:31:56,760 --> 02:32:00,960
element, my idea again

2105
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:03,880
and I have it this way.

2106
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:07,320
Okay, so we've got two different
elements, right?

2107
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:10,800
So we want to interact
with these two elements.

2108
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:21,800
So now what is my next step, guys?

2109
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:22,320
There we go.

2110
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:27,680
So we need to create
an object of the Actions class demo.

2111
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:28,960
Then I'm coming to that point.

2112
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:34,800
Okay, so let's go step by step one by one.

2113
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:35,280
All right.

2114
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:41,160
So actions, action, right, is equal to new

2115
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,200
actions in here.

2116
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:50,000
And what I need to specify
here, my driver.

2117
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:53,680
Okay.

2118
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:54,120
Okay.

2119
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:56,640
So I have my elements, I have my actions.

2120
02:32:56,640 --> 02:32:58,040
Class object.

2121
02:32:58,040 --> 02:33:00,320
So now what I need to do,

2122
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:04,840
I need go ahead and start
performing my action.

2123
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:05,760
Right.

2124
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:09,480
So by using the object
that we just created,

2125
02:33:09,480 --> 02:33:15,440
what we can do in here,
there should be a method drag and drop.

2126
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:18,680
Okay, So if you look in this method,

2127
02:33:19,160 --> 02:33:22,520
it's expecting us to pass

2128
02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:25,840
two different web elements in here.

2129
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:30,120
So one of them is going to be
the drag couple, right?

2130
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:33,840
And the other one
is going to be the target, Right.

2131
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:37,400
The target element
that we need to drop it into.

2132
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,440
Okay.

2133
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:40,080
So I'm going to

2134
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:42,920
use this. Okay.

2135
02:33:42,920 --> 02:33:46,920
So the first element that we
have is our drivable, right

2136
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:50,640
pasted in here.

2137
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:56,280
The second one is the drop bubble,
which is our target, right?

2138
02:33:56,400 --> 02:34:00,240
So in order to make this action
actually happen

2139
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:03,000
what we need to do, we need to be form.

2140
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:08,480
Okay, so let's go back in the

2141
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:13,080
to the website in here so

2142
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:16,080
we can see that in here.

2143
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:21,240
Guys, there is an iframe, right.

2144
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:26,280
Which is covering our focus
to actually go ahead and

2145
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:31,000
manipulate with the two elements
that we need to write.

2146
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:34,480
So how do we handle this situation, guys?

2147
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:44,360
What do we want to do, switch to?

2148
02:34:44,400 --> 02:34:47,040
Right?
How do we switch to the framework, guys?

2149
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:50,440
How how many ways of switching to frame?

2150
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:58,080
Do we know?

2151
02:34:58,080 --> 02:35:01,800
Okay, index right

2152
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:09,520
name or idea, name or idea?

2153
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:13,840
And then the last one is by web element.

2154
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:16,360
Okay. So let's take a look.

2155
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:22,400
How many frames
do we actually have in here?

2156
02:35:22,400 --> 02:35:23,520
All right. Let's see.

2157
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:25,360
I afraid

2158
02:35:25,360 --> 02:35:28,800
we only have one frame in here, guys.

2159
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:33,320
So can we use can we use indexing in here?

2160
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:38,280
Guys? No.

2161
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:42,480
Why not?

2162
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:45,560
We only have one eye frame on this

2163
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:49,280
page, right?

2164
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:51,040
It's not going to get confused. Right?

2165
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:53,080
So we can simply use this.

2166
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:56,640
We can switch our focus by the index.

2167
02:35:57,080 --> 02:36:01,800
Right So what I am going to do
going to do driver,

2168
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:08,040
but switch to the frame.

2169
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:14,920
And what is the index cards in here?

2170
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:16,200
Is it one

2171
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:25,440
hour index?

2172
02:36:25,440 --> 02:36:27,040
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

2173
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:29,040
So we have a mix in here.

2174
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:29,400
Okay.

2175
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:32,440
Is it zero or one guys?

2176
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:35,080
It needs to be zero.

2177
02:36:35,080 --> 02:36:35,880
Right.

2178
02:36:36,960 --> 02:36:37,600
Okay.

2179
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:41,800
So this is our.

2180
02:36:41,800 --> 02:36:42,600
Okay.

2181
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:43,800
All right.

2182
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:49,560
So now let's
go ahead and run this script and see

2183
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:57,440
what happens.

2184
02:36:57,440 --> 02:37:05,240
I hope it's
not going to open up on the other system.

2185
02:37:05,240 --> 02:37:09,280
What happened, guys?

2186
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:14,880
Here you can see that
we simply got this element

2187
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:17,040
and dropped it at the other

2188
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:19,640
onto the other elements.

2189
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:20,280
Right.

2190
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:23,960
Okay.

2191
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:24,320
All right.

2192
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:28,680
So this is one of the ways of dragging

2193
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:31,640
and dropping the elements.

2194
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:32,880
Okay.

2195
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:35,760
So I want show you

2196
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:38,280
I want to show you another way in here.

2197
02:37:38,280 --> 02:37:40,440
So let me common this out. Okay?

2198
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,640
So guys,

2199
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:46,320
hold and move.

2200
02:37:46,320 --> 02:37:47,800
Yes, almost that.

2201
02:37:47,800 --> 02:37:51,720
Okay, so let's see guys in here.

2202
02:37:52,680 --> 02:37:54,880
So manually, guys, what?

2203
02:37:55,080 --> 02:37:57,400
What am I doing? First steps.

2204
02:37:57,400 --> 02:38:01,240
So if I navigate to this page,
I start interacting

2205
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:03,160
with these two elements, right?

2206
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:06,360
So first of all, what I am doing in here?

2207
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:10,120
Manually
clicking first and doing what guys

2208
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:16,600
clicking and holding it right?

2209
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:19,920
So what I want to do in here,

2210
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:24,120
action dot click and hold,

2211
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:27,360
okay, so click and hold.

2212
02:38:27,360 --> 02:38:31,560
And what I need to do,
I need to specify the element

2213
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:34,880
which I will be clicking and holding onto.

2214
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:41,160
Okay,
so now once I clicked and hold onto it,

2215
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:47,160
what do I need to do guys?

2216
02:38:47,160 --> 02:38:51,000
I now need to move it right?

2217
02:38:51,240 --> 02:38:55,440
So I need to move it to an element right.

2218
02:38:55,680 --> 02:38:57,680
So here

2219
02:38:57,720 --> 02:39:02,720
I'll do move to Element
and then we already know what element

2220
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:04,480
I will be moving to.

2221
02:39:04,480 --> 02:39:07,400
It is the drop label element, right?

2222
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:10,240
So once I moved my

2223
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:14,480
my dragonball onto the drop,
what happens next?

2224
02:39:14,680 --> 02:39:15,840
What do I do next.

2225
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:19,080
Okay so I clicked on
hold move to an element.

2226
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:25,920
So now what I need to do,

2227
02:39:25,920 --> 02:39:28,920
I need to release my mouse.

2228
02:39:29,320 --> 02:39:30,880
Right. There we go.

2229
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:34,560
So what I will need to

2230
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:37,320
do, I need to release my mouse.

2231
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:40,400
Okay.

2232
02:39:40,400 --> 02:39:42,960
And then so this action to happen

2233
02:39:43,800 --> 02:39:46,160
is what I will need to do.

2234
02:39:46,320 --> 02:39:48,480
I need to perform. Okay.

2235
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:53,120
But before I run this code,
there is one thing that I need to

2236
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:56,680
mention in here. Okay, guys.

2237
02:39:56,680 --> 02:40:00,440
So when you are using actions class

2238
02:40:01,440 --> 02:40:08,200
and you have more than one action
back to back.

2239
02:40:08,200 --> 02:40:12,000
What you need to do after the last action

2240
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:15,560
and before you perform
what you need to do.

2241
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:18,600
You need to build everything.

2242
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:23,600
Okay, So basically what this method does,
it builds

2243
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:29,640
all the actions that you have into one
and then it's going to perform.

2244
02:40:30,400 --> 02:40:34,520
Is that clear, guys?

2245
02:40:34,520 --> 02:40:37,440
I think it's going to work
without the build as well,

2246
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:43,200
but this is the recommended way to do it.

2247
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:54,920
Okay, exactly.

2248
02:40:54,920 --> 02:40:57,840
So if you have a method chaining,
absolutely right.

2249
02:40:58,160 --> 02:41:02,200
Use build after the last action
and then perform.

2250
02:41:02,960 --> 02:41:07,800
Okay, so

2251
02:41:08,080 --> 02:41:21,480
let me run this now.

2252
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:22,480
There we go.

2253
02:41:22,480 --> 02:41:27,320
So it tracked and dropped
onto that drop able element

2254
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:33,360
right.

2255
02:41:33,360 --> 02:41:46,200
So let's close this.

2256
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:49,880
All right, guys,
any questions on actions class

2257
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:53,520
or taking screenshots or, handling

2258
02:41:53,520 --> 02:42:01,640
the calendar, scars?

2259
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:02,560
Okay.

2260
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:05,840
So today seems like it's more interactive,
right, guys?

2261
02:42:06,040 --> 02:42:08,040
It more

2262
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:12,280
no more concatenating with x-pac

2263
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:16,440
no more while with for right.

2264
02:42:17,320 --> 02:42:24,920
There we go.

2265
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:32,640
I can show the notes. Yes.

2266
02:42:32,640 --> 02:42:35,560
Okay, so let's go over the homework

2267
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:43,640
actions and action.

2268
02:42:43,640 --> 02:42:55,400
You mean this action?

2269
02:42:55,400 --> 02:43:03,560
If you're talking about this actions
and this action, then actions is a class.

2270
02:43:03,560 --> 02:43:12,840
This is an object, right?

2271
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:15,360
All right, let's get

2272
02:43:21,800 --> 02:43:22,440
that homework

2273
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:28,840
for you.

2274
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:31,920
I'm not really sure
which actions and action you're

2275
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:34,920
referring to.

2276
02:43:34,920 --> 02:43:38,960
Then you elaborate on the question
so that I can answer that correctly.

2277
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:40,200
Okay.

2278
02:43:40,560 --> 02:43:42,840
So homework, guys.

2279
02:43:43,560 --> 02:43:57,160
Let's to this.

2280
02:43:57,160 --> 02:43:59,280
Oh, I'm not sure about action.

2281
02:43:59,400 --> 02:44:01,520
Okay.

2282
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:04,800
I'm not sure about action,
but we won't be using action.

2283
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:05,480
Okay.

2284
02:44:05,480 --> 02:44:10,320
So we will only be using actions.

2285
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:14,800
Action is probably an interface. Yes.

2286
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:16,560
All right, guys. So here,

2287
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:18,120
I want you

2288
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:20,400
to navigate to this American Airlines

2289
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:24,720
and interact with the calendar.

2290
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:25,360
Okay?

2291
02:44:25,360 --> 02:44:28,360
Select the departure, Select
the return date,

2292
02:44:29,360 --> 02:44:31,720
select the destination as well.

2293
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:34,520
Click on Search
and quit the browser. Okay.

2294
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:38,160
So if you click on this guy in here,
you will see

2295
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:42,560
the exact almost exact same right

2296
02:44:43,920 --> 02:44:47,240
calendar
that we worked on on Delta Airlines.

2297
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:52,960
So select the departure
and the return date.

2298
02:44:52,960 --> 02:44:59,480
And here, select the destination guys.

2299
02:44:59,480 --> 02:45:02,840
So from here
we can select the destination.

2300
02:45:03,960 --> 02:45:06,200
And from here you can select

2301
02:45:06,200 --> 02:45:09,120
where you go into and click on search,

2302
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:11,160
right?

2303
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:13,360
And then quit the browser.

2304
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:16,000
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

2305
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,400
Any questions?

2306
02:45:20,400 --> 02:45:21,720
This is how.

2307
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:23,920
This is how it's built, guys.

2308
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:27,240
Okay, So you can do this

2309
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:35,040
and you can actually do this in here.

2310
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:36,520
Oh, that doesn't work

2311
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:40,280
with that.

2312
02:45:40,280 --> 02:45:43,440
It's weird.

2313
02:45:43,440 --> 02:45:46,920
I thought it was a return and

2314
02:45:47,040 --> 02:45:48,240
departure.

2315
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:49,560
That seems like not so.

2316
02:45:49,560 --> 02:45:53,640
This is how it's built, guys.

2317
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:58,320
Okay, so whenever you want to depart,
you have two months in here.

2318
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:02,160
Whenever you want to return,
you have two different months here.

2319
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:03,000
Okay?

2320
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:11,440
After you go.

2321
02:46:11,440 --> 02:46:14,360
All right. Guess is the homework clear?

2322
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:19,320
Any questions?

2323
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:20,600
Yes, I'll push the code. Okay.

2324
02:46:20,600 --> 02:46:23,080
I guess I'll push the code
right after the class

2325
02:46:30,040 --> 02:46:31,560
based on difficulty.

2326
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:33,600
Okay. Today's and

2327
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:39,080
yesterday's class.

2328
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:39,880
Okay, guys.

2329
02:46:39,880 --> 02:46:42,280
So yesterday

2330
02:46:42,640 --> 02:46:44,280
it wasn't that difficult.

2331
02:46:44,280 --> 02:46:45,000
Okay?

2332
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Today was more interactive class.

2333
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:54,520
Okay, But we use the same logic
as yesterday and today,

2334
02:46:54,520 --> 02:46:59,120
because in the calendar handling,
we use the same logic today as well.

2335
02:46:59,400 --> 02:47:02,600
But the only difference we had is this

2336
02:47:03,080 --> 02:47:08,280
why loop and clicking on the next button
and having the for loop at the same time?

2337
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:10,560
So that was the breaking point
for everyone.

2338
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:15,000
Okay,
so I think everyone got confused in here.

2339
02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:16,640
Why? Why?

2340
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:20,520
We need the while loop, how we're dealing
with for loop and all that stuff.

2341
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:21,800
Okay.

2342
02:47:22,280 --> 02:47:25,280
But in terms of in of difficulty,

2343
02:47:25,280 --> 02:47:28,600
I don't think it's
too difficult to understand.

2344
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:29,520
Okay.

2345
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:34,840
You might not catch it at first, but then
if you look at it, you will be able to

2346
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:36,760
understand what

2347
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:44,720
is going on.

2348
02:47:44,720 --> 02:47:45,600
My brain.

2349
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:48,520
Believe me, guys, I have had

2350
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:52,320
more than you do right now.

2351
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:53,400
Okay?

2352
02:47:53,400 --> 02:47:56,600
When I when I was when I was studying

2353
02:47:56,960 --> 02:48:05,680
syntax. Yes.

2354
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:07,920
Let me focus the

2355
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:14,960
one more.

2356
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:17,040
Of course. Announcements.

2357
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:19,880
Any other questions, guys,
before we wrap up

2358
02:48:20,120 --> 02:48:46,840
the class?

2359
02:48:46,840 --> 02:48:49,520
You guys,
you guys are asking really good questions

2360
02:48:50,880 --> 02:48:52,920
until you guys are confused.

2361
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:56,480
Okay, so when you're confused,
you guys don't want to talk at all,

2362
02:48:56,880 --> 02:48:58,560
so that's not good.

2363
02:48:58,560 --> 02:49:01,760
Okay,

2364
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:03,920
so if you're confused,
you got to let me know.

2365
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:11,480
Okay, guys.

2366
02:49:11,480 --> 02:49:13,960
All right, guys.
Till more classes last for us.

2367
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:17,880
Okay, so more classes last.

2368
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:20,080
So please, please practice.

2369
02:49:20,080 --> 02:49:25,280
Please complete the homework
and I'll see you next week.

2370
02:49:25,280 --> 02:49:25,720
Okay?

2371
02:49:25,720 --> 02:49:29,400
We're going to be doing
some more fun stuff next week.

2372
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:36,800
Okay?

2373
02:49:36,800 --> 02:49:39,840
Okay.

2374
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:43,200
You have more fun tools to learn.

2375
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:47,520
Okay, guys.

2376
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:47,960
All right.

2377
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:49,440
All right, guys.

2378
02:49:49,440 --> 02:49:49,920
Take care.

2379
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:53,520
Everyone, please practice,
and I'll see you next week.

2380
02:49:53,880 --> 02:49:55,400
Okay? Thanks, everybody.

2381
02:49:55,400 --> 02:50:03,720
Goodnight.
