1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,480
Okay, we are

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,920
recording now.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,600
Are you feeling better?

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,120
Good.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,640
To be honest, I am feeling sad and happy.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,600
And at the same time,
I don't know how to express this.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,920
And I am feeling so many things.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,040
I am also seek

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,080
a happy
because I will be engaged on 17th of this

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,840
and sad because my sisters
and my mom took me

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,920
for shopping like three times already
and they are asking to go one more time

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,280
and then I have to go the.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,120
I have to go shopping for my future wife
as well on Wednesday.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,360
So I don't know whether I should be happy
or sad.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,560
I have already spent my one last one month
birthday.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,840
Let's
see how far and still be major things.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,120
They are still there,
like the ring bar to be ready.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,440
Send them in the ceremony. They are apart.

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,520
They are dressed for shopping for the mom
and the future wife.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,000
And for me.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,800
They make you become poor.

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,840
So if anything, I should be happy.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,560
You see? Yes, I am happy.

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,880
I don't.

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,920
I will be numbers and you will be okay.

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, Bill.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:46,600
I will try my best.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,640
And you are glowing.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,840
And you are not sad

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,200
when you have babies,
you will spend hundreds or.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,440
Okay, Let's not have babies.

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,720
Oh, they are so, so many traditions.

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,760
I mean, it's very, very complicated
here in in some continent to get married.

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,040
And there are so many

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,720
things that you have to take

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,440
year off.

37
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,040
How many people attend the wedding?

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,720
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,320
It's like sometimes 300 plus people.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,560
300 plus people on average,
250 or 300 on average.

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,880
I mean, it's like the whole community

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,840
or all your relatives, each
and every person that you know

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,960
in your in your life,
they will attend to your marriage.

44
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,720
How do you feel?

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,920
300 people, people
they just spent their whole life

46
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,840
earnings on on their daughter's marriage,
especially here in subcontinent.

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,160
Believe me, it's very,
very tough for the parents.

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,920
My first of our 600 plus.

49
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,120
Yes, it's totally possible.

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,200
I think I am expecting like 500
plus at least in my in my marriage,

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,400
at least 500.

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,440
You mine was by 400 plus.

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
So I have already starting now
you guys will understand why

54
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,040
Why I was asking for calls from Alexey.

55
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,640
I will be needing
a lot of cows and chickens

56
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,200
in the

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:40,440
near future.

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,160
And some people came to my wedding
that I never saw in my life.

59
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,720
Oh, yes. There. There.
Most probably there.

60
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,640
There were these to learn

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,440
the students,
they tried to just go and everything

62
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,920
that is
so there that they can have good food.

63
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,800
If can you share pictures
videos of family? Yep.

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,640
Should definitely.

65
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,320
I will be sitting

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,480
free food and feeding students
first of all.

67
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,040
Yeah.

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,680
And they will just like so naturally
that no one will

69
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,880
even will realize
that they are not invited.

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,800
They have special schools
and all the dates in their calendar.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,840
They have special contacts with the

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,400
with those guys who or who have

73
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,560
these big halls
in which we do these kind of ceremony.

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,040
So they are telling them
to watch their work.

75
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,400
I mean, what you guys can
be in someone else's marriage

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,440
to have food that reminds them
interrelated. Yes.

77
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,240
It's correct. It's

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,880
people don't do that in USA.

79
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,320
I got married in USA.

80
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,360
In USA, you pay for each city.

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,480
It's expensive.

82
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,200
So I like this idea
very much in especially in Pakistan.

83
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,480
So all of the guest
who are coming in the marriage

84
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,120
and especially the people
that are in your community, if you are

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,440
if you are living in a village
or in a city.

86
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,840
So they kind of contribute a small amount

87
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,400
on each marriage
and they kind of writing down.

88
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,920
So and let's say if I am getting married,
I will be my friends,

89
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,320
my family, because they are
they all will be paying a small amount.

90
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,680
And actually that is not a small amount.

91
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,880
When accumulated, it will be a big amount.

92
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,680
And when they will be getting married,
I will do the same.

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,720
And they kind of keep record of this.

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,280
For some of the families,
they don't even feel the burden at all.

95
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,640
If for all the expense, it's very,
very easy for them.

96
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,600
They just have to finalize the dates
and do some other stuff

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,880
in here. All

98
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,600
right, guys.

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
So let's start with class.

100
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:10,600
I think we have enough people now. Yes.

101
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,920
I think it's a very good idea. Oh,

102
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,080
we started discussing the joined.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,640
Hello. I'm our.

104
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Okay, let's let's let me check.

105
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:44,200
Oh, good.

106
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,760
Fine number.

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,960
We have not started

108
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,480
like all

109
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,120
from assets that are employees. Okay

110
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,320
and check the employer

111
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,120
state best for practice are

112
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,200
employee status.

113
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,040
You know

114
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,720
that employer state proves

115
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:12,600
industry status.

116
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,160
Here we have the employer status.

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
Okay, so

118
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,880
see everything.

119
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,880
So let me also do this

120
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,400
over here.

121
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:46,760
Employee status is not so.

122
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,920
I'm not What is wrong with discovery?

123
00:09:49,920 --> 00:10:04,080
I see this status for the employees.

124
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,360
It differs every time.

125
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
Not possible.

126
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,040
It is not possible. Aha.

127
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,080
What do you mean
it differs every time? Wow.

128
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,600
Yeah.

129
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,200
For example, can you check it
without an ordinal?

130
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:37,440
Yes. Why not?

131
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,080
You mean the count is increasing
or decreasing every time for the employer

132
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:50,880
status column?

133
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:59,800
Sorry.

134
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,600
Yes, I see the null values first. Now.

135
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,680
And you mean now?

136
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,520
I don't see the normal values.

137
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,840
Oh, okay. Okay.

138
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,120
This is because so much focus in focus.

139
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,040
And everyone, please focus in here.

140
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,760
The school is returning us
only the first 2000 rows in here.

141
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,520
And if you guys focus in the message tab,
it is saying

142
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,720
that although I have written this query
in here,

143
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,840
my skill workbench is modifying this query

144
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,160
actually to this

145
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,760
this so that we only fetch
in the first 2000 rows

146
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,600
school workbench is doing this to optimize

147
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,000
the bandwidth usage so that even if

148
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,320
if let's say
there are 1 million rows in a table

149
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,600
or 1 billion rows
and if you execute discovery

150
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,080
skill,
we'll have to do a lot of competition

151
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,720
computation
to bring all those 1 billion rows.

152
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,000
So by default, skill limits
the amount of data that we test or fact

153
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,800
so that the queries are optimized.

154
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,560
Does it make sense now?

155
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,560
So now I have a task
small task for you Search on the internet

156
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,960
how to fetch all the data
from from a table.

157
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,880
So Amit has written this guilty.

158
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,160
And he was confused
that when he executes discovery

159
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,560
he only get the null results in here.

160
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,200
So but some of the values are not null
and the data is there also.

161
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,360
So why he was not getting that data.

162
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,280
So this confused, emotive was not getting
this checked out because by default

163
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,760
at the max
only shows you only 1000 process

164
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,160
so that if there

165
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,520
are, let's say
1 billion rules in the table

166
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,200
and if someone accidentally arrived
security

167
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,200
as school has to do a lot of computation
it will take a lot of time

168
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,080
and network bandwidth
to display all those 1 billion rows.

169
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,440
So by default would be
that is limited in here

170
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,360
and you can change in this default
setting to get all the data

171
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,080
or maybe getting, let's say,
instead of 1000 to get

172
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,160
10,000 or 50,000 rows.

173
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
So I want you to start on the Internet,

174
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,000
how to bring, let's say,
all the rows from a table.

175
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,080
So I have this problem that the my school

176
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,120
workbench by default
only fetches the first 2000 rows.

177
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,320
And I want you to do a research on Google
to bring all the rows from this table.

178
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,200
I spent more than 30 minutes last night
with that.

179
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
No, no, no.

180
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,880
So, guys, if you if something is bothering
you for, let's say,

181
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,480
more than 10 minutes,
then there might be something

182
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,920
that you are missing
from a concept perspective.

183
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,680
So you should definitely send a message
in this or channel or contact me

184
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,720
so that we don't waste in this place
this time.

185
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,960
Your time is very important.

186
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,040
Why it does not show pagination.

187
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,920
Yes. Or one. This is also a great idea.

188
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,040
Maybe you should build a skill
workbench to

189
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,120
have those pagination options

190
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,160
in the bottom

191
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,800
so that we can click on those options
to bring on.

192
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,960
The next piece of data
is some of the software.

193
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,720
They do support it,

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,400
but as you guys know, the best software
that was developed by humanity

195
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,560
after Windows 11, that's why

196
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:48,120
we don't have this option in here.

197
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,360
So guys, quickly start on the Yes, in BHP.

198
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Michael, it works. Yes, you are right.

199
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,800
Many other software, they also support it.

200
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,440
So guys, quickly do a research
and tell me if it is possible

201
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,240
to fetch all the rules

202
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
in my skill workbench, how to fetch

203
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,240
all the rules from a table
in my skill workbench.

204
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,560
And I also want your queries
that you are typing on the Google

205
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:25,320
to find out the solution for this.

206
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:38,760
And it should not take more than 2 to 3
minutes.

207
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,240
Say again please. So right now

208
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,040
I am executing this duty and

209
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,960
skill workbench useful
only showing me first 2000 draws.

210
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,240
I want to get all the rules
from this table for this column.

211
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,680
How can I do that?

212
00:15:52,680 --> 00:16:11,920
You have to search this on the internet.

213
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,920
Select all from backgrounds
where X type is equal to you.

214
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,840
Select all me and select all columns.

215
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,080
We have X type
you means we are any row with the column.

216
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,200
X type is equal to you.

217
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,440
So you'll get by saying if we put this

218
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,920
we're X die.

219
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:42,640
If we put this x type is equal to you,
we should be getting all the rules.

220
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,360
Okay,

221
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,520
So let's see.

222
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:58,280
Like this, you'll get to
where X type is equal to you.

223
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,960
Unknown column.

224
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,840
Column X type in the where clause.

225
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,960
It means from wherever
you have copied your code.

226
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,680
And they had this column
X type in that, in that, in that table.

227
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,320
And they're all this query for that table

228
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,800
you just literally copied
and pasted everything in here.

229
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,880
Okay.

230
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,880
And now, because this column is
not available in here, it is not working.

231
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,920
Guys, please be creative.

232
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,600
You can easily change this limit
by going to my skill workbench added for

233
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,920
viewed it as a yes.

234
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,120
So the only the sad thing
in the excluded workbench

235
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,320
that we can change to change this limit.

236
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,760
But I don't want to change it this limit
guys, I don't want to change this limit.

237
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,280
Is it possible to write a query itself?

238
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Maybe so.

239
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,160
If we go inside b my little workbench,

240
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
if we go inside of the edit
and then preferences

241
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,280
and then ask purist.

242
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,160
We are not asking to disturb

243
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,160
you. Re editor Max

244
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,200
in Max number of thirds 50

245
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,280
And here we have limit rules.

246
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Count is equal to 1000
and then we have this option

247
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,560
to limit the rules.

248
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:49,360
So if I do that
and if I execute this again,

249
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,320
this time it has 5 to 6920 earlier.

250
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,360
So now and not
you should see all the data in here.

251
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,560
C 17 and I want to do 165 or whatever,

252
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,480
but guys,
please change that starting again to

253
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,240
1000 or maybe 5000 or something like that

254
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,600
so that your code is there.

255
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
Don't take too much time.

256
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,240
Maybe 5000 is more than enough.

257
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,480
Any other questions, guys?

258
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,320
Any other issues that you guys might faced
during your assignment

259
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,440
or write by writing any other query
or something that might be bothering you?

260
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,520
Is there anything else
that can also benefit, let's say,

261
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:47,520
the remaining of the class?

262
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,560
I have a question on about joins.

263
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,840
Yes. Alone, please.

264
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,080
Output of doing not used actually.

265
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,920
You're so very very clear
that you will be using our project.

266
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,600
But still. Yes.

267
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,160
Please ask is it right or left?

268
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,280
It is both left and right. Both sides

269
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,680
out remains to give the data

270
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:15,800
from both side.

271
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,200
Yes, it is full some of the databases.

272
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,840
Okay.

273
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,920
So yes, let me clarify
this also some of the databases

274
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,120
I actually I wanted to tell in this class.

275
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,080
So let me bring the

276
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,600
duty.

277
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,320
So you see, I have written this inner
join in here.

278
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,240
Nice. Please focus in here.

279
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:42,200
Even if I remove this inner keyword,
I still get the results.

280
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,280
So again,

281
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,640
depends on all the databases
which keywords

282
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,520
given itself.

283
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,280
They can also be slightly different
from the database or back to base.

284
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,800
That's why
I told you guys that I never use these.

285
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,400
Join the syntax.

286
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,840
I repeatedly told you that I never prefer
I never prefer these join syntax

287
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,560
because from database for database
you might have you might have to

288
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,440
just use inner join
or sometimes you might just write, join.

289
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,120
Sometimes you write out.

290
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,320
Sometimes you write full out or sometimes
you write full output of join it.

291
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,480
There are so many variations.
So many variations.

292
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,400
But this syntax with the weird clause

293
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,280
that I wrote,
I told you that it is the same syntax.

294
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,000
I don't know where I wrote that,
but for example, this one, right?

295
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,760
I can easily replace that
to join syntax with.

296
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,520
We had a clause,

297
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,000
so this is what I recommend
because it will work on all the databases

298
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,040
shows here.

299
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,600
Then they are not same alone.

300
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,560
It again
depends from database to database.

301
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,640
So which one is not same.

302
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,560
Full pool join and

303
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,080
that is which one?

304
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,040
Which one of them are not same

305
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,680
in them.

306
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,400
Join and

307
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,800
join or which one

308
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,720
exclusive and inclusive

309
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,400
right to join.

310
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,680
Inclusive and exclusive

311
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,000
Select all from right to join

312
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,520
Select All from right to join.

313
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,200
Oh no, no, no.

314
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,960
Also not focus on the queries
that they are writing

315
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,960
in above.

316
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,400
They are using the real condition
where B is null and below.

317
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,440
They are not using that query.

318
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,160
Otherwise the syntax for the right
try to join

319
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:49,200
it is same.

320
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,200
You can also modify your this
to achieve these results.

321
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,760
The right keyword.

322
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:15,760
It will give you the same results.

323
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,400
Oh also is

324
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,040
the right and left joins

325
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,040
they I saw my questions for interview
they're asking about output

326
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,120
and in doing so it's just full and in a

327
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,960
yes they are same
they are saying there is no such thing

328
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,800
as inclusive output of join
and non inclusive output.

329
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,640
At least I have not seen this.

330
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,440
I have not started this.

331
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,680
But if this thing still exist,
you guys think if it is exist,

332
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,200
I will do my research.

333
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,560
Maybe they have added something
in in later

334
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,680
submergence,
but I have not seen this in my experience.

335
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,840
I have not started in my engineering.

336
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,560
I have not seen this in my four years

337
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:04,000
of development.

338
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,680
Let me know.

339
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,720
Do do your research.

340
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,400
If you
if you feel that this is something that

341
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,400
we should
know, I will do my research after that.

342
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,360
If we don't mention do I?

343
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,880
And instead use where clause.

344
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,080
How is getting all the way to join
to perform?

345
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,200
It knows from this condition
you'll need to

346
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,920
it knows from this condition
and this is what I recommend.

347
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Otherwise you guys will be confused.

348
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,120
We will be wasting a lot of time
on your jobs.

349
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,440
Some websites also said that output outer
join it right and left to join non.

350
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,840
This is not correct.

351
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,120
Also guys when looking for knowledge
always look for the sources

352
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,560
which are authentic.

353
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,240
Either consult a book
or either read the documentation.

354
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,720
I can also make website
and I can write whatever I want.

355
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,120
Right?

356
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,320
So make sure that
from wherever you guys are starting,

357
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,200
if wherever you are having the practice,
that source is authentic.

358
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,920
Otherwise you guys will be confused,
will be wasting a lot of time on your jobs

359
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,240
and you guys might also be
confused in your interviews,

360
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,960
books,

361
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,600
documentation,
or if you are looking for something else,

362
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,720
make sure that they have
at least good reputation on the internet.

363
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,440
Sorry.

364
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,200
Or you can always send me that source
from where you guys are referring.

365
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,000
Maybe they might have written something
in a different context,

366
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,360
and because you guys might not
that might not know

367
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,640
that concept, context or the history
that might also confused you in there.

368
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:49,880
So always
tell me if something is confusing.

369
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,440
Okay.

370
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,040
So we were discussing
about the joints, right?

371
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,080
The joints, as I told you, they are also

372
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
some of their databases.

373
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,880
They might just write it
as joint in a joint.

374
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,240
They are all the other names as well.

375
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,160
So the things which are not universal,
which

376
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,640
I will not be focusing on those things,
these kind of things,

377
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,200
they might work on one database
and might not work on other databases.

378
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,040
So my priority will be to teach you
that stuff,

379
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,160
which is universal and can be used on
almost all the databases.

380
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
And if something is

381
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,960
if something might differ,

382
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,440
I will tell you that it can differ.

383
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,880
So some of the databases,
they also call them these joints

384
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:47,400
differently.

385
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,120
So these two, they they
they are kind of important.

386
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,000
And I hope you guys have understood
is there anyone who has some

387
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,080
kind of confusion with the right to join
or the left to join?

388
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,960
Right means whichever table what you are
writing towards the right of this keyword.

389
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,800
Bring all the data from that table

390
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,600
are whether there is a match
or there is no match.

391
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,000
But from the table
which is towards the left,

392
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,160
only bring the rows which have a match.

393
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,200
And this left is actually same
because if we just change

394
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,360
the placement of cables from here to here,
it can

395
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,400
we can easily achieve the same results
that we are achieving with the left joint.

396
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,600
So if you have understood
actually one of them, you have understood

397
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,040
both of them.

398
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:49,200
It is there
anyone who is confused about this? No.

399
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,040
So did you guys do some kind of richer
research on self

400
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,800
joint?

401
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:10,320
No, research on self joins were very,
very important.

402
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,960
It's very, very important
with respect to your interviews.

403
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,240
So let me start it again from scratch

404
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,160
so that our regular life database
are tied to me

405
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,880
as a very good example
for this healthy joint.

406
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,560
So let me bring that.

407
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,960
I did what I forget.

408
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,600
What was it now?

409
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,960
It's fine. Yes.

410
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,360
When we look at something for the first
time, we we can easily forget that

411
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,560
it says it happens
when it does self screen

412
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,640
or something like that.

413
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:00,600
Okay.

414
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,520
But I think after you guys solve your

415
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,120
exercises, the assignments, by the way,

416
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,960
are you guys having a hard time
solving that assignment that I shared?

417
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,240
I wrote a lot of questions over there.

418
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,200
Are they easy, hard or

419
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,800
what are your

420
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,120
certainties tend to answer.

421
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:38,000
I think those questions,

422
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:50,120
and some of them are hard,

423
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,000
confusing and left with.

424
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,680
To ask you.

425
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,840
I will share this solution
with all those questions.

426
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,800
Don't worry.

427
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,480
And even if you guys still have questions
after I have shared the solution,

428
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,560
we will discuss those questions
as well in the class.

429
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,640
Yes, it will take a lot of time.

430
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,480
Actually.

431
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,040
You guys will be seeing

432
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,680
pretty much same table
names and column names.

433
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,800
And this is also a part of the good job

434
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,920
to finding the column names
inside those table names.

435
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,480
And then writing this blog
that the deadline is Sunday.

436
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,200
So that's why I created that.

437
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,120
Have you guys are are all the questions
that you have solved they belong

438
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,320
to my skill database
are some of them also belong

439
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,960
to the article one

440
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,000
oracle?

441
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,240
Okay, that will be good
because this database is

442
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,360
kind of shared between all the batches.

443
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,360
So time to time they kind of keep on
adding and diluting the data.

444
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,320
So it's good identity part
with Oracle first.

445
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,440
Okay.

446
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,520
And so all right, guys,
let's start with the self.

447
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,640
Join.

448
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,920
So previously we learned that

449
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
there can be two tables, right?

450
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,120
Table one

451
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,000
and table two.

452
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,120
And because we are discussing
the relational databases,

453
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,520
we have primary keys.

454
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,920
So it will, let's call it Prime Key two

455
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,520
and let's call it primary key one.

456
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,840
So in relational databases,
how we create relations, whatever

457
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,320
that is stored inside this primary table,

458
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,200
if we have to create a link

459
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,080
between table one and a table two role.

460
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,120
So let's say we have stored one,
two, three, four.

461
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,240
So let's say this table contains
the personal information

462
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,440
and this table contains
the employment information.

463
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,760
So I have stored, let's say
first name in here, last name in here,

464
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,120
but the salary information is stored
inside of this table, right?

465
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,920
So now I have to tell that the let's say,
first employee is John.

466
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,320
I have that the salary that I have stored
in here, let's say 200 K

467
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,320
this 100 K a salary belongs to John.

468
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,480
So how can I do that? Right.

469
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,720
So let's say this is also rule number one.

470
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,240
So I have stored prime even in here
the first name I have stored in here

471
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,960
and I want to store this information
and the 100 year

472
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,560
salary belongs to this employee
which is stored at room number one.

473
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:58,400
So how can I do that?

474
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,480
Everyone, please respond.
How can I do that?

475
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,320
Actually, give me one woman Two days.

476
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,240
Let me let me show you a

477
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,640
nearly real example.

478
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,680
So I have this

479
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,640
person table.

480
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,120
Give me one moment.

481
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,560
I have column first

482
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,520
name, last name.

483
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,600
This is a primary key.

484
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,800
So I have strawberries that are one.

485
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,160
John.

486
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,480
Mike I have another table which is

487
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,400
employer table.

488
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,000
It has primary key.

489
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,240
It has salary.

490
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,000
Primary key is one.

491
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,680
Salary is 100. Here.

492
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:57,000
So this is one table.

493
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,440
And this is let's say

494
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,280
another table.

495
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,840
Okay, How can I bring the borders?

496
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:12,080
Silver like this, All borders open.

497
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,880
Great.

498
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,600
Sorry for my border skill skills.

499
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,040
So I want to tell

500
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,560
that I want to create this relationship.

501
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,880
Can you zoom? Yes.

502
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,520
Is it readable now?

503
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
So how can I tell?

504
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,600
How can I store this information that

505
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,600
why I am so bad
at trying things know about non border

506
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,800
only border or

507
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,960
this area

508
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,840
borders?

509
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,360
Yeah, looks are still this
but I need extra.

510
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,400
How can I let this

511
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,120
of finally.

512
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,000
So what it works

513
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,360
for Oracle that we are practicing
now for current assignment.

514
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,040
Yes so how can I store
how can I link to this information

515
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,920
that this 100 year salary
actually belongs to John

516
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,160
so I can

517
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,040
I can create another column in here right.

518
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,600
I can create another column.

519
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,640
I can call it, let's say

520
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,000
let me call it

521
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,400
empty Iodine store.

522
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,520
Okay. Eight.

523
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,440
I can store this

524
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,800
non M, E

525
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,520
and B I can store this e mp i I.D.

526
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,760
inside of this table and I can store

527
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,280
exactly number one in here.

528
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,200
Now, everyone who looks at this table

529
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,880
and if he or she wants to find out
the information

530
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,600
related to employment,
he can refer to this

531
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,560
sorry, this number one,
he can go inside this table

532
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,200
and he
can look for this salary information.

533
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,200
Today, I will teach you how to create
columns, how to create tables,

534
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,320
how to put the inside column,
almost everything, don't worry.

535
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,680
So, guys, does it make sense
how I created this relationship?

536
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,600
I created a same column
and the column name can be different,

537
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,080
and I stole a piece of information

538
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,480
from this table inside this table.

539
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,600
And now whenever
we need to link to these two tables,

540
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,680
you guys can read
this piece of information.

541
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,400
You can go inside this table
and you can link the piece

542
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,520
of information
that is stored inside the employer table.

543
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,640
So this is how we create the drawings.

544
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,360
Actually. So

545
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:29,640
now so in this part of the job
will be done already for you.

546
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,480
You guys don't need to do this. Yes.

547
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,280
So can you guys tell me,
what do we call this thing?

548
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,640
What do we call this thing?

549
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,000
Is it
primary key, foreign key table column?

550
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,600
What is it?
Is it foreign key? How do we know?

551
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,600
Because the prime key,

552
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,360
if that is stored inside
the same table, would have to be.

553
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,760
Usually we all should be primary key.

554
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,880
But the same thing is also

555
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,440
in another table

556
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,600
that contains the same information

557
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,760
that is called the foreign key.

558
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,920
So this E and B ID it must be a primary
E in any of the tables.

559
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,720
Okay,

560
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,000
so this is what we learn to till now.

561
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,160
But what if what if this

562
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,720
same primary e from this table is,

563
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,920
is it stored inside

564
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,120
the same table as the foreign key?

565
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,520
Then we knew that this self joins.

566
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,720
So you guys understand
two different tables

567
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,120
from one table primary key
existing in another table.

568
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,200
It is called foreign key. Right.

569
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,440
But it is also possible
that this same primary key inside the same

570
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,960
table can also be can also exist

571
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,080
inside the same table as foreign key.

572
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,120
And if we have this relationship,

573
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,720
then we need to write big duties
with the help of self joints.

574
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,840
Then we use this self adjoins.

575
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,480
If we have to bring the data
from those type of tables.

576
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,080
Now, now let me show this table to you.

577
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,080
So this table in the

578
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,880
Oracle database,
if you guys observe carefully,

579
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,200
oops, this employee I.D.

580
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,960
is the primary key inside of this table

581
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,600
right?

582
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,000
Looking exactly.

583
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,240
Let me know, guys, if it is readable.

584
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,480
I think we can close this out as well.

585
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,600
Is it better?

586
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,920
Maybe I can delete some dirty.

587
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,480
I could not really? No.

588
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,600
Okay.

589
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,440
So I was saying

590
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,840
this is the primary.

591
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,680
Right?

592
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,440
And guys, one more thing.

593
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,920
Can I just tell by looking at the data

594
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,400
if that column is a primary,
you're not going to tell that.

595
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,640
Can I do that?

596
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

597
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,880
You guys are wrong.

598
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,160
I can insert in that to in such a way

599
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,360
that will always look unique.

600
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,880
I can.

601
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,320
I can do that.

602
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,720
Yes. If you want to really check

603
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,560
if something is a primary key or not,
you should check the schema.

604
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,000
You should check the schema.

605
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,880
So for example, if we go

606
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,640
inside of the asset
you are in below table.

607
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,240
Oh, actually we don't need.

608
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,720
So you will see with every column
you will see this chart

609
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,480
and this the speaker will be written
with the column name

610
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,840
that is confirming
that this is the primary key.

611
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,480
This is also a primary key.

612
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,040
So this is how we are 100% sure.

613
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,840
Right.

614
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,160
So engineers, they never guessed things.

615
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,160
They actually do the right thing
to find out

616
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,120
the piece of information
that they are discussing or looking at.

617
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,680
You see, this is the primary.

618
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,920
So we cannot just tell
by looking at the data.

619
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,040
We can guess at mix.

620
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,880
So in here

621
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,040
I have joked this came under there.

622
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,000
I know.

623
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So this is the primary in here.

624
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,680
Okay, This is the primary.

625
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,440
But if if you guys observe carefully
this same information

626
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,040
is also present.

627
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,560
And this is also I know

628
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,600
from schema, okay,
I am not just looking merely at the data.

629
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:43,440
I know from schema that this same key
is existing in here as well.

630
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,200
Today.

631
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,800
I will also show you

632
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,760
how to create primary keys and foreign
keys, how to create this relationship

633
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,160
in schema actually,
although you guys will not be doing it.

634
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,760
But still I will show you
so that for sure you guys know

635
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,880
how to create them
and how these things work.

636
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,720
So actually let me show you.

637
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,800
I think

638
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,400
you guys see this.

639
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:32,280
He already started sending me addresses.

640
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Oh my God,

641
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,440
I am like this.

642
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,720
Hey, I bet
he will be very, very happy with me.

643
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,600
He will always be mad at me.

644
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,800
Okay, Poor me.

645
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,840
Let me show you

646
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:05,160
from this schema.

647
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:05,760
Yeah.

648
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:34,520
He is my primary female.

649
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,840
You guys check this page.

650
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:50,840
You got an opening for you
or is it only me?

651
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,400
So this is the schema, guys.

652
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,960
This is the schema.

653
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,800
And if you guys look carefully

654
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,760
for the employ already table,

655
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,800
it says primary e of implies table.

656
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,640
Okay.

657
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,760
This is how I know
if it is a prime or not.

658
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,880
And then if you look for the manager
the column in here

659
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,000
it says manager Ardi of employee
has a same domain

660
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,520
as manager already in department
stable foreign aid to employ

661
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,520
IED see foreign key to employ
I column of employee's

662
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:30,000
table useful for reflexive domains
and connect to buy queries.

663
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,240
So they are they are also this is all and
they are also the types of self domains.

664
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,960
So from schema, I know that these things
are related to each other.

665
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,440
And before you start writing your duties,

666
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,960
I will highly encourage you
to check out the schema of that table.

667
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,560
Okay.

668
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,680
Same that
I speak, but under different column name.

669
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,720
Yes. And I'll be.

670
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,600
That's why
we need to look at the schema yesterday's.

671
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,920
So with time

672
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,320
you will also be able to judge things
with your experience.

673
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,080
But you you you never know there

674
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,720
there might be a legendary developer

675
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,240
or Libya who might have written anything
just like that

676
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,040
although it's very very companies
they do follow

677
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,200
a very high standard of

678
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,560
things to write the column names.

679
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,840
And for example,
they will never write this underscore ID

680
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,520
If something is not a primary,
they will only write this ID

681
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,640
if something is a primary key
or if something is very, very important

682
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,840
for that paper. Is that mean foreign?

683
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,000
He can be something else,
but not always know It will always be.

684
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,440
You can do that.

685
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,360
You can do that.

686
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:53,440
You can just create any column
to be a foreign key body.

687
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,200
You should never do that.

688
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,360
You should always refer to a primary key
as a foreign key in another table.

689
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,000
It it's a very bad practice.

690
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,520
It can lead to many,
many problems later on.

691
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,120
Because remember, guys, once
this schema is created

692
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,360
and once it has been populated
with the data

693
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,360
then modifying the schema or the table,
it will cost you a lot.

694
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,320
It will be very, very expensive.

695
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,040
So be careful when, although you guys
will not be doing it, but

696
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,040
maybe later on, once you become managers
or team lead,

697
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,760
you guys will definitely be participating
in these kind of decisions.

698
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,640
So be careful if you are planning
to use something for is,

699
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,400
make sure that you are at least
spending days to design that thing.

700
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,760
So this implied the primary key,
which is also present

701
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,040
inside the same table as sorry,
inside the same table as the foreign key.

702
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:00,240
Also, now I can look at this information
just like that.

703
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,000
Like, for example,
I can look at the many variety of legs.

704
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,840
It is 100 and I can
then check this in for the employer.

705
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,440
I need four legs is one or one or two.

706
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,480
I go inside this column,

707
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,920
I check the manager ID all flex is 100.

708
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,280
I then again search the key hundred inside
this table to find out about the manager

709
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,480
of the legs.

710
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:27,800
Right.

711
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,960
It looks easy if we do it manually. Right.

712
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,800
Can you guys find the manager of let's say
maybe Nancy,

713
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,040
who is the manager of Nancy,
and you guys tell me.

714
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,440
So to find out the manager, I have to go
and check the manager variety,

715
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,320
which is one or two.

716
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,680
Then I again will
I will do a result in here

717
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,760
to find out the manager
and I can find this out from Nina.

718
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,360
So what we are doing,
we are referring to a column

719
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,600
inside the same table

720
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,000
as foreign key and as primary key. Right?

721
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,480
So the same information,
both the primary keys and before on keys,

722
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,440
they are actually presented
inside a single table.

723
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,920
So previously they were present
in a two different tables

724
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,640
and you guys were easily able
to write this to join those two tables.

725
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,160
But how can we do that
if we have only one table?

726
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:34,440
So the solution is
we create two copies of the same table

727
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,160
and we give them different names.

728
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,720
It is possible in a school
in actually all the that I believe

729
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,920
we call them aliases,
and once we have two tables,

730
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,760
then you guys already know how to link
the information between two tables.

731
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,400
Right?

732
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,240
If I create two copies

733
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,200
of these tables,
then you guys already know how to do that.

734
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,920
So that's what we will be doing.

735
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,840
And then this
this this approach is called a self join.

736
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,920
This approach is called a self doing.

737
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:11,080
So let's say, for example,
if I go to school

738
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:20,120
workbench, well,

739
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,520
why it is slaughtering

740
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,400
All right.

741
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,840
Oops looks better place.

742
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,360
It's always slow.

743
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:37,840
I think it's too much slower today for me.

744
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,920
It's all the time with the floor.

745
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,360
Okay. Well, guys, it is free. Okay.

746
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,560
It's it is fine.

747
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So. So let's say I want to

748
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,600
find out the information of the employee
and your manager.

749
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,240
So index, I won't do it all.

750
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,240
So we say that it's in effect now.

751
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,160
And then you can also tell your fellows
what is are due to us.

752
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:25,560
Do you guys know what is a due loss?

753
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:32,040
Oh, so you'll get that

754
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,720
if there are 100 100 people

755
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,600
in a room which are calling your name

756
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,600
and you are in the center of the room,

757
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,720
and if, let's say from your family,
who is also in the room

758
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,440
or actually is a true caller
who who really wants to talk to you,

759
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,840
and if they are under 2000 people
in a room, they're not also calling you

760
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,640
at the same time
again and again and again.

761
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,800
Can you hear me?

762
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:05,320
Actual real person
who really needs your attention.

763
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,160
So that is doors in computers, Computers.

764
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,800
They have a limited capability
of entertaining the requests per second.

765
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,240
If actual good users
who really want to use your service,

766
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,520
your server has a limited capacity
to entertain them.

767
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,080
But indeed those what do we do?

768
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,600
We write a far loop

769
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,480
and inside that far loop

770
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,680
we requested the same page again
and again and again.

771
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,600
From that sentiment Now server,

772
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,720
it kind of gets our guest Meg
into turning that request

773
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,160
and he is unable
to entertain actual real users as that

774
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,160
because he is busy with someone else
very high speed

775
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,320
and goes can hear men can not

776
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,160
if it's a very simple

777
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,280
explanation of us

778
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,520
then roll thousand devices

779
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,840
to do the same at all at once. Yes

780
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,040
so let's say first so I want to get to

781
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,720
the first name
and I am calling it, let's say empty name.

782
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,200
I can do that right days.

783
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,600
I can rename a column. So

784
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,320
yes, you guys should follow me.

785
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,560
So you guys see
instead of first name column,

786
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,800
now it is called employee
Name Column, right?

787
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,280
I want to name the column differently
so that you guys can see the information

788
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:44,280
of the employee and you guys can see
the information of the manager

789
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,400
employer name.

790
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,680
I am calling this
first name as the employee name and then

791
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,440
I am creating a copy of employee

792
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,800
stable as MP

793
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,400
underscore table.

794
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,080
Okay.

795
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,480
Or maybe it will be a large name.

796
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,280
Let's call it only MP then a comma.

797
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,080
Then I repeat the same thing.

798
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:20,520
And this time I call this table
as the manager.

799
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,680
Okay.

800
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,400
Like this.

801
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,240
So now I have created the aliases, right?

802
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,760
The same table is called

803
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,480
a copy is created with the name manager

804
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,240
of this enclosed table
and another copy inside.

805
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,120
The memory will be created
and it will be called EMV.

806
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,040
It is clear, guys,

807
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,680
till this point, do you guys understand
what I have done until this point?

808
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,560
So inside the from clause

809
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,640
I have written the same table name,
but I have given it to different aliases.

810
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,360
It is

811
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,560
essentially the same as creating
two copies of the same table.

812
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,240
Although it is a logical division,

813
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,600
there is no actual copy
that is being created in the memory.

814
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,960
But to understand
you guys can think of it like a copy

815
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,960
has been created inside the memory.

816
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,480
And guys, I am saying it again.

817
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,960
It's very important for the interviewer,
so please pay extra attention.

818
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,880
Yes, it is basically renaming it
on a logical layer.

819
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:31,720
Nothing is being renamed in actual
in your database.

820
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,000
It's all logical

821
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,160
if just to make sure that you guys think
easily.

822
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,320
Otherwise
the information is not being modified

823
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:52,840
at any level inside your database.

824
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,200
Looks good. All all of you are good.

825
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:02,000
Anyone confused?

826
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,880
Most of I think.

827
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,640
And you make another example.

828
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,760
But Mustafa, if something is confusing you

829
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,120
in this example, it will also confuse you
in another example.

830
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,840
So ask me in here
what is what is it that is confusing you?

831
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,520
These are aliases they will expire

832
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,080
after a skill as executed Your query

833
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,320
again.

834
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:29,040
And Damian, there is nothing that is being
stored as alias in the database.

835
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,720
It is just to help
you write a query is easily

836
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,360
another decode inside of the memory.

837
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,600
Inside the permanent story.

838
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,320
Nothing is being being renamed.

839
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,160
No aliases are created.

840
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:47,040
It's just so that you guys can write
your queries easily.

841
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,160
The queries that I am teaching
you till this class.

842
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:55,080
Till now,
they have not modified any information

843
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,320
anywhere inside a memory
or inside the database.

844
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,960
Today I will teach you how to do that

845
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,440
if we run another curious.

846
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,760
These aliases will not work.

847
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,240
We are copying a renaming.

848
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,040
The first name as implied name? Yes.

849
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,160
Just for this query.

850
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,480
Right after I have executed discovery.

851
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:20,240
There is no such thing as empty name
inside a slot inside of the memory.

852
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,680
I don't run it right now.

853
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,480
Then kindly please
explain this again from the beginning.

854
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,600
Yes, sure.

855
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,160
So this first name I.

856
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,160
The first name column is present
inside the simple table.

857
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,000
Right?

858
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,520
So I am bringing this first name MP

859
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,720
dot because I have So this

860
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,560
this first name is being brought in here

861
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,840
from this copy of the table.

862
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,960
Okay. This copy of the table.

863
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,080
And let's say I can also now do this.

864
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:00,760
I can again bring the first name
from this copy of the table. How?

865
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,080
By writing M and our dog

866
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,160
first name

867
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,240
as manager.

868
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:21,680
First name like this.

869
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:27,520
So this piece of information,
this first column is being brought here

870
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,960
from this
first copy of the table is the same table.

871
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:36,440
And this piece of information
is brought in here from this second

872
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,680
copy of the table, although I am bringing
the results from same column.

873
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,880
But I can I can also.

874
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,840
You would be, let's see last name column

875
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,880
totally depends on.

876
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,160
So until now what I have done I have
created two copies of this same table.

877
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,080
This implies table.

878
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,440
I have created two copies.

879
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,240
One I have called as MP,
the other copy is called the manager

880
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,240
and I can use any of these copies
to bring any of the columns

881
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:07,440
from the back obvious.

882
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,480
If this is clear till this point,
then we will move forward.

883
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,920
Tell me if it is clear.

884
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,960
I have created
two copies of the same table

885
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,520
and I can use any of the copy
to bring the data

886
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:25,440
from any of the columns from this table.

887
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:25,920
Was table.

888
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:32,880
Does it make sense now
till till this point?

889
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,640
It's like, let's say for example,
we have Lubo, right?

890
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,880
Lubo is also break manager
so I can call him as manager

891
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,080
or I can call him Lubo.

892
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:47,560
But Lubo is same person, right?

893
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,560
So same person having two names,
this same table,

894
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:58,960
having two aliases.

895
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,280
But why even be name is always Alan.

896
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,600
There?

897
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,920
Because I have not written any condition.

898
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,560
Yes, and this is another concept.

899
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:13,880
So when we write
two tables in the front laws

900
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,240
and we do not write the rare condition,

901
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,040
what Eskil will do is will speak
in the first row of the table.

902
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:29,360
One in here, and it will create
all the combinations with this table

903
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:34,160
to all the rows from the table to okay,
then it will pick in the second doses.

904
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,520
This is how by default school
joins two tables.

905
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,080
If we are not writing

906
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,320
the we are condition,
you guys don't need to actually know this

907
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,800
ignore it if you guys don't understand it.

908
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,800
This is called the cross project.

909
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,960
Do you guys know the

910
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,600
it it is called something special
in activity as well.

911
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,880
When we create all the combination of all

912
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,240
the elements of table one with table two,
it is called something special.

913
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,160
I don't remember it.

914
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,240
And you guys tell me across product
I guess

915
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,880
a cross B multi
something multiplication like this, right?

916
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,040
Yes, This is what is happening in here.

917
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,280
So then we don't specify the conditions.

918
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,400
This is how by default school joins
two tables.

919
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,920
That's
why we see the information like this.

920
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,360
But you guys can ignore this.

921
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,680
This is not required

922
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,360
actually,
that these all of these skill cuties,

923
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,200
they are translated to do that
mathematical things.

924
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,560
Those are cells and then they are executed
inside your computers.

925
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,880
There is a complete
branch of a school that only

926
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,000
tells you

927
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,640
these relationships with respect
to mathematical, it's called

928
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,840
algebraic skill or something like that.

929
01:00:47,840 --> 01:01:00,480
If you guys want to do some research.

930
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,040
Yeah, sorry.

931
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,480
Relational algebra, not algebraic.

932
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,320
It's called relational algebra.

933
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,360
So you guys can actually write

934
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,600
all of the queries
using relational algebra as well.

935
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,560
Those who are good with math.

936
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,080
You guys can have a look

937
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,520
then if deep diving you guys,

938
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,720
I just cannot control my emotion
and the amount of knowledge

939
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,920
that I have inside me.

940
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,280
I have spent a lot of time
studying these databases,

941
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,920
so there are so many things,

942
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:39,120
but I always tried to
actually it was very, very hard at first.

943
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,280
I used to tell a lot of details.

944
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,560
And so the idea is to get confused.

945
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,040
I had like 15 sessions with ASL,
and ASL told me, Hey, ask me, please,

946
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,200
please limit the amount of information
that you tell in your classes.

947
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,360
This tutor,
they cannot understand all of it.

948
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,160
Then I started realizing it then.

949
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,160
Now I know how to limit

950
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,960
so we can ignore

951
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,160
the results
that we are getting in here for now.

952
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,200
But this should be clear
that we have created two copies

953
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,520
and I can

954
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,160
refer to the information
from any of the columns in here.

955
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,520
Now the next thing is that

956
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,160
so I am deleting some of it

957
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,200
and I am creating a copy of this.

958
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,840
And you guys remember I will intentionally

959
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,920
write the wrong query first
and you guys have to tell me

960
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,640
or why did I tell you
it should be a surprise.

961
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,800
I am sorry if I missed
what do I And we have by default,

962
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,280
when we connect to tables,
it's called across the media.

963
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,760
It is called across product.

964
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,480
Right across. We

965
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,560
is alone.

966
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,200
We don't need to do this

967
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,880
all to fix the problem.

968
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,040
This is not a problem.

969
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,360
This is a default behavior.

970
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,840
It runs for everyone.

971
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,320
Yes, all the databases.

972
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,800
This is how they treat you by default.

973
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,240
We already have trust special normalized.

974
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,160
You should not.
We have interest rate issue.

975
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,760
I told Westerwelle that I will not be

976
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,680
exaggerating things for you guys.

977
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,480
If something is difficult,
I will tell you if it is difficult so.

978
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,440
They are learning the nested loops
and this condition.

979
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,960
I tell like
I told them, it's a little difficult.

980
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,280
Oh, they have so many friends
in previous batches they already know.

981
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,920
What does it mean when I say easy peasy?

982
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,160
So what I want to do is that

983
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,120
I want to bring the first name

984
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,520
and the last name from here.

985
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,880
So far we just gave two aliases
to the same table and the table generated

986
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,880
across the start of the first name
with the start of last name.

987
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,120
Yes, you are right. So

988
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,520
and then what I want to do, I

989
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,960
want to join these two tables
based on this managed ID.

990
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,640
So manager directly from here

991
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,960
if it is equal to any of the ID.

992
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,680
So if this number that is present in here,

993
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,360
if it is present
to any of the table in here,

994
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:28,800
then the first name and the last name
I want to bring from here

995
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,080
and then I want to combine
these two results.

996
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,320
I want to call it employee
first name the information

997
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,800
that I am getting from this table
and the manager first name

998
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,640
that I am getting from

999
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,640
this table, that it makes sense, right?

1000
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,760
So I want to match these two ideas.

1001
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,760
One is called the manager idea
that is called employee I.D.

1002
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,000
and if there is a match,
So which one should I use, guys,

1003
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,280
if I I'm trying to solve
with the help of joins,

1004
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,280
should I use left to join drive
to join self join in join

1005
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:14,120
it is actually

1006
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,960
an inner join but because the primary

1007
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:23,240
e is present inside the same
it is called a self join but it in actual

1008
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:26,880
it is an inner join in a join
means the match

1009
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,280
the b that I should be present
in both the tables.

1010
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:31,640
Yeah.

1011
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:36,800
So if it is same in here and in here,

1012
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,200
then this means that let's say

1013
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,240
this Nina a d Steven.

1014
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,040
Why not take the proper example?

1015
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:51,200
So for me, the manager is it 100,
which means

1016
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,200
Steven is the manager of Nina.

1017
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,000
If we do not want all the info.

1018
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,080
So in intersection. Yes.

1019
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,160
Can we write the query now?

1020
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:07,400
Can you guys help me
write down the query now? I

1021
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,960
So we have to write
the real condition in here.

1022
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,400
So what should I do?

1023
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,360
How should I write the condition

1024
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,360
manager not

1025
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,920
Should I put employer idea
or manager writing here

1026
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,320
it is called a manager ID,

1027
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:49,800
it is called employee ID.

1028
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,520
So manager underscore I.D..

1029
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,520
Am I doing it right, guys

1030
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,440
or I am doing it wrong?

1031
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:05,400
Employee Not employee I am.

1032
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,960
I might doing it right.

1033
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,240
Look at this table, guys.

1034
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,680
Look at this table
and tell me I have called

1035
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,400
this table as employee table

1036
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,880
and this table as am and G are table.

1037
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,480
Should I write employee dog manager.

1038
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:26,840
I need our manager.

1039
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:30,840
Dog manager. I.

1040
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,040
I want to create a relationship

1041
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,480
employed or the manager ID

1042
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,760
is equal to manager dog employer ID

1043
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,000
is it correct?

1044
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,160
Guys I found a solution.

1045
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,400
When we have a crazy table diving call ASL
then she will call directly to a square

1046
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,360
during the class and our brains save.

1047
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:01,560
Or are you guys going to record
that part of the video

1048
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:05,560
like you did for was memorize that iconic

1049
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,400
illustrate version of repository

1050
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,920
so you guys will never forget
in your life.

1051
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:25,760
Holiday poster it looks like right?

1052
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:34,160
I am sorry for this.

1053
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:37,280
Yes, it should be

1054
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,880
MP dog manager i.t and

1055
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,520
manager dot employ i.t

1056
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,920
is too early for this

1057
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,200
online guide.

1058
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,000
Let's find out if we are getting
the correct results or not.

1059
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,240
How can I.

1060
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,960
How can I verify this without
going through the start out method?

1061
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,720
I get a lot of results

1062
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,360
so b one does not have

1063
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:25,560
any many right?

1064
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:32,480
Steven does not have any manager database.

1065
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,800
I we are conditioned to check if I am
getting a manager for Steven as well.

1066
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,040
If I am getting a manager for this Steven
as well as well,

1067
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,120
that means I have
done something wrong, right.

1068
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,400
That means I have done something wrong
that.

1069
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,080
Means this idea 100

1070
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,160
is being linked to this idea.

1071
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,400
100 in here. Right.

1072
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,880
So let's let's do that.

1073
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,280
You guys never proved me wrong.

1074
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:10,280
Right?

1075
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:17,120
Okay, we're.

1076
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,880
We are okay.

1077
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,440
Should I say, employ
first name as Steven or manager?

1078
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:29,400
First name as Steven.

1079
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,960
Employee. Right.

1080
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,960
Employed or first name is equal to Steven.

1081
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,960
And so should I capitalize
first letter here as well.

1082
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,560
Or I can just write and Steven like this

1083
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,320
or in this s should be capital

1084
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,760
plus later capital.

1085
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,880
And can I also remove this employee

1086
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:57,240
from here? No.

1087
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,120
Otherwise I still will be confused
which first name

1088
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,360
we are trying to refer right.

1089
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,240
Oh there are two.

1090
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,360
And instead of weird
we should write and in here

1091
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,640
guys, we are also getting the

1092
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:22,400
manager for Steven.

1093
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,360
Guys, I told you in the last class
that I will write, I will

1094
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:39,640
I will write a wrong query
and you guys have to tell me 85.

1095
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,000
What is going on?

1096
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,720
Okay, let me do this.

1097
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,920
That means you guys have not
you guys have not understood this.

1098
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,440
So don't write.

1099
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,640
How many of you
are able to find this issue.

1100
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,960
I still there the manager for Steven.

1101
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,640
I should not be getting the manager for.

1102
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:11,680
Steven Right.

1103
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:19,480
Can you Suzanne dear record,
please give that to me.

1104
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:19,960
Okay,

1105
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:27,600
guys, let me explain it again.

1106
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:50,160
I think it will make more sense like this.

1107
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,320
Let me remove this

1108
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:56,040
and let's focus on this

1109
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:02,080
part.

1110
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,280
So first, what I did,

1111
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,720
you guys will see this.

1112
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,320
Steven as well.

1113
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,240
Don't really

1114
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,120
let me send what what

1115
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:18,600
what are the items
that you guys are getting?

1116
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,560
How can it do I how can it
they will do and push itself.

1117
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,720
It is weird from the beginning.

1118
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,560
Wrong keyword not found.

1119
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,000
Eskil come on not properly ended.

1120
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,360
Okay let me sent this.

1121
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,520
I think you're this guilty
and tell me if you guys

1122
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:59,520
see the output.

1123
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,160
So just to make things clear,
I think it will not confuse

1124
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:07,480
you guys that much.

1125
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:09,520
Let me do this case.

1126
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,320
Why not?

1127
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,040
Let's only

1128
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,960
get the results

1129
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,120
for plus, let's say

1130
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,160
maybe one, two, three, four,
five employees.

1131
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,800
Let me show you the results step by step.

1132
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,400
So we're

1133
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,240
employee ideally in

1134
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,520
one or one

1135
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:50,520
300 111 or 2113.

1136
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,400
Tell me, guys,
if something is confusing you two and 105

1137
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,240
So let's let's do this only for the

1138
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,280
first

1139
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:12,360
five employees.

1140
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:38,840
And also let me show the ideas in here.

1141
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:59,840
So right now
we are getting the growth product in here.

1142
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,320
Let me also that

1143
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:32,960
okay, now looks good.

1144
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,520
Only five results.

1145
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,120
But the gross product again here.

1146
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,240
Okay.
Because we are missing the inner join.

1147
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,040
Okay, it's fine,

1148
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,400
but we will not be getting more results
this time

1149
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,960
other than these five employees
when we tried to join.

1150
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,320
So now I have created three copies

1151
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,920
and they looks good.

1152
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,680
The result is confusing

1153
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,600
because of this

1154
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:12,240
cross product in.

1155
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:17,520
Okay, let me do this.

1156
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:22,880
This should work fine.

1157
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,160
So this index is different for Oracle.

1158
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,880
Our tool in our role in

1159
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,600
the last

1160
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,600
we are wrong.

1161
01:17:42,600 --> 01:18:00,280
Number four.

1162
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:06,720
Okay, Now it looks flawed, right?

1163
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:07,240
But again,

1164
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,200
because we do not have that acuity,
we are still getting that cross product.

1165
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,760
So Steven is being cross product
with first with all of the

1166
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,320
role of the other table,

1167
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,840
other manager table.

1168
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,000
No, no, we should not be.

1169
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,840
Once we tried to write the proper
condition, we should not be seeing this

1170
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,200
manager in here.

1171
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,760
Okay, So let me right now show you will be

1172
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,400
manager.

1173
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,240
They did the proper link in here

1174
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,560
all but then.

1175
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:47,240
Sorry. And

1176
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:57,960
so let me try this guys.

1177
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:01,760
So Manager dot

1178
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,560
employer

1179
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,600
idea is equal to

1180
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,880
e p dot oops.

1181
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,920
So this

1182
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,960
e MP dot

1183
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,760
manager already right

1184
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,920
here the script after the changes.

1185
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:40,080
Okay, let me put it this.

1186
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,200
I am still confused right now.

1187
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,360
Y and during the first line

1188
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,880
manager and or last name

1189
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,320
as manager dot first name in the
not in the line

1190
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,480
plus right left verify

1191
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,600
so for Nina

1192
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:17,040
the manager is Steven right.

1193
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,960
But in here

1194
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,200
we get the manager as the thing

1195
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
right we do

1196
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:30,120
let me correct this query

1197
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,200
and then I will explain to you Let

1198
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,480
or the people

1199
01:20:54,480 --> 01:21:02,960
giving the cross product in here as well.

1200
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:09,600
Weird guys, give me 2 minutes.

1201
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,120
I will. Or

1202
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,960
I need a break

1203
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,440
for minutes.

1204
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,840
Okay. Just give me 4 minutes.

1205
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,600
Otherwise I will give you a break
and then I will do the research to

1206
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,400
fix this before and after the break.

1207
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:42,240
I will explain. 40

1208
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,640
No, just

1209
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:15,480
guys.

1210
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,400
I good.

1211
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,560
And you see, I am bringing the employer
in from both details.

1212
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,400
You guys didn't tell me
we spent so much time.

1213
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:27,560
What we should be writing Manager in here.

1214
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:28,920
Andy, are

1215
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:33,840
okay?

1216
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,600
Well, I was confused why it is not working

1217
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:40,000
because one board decided
to erode the employer ID.

1218
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,440
We were always bringing the employee I.D..

1219
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,080
Come on, guys.

1220
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,600
You guys didn't tell me

1221
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,040
we are 11.

1222
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,040
I was so confused, man.

1223
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,280
Why? Why? This is happening in here.

1224
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,600
The results,
they are not working either way.

1225
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,680
Okay?

1226
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:04,200
And now? No, really.

1227
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:10,080
Give me five more minutes.

1228
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,760
And the man, at least you should have
told me this flat I am using.

1229
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:18,320
The manager on board decides

1230
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,720
this is what I was doing.

1231
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:25,680
I wrote employ in here
and employee in here.

1232
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:29,280
Some more to the first names

1233
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,480
and in here

1234
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,960
or the

1235
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,680
sorry, the first name in here.

1236
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,880
The last name in here.

1237
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,160
It should be first name like this

1238
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,640
and employ I.D.

1239
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,360
employee I.D.

1240
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,400
And it should be employed.

1241
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,440
So I was not bringing the first names
always

1242
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,000
like this does.

1243
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,880
It makes sense now

1244
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,120
for now, confusion is universal.

1245
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,800
Okay.

1246
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,440
Okay.

1247
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,280
Now let me tell you what I did wrong.

1248
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:22,960
Also, first, let me tell this.

1249
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,120
This is the correct query.

1250
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,000
Nice Forget whatever
I have been doing in last 15 minutes,

1251
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
if this is the correct duty.

1252
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,480
And now tell me
let me tell my mistake as well in

1253
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,360
in the the
I should be bringing the first name

1254
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,960
of the manager as well, which case

1255
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,280
I have really confused you.

1256
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,840
What what we were doing
we were bringing the first name

1257
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,720
of the employees
and the last name of the managers.

1258
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:59,280
I was so confused that
why I am not getting the proper results.

1259
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,880
Because because of this,
because I never brought the first name

1260
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,080
of the manager or who who understand this.

1261
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,800
Let me let me reproduce
the problem as well.

1262
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:16,080
Next in here, I was

1263
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:20,760
always bringing the last name of manager
like this.

1264
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:23,560
Like this. I

1265
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,960
like this.

1266
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:32,040
That's why even though there is no
manager, I was still getting the results

1267
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,360
like this.

1268
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,000
I was.

1269
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,040
Instead of getting Steven,
I was getting going.

1270
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,720
Right? And I was confused.

1271
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,920
Why not?

1272
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,320
Has a manager as a Steven.

1273
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,680
But how come
we are seeing this going in here?

1274
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,760
We wrote that to you before

1275
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,560
I and Hasim

1276
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,920
asked so many times
you ignored all My God,

1277
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:04,960
maybe
I was not looking at the screen right?

1278
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:09,840
And these silly mistakes
they can waste many, many,

1279
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:15,560
many, many hours still. Yes.

1280
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,200
11. Now, this is now
is the time for this emoji.

1281
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,840
Yeah.

1282
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,400
Okay, Let me here
because, guys, let's have a break.

1283
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,320
I think we all need
a break before I can bombard

1284
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,560
it. Let's have a

1285
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:42,360
15 minute break.

1286
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:47,400
And also let me contact this students
with two which are supposed to join us

1287
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,720
break do 1147 You guys already told

1288
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:57,440
you guys try to bag me
when something is very, very important.

1289
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,240
And that can be the time of all class.

1290
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,560
Call that and we need some more.

1291
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,360
Because you wrote the last name.

1292
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,280
Yes, I wrote the last name.

1293
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,480
And I was confused why we are getting

1294
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,080
the king as the manager.

1295
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,120
Why not Stephen

1296
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:18,600
Nice.

1297
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,920
Let's have a break.

1298
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,840
Take some fresh air

1299
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,920
and let's meet after 15 minutes
and reminding me about the recording.

1300
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,280
I will explain from the start.

1301
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:32,400
Don't worry.

1302
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,240
Recording.

1303
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:35,520
Please be patient.

1304
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:47,160
We are recording.

1305
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:47,800
Okay.

1306
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:50,720
I will keep my one eye on the chat

1307
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:58,000
as well. I

1308
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,880
is also here.

1309
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,280
Oh my God.

1310
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:02,880
I hear.

1311
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,760
You missed the

1312
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:13,320
I am hungry

1313
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:17,160
when I am hungry and angry.

1314
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,480
No need to record anyway.

1315
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:24,800
If you will watch that video ten times
and the thing will be clear.

1316
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,880
All right, guys.

1317
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:30,040
So and we created two copies

1318
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:33,800
of the same table.

1319
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,560
Okay.

1320
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:37,320
One, I called as MP, so let's say

1321
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,200
this is the MP table

1322
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,960
and the second copy I called as the

1323
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,600
M and g r k, but okay

1324
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,760
from the employed table.

1325
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:00,320
So I am saying MP, not employee I,

1326
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,960
which means I am asking a skill
to give this information

1327
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:09,720
and I am renaming this information
as MP under school.

1328
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:10,080
Right.

1329
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,000
That's why I see this MP already in here.

1330
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,400
The second piece of information

1331
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,400
that I am asking school
to give me is the first name

1332
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,720
of the employee.

1333
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:24,840
So and I have renamed

1334
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,080
that as

1335
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,960
MP underscore first name.

1336
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,760
Therefore I icmp

1337
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,360
underscore name in here,
so I did not fascinate me.

1338
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,280
MP name and

1339
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,240
I am using an inner join,

1340
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:44,760
which means if the information

1341
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:49,040
is available on both sides,
then only I will see details.

1342
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:52,160
That's why the first idea the idea

1343
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,760
for this reason is empty

1344
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:57,760
and there is no match inside.

1345
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,240
The manager table.
That's why I don't see this. Stephen.

1346
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:01,400
I don't see this.

1347
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:05,360
Stephen and I start seeing the information
from Nina.

1348
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:07,760
So faster that I get as Nina.

1349
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,080
Then then Alexander, then Bruce,
then David.

1350
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:23,280
It is clear guys, still this point,
it is a necessity.

1351
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,280
Otherwise it will confuse you more.

1352
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:29,240
If I don't get renamed, it will confuse

1353
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:35,400
you more. That

1354
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:37,160
is it.

1355
01:30:37,160 --> 01:31:04,000
Is it clear what I have explained
till this point?

1356
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,280
Mike, you didn't find

1357
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:09,480
I was trying to retrieve Stephen
as an employee with no manager name.

1358
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:11,160
Easy peasy

1359
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,360
so far.

1360
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:20,480
The back, the manager already that we are.

1361
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,400
So you must have written it
in a different order here.

1362
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,840
Yes, you must have written.

1363
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,800
I will explain that as.

1364
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:30,560
But give me one moment. So.

1365
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,440
Okay then I am also

1366
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,680
bringing the first name
from the manager table,

1367
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:42,600
which means I will be getting these
first names

1368
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,560
from this manager table

1369
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,000
and I have renamed that as manager
first name.

1370
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,080
So I will see the manager
first name in here as well.

1371
01:31:55,080 --> 01:32:00,160
Okay, so it should be this.

1372
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,360
The query should be clear till this part

1373
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:04,960
in here.

1374
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,280
This part I have only written this part

1375
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,680
to only get the five results.

1376
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,360
And which five results I want.

1377
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:20,520
I want the five results for ID
100 10123425.

1378
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,360
So that I don't get so many results
and you guys can verify

1379
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,080
the information easily.

1380
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,320
So five results are displayed in here.

1381
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:29,640
In here.

1382
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:33,280
And I have also limited
the information to five rows

1383
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,440
so that you guys can cross verify things
if it is working fine or not.

1384
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,800
So this part has nothing
to do with this self

1385
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,000
and you want
you guys can ignore this part as well.

1386
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:53,600
If it is confusing,
you all go till this point.

1387
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,360
Okay.

1388
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,120
Now this joined back

1389
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,040
in part what I am saying.

1390
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,600
I am saying

1391
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,600
from the manager table this table

1392
01:33:04,760 --> 01:33:05,880
I want to

1393
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,520
match the employer ID row number
easy to keyboard.

1394
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,000
It is a way.

1395
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,920
Yes, it is a keyword in oracle skill
only in my skill

1396
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:20,280
we use the limit keyword to limit
the number rows.

1397
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:22,080
We can add the join as well.

1398
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,400
Yes. Or one you.

1399
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,160
We cannot be joined as well.

1400
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:29,120
But again joins is not a universal

1401
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,520
it might not work on some of the databases

1402
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:36,320
or it might be the case

1403
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:41,400
that the join is called something else
like inner join

1404
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:45,760
or simply join or something else
on a different database.

1405
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:53,360
But this weird clause,
it will work on all databases.

1406
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,040
The next thing I am saying
from the manager table,

1407
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,040
I want to match these IDs, these ideas

1408
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,080
with the employer table, which is this one

1409
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:09,000
from the manager column.

1410
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:13,400
So what I still will do
as school will pick a manager

1411
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:17,240
already from here.

1412
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:18,000
Okay.

1413
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,640
And it will go inside the manager table

1414
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:23,920
and it will such a person
that has this idea.

1415
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,720
So Stephen has this idea.

1416
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:30,000
Okay, so I see this Stephen

1417
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,000
as the manager of Nina.

1418
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,720
Then again for this second row, again
the ID is 100,

1419
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:41,640
so a skill will again
start this inside the manager table.

1420
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,800
As the employer ID,
you see manager dot employer I.

1421
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,320
I have written manager don't employ any
so it will go manager

1422
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,320
and then the employer ID.

1423
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,200
So again ID find this Stephen so displace

1424
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,920
this Stephen as the manager
for the lets as well.

1425
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:00,480
Then it will match the third row.

1426
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:06,320
It will check the manager ID for
the Alexander is one or two again.

1427
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:13,200
It will go inside this manager table
and it will find the 102 as this let's.

1428
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:18,240
That's why we get the let's as the manager
then for the brewers

1429
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,960
and for the David
we have manager ID as 103.

1430
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:23,640
So again

1431
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,320
this Alexander

1432
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:29,720
is Brown from this manager table
as the manager I think

1433
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,480
this is the correct approach
that I should have written.

1434
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:38,800
But in last 20 minutes what I did wrong

1435
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,960
was instead of Manager firstName,

1436
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:45,920
I wrote in here

1437
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,280
the last name

1438
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:51,560
and because that
But what confused me was that

1439
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,120
instead of Stephen as the manager of Nina,

1440
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:58,560
my session has expired.

1441
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,080
Let me copy this query.

1442
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,480
Letting the session of

1443
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,720
the need to add debug option in database.

1444
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,960
So what I did instead manager ID

1445
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:17,160
and you guys also tried to told me, but

1446
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:19,680
I didn't check the check.

1447
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:24,240
I returned the manager dot last
and what was happening

1448
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,440
instead of Stephen as the as the manager

1449
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,520
the last name of Stephen is king.

1450
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:34,280
So King was appearing in the manager first
and I was sure that

1451
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,720
the manager of Nina is Stephen
and I was confused why it is not working.

1452
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,520
So I tried changing this

1453
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,480
a sequence in here

1454
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:46,240
because
it affects how the results are brought.

1455
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,520
And I tried many, many things, but at last

1456
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,840
I found that instead of last name

1457
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:56,160
I should have the first name in here

1458
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:59,160
that kind of wasted the last

1459
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:05,280
20 to 25 minutes.

1460
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,840
Stephen is king, so it is normal
that he does not have a manager.

1461
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:14,920
Miriam or nice
you guys very lucky actually.

1462
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:18,600
You guys missed the first part.

1463
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,160
You guys are very lucky

1464
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,000
after many, many years.

1465
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,560
I remember it reminded me my initial days

1466
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,120
of working as a developer.

1467
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:33,240
This is what I have been
I did for many, many years.

1468
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,280
Those small, silly mistake.

1469
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:43,080
I used to spend hours
on these type of things.

1470
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:47,560
We broke out of our brain.

1471
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,320
I saw

1472
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,920
this is how simple the self adjoins are.

1473
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,040
Guys. Come on.

1474
01:37:55,040 --> 01:38:00,520
They are very simple.

1475
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:06,760
Do I think the information
to the same table?

1476
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,320
Did we download anything new? Yes.

1477
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:16,480
We downloaded so many things.

1478
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,280
Okay guys,
spend some time with the self join

1479
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,040
because we.

1480
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,400
I have to cover so many other things.

1481
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:27,960
I will again go through this self
join in the next class as well

1482
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,080
so that you guys are good
with the self joins

1483
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:37,440
and let send you the theory as well.

1484
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:44,160
So now you guys can remove
this part as well if you want.

1485
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,880
So there things look even simpler

1486
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,440
self and do on without the pivot.

1487
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,760
So we are writing a join with the
where clause

1488
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:02,600
of the term is called

1489
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:06,360
self can join you can achieve
the same thing with different

1490
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,160
in different ways.

1491
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:15,040
I will go over this self join again
in the next class.

1492
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:20,200
No, don't worry if it is confusing you.

1493
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,520
Let me check.

1494
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,000
So this was self.

1495
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,560
Join self and join a castle on a table.

1496
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,720
Takes a selfie

1497
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,280
itself in it is a regular join

1498
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:38,320
but on the table is joined with itself.

1499
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:43,280
So next thing is the SAT operator
one more skill class left right.

1500
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:48,240
Hopefully we will be able to color
all in the next class,

1501
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,480
but if required I will add more classes.

1502
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:52,400
Don't worry.

1503
01:39:52,400 --> 01:40:05,280
If required, I will add more classes.

1504
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:06,360
It will.

1505
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:10,240
The next thing
is, guys, the self operators.

1506
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:15,200
Now first, let me tell you why
we need this set operator

1507
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:21,640
So and you guys still have

1508
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:25,200
three review classes
as well, at least to review a classic

1509
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,200
one will be on Monday

1510
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,640
and this coming Monday

1511
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,120
and next will be on Thursday.

1512
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:47,480
And in the coming Monday.

1513
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:48,840
Let me change my settings.

1514
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,040
I think it really has

1515
01:40:51,040 --> 01:41:00,160
slowed down the performance.

1516
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:05,920
So we have this person table and there is
also a person table, if I am not wrong.

1517
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:35,280
Yes, I don't have first on two and three.

1518
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:44,120
You guys don't see the percent
two and three table.

1519
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:47,560
Oh let me.

1520
01:41:47,880 --> 01:42:02,720
Yeah.

1521
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,880
Or I think I need to give you permission

1522
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,320
to see this table.

1523
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:11,280
I think I have not given you
the permission.

1524
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,520
Okay, You guys don't need it.

1525
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:15,520
Just. Just just just work with.

1526
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,120
Just watch what I am doing in here.

1527
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:19,720
You can test it on any table

1528
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:25,240
in this table, Pretty much everything.

1529
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,240
I think you have to restart this

1530
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:28,880
in grade

1531
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:33,120
software, because I clicked somewhere
where we would.

1532
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:34,240
I should not.

1533
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:40,520
I am not supposed to click.

1534
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:44,600
We are low lowly

1535
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,600
regions who are not allowed to access

1536
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:51,000
to classified information.

1537
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,280
No, no,
there is no classified information.

1538
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:58,320
Ellen is a very simple information.

1539
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:01,200
Guys like me, they started this

1540
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:04,080
these all good.

1541
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:19,680
So this is it is not even closing.

1542
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:20,680
I think

1543
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:49,480
that is my task manager.

1544
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:51,040
Well, Windows by Mac.

1545
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:54,000
It is not because of Windows
it is because of this

1546
01:43:56,720 --> 01:44:10,640
My skill workbench.

1547
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:15,120
I think we are still getting many,
many benefits

1548
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:22,160
from free software.

1549
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,480
So let me show you the
this table person to

1550
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,160
do it please.

1551
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,880
The there is nothing to do.

1552
01:44:50,880 --> 01:45:05,400
I am waiting for the tutor to execute.

1553
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:09,800
I think before meeting any person
we should do two things

1554
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:13,760
make them use slow internet
and my skills workbench

1555
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:22,560
and you guys will be in good shape
after marriage.

1556
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:35,600
They will have a lot of patience
after this.

1557
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:41,760
Finally, all my colleague finally.

1558
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,280
Guys, did you notice something different

1559
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:47,640
with about this person today?

1560
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:53,080
But there is something weird
that you guys noticed about this person.

1561
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,800
Whatever.

1562
01:45:55,800 --> 01:46:02,160
Well, what is that?

1563
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:04,640
They are told it is faster

1564
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,320
if you do that.

1565
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,440
It's not

1566
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,880
okay.

1567
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,480
So there is some information

1568
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,480
and so there is
there is an overlap of information.

1569
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:18,520
The same data that is presented
inside of the person.

1570
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:19,560
The table

1571
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:23,880
is also present inside the person

1572
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:31,920
to table right.

1573
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,000
Except this part.

1574
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,640
This part

1575
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:38,960
is the same as this part.

1576
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,120
Right, guys?

1577
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:44,440
So two tables,
they are having the same information.

1578
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:48,360
What if I have to combine the information

1579
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,600
of two tables which have same columns now?

1580
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,840
First, let me tell you why.

1581
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,760
Why two tables
might contain the same information.

1582
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:02,320
So in real life, what happens
is that as we create the tables with time,

1583
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:03,600
if the application is

1584
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:08,080
something like, say, for example,
if we are dealing with the credit, if the

1585
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:12,560
if we are dealing with a credit card
domain, let's say, for example,

1586
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:17,800
we might have thousands of transactions

1587
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:22,040
per day and maybe millions of transactions

1588
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:25,160
per month and eventually
maybe billions of transactions.

1589
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,040
All right.

1590
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:26,680
If let's say

1591
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:30,400
we are storing the information related
to the transactions of a credit card,

1592
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,240
what do you guys think?

1593
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:35,600
Can we have huge amounts of data
in that scenario or not?

1594
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:41,440
Or let's say if we are talking about the
about a website like Amazon

1595
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:46,880
and if we are recording
the information related to orders, again,

1596
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,520
we can have billions of records
in a table.

1597
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:55,560
But whenever we put so much data
inside the same table,

1598
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,880
if we run our queries, they will be very,

1599
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:03,320
very,
very slow, might take hours to execute.

1600
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:07,000
So what we do once a table has grown

1601
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,600
to such size,
let's say millions of entries,

1602
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:13,080
we archive those.

1603
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:15,160
All the results.

1604
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:19,240
So and if we need those results,

1605
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,640
if the application is

1606
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:26,160
required or the old information

1607
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:30,720
and the new information
available at the same time, what do we do?

1608
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:34,440
We create tables like person one person

1609
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,360
to person to the person forward

1610
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:41,120
so that we can speed up our duties.

1611
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:45,440
So it is possible
that same piece of information,

1612
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:49,320
same tables can exist in a database
having same columns.

1613
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:52,840
And why we do that
so that we can split the information

1614
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:55,720
in two different
and we can speed up the queries.

1615
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,520
Does it make sense? Right?

1616
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:00,240
Why we can have exact

1617
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,760
same schema for two tables

1618
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,240
now, whenever it happens

1619
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,240
now we need to modify the queue.

1620
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,000
It is also right.

1621
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,480
If I want all the data from this table

1622
01:49:15,480 --> 01:49:18,960
and this table now, how can I do that?

1623
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:23,520
I want to bring the first name and
the last name from this table and table.

1624
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:29,280
Right now we have a problem.

1625
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,440
Can you guys think of a query to do that?

1626
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:35,480
No. Join will be bringing the data
in horizontal way, passing

1627
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,960
not in vertical way, not stacking up
the rows from both the tables.

1628
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:41,400
Does it make sense?

1629
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:45,960
So guys do lines there the joins
the things in parallel if something is

1630
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:49,920
matching in here and in the second table,
then we will be getting that row.

1631
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,760
But this time I want all the data
from this table one

1632
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:57,960
stacked up with all the data
from table two.

1633
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:01,240
Do you guys understand the difference
between the lines and this scenario?

1634
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,040
It is not possible with joints

1635
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,080
right left thing.

1636
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:10,120
It is not possible.

1637
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:10,840
Okay.

1638
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:13,480
If it is possible, right. Actually,

1639
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:17,400
I want to see the results from here
and here inside

1640
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:23,160
a column named as firstName.

1641
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:28,320
No, thanks.

1642
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,720
So far. Back to we have the set operator.

1643
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:32,480
Let me show you.

1644
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,800
It will make more sense

1645
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,440
How are you asking something
we don't know.

1646
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,480
I am not asking.

1647
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:43,400
But you guys are saying it is possible
with the help of something

1648
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,000
that you already know.

1649
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,120
So I thought maybe you will.

1650
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:49,480
You would add, you will, you would.

1651
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:54,720
You would increase my knowledge as then
by doing the same thing with the setup.

1652
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:57,800
It is something that you guys
already don't trust us.

1653
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:02,400
So being that there's two different
tables, we can't use, joints

1654
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:08,800
we can use joins, but the joints,
they work in a horizontal fashion.

1655
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,960
They,
they don't work in a vertical effect.

1656
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,880
Let me actually show you.

1657
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:16,880
Let me write acuity for you
and then you guys will understand what

1658
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:25,560
I mean.

1659
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:34,040
So I am saying select first name, select

1660
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,080
last name and

1661
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:42,320
do the same from here.

1662
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:42,960
Right

1663
01:51:46,160 --> 01:52:13,920
limit to the.

1664
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:16,320
So I get to John

1665
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:19,040
Daddy Mary and came right nice

1666
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:22,880
from this first guilty to results
I have intentionally

1667
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:31,800
immaturity results.

1668
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:35,400
If I execute this query
on the second table,

1669
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:39,520
it is a different table
so it might have different information.

1670
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:51,760
It has same information.

1671
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:58,360
Let me intentionally
change this information.

1672
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:00,120
Okay for you all to find.

1673
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:02,720
So in here I have Ali,

1674
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:06,640
Mike, and Sara.

1675
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:12,360
So now what I want to do,
I have three results from percent two

1676
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:16,280
and two results from person table right.

1677
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:16,880
This is clear.

1678
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,720
These two results from percent.

1679
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:21,240
Table three results from percent two.

1680
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:23,880
And I want to get now

1681
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:27,640
I want to write that you read
that gives me five results in total.

1682
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:29,520
I want

1683
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:32,240
to articulate
that gives me five results in total.

1684
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:35,120
And it includes these two results from

1685
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:40,760
and these three results in here.

1686
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:44,560
So let me let me also do that

1687
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:27,080
very quickly.

1688
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:27,440
Limit.

1689
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:31,080
Limit does not work with union with

1690
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:45,320
it will be confusing for you.

1691
01:54:45,320 --> 01:54:46,440
Give me one winner today.

1692
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:49,480
Let me make it easy for you

1693
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:58,720
again.

1694
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:01,280
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not again.
Not again.

1695
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:03,520
Just 2 minutes. What again?

1696
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:06,400
Just want to make sure
that you guys understand it correctly.

1697
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:14,720
Not again.

1698
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:22,080
Definitely not again.

1699
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:25,640
I have already invested a lot of time

1700
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:25,960
in order.

1701
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:31,800
This time, and I will also keep on
looking the messages

1702
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:35,800
that we have access to person to know
you guys don't have

1703
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:40,080
when you say the it scares me,
you do the hard easy.

1704
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,600
Are you sure?
No, no, it is very hard. Give me

1705
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:49,000
give me to.

1706
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,400
Yes. So, Dawn, Mary Ali.

1707
01:55:52,120 --> 01:55:55,920
Okay. And

1708
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:02,400
we I will also

1709
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,760
tell you how to do the same thing
on other tables as well.

1710
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,920
First, let me teach you the concept.

1711
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,760
So I do four or five, six

1712
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:24,360
for Guy.

1713
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,800
This marriage stuff
will break his brain already

1714
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:30,480
seem.

1715
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,480
I think you are right. I am.

1716
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:35,400
I have started getting three there
so three rows in here

1717
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:39,320
Touro three rows in here.

1718
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:40,160
Right.

1719
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,560
Don Mattingly from person to table

1720
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:50,600
and Ali,

1721
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:54,800
Mike and Sara from from here.

1722
01:56:54,800 --> 01:57:00,200
So now if I want to see both
to the results from both the table,

1723
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,640
I can write more the theories

1724
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:05,720
and I can write reunion in here.

1725
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:08,760
And if I execute this query

1726
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:13,920
as a whole,

1727
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:19,080
I will see those those results
that I was getting from the first query.

1728
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:22,440
Plus, I am also getting the results

1729
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:30,960
which were from the second query.

1730
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,080
Those results were six in total.

1731
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:36,760
Right left me. So these three results from

1732
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:39,120
let me draw

1733
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:42,600
these three results
that I was getting individually

1734
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:47,880
are coming from this query
and these three results.

1735
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:51,360
They are coming from this query

1736
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:56,160
and this union,
all what this union all is doing,

1737
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:01,840
it is combining the results
from both the queries in a single set

1738
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:05,320
so that we can see the rows in a vertical

1739
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:08,640
fashion.

1740
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:16,080
Is is it clear?

1741
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:18,640
So guys on this one more thing

1742
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:23,720
the same in the
when I put to this reunion,

1743
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:26,360
all I see the duplicate results

1744
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:32,200
are this Ali is duplicate right
it is coming from both the curious.

1745
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:36,480
If I only want the unique results,

1746
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:45,840
I can remove this all from here.

1747
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,080
I think I should create separate tables
for each concept.

1748
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:51,960
Maybe to avoid these
kind of things in the future.

1749
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:56,400
So if I remove the union,
if I remove the all operator,

1750
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:00,600
I don't see the duplicate that the data.

1751
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:03,040
Now Ali is appearing only once.

1752
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:07,480
If I put the all operator in here,
then I see the duplicate that

1753
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:15,480
I as well.

1754
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,640
So this union,

1755
01:59:19,240 --> 01:59:20,320
this union.

1756
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:25,200
But what it is doing once
it triggered the out

1757
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:29,520
from both to be curious both of the tables
it also perform

1758
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:34,200
which extra operation is being performed
in here guys in the case of union

1759
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,440
when do we get the same effects.

1760
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:41,800
Well with what is the keyword
that we use this thing, right?

1761
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:48,160
So the union performs
the stacking of two of the data

1762
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:51,160
from two tables,
plus the distinct operation.

1763
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:56,520
But the union all it only performs
the vertical starting stacking.

1764
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,640
Can you guys
tell me which one will be faster out

1765
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:05,880
of these two union all or union?

1766
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:10,240
No guys it will be slow because it has to
perform that distinct operation as well.

1767
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:13,920
Union all will be faster.

1768
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:18,560
So most of the time in the industry
you guys will see union all being used.

1769
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:22,160
But if you really don't
want to look at the duplicate data,

1770
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,960
you can use the union Operator
Now tell me,

1771
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:30,240
was it hard or easy to understand
the union operator And now tell me, is it

1772
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:34,200
something that we can do with the
are clause by it

1773
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:42,640
by and by joining the table?

1774
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:48,240
Can we achieve the same effects by joins?

1775
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:52,680
Yes, we can.

1776
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:53,080
And not.

1777
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:56,600
Can you write a query please?

1778
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:58,760
Maybe I should
tell our skill guys they have

1779
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:00,240
they have

1780
02:01:00,240 --> 02:01:03,240
just added this union without any purpose.

1781
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:03,560
Right.

1782
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:06,320
We can achieve the same thing

1783
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:11,280
and with this smart again.

1784
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,520
All right, guys. So,

1785
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:16,320
okay, one more thing.

1786
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:18,560
It is not the union and the union.

1787
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:21,320
All okay.

1788
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:24,120
Two, three, four, five, six.

1789
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:26,240
We also have

1790
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:27,200
intercepts.

1791
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:29,120
Intercept, intercept.

1792
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:34,000
What the intercept will do it
will only bring those roles which are

1793
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,960
available in both of their tables,
but it is not supported in my school.

1794
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:41,520
And then we have minus as well.

1795
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:45,120
So but minus will do it
will subtract those roles

1796
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:48,640
which are present in the table B as well.

1797
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:51,720
And it give us the remaining result,

1798
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:54,240
but it is also not supported in my school.

1799
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:57,320
You guys can check if they are supported

1800
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:00,880
in Oracle as well,
but they are very, very rare.

1801
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,640
It is very, very clear
that you guys will be using them.

1802
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:08,640
So we will not be looking at those two
because in here the tables

1803
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:09,720
they are complex

1804
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:14,280
and it will not make much more sense
and they are not that much used

1805
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:18,880
user to join the results of

1806
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:22,200
two or more select statements rules.

1807
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:24,840
Okay, so we have some rules as well.

1808
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:27,720
Same number columns must be selected.

1809
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:31,280
So for example,
I cannot do this that I select

1810
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:33,800
only one column in here

1811
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:37,080
and I select to columns in the query

1812
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:40,200
which I am doing the union with.

1813
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,160
Right.

1814
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:44,280
So but my ask really is great.

1815
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:46,240
It, it might work.

1816
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:47,880
We might still get results.

1817
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:50,760
It's very rare
that we get at as in my estimate.

1818
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:53,600
Oh, finally we have added the no.

1819
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:56,800
It is also giving error in it as well.

1820
02:02:57,240 --> 02:03:00,000
But Oracle one,
it will definitely give you an error.

1821
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,760
So. So this is the first rule.

1822
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:05,360
Same number of columns
in both to the select statement

1823
02:03:07,240 --> 02:03:08,360
and a dead body.

1824
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:10,680
Types of the columns and must be same.

1825
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:15,120
This thing works in my sequel,
even that our types don't match.

1826
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:19,160
It will still work,
but in Oracle you will be getting into.

1827
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:24,120
So for example, I can not do this

1828
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:28,880
in here I select the Edge column.

1829
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:32,440
So in here
I am selecting firstName last name,

1830
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:36,040
which are both like job types
like strings.

1831
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:39,720
But in here I am selecting the Age column,
which is nomadic.

1832
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:42,720
I guess.

1833
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:45,240
But it will work in my skill.

1834
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:45,600
It will.

1835
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:48,600
You will not get any errors, you see.

1836
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:53,000
But if you guys try to do
the same other databases

1837
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:57,560
like Oracle or my skill server,
it will give you an error.

1838
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:00,120
For example, if I do this

1839
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:06,720
so firstname from employee
technical glitch

1840
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:09,760
or you will be out of there
to be rejected.

1841
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:11,840
So first name from

1842
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:18,240
at our DOT employees.

1843
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:20,400
So this task will display department

1844
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:24,080
ID and managerial
from both employer and department.

1845
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:26,000
Please remove duplicates and solve them.

1846
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,560
Astounding was about union. Yes.
All right. You are right.

1847
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:31,720
Is it possible to use here distinct

1848
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,040
union have the distinct

1849
02:04:35,120 --> 02:04:38,080
so you don't need to do
the distinct separately.

1850
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:44,000
So I want my ask Really So find does
not reject you even if you make a mistake.

1851
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,400
Yes, you have. Right?

1852
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:48,320
I use the Intersect. Yeah, Intersect.

1853
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:53,520
Well, yes, I think intersect and minus
they works in in Oracle database.

1854
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:56,200
I think they work,
but they don't work in my sequel. Right.

1855
02:04:56,200 --> 02:04:59,280
Have you guys tried this, the middle
or someone else?

1856
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,360
Can you quickly try that?

1857
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:04,000
If we have the Intersect
or minus keyword in my sequel,

1858
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:09,680
if they were in my sequel,
a copy might let me share my query.

1859
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:11,360
Just put

1860
02:05:17,320 --> 02:05:20,160
No, and so am

1861
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:24,200
I spelling it right?

1862
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:24,960
Intersect.

1863
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:30,120
Yes, it is already giving an error
and the other one is minus.

1864
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:33,480
No, they are not
even recognized as keywords.

1865
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:37,320
There might be a separate

1866
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,400
and there might be other ways
to do the same, but

1867
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:41,640
they are not supported it.

1868
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:45,960
We can see it because we don't have access
to person to table.

1869
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:48,560
Yes, but you guys can write this query
on any table.

1870
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:52,920
I just use the person tool
so that you can understand it easily.

1871
02:05:53,480 --> 02:05:57,040
So I am doing the same thing on the Oracle
one in here as well.

1872
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:58,840
So you guys can follow me in here.

1873
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:20,520
So I am selecting the first name
from the employee stable.

1874
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:21,200
Okay.

1875
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:24,040
And let me select so

1876
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:26,520
a union

1877
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:29,400
select.

1878
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:32,560
Tell me some other column,
which is let's say

1879
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,080
may be

1880
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:38,360
employed.

1881
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:39,840
Right? It is a number column.

1882
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,960
So the first name is Water.

1883
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:57,600
The employee ID is number.

1884
02:06:57,600 --> 02:07:01,960
So if I try to do the union in here,
my session will be expired

1885
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:05,160
and I will reload the page.

1886
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:09,120
Last night I didn't get sleep,
but now I am trying to convince myself

1887
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:12,560
that you are not going too fast.

1888
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:17,400
You guys, you can always talk me

1889
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:20,680
So I am on still a union part.

1890
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,240
We have only like two things
the self unions

1891
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:29,160
and the unions.

1892
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,320
So this is the channel
that you guys will get.

1893
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:33,960
Expression must have the same data type.

1894
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:37,080
So basically union roles from both

1895
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:40,080
they both combined and intersect
shows them separately.

1896
02:07:40,080 --> 02:07:40,920
No, no, no, no.

1897
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:44,320
Intersect will only show those roles

1898
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,800
which are present in both of the tables.

1899
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:51,640
The exact same data.

1900
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:54,360
Let me show you if if I, if,

1901
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:56,960
if I if intersect would have

1902
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:00,360
if school sports intersect there.

1903
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:03,240
And if I do the Intersect,
I will only be getting elite. And

1904
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:07,800
in here, if it was supported in school

1905
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,840
and if I would have written this

1906
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:15,720
instead of a union,
if I had written it with Intersect,

1907
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:18,600
I will only get this with

1908
02:08:18,600 --> 02:08:21,840
Ali and give because is present in both.

1909
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:24,400
It is intersection. All right.

1910
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:27,640
So the same as the intersection
in mathematics.

1911
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,640
In this activity

1912
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:32,520
intersection mean the information

1913
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,600
that is present on both sides

1914
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,360
if same as the secretary

1915
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,440
minus is also same as this activity

1916
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:44,560
this school on this all of this school

1917
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:50,400
is actually a based on the theory
and other mathematical concepts

1918
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:56,360
behind the scenes.

1919
02:08:56,360 --> 02:09:01,280
No you guys can also understand
intersect means if it is available in

1920
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:04,880
both the tables in simple

1921
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:14,040
all good guys.

1922
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:15,840
All good guys.

1923
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:21,680
And please let me know if I am going fast.

1924
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:26,320
There is no use of showing this.

1925
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:34,160
If you guys don't understand this,
the expression must have same data type

1926
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:38,640
union puts it all together so

1927
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:44,280
without duplication in union
we don't have duplication again.

1928
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:50,400
Same as Secretary,

1929
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:54,320
no duplicates, but all the information
from both of the tables.

1930
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,040
Guys, if someone is confused,
please stop me right now.

1931
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:02,680
What we What is confusing you

1932
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:03,840
tell me now

1933
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:12,440
Everything.

1934
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:13,800
Then it is fine.

1935
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:16,080
Is there anyone else who is confused

1936
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:25,680
with that manager thing?

1937
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:27,720
Olga I will repeat in the next class again

1938
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:32,480
and in the review class again.

1939
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:34,400
And then if you guys are still confused,

1940
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:41,640
then we will discuss that.

1941
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:51,640
I am not sure it will help all my board.

1942
02:10:51,640 --> 02:10:53,800
All my board backed their self.

1943
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:57,640
John has a video in my class

1944
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:02,400
How many of you are not comfortable
now because of that self? Join

1945
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:06,440
manager Stephen King

1946
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:09,360
A Do you guys need a break?

1947
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:17,600
Maybe for 20 minutes
and then we can continue.

1948
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:22,800
What I am asking I'm
not asking to my knowledgeable

1949
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:25,240
and Hartmut
is there anyone who needs a break

1950
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:33,640
as all managers are?

1951
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,480
Okay Catherine,
I'm not asking you as well.

1952
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:38,480
Is there anyone else?

1953
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:41,160
So we need to get content

1954
02:11:41,160 --> 02:11:42,280
posted by you at all.

1955
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:43,440
So not

1956
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:51,200
can we continue tomorrow?

1957
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:55,560
No. Other guys.

1958
02:11:55,560 --> 02:11:57,880
Let's do some funny things then.

1959
02:11:57,880 --> 02:11:58,920
I will do is

1960
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:02,600
I will discuss this beam remaining off
to be involved in the next class.

1961
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:08,280
Let's let's create some tables
and do some stuff other than this one

1962
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:14,440
so that you guys feel so relaxed.

1963
02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:15,760
Go to your home.

1964
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:18,600
Home, Babs,

1965
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:22,120
and connected to your free school,

1966
02:12:22,160 --> 02:12:26,720
using your free school credentials
that you guys created in the last class

1967
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:31,680
is more money at the moment.

1968
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:37,480
Can you send me the password, please?

1969
02:12:37,480 --> 02:12:40,240
Check if this one is working

1970
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,240
and I don't have the password,

1971
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:50,320
but you know, we are not getting a break.

1972
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:58,480
Definitely,
because right now market is super,

1973
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:02,960
super hard and I want you to graduate
as soon as possible.

1974
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,160
You can. You guys believe me?

1975
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:08,040
Students are getting 3 to 5 offers,
like not a single offer.

1976
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:13,080
They are getting three of our four offers
and they are choosing from those offers.

1977
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:15,720
I will ask them to share

1978
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:18,440
all, all their experiences today.

1979
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:20,440
You guys can start.

1980
02:13:20,440 --> 02:13:29,480
I think it will be in 1.5 months.

1981
02:13:29,480 --> 02:13:38,440
Okay.

1982
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:39,200
All right, guys.

1983
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:44,040
So let's learn how to what is the average
salary then is please ask this question.

1984
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:48,520
I also don't know because I don't
intervene too much in personal things.

1985
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:52,320
I don't like this,
but when I invite the students today,

1986
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:54,440
you can ask these
kind of questions as well.

1987
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:57,000
And if they are comfortable,
they will share this.

1988
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:01,080
I will ask them to to be kind
to at least to give us the range

1989
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:05,920
so that you guys
can have an idea of the salary as well.

1990
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:08,680
But I am, I am sure,
because some of the students,

1991
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:13,560
they just rejected the offer below it,
So I am sure it it is above 80.

1992
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:18,760
They will join around 230.

1993
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:19,920
They have so many offers.

1994
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:22,120
Why would someone join for 80 or 90

1995
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:31,480
and why now?

1996
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:34,760
You can send
whatever is above 85 here to my account.

1997
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,120
Please.

1998
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:38,920
I really need that

1999
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:47,400
until my wife gets a job.

2000
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,800
I think you have to make and resume first.

2001
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:51,400
Yes, definitely.

2002
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:54,520
We will be teaching you how to do that.

2003
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:56,000
You should give money to us.

2004
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:56,600
No, no.

2005
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:59,000
From today I am very poor guy.

2006
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,240
You make so much money.

2007
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:07,000
I know all the money is gone.

2008
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,240
Everything is gone.

2009
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:15,480
So, guys,
are you connected to the new database?

2010
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:18,640
I So you can also give me about 100
K to my account.

2011
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:21,400
You guys are saying you are happy,
right? With

2012
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:30,200
150 K for me, Zima
I think I need to give whatever

2013
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:34,680
I get from the Monday
night out to you to make you 150.

2014
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:37,920
You see, this is how many the person

2015
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:42,920
who has a expensive life like silver,
they are looking for 150.

2016
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:50,440
Okay, so guys like me

2017
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:57,480
teach you how to create these tables.

2018
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:59,320
I don't have the new DB.

2019
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:01,440
Most of you create the

2020
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:04,200
account that I

2021
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:13,920
how that I showed in the last class.

2022
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:18,360
I know

2023
02:16:19,640 --> 02:16:22,280
how many of you have not created
the accounts guys

2024
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:26,640
on this free database

2025
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:42,800
don't want them.

2026
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:46,000
I know
you are not thinking in the right way.

2027
02:16:46,440 --> 02:16:48,000
This is not how you should think.

2028
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,400
How much money you are making them. Now.

2029
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:54,360
You should think how much money is paid
to a good pastor

2030
02:16:54,360 --> 02:16:57,840
that have five years of experience
in this industry.

2031
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,880
You be underestimating you a lot.

2032
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:02,400
Please don't do this.

2033
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:05,360
Just just because of this mentality.

2034
02:17:05,360 --> 02:17:10,680
I have persuaded three different jobs
because always undermined myself so much.

2035
02:17:11,360 --> 02:17:15,880
And believe me, on every job
when whatever amount I ask, they literally

2036
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:20,440
paid me that amount
and after that I was cursing myself.

2037
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:25,280
Why? I didn't ask the double amount.

2038
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:27,000
Please don't do that.

2039
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:31,920
It will be so bad that you have to quit
your job later on because once you know

2040
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:34,760
how much your colleagues are earning,
it will it will.

2041
02:17:34,960 --> 02:17:35,560
It will.

2042
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:38,080
It will be like it all time.

2043
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:40,200
It will be in your head of that
why you are earning,

2044
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:43,960
even if you are earning one penny less,
then then your colleagues

2045
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:47,400
it will be all time inside your head
that you are undermined.

2046
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:48,920
You are not valuable.

2047
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:50,120
Please don't do this.

2048
02:17:50,120 --> 02:17:52,280
Ask them they are that makes you happy.

2049
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:55,560
But it also should also follow
the standards

2050
02:17:55,560 --> 02:18:02,840
as well.

2051
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:06,400
Yes, it is illegal, but I don't think so.

2052
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:08,400
There is any company on this side

2053
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:11,240
in which you don't know
how much your manager is earning.

2054
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:13,280
I'll leave that out of me.

2055
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:17,800
You have very well
a very good idea about these figures.

2056
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:24,040
Although it is illegal.

2057
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:29,080
I mean, they literally ask me to sign
so many documents not to do this.

2058
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:32,880
And the first thing that I did to do,
I knew my job

2059
02:18:33,160 --> 02:18:36,720
was this how motivated that person,
instead of being out with many that

2060
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:46,520
we used to spend many, many hours
just to discuss

2061
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:50,760
how much money everyone
is, it's not possible.

2062
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:54,880
So I know

2063
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:57,480
before I teach you how to do that,

2064
02:18:58,480 --> 02:19:01,440
I want to tell you that

2065
02:19:01,440 --> 02:19:03,840
these are before path of skill,

2066
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,440
that I was telling you about.

2067
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:09,440
One is the DML part.

2068
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:12,120
DML stands for direct manipulation
language

2069
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:17,200
using these commands and these key words
to manipulate the data.

2070
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:20,600
So we have only learned

2071
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:24,720
I'm sorry if you guys feel
that you have learned nothing.

2072
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:27,920
We have only learned this part.

2073
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:29,280
We have not learned this.

2074
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:32,160
We have not learned this, this, this.

2075
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:35,280
So you guys have only write this letter

2076
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:38,560
and out of this you ask me if it is 100%.

2077
02:19:38,560 --> 02:19:43,680
You have learned like 20% from.

2078
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:46,600
So you you guys
can be proud of your learning now.

2079
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:49,040
So this is called

2080
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:57,160
manipulation part.

2081
02:19:57,160 --> 02:20:01,800
I think it is more than enough for you
as a tester because remember, guys,

2082
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:05,160
if you know all of this,

2083
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:08,120
you are potentially, potentially deeper.

2084
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:13,520
That can start your job right now
and be as a DBA.

2085
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:18,520
If you know all of this,
you can easily get a job around 150.

2086
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:18,880
Okay,

2087
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:23,280
So but we are not a we are not devious.

2088
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:26,360
We are
we are testers, so we will not be needing

2089
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:35,000
that.

2090
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,440
Come on. Silver is your card.

2091
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:39,960
First tell me do card

2092
02:20:45,560 --> 02:20:45,880
Silver.

2093
02:20:45,880 --> 02:20:47,920
Let's have a separate discussion
with Zima.

2094
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:50,040
It's hard from scratch.

2095
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:51,680
No, it is not hard.

2096
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:55,240
I don't agree with all that skill class
you the hard guys

2097
02:20:56,680 --> 02:21:00,200
minus the self enjoying

2098
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:04,600
it is not hard.

2099
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:12,600
I think it is way easier than Java.

2100
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:17,440
It's fine guys, because you have not
reviewed reviewed it and you have not

2101
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:20,800
spent some time with that skill.

2102
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:26,160
It's very easy.

2103
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:30,600
So this DML means the data
manipulation language,

2104
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:34,760
which means the part of our skill
that we can use to manipulate

2105
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:39,320
that manipulation
mean we can fetch the data from table,

2106
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:43,240
we can store the data from table,
we can delete the data from table.

2107
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:46,160
We can update the data
from that from table.

2108
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:49,960
Then we have the detail part.

2109
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:54,360
So in in next 40 minutes,
we will learn this

2110
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:57,000
and all of this.

2111
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:02,040
How do you guys ready for that?

2112
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:05,400
So in the first world classes
you have learned only about select.

2113
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:08,400
In next 40 minutes
you guys will learn about update

2114
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:18,400
or delete inside
or drop renamed to the and truncate.

2115
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:20,160
Yes, update and insert.
They are different.

2116
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:23,440
So asking is so easy infotainment
or you can learn

2117
02:22:23,440 --> 02:22:26,480
completed your data.

2118
02:22:26,480 --> 02:22:28,120
So DDL is a data

2119
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:32,120
definition language, which means
whenever you have to create something,

2120
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:36,600
whenever you have to define something,
then you will be using detail park

2121
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:39,720
And it includes the key words like draw

2122
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:42,400
up, rename, create either and truncate.

2123
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:48,400
Then there is this part
and that control language.

2124
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:51,000
So it involves revoke and grant.

2125
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:56,960
So for example,
if there are five tables and let's say for

2126
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:58,960
some of the

2127
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:03,720
employees of your company,
you only want them to access to table,

2128
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:08,480
same as I can see the person to table,
but you guys can't see it.

2129
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:13,320
It is happening because of this skill,
because you have limited to be access.

2130
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:17,440
I have revoked the access
for that person to table.

2131
02:23:17,440 --> 02:23:17,840
I can do.

2132
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:19,440
I didn't revoke it.

2133
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:21,920
I didn't by default it is revoked.

2134
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:26,440
I have to grant the permission to use
so you guys can only see those tables,

2135
02:23:26,440 --> 02:23:28,560
which I have explicitly selected

2136
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:32,760
using this grant keyword.

2137
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:36,960
So this is the part of this here
that are control language.

2138
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:39,240
Which part of that that you want to see.

2139
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:42,520
So on on your jobs,

2140
02:23:42,520 --> 02:23:45,480
everyone will be having a separate
username and password

2141
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:50,640
and you will see those tables
which are related to your jobs.

2142
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:53,280
Otherwise databases,
they are very, very big.

2143
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:55,960
Thousands of tables
can exist in a database

2144
02:23:56,760 --> 02:24:01,560
and there can be thousands of restrictions
that they can apply on those tables.

2145
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:06,400
So they will all be doing it
using the park guys.

2146
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,800
What is DML detail?

2147
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:15,120
And they might ask these things
in your interviews.

2148
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:18,440
So then we have a transaction
control language.

2149
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:22,920
This transaction control
language is related to something.

2150
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:25,680
Say if you are inserting the data
in five tables,

2151
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:29,840
the data is inserted in four
tables, but somehow it fails

2152
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:32,520
in the fifth table.

2153
02:24:32,520 --> 02:24:35,040
Then what do you want to do?

2154
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:37,360
Do you want to reverse the data?

2155
02:24:37,640 --> 02:24:41,200
Do you want to also remove the data
that was inserted to four tables?

2156
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:44,880
Or do you want to complete information,
complete this transaction

2157
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:48,120
with the errors or whatever
you want to do in those scenarios?

2158
02:24:48,440 --> 02:24:52,400
Think of the applications
like ATM machines, ATM machines

2159
02:24:52,400 --> 02:24:55,680
that detect the balance from one account
and they give you the cash.

2160
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:58,920
What if the amount has been deducted
from your account but you didn't

2161
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:00,040
get the cash?

2162
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:04,640
They are they are treated
as complete transaction either.

2163
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:09,160
It deducts the amount and gives you
the money or nothing happens.

2164
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:12,480
If you do not get the money,
the amount is reversed to your account.

2165
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:15,520
Will we have it in your file? Yes.

2166
02:25:15,920 --> 02:25:19,080
We will be having an interview files
and slides as well.

2167
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:20,120
Definitely.

2168
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:24,600
So that is done with the help of the DCL
part as a tester.

2169
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,280
You guys not do not need this.

2170
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:29,280
You guys do not need this.

2171
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:34,000
You guys also do not need
this but you guys might need

2172
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:37,400
this update insert and delete part.

2173
02:25:38,840 --> 02:25:41,840
But because you guys

2174
02:25:42,920 --> 02:25:46,800
will be putting five years
of five years of experience

2175
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:49,920
in your resume soon
you guys will be promoted.

2176
02:25:49,920 --> 02:25:53,520
If you have a good attitude,
if you are one of those who would

2177
02:25:54,600 --> 02:25:56,720
like to lead others,

2178
02:25:56,720 --> 02:26:01,160
you will be becoming
team leaders, managers and other things.

2179
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:05,640
So You guys might
also want to have a look at these things.

2180
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:09,760
So if you know things
that you will be able

2181
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:11,560
to search for those things in the future.

2182
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:15,760
So that's why I want to at least
give you at least one example

2183
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:19,680
so that in your future,
you know what you should be doing next.

2184
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:23,680
So I will show at least one
example of these as well.

2185
02:26:24,480 --> 02:26:26,680
But it is good to know that.

2186
02:26:26,680 --> 02:26:29,600
So I have told you guys
what you will be needing on your job

2187
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:34,040
and these are only for those which.

2188
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:35,880
So it always happens.

2189
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:38,800
There are some doers
and there are some followers

2190
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:41,520
and there are some leaders
and things like that.

2191
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:45,880
So I have seen people with 15 years
of experience still doing the testing.

2192
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:49,320
They are not promoted to managers,
team leaders or directors.

2193
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:53,440
And I have also the students
from Batch five.

2194
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:58,040
One of them is literally
is the director of that company now.

2195
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:01,680
So it will also happen to you
guys, new parents.

2196
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:04,080
What is your attitude?
What do you want to achieve in life?

2197
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:08,280
So I will actually show you the path so
that you guys know what to do in future.

2198
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:10,760
So those who only want

2199
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:12,160
to be

2200
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:15,680
a tester, you
guys can start ignoring things after this.

2201
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:19,200
Those who want to go a step ahead,
you guys can have a look in here

2202
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:22,200
and maybe later on
you guys can also have an idea in here

2203
02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:26,160
so that at least the conversations
that you guys will be making with the DP

2204
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:30,680
or other team members, you
at least know what they are talking about.

2205
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:33,800
So for that, we created a new database

2206
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:36,680
in which we have all the privileges

2207
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:39,880
we in which we can do all of this stuff.

2208
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:42,120
So let's start from creating a table.

2209
02:27:42,520 --> 02:27:43,400
Are you guys ready?

2210
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:46,840
Have you guys opened that, that,
that new database

2211
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:51,240
in your data?

2212
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:56,000
All right, so let's create a table and
then the same person table in here site.

2213
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:57,680
So to create a table

2214
02:27:57,680 --> 02:28:01,480
so again very simple few keywords
and you can start creating table.

2215
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:02,800
So we started with create

2216
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:06,320
Let me let me to create.

2217
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:09,360
Then I want everyone,
all of you to follow.

2218
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:11,200
Then we say create table.

2219
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:14,760
Let me know what you guys are done writing

2220
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:15,920
after create table.

2221
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:19,680
We give the name of the table like person,

2222
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:27,480
then parentheses in here.

2223
02:28:27,480 --> 02:28:29,000
So in Java

2224
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:33,200
we use first to define the data type,
and then we define the variable name.

2225
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:36,160
Right?
But in school it is little different.

2226
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:39,640
In Java, we first define the data type,
then the variable name.

2227
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:44,400
In school, we first spell the name
of the column and then define define

2228
02:28:44,400 --> 02:28:45,600
the data.

2229
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:49,000
So let's say, for example,
if you want to have a column in here,

2230
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:53,000
we first tell the name of the column
and then we decide the objective type.

2231
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:56,160
So we want this to be a column

2232
02:28:56,480 --> 02:29:00,240
and let's say I want it to be a bar job,

2233
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:03,840
or let's say I want it to be a number

2234
02:29:03,840 --> 02:29:11,400
that I can define in here.

2235
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:15,800
So if I want it to be a number,
I can define it like this.

2236
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:19,920
I can say, Hey, a skill,
make it an integer and

2237
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:23,520
only allow up to ten numbers.

2238
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:25,920
So ten for it not.

2239
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:30,200
And number ten did use in this integer,
so our skill will limit it.

2240
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:33,000
We only allowed ten integers in here.

2241
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:38,160
And let's say
I also want to tell the skill

2242
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:43,160
that create this special column
as the prime key.

2243
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:45,960
So I will write primary

2244
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:47,360
and I will write eight.

2245
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:48,720
So now

2246
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:53,800
what I am saying in
this security is create a table person

2247
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:58,320
inside that person define a column ID,

2248
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:01,400
and for that table I.D.,

2249
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:03,560
the data type is integer.

2250
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:07,320
So in Java, we by char

2251
02:30:07,720 --> 02:30:12,240
integer long,
but in scale we have only integer,

2252
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:16,560
and inside of the integer we can define
how many digits we want to allow.

2253
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:19,920
We can also have a decimal in here

2254
02:30:20,440 --> 02:30:25,760
if a decimal is equivalent
to the numbers that we have in Java.

2255
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:30,320
And we can also have a larger.

2256
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:32,960
This large chart is equivalent
to this string.

2257
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:36,400
And again, in every of these
that are types, I can define

2258
02:30:36,440 --> 02:30:40,160
how many characters
or how many details I want to allow here.

2259
02:30:41,160 --> 02:30:44,560
All looks good guys, till this point.

2260
02:30:44,560 --> 02:30:47,560
And by the way, all of these examples,
they are on this slide,

2261
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:58,480
so you guys don't need to worry
about memorizing the syntax.

2262
02:30:58,480 --> 02:31:01,320
All right. So this is the first column
that I have defined.

2263
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:03,240
Let's define more columns like.

2264
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:06,280
Let's say first name,

2265
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:10,240
and now tell me the data types
for these columns as well.

2266
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:12,480
Guys, what should building that
a tie for first name?

2267
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:14,680
Should it be decimal integer or locked up?

2268
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:17,000
What is what to stand for?

2269
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,680
It is variable, correct? Yes.

2270
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:22,240
And as so it's sure to be Law Order.

2271
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:24,960
You see, it is a variable in the length.

2272
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:26,280
Right? I can define the length.

2273
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:28,920
And what do you guys think? Work
should be a good number.

2274
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:31,800
What should be the limit of the characters
for first name?

2275
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:36,680
Because if we put unlimited,
then it will slow down the killing.

2276
02:31:37,400 --> 02:31:39,680
Oh, can we have a first name tell

2277
02:31:40,280 --> 02:31:43,040
that can have 226 characters?

2278
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:43,640
I assure

2279
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:49,960
you. Have a first name that has 226.

2280
02:31:49,960 --> 02:31:53,360
And why especially 226 characters?

2281
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,240
Why not 230?

2282
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:57,360
Why not 250?

2283
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:02,360
So the realistic number would be around
25 to 30.

2284
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:06,240
Okay, something like that.

2285
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:10,200
So this will be
the second column in my table.

2286
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:13,760
Okay, let's let's define
a few more columns.

2287
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:15,800
So let's

2288
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:19,080
last name and again,

2289
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:22,160
the data type will be larger

2290
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:25,440
world record of longest name.

2291
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:30,280
No, we are talking about
only first name first.

2292
02:32:30,480 --> 02:32:32,760
I think it is first.
Middle of last name. No.

2293
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:41,600
Or it is only the first name.

2294
02:32:41,600 --> 02:32:42,680
If it is the first name.

2295
02:32:42,680 --> 02:32:49,520
I think many of the applications
can fail on this type.

2296
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:52,240
Okay, let me put under.

2297
02:32:52,280 --> 02:32:57,400
Are you happy now?

2298
02:32:57,400 --> 02:32:58,320
Okay.

2299
02:32:58,360 --> 02:33:03,480
I am giving you Hunter Allen.

2300
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:04,440
Please be happy

2301
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:06,800
in your database.

2302
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:12,120
You can also do it like 200 or 300.

2303
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:16,720
Especially if it is a dollar.

2304
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:18,840
Okay.

2305
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:22,760
And let's also define maybe age

2306
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:26,160
for age

2307
02:33:26,600 --> 02:33:29,640
so let's for

2308
02:33:29,640 --> 02:33:33,880
ten and let's also define the

2309
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:39,240
decimal

2310
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:43,120
30 like this.

2311
02:33:44,280 --> 02:33:46,760
So I only want to teach you

2312
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:54,720
one more thing.

2313
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:58,680
Let me remove the salary
so that I can also show you how

2314
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:03,680
how we can do that

2315
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:06,480
linkage as well
between primary and foreign.

2316
02:34:06,760 --> 02:34:09,680
Why age ten? I don't know.

2317
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:11,640
Maybe you guys will again,
Google something

2318
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:14,840
and you will tell me
how does someone come here have an age

2319
02:34:14,840 --> 02:34:19,520
that can have candidates?

2320
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,040
Because you guys
now know how to Google, right?

2321
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:30,240
So just to be on safe side,

2322
02:34:30,240 --> 02:34:34,240
maybe you guys will start using this table
for aliens or something like that.

2323
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:35,720
Who Knows

2324
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:40,360
now you
guys mark me the three their in here.

2325
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:41,840
Okay.

2326
02:34:41,960 --> 02:34:45,080
However you guys are happy

2327
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:51,480
so let me do one more thing, guys.

2328
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:55,080
So end of universe.

2329
02:34:55,840 --> 02:34:58,440
So I am also created and creating

2330
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:02,480
any table employee who also have ideas.

2331
02:35:02,480 --> 02:35:06,600
It is a primary key
and let's keep it very, very simple.

2332
02:35:06,600 --> 02:35:12,880
It has a salary as well.

2333
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:14,520
Salary

2334
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:16,960
similar

2335
02:35:19,240 --> 02:35:22,960
from on.

2336
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:27,840
Maybe I should take a break
for next next batch

2337
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:30,440
before I am done with all of that

2338
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:34,480
marriage stuff.

2339
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:37,640
So you do the very simple table,

2340
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:42,360
create a table employ
it has idea, which is a primary key.

2341
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:45,000
It has a salary column.

2342
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,520
Let's try to create this

2343
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:50,040
moment.

2344
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:52,400
What was the name of the database?

2345
02:35:52,400 --> 02:35:53,800
What was the name of this database?

2346
02:35:53,800 --> 02:35:54,760
Mama, Daddy with us

2347
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:02,640
out of

2348
02:36:02,760 --> 02:36:12,600
his moment with us.

2349
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:15,200
Do you guys remember
what was the name of the database?

2350
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:17,880
It was same as username, right? Aisha.

2351
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:27,800
Nice as well.

2352
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:29,640
Can you guys verify your user name?

2353
02:36:29,640 --> 02:36:30,600
Are the database names?

2354
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:36,760
They are same, right? Or

2355
02:36:44,640 --> 02:36:45,160
I think they

2356
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:46,720
they are same like

2357
02:36:51,320 --> 02:37:03,200
the let me try it.

2358
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:06,120
Okay so it sounds all the affected

2359
02:37:07,640 --> 02:37:10,600
so let's let's check if this database No,

2360
02:37:10,600 --> 02:37:14,240
no no this is not free Haskell
your use of names audio database names,

2361
02:37:15,240 --> 02:37:16,760
your database.

2362
02:37:16,760 --> 02:37:18,760
So let's select the B table.

2363
02:37:18,760 --> 02:37:21,520
Select all from employee

2364
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:27,560
and let's see if data
if the table has been created of non.

2365
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:29,040
So we see this table.

2366
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:31,960
It has idea and salary
but no data inside the table.

2367
02:37:32,040 --> 02:37:34,920
Do you guys also see the tables
in your databases,

2368
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:45,120
your user names on your database?

2369
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:50,160
So I have created a table
and this table has the primary ID

2370
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:55,000
that I want to use
as foreign key in to this table, right?

2371
02:37:55,920 --> 02:37:59,840
So I can create a foreign key in here

2372
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:05,040
by saying foreign E, f

2373
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:08,880
or I in organized expelling foreign key

2374
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:14,720
foreign key, let's

2375
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:17,800
say empty underscore I.D.

2376
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:22,320
And it referenced is

2377
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:29,040
the idea from employee,
which is called I.D.

2378
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:30,480
like this

2379
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:33,720
and I need a comma as well.

2380
02:38:33,720 --> 02:38:35,720
So this is how we created before.

2381
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:41,080
And so I am going I'm saying, hey, I skill
this is the foreign key

2382
02:38:41,080 --> 02:38:42,960
employer I.D.

2383
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,560
workplace

2384
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:53,560
create a foreign key as employ I.D.

2385
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:58,080
create a foreign key has employed I.D.

2386
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:01,200
And I don't need to define the data type
and whatever

2387
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:05,560
because it will take all of this
information from here.

2388
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:08,800
And I am saying, hey,
ask you all this employ I.D.

2389
02:39:08,840 --> 02:39:10,440
It is actually a reference.

2390
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:16,480
So this is the primary e of employer table
and it is called inside of that table.

2391
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:21,480
So bring all the information related
to the data type and all other limitations

2392
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:25,640
and also make this key inside my table

2393
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:29,040
and why I created this table first.

2394
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:34,560
This is why I created this table first,
because if I execute this query before I,

2395
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,320
I create this table.
What do you guys think?

2396
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:43,800
Will I get an error
or will I be able to do that?

2397
02:39:43,800 --> 02:39:47,280
If that table does not exist,
I will be getting an error, right?

2398
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:50,200
How can I reference something
which does not even exist?

2399
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:53,280
So that's why
I asked you to create this table first

2400
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:56,840
so that we can refer to this

2401
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:08,480
E column.

2402
02:40:08,480 --> 02:40:11,640
MPI D

2403
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:20,840
does not exist.

2404
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:23,600
Let me give me one moment.

2405
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:25,680
So let's all on

2406
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:43,120
Why has not created the

2407
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:49,320
event signifying

2408
02:40:49,320 --> 02:41:22,320
missing something?

2409
02:41:22,320 --> 02:42:02,960
Guys, give me one moment.

2410
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:29,160
I have.

2411
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:30,400
Yes, it looks good.

2412
02:42:30,400 --> 02:42:36,000
Now I want you to just make sure
that the relation is created.

2413
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:36,920
It is created now.

2414
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:39,520
So I have to create the

2415
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:42,840
column in here
and then I can refer it in here.

2416
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:45,280
Sorry, I was wrong.

2417
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:46,320
Employee I.D.

2418
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:49,120
is not offering this employer I.D.

2419
02:42:49,120 --> 02:42:51,240
is not offering this I.D..

2420
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:53,600
Do you guys also see this?
Maybe need a break?

2421
02:42:53,600 --> 02:42:55,640
No, no, we don't need every time.

2422
02:42:57,440 --> 02:42:59,400
And can you guys see this relation

2423
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:01,800
created
when you click on this column, Stable

2424
02:43:03,240 --> 02:43:05,360
Danger, this and add

2425
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:08,720
a column in here
and then let's say a foreign key

2426
02:43:08,720 --> 02:43:13,600
and then the name of the column
that you want to Baffert as foreign key

2427
02:43:13,960 --> 02:43:16,840
and then tell the references
to which table.

2428
02:43:17,800 --> 02:43:20,240
Yes. Let me repeat and give you

2429
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:25,000
guys executed this

2430
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:28,840
and tell me
if you see both the tables in here

2431
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:43,640
and the relation is created created,

2432
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:47,640
make sure your in your how to run it.

2433
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:49,640
You're just selected and created.

2434
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:51,200
Make sure

2435
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:54,120
that you guys are also using
the same column names.

2436
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:57,320
And also here
you can share this screenshot.

2437
02:43:57,880 --> 02:44:00,920
How many of you have created
both the tables and the link?

2438
02:44:00,920 --> 02:44:02,400
Looks good

2439
02:44:07,640 --> 02:44:14,240
on all table person
already exist recruitment.

2440
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:17,400
So because you guys
have already created this table,

2441
02:44:17,400 --> 02:44:21,080
you need to delete their table,
execute the security first for those

2442
02:44:21,080 --> 02:44:24,240
who are getting error drop table
and then the table name.

2443
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:27,320
Because it is a you you already have

2444
02:44:27,320 --> 02:44:28,320
that table

2445
02:44:31,560 --> 02:44:33,880
executing this broad table command first

2446
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:36,840
and then create the tables

2447
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:46,320
alone.

2448
02:44:46,320 --> 02:44:48,760
I thought them and then they format

2449
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:53,960
and there's Mustafa because most of you,
if something is already defined

2450
02:44:53,960 --> 02:44:59,040
we, cannot redefine
it is same as defining variables.

2451
02:44:59,480 --> 02:45:04,560
Next slide Drop
How to check connection between tables.

2452
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:08,160
Right. Click on your tables and click on

2453
02:45:09,440 --> 02:45:11,320

2454
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:13,320
Once you do that, you will

2455
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:16,080
the columns information in here

2456
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:24,000
and the mail also

2457
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:34,840

02:46:00,600 --> 02:46:02,240

2462
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:05,120
I am asking for help from the right person

2463
02:46:06,520 --> 02:46:07,240
before blog.

2464
02:46:07,240 --> 02:46:09,480
Where did you define person table?

2465
02:46:09,480 --> 02:46:12,320
So if you have an attitude to this
even at once,

2466
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:19,960
if the table will be defined.

2467
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:23,120
Yep. Yep.

2468
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:28,440
So let's lesson third some data as well.

2469
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:33,480
In in here guys.

2470
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:36,800
So this is how we can create the tables.

2471
02:46:36,800 --> 02:46:39,360
You guys can just then you please help me.

2472
02:46:39,360 --> 02:46:42,120
Can you please help Silva

2473
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:49,520

2474
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:52,440
Silva I'm just kidding. Please
share the editor that you are getting.

2475
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:57,240
I just ask to be more experienced person

2476
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:03,240
and no, it's working.

2477
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:03,800
Okay.

2478
02:47:07,640 --> 02:47:11,800
Do we also have someone who knows
Ileana in person?

2479
02:47:11,800 --> 02:47:17,040
It is not working for me as well and
will do the error that you get for one.

2480
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:20,000
And then you don't have a wife
in this class.

2481
02:47:20,200 --> 02:47:35,760
Sorry, I cannot help you you.

2482
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:38,080
But now you will have to select
to be database

2483
02:47:39,960 --> 02:47:41,520
guys read to the errors as well.

2484
02:47:41,520 --> 02:47:44,640
If there is no database selector,
it means you have to execute this

2485
02:47:44,640 --> 02:47:56,240
part.

2486
02:47:56,240 --> 02:47:58,440
Guys, let me do this right.

2487
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:00,720
Give me one moment.

2488
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:04,320
Drop table.

2489
02:48:04,800 --> 02:48:08,000
You guys have given the same names
as as mine.

2490
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:19,720
Right?

2491
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:24,200
Just execute
all of these queries in this sequence.

2492
02:48:24,480 --> 02:48:28,880
And before that, this this part
will be different for every one of you.

2493
02:48:29,160 --> 02:48:34,120
So keep this part
and all of the remaining queries replace

2494
02:48:35,280 --> 02:48:35,560
here.

2495
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:38,600
This thing that I have sent you,
all of the all of you select

2496
02:48:38,600 --> 02:48:40,680
all of it in your editor and

2497
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:43,120
and execute it.

2498
02:48:43,120 --> 02:48:45,720
It will look

2499
02:48:45,880 --> 02:48:55,720
all fine for you.

2500
02:48:55,720 --> 02:48:57,920
Let me know once
you guys have executed this,

2501
02:48:59,080 --> 02:49:00,840
this time
we should not be getting any out of

2502
02:49:00,840 --> 02:49:30,240
If you have selected your database,
I see null.

2503
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:32,640
It means you look good.

2504
02:49:32,640 --> 02:49:34,680
Yes, Poppy, all of it.

2505
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:37,640
If it works, no needs null is good.

2506
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:42,840
Yes, it's stop working
the skill workbench.

2507
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:44,400
You have to restart it.

2508
02:49:44,400 --> 02:50:02,280
That means.

2509
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:05,000
Alex, let's watch this

2510
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:08,520
and you have to drop the person
table first and then be

2511
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:12,880
because person is adapting some piece
of information inside the employee

2512
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:17,320
and we are trying to do the employee
first, which will make this person

2513
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:20,560
work, not properly
because the reference is gone.

2514
02:50:21,800 --> 02:50:25,320
Delete, draw the person table first.

2515
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:27,640
Those who are getting error,
drop the person table

2516
02:50:27,640 --> 02:50:34,680
first first.

2517
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:37,680
Is there anyone unknown table person.

2518
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:40,520
It means that you have already deleted
that person table

2519
02:50:42,040 --> 02:50:44,600
in here in your tables a deck.

2520
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:46,920
How many tables do you have in
your database?

2521
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:51,080
You will have this table
step shows here a screenshot of in here.

2522
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:53,480
Before sharing the screenshot,
click on refresh all

2523
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:58,960
and then showed me the screenshot.

2524
02:50:58,960 --> 02:50:59,600
I have none.

2525
02:50:59,600 --> 02:51:01,760
That means
you don't need to drop this table

2526
02:51:01,800 --> 02:51:03,600
otherwise you will be getting an error.

2527
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:24,800
There are no tables,
just these two commands.

2528
02:51:24,800 --> 02:51:29,120
Yes, Alexa, you don't need to drop
that person table not dropping below table

2529
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:39,960
only and then create tables.

2530
02:51:39,960 --> 02:51:44,560
Or if you guys are getting the error
still, let us just name your employed

2531
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:47,160
table two in play. 1%. 2%. One

2532
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:51,200
or use any other names

2533
02:51:53,880 --> 02:51:54,920
you are made of.

2534
02:51:54,920 --> 02:51:57,800
You have also deleted
the person table already,

2535
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:01,160
so just drop the employed table and create

2536
02:52:01,160 --> 02:52:02,280
the new ones

2537
02:52:04,280 --> 02:52:05,320
of you have already.

2538
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:09,400
Just read the other guys into that which
says they are not find the person table.

2539
02:52:09,400 --> 02:52:11,040
It means you have already deleted it.

2540
02:52:11,040 --> 02:52:13,280
You don't need to execute this command

2541
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:16,680
if you have already deleted
that you don't need to execute this.

2542
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:23,640
Read the errors.

2543
02:52:23,640 --> 02:52:24,560
It's fine now.

2544
02:52:24,560 --> 02:52:26,920
If you don't have any errors,
don't have any tables.

2545
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:27,800
Just create.

2546
02:52:27,800 --> 02:52:34,800
Just create the tables that's it.

2547
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:45,280
This is how my employees table looks like.

2548
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:49,760
How many of you are still unable
to see employee and person table

2549
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:55,680
in your databases?

2550
02:52:55,680 --> 02:52:59,560
Do you get any errors

2551
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:03,400
and any

2552
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:09,720
you need to remove the employer table?

2553
02:53:09,720 --> 02:53:11,840
Then you tell us to create both tables.

2554
02:53:11,840 --> 02:53:15,080
I think you
I thought you guys are following me.

2555
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:18,840
That means
you should have created these tables.

2556
02:53:18,840 --> 02:53:24,600
But I don't know
how many of you follow me.

2557
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:32,800
You guys don't follow me
when I do something in here. Yes.

2558
02:53:32,800 --> 02:53:49,280
That means you should have created
the tables, right?

2559
02:53:49,280 --> 02:53:55,040
All right, guys, let me do this.

2560
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:56,840
Let's. Let's do this.

2561
02:53:56,840 --> 02:53:59,280
Guys, I am renaming this table to MP

2562
02:54:00,760 --> 02:54:01,560
and this table

2563
02:54:01,560 --> 02:54:08,480
to person.

2564
02:54:08,480 --> 02:54:11,040
Just execute these two queries

2565
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:13,920
and you will.

2566
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:16,440
You should not be having any issues
at all.

2567
02:54:16,440 --> 02:54:19,440
I had all these tables at first,
but not anymore.

2568
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:23,680
And I will create these two tables,

2569
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:26,280
execute this queries
and the tables will be created.

2570
02:54:27,560 --> 02:54:29,200
Actually, let me execute this.

2571
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:37,360
Yes, it's already break time.

2572
02:54:37,360 --> 02:54:42,480
Just one more minute
and then we can have a yes.

2573
02:54:42,480 --> 02:54:43,360
All looks good.

2574
02:54:43,360 --> 02:54:49,200
Just knowing that your days to get
is that I have sent you.

2575
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:50,760
You missed that part.

2576
02:54:50,760 --> 02:54:53,520
Not only just started it you're basically
this table will be created

2577
02:54:54,480 --> 02:54:59,640
works.

2578
02:54:59,640 --> 02:55:08,880
Is there anyone
who is still getting any errors?

2579
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:10,240
Now it works.

2580
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:14,040
Anyone else who's getting any errors

2581
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:17,760
tangled?

2582
02:55:18,120 --> 02:55:18,640
Okay.

2583
02:55:18,640 --> 02:55:27,240
Can we move forward now? Yes.

2584
02:55:27,240 --> 02:55:28,720
We should have food table.

2585
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:30,240
No, we should have it.

2586
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:32,080
We should not have nothing.

2587
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:34,520
All the whatever you have, it is fine.

2588
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:35,680
You would just.

2589
02:55:35,680 --> 02:55:37,560
You should just have these two tables.

2590
02:55:37,560 --> 02:55:44,320
Please, Please forgive me, guys.

2591
02:55:44,320 --> 02:55:47,160
There is a very good video
on the internet.

2592
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:51,240
There was a marriage happening
between Pakistan and some other country.

2593
02:55:51,240 --> 02:55:56,880
And the match was so good that Pakistan
created like around 196 score.

2594
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,280
And that score is very good in T20.

2595
02:56:00,360 --> 02:56:02,600
But they still lost in that match.

2596
02:56:02,880 --> 02:56:06,680
All the spectators specially that their

2597
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:10,600

2598
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:13,520

2605
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:40,360
I mean, it is true, right?

2606
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:46,240
If something has gone wrong in this title,
that spell that can be

2607
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:50,280
it will always be really it all
you go wrong

2608
02:56:53,240 --> 02:56:55,800
salary drop the previous one. Yes.

2609
02:56:55,800 --> 02:57:02,880
And to do whatever you want to do.

2610
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:06,600
All right guys,
just let's insert the desktop

2611
02:57:06,800 --> 02:57:10,280
as well in these tables
and then we have a break.

2612
02:57:11,280 --> 02:57:13,920
So to insert the index out,

2613
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:16,920
we write in. So

2614
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:20,160
like this, you can right click the table

2615
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:23,880
and you will see a dropdown
with option of draw the table.

2616
02:57:23,880 --> 02:57:29,520
For your information, it is official
you are fully in love.

2617
02:57:29,520 --> 02:57:33,920
So insert into and after that

2618
02:57:33,920 --> 02:57:36,480
we write the name of the table like this.

2619
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:40,280
And after we specify

2620
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:42,440
the column to support example IED.

2621
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:50,280
So we have the IED in here
and then we have this salary.

2622
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,960
So I specify a salary like this

2623
02:57:55,080 --> 02:57:56,600
and de parentheses.

2624
02:57:56,600 --> 02:57:58,760
I say values,

2625
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:02,400
and then I specify

2626
02:58:04,440 --> 02:58:06,920
a value like this, right?

2627
02:58:06,920 --> 02:58:09,240
So insert in two

2628
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:14,400
and then the name of the table,

2629
02:58:15,320 --> 02:58:18,080
then the columns in which I want to insert

2630
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:23,840
the data, then space values,
and then the value for the first column

2631
02:58:23,840 --> 02:58:36,120
IED and the value for the second one.

2632
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:39,360
Or we will
you only specify the five values

2633
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:41,920
which guys

2634
02:58:41,920 --> 02:58:50,080
who told me to have values?

2635
02:58:50,080 --> 02:58:52,400
Yes. Once.

2636
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:55,000
Once things start going wrong, it

2637
02:58:55,120 --> 02:59:04,440
all goes wrong.

2638
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:13,680
I have 24 salary.

2639
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:21,200
I can fix it quickly,
but I am not sure about you.

2640
02:59:21,200 --> 02:59:27,960
So it is giving me an a warning that
I might lose some information because.

2641
02:59:27,960 --> 02:59:29,760
I have

2642
02:59:30,760 --> 02:59:32,880
a low range

2643
02:59:32,880 --> 02:59:39,840
for the values, so if I select the select

2644
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:43,000
this for the employer table,
I should see this data in my table.

2645
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:46,280
So I see I IED one and then Saturday.

2646
02:59:46,320 --> 02:59:55,200
How do you guys see
the information as well?

2647
02:59:55,200 --> 02:59:58,160
Just try to insert a lower number
if it gives me a lot

2648
02:59:58,200 --> 03:00:07,160
name, please confirm everyone.

2649
03:00:07,160 --> 03:00:09,640
If you guys don't
see the dirt in your table

2650
03:00:12,880 --> 03:00:14,560
and let me copy paste.

2651
03:00:14,560 --> 03:00:15,120
So there

2652
03:00:17,760 --> 03:00:21,000
looks a little better.

2653
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,840
I need to

2654
03:00:23,840 --> 03:00:26,320
and maybe you want to

2655
03:00:26,720 --> 03:00:33,160
do the one.

2656
03:00:34,120 --> 03:00:39,960
So I am executing
only the last three rows again.

2657
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:45,080
And now if I say select all from employee,
I should see four rules in here.

2658
03:00:45,600 --> 03:00:51,280
That is, insert some more data and tell me
if guys see all the dirt on your table.

2659
03:00:51,280 --> 03:00:57,680
Now all automatically like loop
and that I will show you later on.

2660
03:00:57,680 --> 03:00:59,400
We usually don't try it.

2661
03:00:59,400 --> 03:01:03,840
We can write loops, yes,
but usually we insert a B that file

2662
03:01:03,840 --> 03:01:08,840
from frontend
or from files like Excel or something.

2663
03:01:08,840 --> 03:01:11,960
I can, but we can also like loops, but

2664
03:01:11,960 --> 03:01:15,440
that is that requires the understanding

2665
03:01:15,440 --> 03:01:18,800
of procedures and functions,
how procedures and function work.

2666
03:01:19,200 --> 03:01:21,200
You write the loop inside the procedure.

2667
03:01:21,200 --> 03:01:25,200
We call that procedure
and then it inserts do that I using your

2668
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:29,520
and if you guys want

2669
03:01:29,520 --> 03:01:38,600
I can share this guilty as well.

2670
03:01:38,600 --> 03:01:39,840
Now do one more thing.

2671
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:43,680
I try to insert
and try to insert the same rule again.

2672
03:01:44,560 --> 03:01:46,920
So if I try to insert the same row again,

2673
03:01:48,120 --> 03:01:50,240
I get this error that sends

2674
03:01:50,240 --> 03:01:53,320
a duplicate entry for for the primary key.

2675
03:01:53,320 --> 03:01:57,840
You remember
we told you that this ID is a primary key,

2676
03:01:57,840 --> 03:02:00,080
and primary key
is they don't allow duplicate.

2677
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:03,840
So if you try to add a duplicate,
it will give you it should give you

2678
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:04,280
an error.

2679
03:02:04,280 --> 03:02:07,200
It also confirms
that you created the table correctly.

2680
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:15,600
Do you guys got the error?

2681
03:02:15,600 --> 03:02:17,960
Yes. Yes. You should go to the error.

2682
03:02:17,960 --> 03:02:20,880
Do we have MP and person? Yes

2683
03:02:21,920 --> 03:02:24,960
Yes. You should get the error this time
because primary case

2684
03:02:24,960 --> 03:02:26,960
don't allow duplicate backup.

2685
03:02:26,960 --> 03:02:29,200
Let's quickly add the data for

2686
03:02:30,360 --> 03:02:33,440
the person as well.

2687
03:02:33,440 --> 03:02:35,800
So insert

2688
03:02:35,800 --> 03:02:38,720
in to name of the table person

2689
03:02:40,040 --> 03:02:42,000
parentheses

2690
03:02:42,200 --> 03:02:45,920
and in the person table
we have the ID column.

2691
03:02:46,200 --> 03:02:48,840
So I specify I.D..

2692
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:51,040
We have the first name column.

2693
03:02:51,040 --> 03:02:53,400
By the way, I can also leave some columns

2694
03:02:53,880 --> 03:02:56,280
for those columns
and null values will be inserted.

2695
03:02:57,600 --> 03:03:01,440
First name,

2696
03:03:01,440 --> 03:03:03,840
then last name,

2697
03:03:05,160 --> 03:03:07,200
then ID,

2698
03:03:08,280 --> 03:03:12,080
and then the MP ID in here.

2699
03:03:12,480 --> 03:03:15,360
Then I say values

2700
03:03:15,360 --> 03:03:17,560
and then I specify the idea.

2701
03:03:17,560 --> 03:03:20,640
Let's say already run

2702
03:03:20,720 --> 03:03:22,400
firstname.

2703
03:03:22,400 --> 03:03:24,960
David, can you guys quickly
tell me some first name?

2704
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:31,840
So John, being

2705
03:03:33,960 --> 03:03:36,840
is on day five

2706
03:03:36,840 --> 03:03:39,600
and what do you guys think
in the employee ID?

2707
03:03:39,760 --> 03:03:43,440
Can I, can I write it in here?

2708
03:03:43,440 --> 03:03:44,640
Stephen

2709
03:03:45,720 --> 03:03:47,080
Oh yes. Now.

2710
03:03:47,080 --> 03:03:49,440
Stephen
One of the first name, right? Stephen

2711
03:03:50,440 --> 03:03:53,800
And then yes, I will remember you.

2712
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:58,080
Stephen We can't because it does not exist
in this table

2713
03:03:58,080 --> 03:04:00,720
and the information
is being referenced in here.

2714
03:04:01,120 --> 03:04:03,240
So let's say it is opening hundred, okay?

2715
03:04:03,240 --> 03:04:05,880
Like this.

2716
03:04:05,880 --> 03:04:08,160
Let me know what you guys are done
writing the security

2717
03:04:34,920 --> 03:04:37,720
and not the child rule

2718
03:04:37,880 --> 03:04:40,280
for unconstrained fields

2719
03:04:42,240 --> 03:05:31,200
or or thing

2720
03:05:31,200 --> 03:05:34,040
where it has created another foreign key.

2721
03:05:34,560 --> 03:05:43,440
This one looks good.

2722
03:05:43,440 --> 03:05:47,280
The all the foreign key references
employer table instead of.

2723
03:05:49,040 --> 03:05:50,520
Oh yes, yes.

2724
03:05:50,520 --> 03:05:56,120
Because if you are right,
we need to update this employer

2725
03:05:56,120 --> 03:05:59,560
to be

2726
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:01,520
now it looks good

2727
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:10,440
right?

2728
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:12,560
All table four

2729
03:06:15,240 --> 03:06:17,400
guys and security.

2730
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:21,080
I fixed it so I am good.

2731
03:06:21,080 --> 03:06:23,760
Yes, you guys did. You guys rename it?

2732
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,120
I did. I forgot to rename it.

2733
03:06:26,120 --> 03:06:32,600
Employee two MP.

2734
03:06:32,600 --> 03:06:33,280
If not,

2735
03:06:34,480 --> 03:06:35,120
it will.

2736
03:06:35,120 --> 03:06:37,560
Why you guys didn't tell me?

2737
03:06:37,560 --> 03:06:39,920
Drop that table if you have not renamed it

2738
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:41,880
and created again

2739
03:06:52,320 --> 03:06:55,040
zero rules effect to the table

2740
03:07:04,480 --> 03:07:06,240
we have now.

2741
03:07:06,240 --> 03:07:06,880
It looks clear.

2742
03:07:06,880 --> 03:07:09,720
So I see ID Stephen King 25.

2743
03:07:09,720 --> 03:07:12,480
Anyone who is not seeing this

2744
03:07:13,600 --> 03:07:23,840
in your table, but.

2745
03:07:23,840 --> 03:07:26,120
Silva Okay. Silva You need to draw up.

2746
03:07:27,160 --> 03:07:29,440
You guys have already learned this command

2747
03:07:30,240 --> 03:07:32,560
drop table means remove that table.

2748
03:07:32,560 --> 03:07:35,160
The database.

2749
03:07:35,160 --> 03:07:36,560
I see it.

2750
03:07:36,560 --> 03:07:41,280
Okay, Where is the remote?

2751
03:07:41,280 --> 03:07:44,720
Please execute this on Silva's
computer. Drop

2752
03:07:45,800 --> 03:07:47,800
able person

2753
03:07:52,960 --> 03:07:55,440
here to find guys.

2754
03:07:55,720 --> 03:07:58,040
This is what you guys
will be doing on your day to day

2755
03:07:58,440 --> 03:08:02,840
basis.

2756
03:08:02,840 --> 03:08:12,560
Silva,
execute this on your computer, please.

2757
03:08:12,560 --> 03:08:16,560
Who else is not seeing this information
in the table?

2758
03:08:16,680 --> 03:08:28,960
In your table?

2759
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:33,600
So those who all look good,
you guys can be on break.

2760
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:36,200
Those who have errors, you go,
I am staying in here.

2761
03:08:36,200 --> 03:08:38,200
So with all your errors before the break.

2762
03:08:38,200 --> 03:08:40,480
So break is still 145.

2763
03:08:40,640 --> 03:08:43,800
Those who have that find in both
the tables, you guys can leave

2764
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:46,080
that some who are facing each other.

2765
03:08:46,080 --> 03:08:49,560
I am here.

2766
03:08:49,560 --> 03:08:52,920
I noticed
not so many people in the class too.

2767
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:55,440
The attendance looks good.

2768
03:08:55,560 --> 03:08:59,200
More than 50 because change many times

2769
03:08:59,200 --> 03:09:08,720
the name of the table.

2770
03:09:08,720 --> 03:09:09,400
I don't know.

2771
03:09:09,400 --> 03:09:11,920
Maybe they put it on recording
and just left a note there.

2772
03:09:11,960 --> 03:09:13,520
Adorable little child.

2773
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:18,240
Yes. Silva, you and I have shared
these two things with. You

2774
03:09:19,440 --> 03:09:21,080
just execute this and

2775
03:09:21,080 --> 03:09:33,320
you will be fine.

2776
03:09:33,320 --> 03:09:37,280
Silva It is because see, on line
number 22, you are trying to refer

2777
03:09:37,280 --> 03:09:41,600
to a foreign key, 26,
which does not exist.

2778
03:09:41,600 --> 03:09:46,440
The unemployed table employed table
only have keys one, two, three and four.

2779
03:09:46,440 --> 03:09:51,120
But you are you have returned 26
in that foreign that does not exist.

2780
03:09:51,120 --> 03:09:52,320
That's why you got this.

2781
03:09:52,320 --> 03:09:54,960
And that's why
we want a little standardize.

2782
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:59,520
You see, if I try to insert,
let's say maybe 100 in here,

2783
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:02,600
I cannot do that
because this information does

2784
03:10:02,600 --> 03:10:05,640
not exist in the employer table.

2785
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:08,280
So I will get this other definitely
I will go to setup.

2786
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:11,880
I can only insert those ideas
which are available in here.

2787
03:10:11,880 --> 03:10:13,600
One, two, three, four.

2788
03:10:13,600 --> 03:10:15,720
I can only only insert in here

2789
03:10:19,760 --> 03:10:21,000
until table.

2790
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:22,320
I am fine.

2791
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:27,360
I have valid all values,
but I still don't say related table.

2792
03:10:27,360 --> 03:10:32,960
What is needed in here?

2793
03:10:32,960 --> 03:10:34,920
Table part does not exist.

2794
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:35,400
Nabeel

2795
03:10:35,400 --> 03:10:39,600
you have accidentally removed the table
maybe by executing drop table command.

2796
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:41,440
So you need to create table person.

2797
03:10:41,440 --> 03:10:48,720
You need to execute discretely,
create table person.

2798
03:10:48,720 --> 03:10:53,120
What is default need be
your usernames are your default of DBS.

2799
03:10:54,680 --> 03:10:57,720
The email that you have you
you should have got

2800
03:10:59,520 --> 03:11:01,320
usernames, database

2801
03:11:01,320 --> 03:11:04,800
names, passwords and the host names.

2802
03:11:05,400 --> 03:11:08,760
So Check your
the emails that you guys create that

2803
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:11,160
you guys used to create my databases.

2804
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:12,760
They are your databases.

2805
03:11:12,760 --> 03:11:14,320
Then you shared all of your code.

2806
03:11:14,320 --> 03:11:16,080
Yes I can share

2807
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:20,560
Let them share it
in the course and ask one guy

2808
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:24,600
I have shared
in the course announcement to you guys.

2809
03:11:24,600 --> 03:11:27,200
Can also check it from here.

2810
03:11:27,640 --> 03:11:31,000
Who else is getting at us?

2811
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:33,800
Those who are able to insert the data.

2812
03:11:33,800 --> 03:11:36,680
You guys can go on break

2813
03:11:36,960 --> 03:11:41,280
or not share the screenshot, but

2814
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:02,320
duplicate entry for primary key guys.

2815
03:12:02,800 --> 03:12:05,680
Also try to read your add us format.

2816
03:12:06,200 --> 03:12:08,160
Run the select command on part table.

2817
03:12:08,160 --> 03:12:10,200
You already have a role that has

2818
03:12:11,240 --> 03:12:13,440
one for

2819
03:14:40,600 --> 03:14:41,960
30 minutes.

2820
03:14:42,560 --> 03:14:47,280
15 minutes if I use that for

2821
03:14:47,320 --> 03:14:48,840
still no

2822
03:15:21,520 --> 03:15:23,320
inserting to reference,

2823
03:15:23,320 --> 03:15:26,120
you can not do that

2824
03:15:26,560 --> 03:15:30,000
to make sure
that when inserting the data in here

2825
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:37,320
and you are only using 1 to 3 or four
as the key, I used to have more problems.

2826
03:15:37,320 --> 03:15:39,640
Now it is only one nice.

2827
03:15:39,640 --> 03:15:43,520
Please share screenshot as you're
looking at all these errors like oh no.

2828
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:46,080
Actually
I am also talking a cell right now.

2829
03:15:46,680 --> 03:15:50,000
I am asking her to give me
some marriage bonuses or something like

2830
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:54,920
that. No,

2831
03:15:56,240 --> 03:15:57,760
you guys can see why.

2832
03:15:57,760 --> 03:16:11,080
But now this picture will make more sense.

2833
03:16:11,080 --> 03:16:14,320
But she said
we will only think about this once

2834
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:25,960
you get married.

2835
03:16:25,960 --> 03:16:30,160
The last error is
I cannot see the last out of it.

2836
03:16:30,160 --> 03:16:33,120
You know, can show me the last letter

2837
03:16:33,120 --> 03:16:39,480
last that it is not visible.

2838
03:16:39,480 --> 03:16:43,280
Some of you can also post in sport

2839
03:17:56,200 --> 03:17:59,240
non database selected in all
this is very simple.

2840
03:17:59,440 --> 03:18:03,280
In order to be selected by the
I still don't see your last letter,

2841
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:06,720
you have to be database
guys and try to video your is

2842
03:18:08,840 --> 03:18:10,280
the last item is you know

2843
03:18:10,280 --> 03:18:13,880
you have not selected the database

2844
03:18:15,040 --> 03:18:18,200
Nabila
do you see the data in your table now

2845
03:18:19,920 --> 03:18:24,080
constraint foreign key MP I D

2846
03:18:25,440 --> 03:18:29,280
demure you mean it means that the data
that you are trying to insert

2847
03:18:29,320 --> 03:18:36,440
does not reference to a key in here. Yes.

2848
03:18:36,560 --> 03:18:39,160
Guys,
just just try to read the errors once.

2849
03:18:39,640 --> 03:18:41,400
I think they should make sense now.

2850
03:18:41,400 --> 03:18:44,600
Common errors
database selected. Which means

2851
03:18:45,600 --> 03:18:45,960
you agree

2852
03:18:45,960 --> 03:18:49,120
you guys need to execute your discovery
constraint.

2853
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:49,760
Why? Later.

2854
03:18:49,760 --> 03:18:53,920
That means you are trying to insert
some data which is not available in here.

2855
03:18:54,240 --> 03:18:55,600
Table does not exist.

2856
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:57,920
That means you need to create the table
first.

2857
03:18:58,800 --> 03:19:01,080
Dropping the table table does not exist.

2858
03:19:01,080 --> 03:19:03,480
That means you have already deleted
the table.

2859
03:19:03,480 --> 03:19:07,040
Simple things need are simple things.

2860
03:19:08,400 --> 03:19:10,880
Is there anyone else

2861
03:19:10,880 --> 03:19:13,320
we still have? Like how much time we have?

2862
03:19:13,320 --> 03:19:14,880
We still have 5 minutes.

2863
03:19:14,880 --> 03:19:16,240
The table already exist.

2864
03:19:16,240 --> 03:19:18,600
What do I. You can drop the table.

2865
03:19:18,600 --> 03:19:21,600
It's a simple right
drop table and table name.

2866
03:19:21,600 --> 03:19:22,480
That's it.

2867
03:19:22,480 --> 03:19:27,160
Any one draw effect in?

2868
03:19:27,160 --> 03:19:29,200
No. Will, can you execute this query?

2869
03:19:29,200 --> 03:19:32,960
Select all from person
so that I can see the data even that I had

2870
03:19:32,960 --> 03:19:51,920
when it was inserted or not. Why?

2871
03:19:51,920 --> 03:19:54,240
I don't see a table list on the left side.

2872
03:19:54,240 --> 03:19:57,400
You have to refresh it right click
and then click on refresh.

2873
03:19:57,400 --> 03:19:58,400
All I'm

2874
03:20:00,800 --> 03:20:03,480
Is there anyone else

2875
03:20:08,080 --> 03:20:10,080
from the far

2876
03:20:11,360 --> 03:20:14,960
We are not a lot of data child role
so most of you see

2877
03:20:14,960 --> 03:20:18,360
you are trying to online content
you are trying to insert 100

2878
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:22,200
hundred in here under 100
does not exist in here.

2879
03:20:22,200 --> 03:20:23,280
In here, in here.

2880
03:20:23,280 --> 03:20:26,040
Maybe I should not have taught you
about foreign keys.

2881
03:20:26,760 --> 03:20:27,360
Then. It's odd.

2882
03:20:27,360 --> 03:20:33,240
You are also getting an error.

2883
03:20:33,240 --> 03:20:37,520
Mustafa handed that 100
the last 100 to something.

2884
03:20:37,520 --> 03:20:39,240
1 to 3 or four.

2885
03:20:39,240 --> 03:20:43,360
Because you reference referencing
the information in another table.

2886
03:20:43,560 --> 03:20:48,000
That information must first exist in that
table from which you are referencing it.

2887
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:48,760
Right.

2888
03:20:48,960 --> 03:20:52,960
That's why you are getting error.

2889
03:20:52,960 --> 03:20:55,720
Sebastian You look good.

2890
03:20:55,880 --> 03:20:58,480
Anyone else guys got exam that is.

2891
03:20:58,480 --> 03:21:02,720
Can you please share this screenshot is
make sure that this last calamities

2892
03:21:02,720 --> 03:21:06,000
referencing this table
the information from this table

2893
03:21:06,320 --> 03:21:08,800
which means we can not insert
random values.

2894
03:21:08,800 --> 03:21:10,880
The values must be one, two, three.

2895
03:21:11,000 --> 03:21:12,360
Any value from this table

2896
03:21:13,440 --> 03:21:14,640
there smart foreign key

2897
03:21:14,640 --> 03:21:17,960
mean right foreign keys
means that creating a relationship

2898
03:21:20,160 --> 03:21:21,680
Now if these those relationships

2899
03:21:21,680 --> 03:21:25,800
are based on primary keys,
they cannot be null.

2900
03:21:25,800 --> 03:21:29,280
I was able to insert some data

2901
03:21:29,280 --> 03:21:31,560
that means your link is not created or not

2902
03:21:36,640 --> 03:21:38,200
all, but you see the data out there.

2903
03:21:38,200 --> 03:21:39,040
That's fine.

2904
03:21:39,040 --> 03:21:43,240
Also for me from the percent table format,
also 20 different person table.

2905
03:21:43,240 --> 03:21:45,840
Or do you also have better

2906
03:21:46,720 --> 03:21:49,160
in the person or that that's okay?

2907
03:21:49,320 --> 03:21:49,800
That's okay.

2908
03:21:49,800 --> 03:21:51,880
You not inserted to get on there as well.

2909
03:21:53,520 --> 03:21:55,360
Give me you look good.

2910
03:21:55,600 --> 03:21:57,760
Yep. Have the data in the tables.

2911
03:21:57,800 --> 03:21:58,880
Looks good.

2912
03:21:58,920 --> 03:22:03,640
Anyone else is animals, is confused
and is not able to insert

2913
03:22:03,640 --> 03:22:13,880
the data, is not able to follow me.

2914
03:22:13,880 --> 03:22:16,000
Okay. Insert
little tiny here as my homework.

2915
03:22:17,720 --> 03:22:19,920
I think
it works now do you see in the data

2916
03:22:21,280 --> 03:22:25,160
in person table?

2917
03:22:25,160 --> 03:22:26,720
Thank you, guys.

2918
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:27,800
All right. Perfect.

2919
03:22:27,800 --> 03:22:40,920
Anyone else?

2920
03:22:40,920 --> 03:22:50,920
Great.

2921
03:22:50,920 --> 03:22:54,240
What do you get?

2922
03:22:54,240 --> 03:22:54,880
Looks good.

2923
03:22:54,880 --> 03:22:56,320
Abdul looks good.

2924
03:22:56,320 --> 03:22:58,320
Also, check your personal table.

2925
03:22:58,320 --> 03:22:59,880
Yep, it looks good.

2926
03:22:59,880 --> 03:23:10,000
Great.

2927
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:10,600
Anyone else?

2928
03:23:10,600 --> 03:23:16,040
You guys,
We are the famous people of this class.

2929
03:23:16,040 --> 03:23:19,560
So now at your query line 24 correctly,
we learned one bit yesterday.

2930
03:23:19,560 --> 03:23:22,920
And this is what the Foreign Relations
looks like.

2931
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:28,120
The you can not insert any random data
if you have created a relationship

2932
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:32,400
with the primary of one table.

2933
03:23:32,400 --> 03:23:36,280
That's how we all pressed
constraints on the data

2934
03:23:36,280 --> 03:23:38,400
that we can insert

2935
03:23:40,080 --> 03:23:40,520
by David.

2936
03:23:40,520 --> 03:23:47,000
These are also called
constraints in databases.

2937
03:23:47,000 --> 03:23:48,600
We are the other famous people.

2938
03:23:48,600 --> 03:23:50,480
We read all the other one.

2939
03:23:50,480 --> 03:23:53,120
Muhammad I saw Marianne

2940
03:23:54,880 --> 03:23:56,080
that mean

2941
03:23:57,200 --> 03:24:00,440
you guys are not getting any errors

2942
03:24:02,520 --> 03:24:03,080
or more.

2943
03:24:03,080 --> 03:24:05,280
Seema Silva

2944
03:24:07,320 --> 03:24:08,520
four one No.

2945
03:24:08,520 --> 03:24:11,040
Why? Why are you guys are so quiet?

2946
03:24:12,760 --> 03:24:15,280
Not them as here.

2947
03:24:15,400 --> 03:24:16,040
I'm sorry.

2948
03:24:16,040 --> 03:24:20,280
Am not able to like
there are so many people in this class.

2949
03:24:21,560 --> 03:24:22,920
Elena is also famous.

2950
03:24:22,920 --> 03:24:25,040
Alex is also not present today.

2951
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:28,400
Ali is usually pleasant.

2952
03:24:28,680 --> 03:24:29,760
I'm Ron.

2953
03:24:29,760 --> 03:24:32,520
I'm Ron. You.
You also some kind got at us.

2954
03:24:32,520 --> 03:24:35,760
Angelique is also famous
and is also not responding

2955
03:24:40,520 --> 03:24:43,080
to Christina.

2956
03:24:43,720 --> 03:24:46,800
Damian Here you guys are all.

2957
03:24:46,800 --> 03:24:47,480
Why? Why?

2958
03:24:47,480 --> 03:24:50,920
You guys are scaring me
Then I thought you guys just left.

2959
03:24:51,160 --> 03:24:54,720
Jumped out of your windows.

2960
03:24:54,720 --> 03:24:56,240
You see it also.

2961
03:24:56,240 --> 03:25:09,720
You all right?

2962
03:25:09,720 --> 03:25:13,200
So you guys now have

2963
03:25:14,760 --> 03:25:19,040
hopefully successfully created a table.

2964
03:25:19,040 --> 03:25:21,760
You guys know how to define that.

2965
03:25:21,840 --> 03:25:23,120
Are types. Let me check

2966
03:25:23,120 --> 03:25:27,040
if you by we are missing something
you know how to create primary keys

2967
03:25:28,400 --> 03:25:29,640
warranties by the way.

2968
03:25:29,640 --> 03:25:32,440
Again
you guys will not be doing this stuff.

2969
03:25:32,440 --> 03:25:36,720
It is the responsibility of DBAs
or architects.

2970
03:25:36,880 --> 03:25:37,280
Okay.

2971
03:25:37,280 --> 03:25:39,800
But I am showing this extra information

2972
03:25:40,960 --> 03:25:43,560
and you guys know how to create an

2973
03:25:43,560 --> 03:25:46,600
for relationships

2974
03:25:46,600 --> 03:25:49,880
and you guys also know how insert
that you guys might need

2975
03:25:49,920 --> 03:25:53,040
this part Inserted data

2976
03:25:57,040 --> 03:25:58,880
break and yes I am on

2977
03:25:58,880 --> 03:26:01,560
the first floor would not be much of a for

2978
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:07,080
but Ben is asking me

2979
03:26:07,080 --> 03:26:18,120
when to join.

2980
03:26:18,120 --> 03:26:38,480
Let me let me tell them.

2981
03:26:38,480 --> 03:26:41,640
All right guys so so so

2982
03:26:45,520 --> 03:26:48,160
let's insert more data

2983
03:26:48,160 --> 03:26:50,680
so that I can show you
how to deliver that as well.

2984
03:26:52,240 --> 03:26:56,800
So I insert one because it is
a primary duplicate, so I'm not allowed.

2985
03:26:56,800 --> 03:26:59,760
So let me try to

2986
03:27:01,920 --> 03:27:08,440
let me like a bill.

2987
03:27:08,440 --> 03:27:10,640
Okay? I hope I am not going to reverse.

2988
03:27:10,880 --> 03:27:21,520
I mean, this is your first name, right?

2989
03:27:21,520 --> 03:27:24,200
Maryam Let me put you here as well.

2990
03:27:24,480 --> 03:27:26,280
Maryam, You will be my next target

2991
03:27:28,040 --> 03:27:32,600
is enough with Aisha.

2992
03:27:32,600 --> 03:27:34,040
But what is your second name?

2993
03:27:34,040 --> 03:27:35,720
I'm just kidding.

2994
03:27:36,640 --> 03:27:42,360
I am sad.

2995
03:27:42,360 --> 03:27:45,680
Mimi,
Who else wants to be in the database?

2996
03:27:46,800 --> 03:27:47,480
Awesome.

2997
03:27:47,480 --> 03:27:49,760
Sometimes they give feedback back.

2998
03:27:50,040 --> 03:27:55,640
I call feel students many times
and I don't call others guys.

2999
03:27:55,640 --> 03:28:00,360
It is because some of the names
of some of you are easy to pronounce

3000
03:28:00,800 --> 03:28:03,840
that that's
the only reason no one is favorite

3001
03:28:05,760 --> 03:28:08,080
guys and those
who want to be in their database.

3002
03:28:08,080 --> 03:28:11,040
Please fill your information
inside of this insert statement

3003
03:28:12,600 --> 03:28:14,280
and I will insert those

3004
03:28:14,280 --> 03:28:17,000
because you are too many. Now

3005
03:28:19,840 --> 03:28:22,400
modify your entire statement

3006
03:28:22,400 --> 03:28:24,840
and choose your desired desired

3007
03:28:24,840 --> 03:28:26,920
salary from here and

3008
03:28:28,160 --> 03:28:31,560
decided that you want to have used
the idea of that salary in here.

3009
03:28:32,440 --> 03:28:34,640
Let's also learn some skill, right?

3010
03:28:34,640 --> 03:28:38,960
Meanwhile, you want to be in a database.

3011
03:28:38,960 --> 03:28:40,840
No one is a favorite.

3012
03:28:40,840 --> 03:28:43,800
Was I also Nicola?

3013
03:28:43,800 --> 03:28:46,040
Is it Nicola or is it Nicola?

3014
03:28:46,040 --> 03:28:46,600
I don't.

3015
03:28:46,600 --> 03:28:47,880
I think I have already.

3016
03:28:47,880 --> 03:28:50,200
I have always mispronounced your name.

3017
03:28:52,080 --> 03:28:53,160
Nicola.

3018
03:28:53,160 --> 03:28:56,080
Second one.

3019
03:28:56,080 --> 03:28:58,360
Why you have it at the end of your name.

3020
03:28:58,360 --> 03:29:00,800
Why should not you be having IAB?

3021
03:29:01,080 --> 03:29:02,520
Nicola

3022
03:29:03,200 --> 03:29:05,840
insert into

3023
03:29:29,360 --> 03:29:30,840
Because of the stupid people

3024
03:29:30,840 --> 03:29:35,320
who wrote that way
in my birth certificate.

3025
03:29:35,320 --> 03:29:37,720
Or it also happens in your country.

3026
03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:39,760
It happens very, very tired.

3027
03:29:39,760 --> 03:29:46,160
It happened so many times in my country,
guys.

3028
03:29:46,280 --> 03:29:47,360
That's it.

3029
03:29:47,440 --> 03:29:53,680
Five, five rules.

3030
03:29:53,680 --> 03:29:55,240
Who has the year or something?

3031
03:29:55,240 --> 03:29:57,000
Or have you? Olga?

3032
03:29:57,000 --> 03:30:00,840
You see,
I don't have a salary for than 150.

3033
03:30:00,840 --> 03:30:01,280
Okay.

3034
03:30:01,800 --> 03:30:05,280
Please have at Max at 150 year.

3035
03:30:05,760 --> 03:30:08,920
At this point I, I have a bad

3036
03:30:09,280 --> 03:30:12,960
instead Dennis copy paste rules please.

3037
03:30:12,960 --> 03:30:20,160
On the end.

3038
03:30:20,160 --> 03:30:22,800
Okay so, so so

3039
03:30:23,960 --> 03:30:28,440
semicolon.

3040
03:30:28,440 --> 03:30:30,440
But we have some time here guys.

3041
03:30:30,800 --> 03:30:33,720
Let me put Alex Guys

3042
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:42,520
and let's delete the Alex.

3043
03:30:42,520 --> 03:30:43,800
This is how we're dealing with that.

3044
03:30:43,800 --> 03:30:53,000
Our guys, my friend,
instead of being Alexander, is Alexandru.

3045
03:30:53,000 --> 03:30:56,040
So guys, I have this data and let's

3046
03:30:56,040 --> 03:30:59,160
say I want to delete some rules from here.

3047
03:30:59,160 --> 03:31:01,120
So this how I can do that.

3048
03:31:01,120 --> 03:31:06,600
So you guys already know what happens
with the draw keyword guys, the table

3049
03:31:06,600 --> 03:31:11,720
plus all of it, all of its data is deleted
when we draw up a table.

3050
03:31:11,720 --> 03:31:12,120
Right?

3051
03:31:13,400 --> 03:31:14,320
You guys observe what

3052
03:31:14,320 --> 03:31:17,320
happens where they drop the table.

3053
03:31:17,320 --> 03:31:19,920
Plus all of its data is gone right.

3054
03:31:20,920 --> 03:31:24,200
That complete is actually
the schema is also deleted.

3055
03:31:24,200 --> 03:31:28,760
It will be data.

3056
03:31:28,760 --> 03:31:30,640
No, I didn't say I.

3057
03:31:30,640 --> 03:31:36,000
We will be spending 30 more minutes today.

3058
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:38,160
Yes, I am sure

3059
03:31:38,960 --> 03:31:42,840
actually more than 30 minutes
because I will invite the student at 240.

3060
03:31:43,160 --> 03:31:46,160
So I don't what you guys

3061
03:31:46,160 --> 03:31:49,280
want to ask the questions
I think it will take like what do you.

3062
03:31:49,280 --> 03:31:53,600
Yes, you can you can leave at that point
if you have to do something important.

3063
03:31:54,480 --> 03:31:58,400
So is this drop able to delete
all the data

3064
03:31:58,440 --> 03:32:02,480
inside the table and it also delete

3065
03:32:02,640 --> 03:32:05,480
the table itself, the schema by right.

3066
03:32:05,480 --> 03:32:07,160
And both things are gone.

3067
03:32:07,160 --> 03:32:10,560
But what if we only want to delete,
let's say a special rule,

3068
03:32:10,560 --> 03:32:14,280
only a single row, a total of three rows
for something like this.

3069
03:32:14,280 --> 03:32:14,920
Right?

3070
03:32:15,120 --> 03:32:17,040
They will be coming at 240.

3071
03:32:17,040 --> 03:32:19,440
So to do that, we to delete

3072
03:32:20,960 --> 03:32:24,000
and guys, please be careful when you are

3073
03:32:25,440 --> 03:32:28,680
writing this query.

3074
03:32:28,680 --> 03:32:32,440
So we tried to delete from

3075
03:32:34,320 --> 03:32:37,880
idea and empty don't have to match
they have to match alone

3076
03:32:37,880 --> 03:32:41,000
not because they are linked
and one of them is primary key.

3077
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:43,120
So you must put some information.

3078
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:46,920
Yes. I should also be careful now

3079
03:32:48,240 --> 03:32:50,560
delete from and then the table name

3080
03:32:55,200 --> 03:32:56,080
where?

3081
03:32:56,080 --> 03:32:58,800
So if we don't write this
we are condition.

3082
03:32:58,800 --> 03:33:03,560
If if we just execute this part completed,
I will be removed from the table.

3083
03:33:04,160 --> 03:33:05,080
So we write this.

3084
03:33:05,080 --> 03:33:07,400
We are condition where I.D.

3085
03:33:07,400 --> 03:33:09,800
is equal to six like this

3086
03:33:10,400 --> 03:33:13,400
so that only a row number six is deleted.

3087
03:33:14,120 --> 03:33:17,680
So right now
we have this row number six, Aleks in here

3088
03:33:19,560 --> 03:33:21,000
and I want to deliver this.

3089
03:33:21,000 --> 03:33:22,200
So delete.

3090
03:33:24,040 --> 03:33:26,720
So it says one one rule is effected.

3091
03:33:26,720 --> 03:33:28,360
That means that all is gone.

3092
03:33:28,360 --> 03:33:33,720
If I, if I do select
all from person again.

3093
03:33:33,720 --> 03:33:37,560
So Alex is gone from here

3094
03:33:37,560 --> 03:33:38,680
after the class we are.

3095
03:33:38,680 --> 03:33:41,840
Can I find because they are all on canvas

3096
03:33:43,320 --> 03:33:48,360
I will also try to push with your java
course so that you guys don't lose them.

3097
03:33:49,160 --> 03:33:51,680
Guys have you deleted the rows
successfully?

3098
03:33:52,280 --> 03:33:58,320
Are is that row deleted?

3099
03:33:58,320 --> 03:34:03,080
So this is how we can delete
one rows, photos or multiple rules.

3100
03:34:03,160 --> 03:34:06,560
You guys can also write this like we are.

3101
03:34:06,560 --> 03:34:09,720
ID is greater than equal to

3102
03:34:09,720 --> 03:34:12,760
maybe one and I.D.

3103
03:34:13,320 --> 03:34:15,560
is less than equal to five.

3104
03:34:15,560 --> 03:34:19,680
So all the rows
which have so far whichever role

3105
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:22,680
this condition is satisfied,
all those roles will be gone.

3106
03:34:23,160 --> 03:34:26,040
So multiple rule is a single
rule is totally depends

3107
03:34:26,040 --> 03:34:28,040
on your rare condition logic.

3108
03:34:28,320 --> 03:34:29,840
Can I ask a stupid question?

3109
03:34:29,840 --> 03:34:30,360
Yes, sure.

3110
03:34:30,360 --> 03:34:33,680
Please ask. Yes.

3111
03:34:33,680 --> 03:34:35,440
Can we say between one and five? Yes.

3112
03:34:35,440 --> 03:34:36,640
You guys can specify.

3113
03:34:36,640 --> 03:34:39,520
So all the real conditions
that you guys have learned

3114
03:34:39,520 --> 03:34:43,280
When we were doing the select statements,
you guys can write all of it in here

3115
03:34:44,400 --> 03:34:45,600
to give any criteria

3116
03:34:45,600 --> 03:34:51,360
to remove the rows.

3117
03:34:51,360 --> 03:34:55,840
So can you guys tell me the difference
between delete and drop?

3118
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:59,560
It's a very famous interview question.

3119
03:34:59,560 --> 03:35:03,400
The one that I will answer

3120
03:35:03,440 --> 03:35:05,240
drop the

3121
03:35:05,240 --> 03:35:08,400
the complete table plus do that to

3122
03:35:09,480 --> 03:35:12,240
delete only delays the data.

3123
03:35:12,560 --> 03:35:14,520
It can be a single row.

3124
03:35:14,520 --> 03:35:16,480
It can be multiple rows.

3125
03:35:16,480 --> 03:35:19,440
Depends on the rare condition
that you guys write.

3126
03:35:20,440 --> 03:35:21,160
Right.

3127
03:35:21,240 --> 03:35:23,400
There is also a target type.

3128
03:35:23,400 --> 03:35:27,840
There is also a third way
that we can use to delete the data

3129
03:35:28,240 --> 03:35:33,480
that is even more than dangerous
in rare condition.

3130
03:35:33,480 --> 03:35:36,520
We might be deleting one or two rows

3131
03:35:38,000 --> 03:35:40,640
in this next

3132
03:35:41,000 --> 03:35:42,440
procedure.

3133
03:35:42,440 --> 03:35:46,680
It will delete all of the data
that is inside a table.

3134
03:35:46,680 --> 03:35:50,040
It is called a truncate.

3135
03:35:50,040 --> 03:35:54,560
Can we reassign the ideas
to another person once they are deleted?

3136
03:35:54,880 --> 03:35:57,000
Yes, I think we can reassign.

3137
03:35:57,000 --> 03:35:59,160
Try, try it
and let me know if you face any errors.

3138
03:35:59,160 --> 03:36:00,320
I think can reassign.

3139
03:36:01,440 --> 03:36:02,280
There should not

3140
03:36:02,280 --> 03:36:05,280
be any harm reassigning those ideas
because that is deleting.

3141
03:36:05,280 --> 03:36:06,680
Then why not?

3142
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:09,400
Why not? Yes.

3143
03:36:09,400 --> 03:36:10,840
Yes, we can.

3144
03:36:10,840 --> 03:36:15,720
Are you guys getting any errors?

3145
03:36:15,720 --> 03:36:18,360
What is not possible is there sometimes

3146
03:36:18,960 --> 03:36:22,960
once we have inserted
the ideas, let's say for example,

3147
03:36:22,960 --> 03:36:25,800
if we are using
the natural increment order

3148
03:36:26,400 --> 03:36:29,120
and if we have assigned let's say

3149
03:36:29,120 --> 03:36:31,880
five two, six, seven, eight to someone.

3150
03:36:32,520 --> 03:36:35,280
So right,
we are inserting the ideas manually,

3151
03:36:35,280 --> 03:36:37,720
but there is also increments as well.

3152
03:36:38,280 --> 03:36:41,920
That means if I have given the idea
five to something, the next rule

3153
03:36:41,920 --> 03:36:45,880
that I will be inserting automatically
an idea of six will be assigned to it.

3154
03:36:46,560 --> 03:36:49,720
So in those cases
there is a problem that if we do that

3155
03:36:49,720 --> 03:36:54,360
as from in between, then
how we can rearrange the data for that.

3156
03:36:54,360 --> 03:37:00,320
We have to write a procedure,
but we will not discuss that.

3157
03:37:00,320 --> 03:37:04,640
So guys are dropping
means completing that out.

3158
03:37:04,640 --> 03:37:08,040
Plus table delete means table will be the

3159
03:37:08,560 --> 03:37:12,440
the one or multiple rows can be deleted
right this time.

3160
03:37:12,480 --> 03:37:17,080
The type of deletion
it is called the truncate.

3161
03:37:17,680 --> 03:37:20,000
So we write truncate

3162
03:37:22,200 --> 03:37:24,720
so and then the table name.

3163
03:37:26,040 --> 03:37:29,200
So this third time what it will do,

3164
03:37:29,200 --> 03:37:31,520
it will delete everything

3165
03:37:31,520 --> 03:37:35,080
from the table
but schema will will stay there.

3166
03:37:35,080 --> 03:37:38,760
So table the structure of the table
will stand there.

3167
03:37:39,200 --> 03:37:41,280
But all the data will be gone.

3168
03:37:42,080 --> 03:37:45,360
There is one more difference
that this truncate is

3169
03:37:45,840 --> 03:37:48,840
way, way faster than this delete.

3170
03:37:49,000 --> 03:37:53,360
So we can also delete all of the data
from the table with this delete command.

3171
03:37:53,360 --> 03:37:54,000
Right.

3172
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:58,560
If I don't specify TV or condition,
it means delete everything from the data.

3173
03:37:58,560 --> 03:38:01,160
But this command can

3174
03:38:01,160 --> 03:38:03,240
longer time this one.

3175
03:38:03,240 --> 03:38:07,840
It will be super, super fast and
everything will be gone in just a second.

3176
03:38:07,840 --> 03:38:10,560
So if I now say select all from person,

3177
03:38:12,280 --> 03:38:14,640
all is gone in just 2 seconds.

3178
03:38:14,640 --> 03:38:20,000
So truncate
it, delete everything in seconds

3179
03:38:22,040 --> 03:38:26,160
and delete deletes one or multiple roles.

3180
03:38:26,160 --> 03:38:28,080
Depends on your where condition.

3181
03:38:28,080 --> 03:38:30,800
You can also delete all of the data
from a table

3182
03:38:31,080 --> 03:38:33,520
using the world class,
but it will be slow.

3183
03:38:34,360 --> 03:38:40,040
And then we have the drop, which is
linear, stable, plus all of all of its.

3184
03:38:40,040 --> 03:38:40,920
Is it clear, guys?

3185
03:38:40,920 --> 03:38:48,720
It's a very famous interview question.

3186
03:38:48,720 --> 03:38:51,640
So I have also written in in here

3187
03:38:53,200 --> 03:38:55,400
just so that you guys know.

3188
03:38:55,400 --> 03:38:57,680
So one more thing guys.

3189
03:38:57,960 --> 03:39:03,000
The things that we delete using
the delete command, they can be reversed.

3190
03:39:03,600 --> 03:39:06,960
They can be reversed,
but the things that you delete

3191
03:39:06,960 --> 03:39:11,120
using truncate or drop,
they cannot be reversed

3192
03:39:12,640 --> 03:39:17,360
unless and until you have a separate
database as the backup database.

3193
03:39:18,080 --> 03:39:22,800
So this one is kind of more safe,
but it is slow.

3194
03:39:22,800 --> 03:39:28,720
So if your company is not paying you good
raise or you are angry with your manager.

3195
03:39:29,120 --> 03:39:32,120
Please
use these commands, truncate or drop.

3196
03:39:33,240 --> 03:39:34,760
Otherwise in

3197
03:39:35,200 --> 03:39:36,840
the regular routine.

3198
03:39:36,840 --> 03:39:43,240
You can use the delete command.

3199
03:39:43,240 --> 03:39:45,720
Yes, Blocked the whole thing
and data is still backup

3200
03:39:45,840 --> 03:39:50,560
unless you have a separate database
as backup.

3201
03:39:50,560 --> 03:39:55,800
So now you guys know when to use
which commands.

3202
03:39:55,800 --> 03:40:00,720
So Silva again again
this cannot be reversed

3203
03:40:01,080 --> 03:40:04,520
unless and until you have a separate
backup database.

3204
03:40:05,800 --> 03:40:07,920
And they are also very, very fast.

3205
03:40:07,920 --> 03:40:12,040
Very, very fast.

3206
03:40:12,040 --> 03:40:13,720
Undo button

3207
03:40:16,800 --> 03:40:19,920
repeatedly the difference
between drop and truncate, please.

3208
03:40:20,440 --> 03:40:24,840
But the difference is
if you are angry with your manager,

3209
03:40:24,840 --> 03:40:28,320
want to leave the company,
use that drop and truncate.

3210
03:40:29,120 --> 03:40:32,000
They delete all the back
to inside the table.

3211
03:40:32,000 --> 03:40:35,280
If you are using truncate,
all the data is gone from the table,

3212
03:40:36,160 --> 03:40:41,640
drop all the data plus the table itself
and they cannot be reversed.

3213
03:40:42,720 --> 03:40:45,160
They cannot be reversed while they delete

3214
03:40:45,480 --> 03:40:48,480
can delete one or multiple rows
and it can be reversed.

3215
03:40:49,080 --> 03:40:51,760
We will use drop
when they say you drop to the ball

3216
03:40:54,240 --> 03:40:55,680
drop database. Yes.

3217
03:40:55,680 --> 03:40:58,200
It also exists to complete
database will be gone

3218
03:40:59,920 --> 03:41:03,840
now but I can now ground do will not work
so record please.

3219
03:41:03,840 --> 03:41:05,400
I'm not showing that the code.

3220
03:41:05,400 --> 03:41:09,280
I have already spent so much time
creating all the database.

3221
03:41:10,080 --> 03:41:12,440
You guys after this class,
you guys can try

3222
03:41:12,440 --> 03:41:15,840
this drop database as well.

3223
03:41:15,840 --> 03:41:19,680
Before I had last day,
she said paid people wrong salaries

3224
03:41:19,680 --> 03:41:25,960
because she was mad with the team.

3225
03:41:25,960 --> 03:41:30,360
So these are again
the same queries and create the table name

3226
03:41:30,680 --> 03:41:35,320
column, then data type also guys,
if you don't want to allow,

3227
03:41:35,640 --> 03:41:39,040
don't want to allow null values,
you can also write not null.

3228
03:41:39,480 --> 03:41:40,600
Whenever somewhere

3229
03:41:40,600 --> 03:41:43,920
someone will try to add
null values, they will be again getting at

3230
03:41:48,160 --> 03:41:50,240
so and inserting two.

3231
03:41:50,280 --> 03:41:52,440
Then the table name

3232
03:41:52,440 --> 03:41:54,560
the column names and then the values

3233
03:41:54,560 --> 03:41:58,440
that we want to insert.

3234
03:41:58,440 --> 03:42:01,560
Now the update so delete
and you guys have already seen.

3235
03:42:01,560 --> 03:42:04,200
Now let me show you the update.

3236
03:42:04,200 --> 03:42:05,640
Come on.

3237
03:42:05,640 --> 03:42:07,720
So let's say you guys

3238
03:42:08,400 --> 03:42:09,960
let me start with that again.

3239
03:42:09,960 --> 03:42:14,360
Oh, by the way, guys,
please don't delete these insert cuties.

3240
03:42:14,640 --> 03:42:20,200
If have written them once, they will be
very helpful on your testing dogs as well.

3241
03:42:21,040 --> 03:42:23,760
So you see here this oh, this is the

3242
03:42:23,760 --> 03:42:29,040
this is how we take the backups
as well in the form of files.

3243
03:42:29,040 --> 03:42:31,920
This is all the backup will look like.

3244
03:42:32,000 --> 03:42:34,280
So let's say guys, I have inserted there

3245
03:42:34,560 --> 03:42:38,880
and let's say some
that I have inserted wrong data and now

3246
03:42:39,960 --> 03:42:42,800
instead
of deleting that role and inserting

3247
03:42:42,800 --> 03:42:47,000
that chrome, maybe 90% of the data
looks good, only 10% of it is not good.

3248
03:42:47,000 --> 03:42:51,360
And I want to update the data
so far that we use the update command.

3249
03:42:51,360 --> 03:42:55,440
So we say update.

3250
03:42:55,440 --> 03:42:59,160
And then you guys have also seen me
writing this command.

3251
03:42:59,160 --> 03:43:00,560
Can you guys help me out?

3252
03:43:00,560 --> 03:43:04,160
I have already updated
the many things in previous

3253
03:43:04,200 --> 03:43:11,520
classes.

3254
03:43:11,520 --> 03:43:21,160
In the previous classes,
I updated the values in front of you.

3255
03:43:21,160 --> 03:43:22,080
Update. Update.

3256
03:43:22,080 --> 03:43:25,920
I want to let's say
I want to change of all.

3257
03:43:25,920 --> 03:43:29,640
You go from 28 to 18

3258
03:43:31,280 --> 03:43:36,080
and to do you guys remember?

3259
03:43:36,080 --> 03:43:38,600
If you guys don't remember quickly
Google it.

3260
03:43:38,600 --> 03:43:55,760
How to update that I in my sequel,
I did this in class two.

3261
03:43:55,760 --> 03:44:01,920
I did this in class three.

3262
03:44:01,920 --> 03:44:03,680
Search for the syntax guys.

3263
03:44:03,680 --> 03:44:05,760
How to update to the dinner table

3264
03:44:10,800 --> 03:44:13,560
why you guys are so slow

3265
03:44:17,600 --> 03:44:18,960
updated table name.

3266
03:44:18,960 --> 03:44:21,600
Right? So let's say
you want to update to this table.

3267
03:44:21,600 --> 03:44:24,280
So I will write update file

3268
03:44:24,280 --> 03:44:26,680
and then after the keyword set

3269
03:44:27,080 --> 03:44:30,360
it is a result keyword
and then the column name.

3270
03:44:30,360 --> 03:44:32,560
So let's say for example,
I want to update the A's.

3271
03:44:32,560 --> 03:44:36,280
So I will say it said the ID is equal to

3272
03:44:38,040 --> 03:44:40,160
18. Right.

3273
03:44:40,160 --> 03:44:44,680
Then the we're condition to identify
for which I want to run this update

3274
03:44:45,480 --> 03:44:49,960
where age is equal to 28.

3275
03:44:50,960 --> 03:44:53,880
So I am saying, hey, a school there is it

3276
03:44:54,400 --> 03:44:57,480
there is a rule in the past table

3277
03:44:57,480 --> 03:45:00,680
which has currently has the value of 28.

3278
03:45:01,080 --> 03:45:03,720
So we are ages right now, age is 28.

3279
03:45:04,400 --> 03:45:06,480
Circle back to 18.

3280
03:45:06,480 --> 03:45:08,160
Okay, so back to 18.

3281
03:45:08,160 --> 03:45:13,080
And this is the table name
and I want to an update

3282
03:45:13,480 --> 03:45:18,240
as it makes sense, guys,
as school is mostly like simple English.

3283
03:45:19,800 --> 03:45:22,400
If there are multiple
people, all of them will be updated.

3284
03:45:23,040 --> 03:45:28,200
So if you want to really make sure
that only all God's age

3285
03:45:28,200 --> 03:45:33,080
is set to 18, you should use ID is again
a very good reason to have primary keys.

3286
03:45:33,200 --> 03:45:36,000
You see very good reason
to have primary keys.

3287
03:45:36,240 --> 03:45:39,240
So instead of having saying this age,
I should say ID

3288
03:45:39,720 --> 03:45:42,560
and I should specify the idea
of all like this.

3289
03:45:42,960 --> 03:45:47,520
Now I am 100%
sure that only one row will be affected.

3290
03:45:48,600 --> 03:45:56,160
Does it make sense, guys?

3291
03:45:56,160 --> 03:45:57,480
So one is affected.

3292
03:45:57,480 --> 03:46:01,440
Now let's let me query that table again.

3293
03:46:01,440 --> 03:46:04,040
And now all you got is

3294
03:46:04,440 --> 03:46:07,240
18, 18, 18, 18 years older.

3295
03:46:07,760 --> 03:46:10,680
Are you guys able
to update the rows on your end as

3296
03:46:16,840 --> 03:46:18,840
is there anyone who is getting any

3297
03:46:18,840 --> 03:46:30,600
errors or issues?

3298
03:46:30,600 --> 03:46:31,280
No errors

3299
03:46:32,880 --> 03:46:33,600
to do

3300
03:46:33,600 --> 03:46:38,320
to disable safe mode or toggle
the option in preferences as well.

3301
03:46:38,320 --> 03:46:41,840
And you are okay. So what?

3302
03:46:41,840 --> 03:46:45,920
You should not be getting that at all
because you are using.

3303
03:46:45,920 --> 03:46:49,560
We are ages equal to 28.

3304
03:46:49,560 --> 03:46:53,080
So Alexa, search
this on the on the internet.

3305
03:46:53,680 --> 03:46:55,920
There is a flag that you need to set

3306
03:46:57,720 --> 03:47:01,560
because if you are updating multiple
roles, that still gives you a warning

3307
03:47:01,560 --> 03:47:06,360
that, Hey, Alex, are you sure
that you really want to do that?

3308
03:47:06,800 --> 03:47:09,680
So this is the flag that we have to set
before we can do that

3309
03:47:10,280 --> 03:47:13,080
as school safe update is equal to zero.

3310
03:47:13,560 --> 03:47:16,600
So execute this query first

3311
03:47:16,600 --> 03:47:22,080
and after you have executed it, then
you can update any number of rows safely.

3312
03:47:22,080 --> 03:47:26,160
By default, it gives you a warning
so that you don't accidentally delete

3313
03:47:26,160 --> 03:47:27,440
all of the data.

3314
03:47:27,440 --> 03:47:30,120
Is there anyone else who's
getting any issues errors

3315
03:47:39,120 --> 03:47:40,920
perimeter of their sector?

3316
03:47:40,920 --> 03:47:44,560
This flag assumes that this flag start
at scale underscore safe

3317
03:47:44,560 --> 03:47:52,600
and of course objects is equal to zero.

3318
03:47:52,600 --> 03:47:54,920
So this is how we can upgrade.

3319
03:47:54,920 --> 03:47:57,400
By the way,
we can update multiple columns as well.

3320
03:47:57,400 --> 03:48:00,000
I have showed you only one column

3321
03:48:00,400 --> 03:48:03,520
and always, always, guys, please,

3322
03:48:04,120 --> 03:48:07,960
whenever you are deleting
or updating something double check

3323
03:48:07,960 --> 03:48:12,480
your wear condition and the best practice
to check these things.

3324
03:48:13,400 --> 03:48:18,120
This is how developers do this
before they can delete or update,

3325
03:48:18,120 --> 03:48:21,520
they execute this select statement
with the same.

3326
03:48:21,520 --> 03:48:22,160
We had a clause.

3327
03:48:22,160 --> 03:48:25,800
So let's say for example, before
deleting that, this is what I will do.

3328
03:48:25,800 --> 03:48:31,440
I will write a select statement
and I will use this word condition in here

3329
03:48:31,440 --> 03:48:35,760
so that I can visually verify
how many rows will be affected.

3330
03:48:35,760 --> 03:48:37,800
So I will not fuss. Right.

3331
03:48:38,320 --> 03:48:42,360
Will execute this delete statement
using the same rare condition.

3332
03:48:42,360 --> 03:48:45,840
I will execute this select statement
so that I know

3333
03:48:45,840 --> 03:48:47,720
how many of those will be affected.

3334
03:48:47,720 --> 03:48:51,400
So I know I am getting three rows
so I know this delete will have had

3335
03:48:51,440 --> 03:48:52,440
three rows.

3336
03:48:52,440 --> 03:48:57,200
So as a best best practice
before updating or deleting, run

3337
03:48:57,200 --> 03:49:00,480
a select query to check
how many doors you get.

3338
03:49:01,080 --> 03:49:04,160
That many rules will be affected
by a delete

3339
03:49:04,160 --> 03:49:07,440
or by update.

3340
03:49:07,440 --> 03:49:08,880
Okay.

3341
03:49:08,880 --> 03:49:15,320
Let me check what else we are missing.

3342
03:49:15,320 --> 03:49:20,800
So truncate table and drop table
used to remove that record from the table.

3343
03:49:20,800 --> 03:49:22,440
Not a the table.

3344
03:49:22,440 --> 03:49:24,000
Okay.

3345
03:49:24,000 --> 03:49:29,400
So truncate will not remove the table,
but all the data that is inside that table

3346
03:49:29,920 --> 03:49:33,640
and this is this index
drop used to delete the data

3347
03:49:33,680 --> 03:49:39,920
and the table from the database
so everything will be gone.

3348
03:49:39,920 --> 03:49:43,320
These are data manipulation
and these are data definitions.

3349
03:49:43,320 --> 03:49:49,080
So I hope now if you guys see these
keywords, everything will make sense.

3350
03:49:49,080 --> 03:49:52,000
You know, these things make sense. Now

3351
03:50:00,080 --> 03:50:02,400
it is the same thing.

3352
03:50:02,680 --> 03:50:05,280
Okay,
so you guys have learned how to do that.

3353
03:50:05,280 --> 03:50:08,840
Now let's learn how to do this as well.

3354
03:50:08,840 --> 03:50:10,560
So now

3355
03:50:10,920 --> 03:50:12,680
I will teach you.

3356
03:50:12,680 --> 03:50:13,800
Stephen,

3357
03:50:14,400 --> 03:50:16,600
I think
although you are in love with Stephen,

3358
03:50:16,960 --> 03:50:21,000
this is what happens when someone is loved
with in love with someone else.

3359
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:23,360
They always stay in their mind.

3360
03:50:23,360 --> 03:50:26,320
They always keep on thinking about those

3361
03:50:30,200 --> 03:50:30,800
contacts.

3362
03:50:30,800 --> 03:50:34,960
The Oracle guys ask them,
Who is this Stephen inside this entity?

3363
03:50:34,960 --> 03:50:36,120
But ask them.

3364
03:50:36,120 --> 03:50:40,480
You want to meet to.

3365
03:50:40,480 --> 03:50:46,800
I am thinking of it.

3366
03:50:46,800 --> 03:50:51,520
So guys, now you know

3367
03:50:52,080 --> 03:50:54,480
all the rules to

3368
03:50:55,400 --> 03:50:59,200
bring the data from their database
with the help of queries

3369
03:50:59,400 --> 03:51:05,440
and some of also some of this stuff
that is required, insert

3370
03:51:05,440 --> 03:51:10,440
and delete the things
inside the table as well.

3371
03:51:10,800 --> 03:51:13,440
And also you can create tables, but

3372
03:51:15,400 --> 03:51:18,960
because we have to

3373
03:51:18,960 --> 03:51:22,280
it this, this knowledge is good.

3374
03:51:22,280 --> 03:51:26,680
If you are doing men were testing manually
go inside the database

3375
03:51:27,280 --> 03:51:30,120
execute security check if that if the

3376
03:51:31,320 --> 03:51:35,000
if the data has been inserted
in a specific table or not

3377
03:51:35,280 --> 03:51:38,040
and then maybe you can verify it
from the frontend.

3378
03:51:38,120 --> 03:51:38,960
Right.

3379
03:51:39,320 --> 03:51:42,480
But we are not manual testers only.

3380
03:51:42,480 --> 03:51:44,240
We are automation testers.

3381
03:51:44,240 --> 03:51:50,040
That means now we should also learn
how to integrate this knowledge

3382
03:51:50,040 --> 03:51:52,760
with the framework
that you guys have built.

3383
03:51:54,480 --> 03:51:57,560
So now I will show you how to

3384
03:51:59,040 --> 03:52:01,840
combine your Java knowledge

3385
03:52:01,840 --> 03:52:06,000
and your skill knowledge
to do the same things.

3386
03:52:06,360 --> 03:52:11,840
So now you will be able to write a Java
code to do all of this stuff,

3387
03:52:11,840 --> 03:52:16,440
to fetch all the data from database
inside your Java programs.

3388
03:52:17,240 --> 03:52:19,680
And then also you guys already know

3389
03:52:19,680 --> 03:52:23,720
how to bring the data
from frontend, right?

3390
03:52:23,760 --> 03:52:25,960
Using selenium in your Java program.

3391
03:52:26,600 --> 03:52:29,880
Now I will show you how to bring the data
from database

3392
03:52:29,880 --> 03:52:32,320
as well using Java code

3393
03:52:32,920 --> 03:52:37,080
and then you guys already know
how to match that to data

3394
03:52:37,160 --> 03:52:41,200
and make your best cases
fail or block pass the.

3395
03:52:41,400 --> 03:52:42,440
Does it make sense? Guys?

3396
03:52:42,440 --> 03:52:44,320
Look what I have just explained

3397
03:52:50,360 --> 03:52:51,400
so you

3398
03:52:51,400 --> 03:52:54,360
already know how to bring the data
from frontend.

3399
03:52:54,720 --> 03:52:59,280
You have started about the backend
as well, but only manually.

3400
03:53:00,480 --> 03:53:02,480
Now we will write the Java code

3401
03:53:03,480 --> 03:53:07,400
and with the help of these skill
that you guys have learned,

3402
03:53:07,400 --> 03:53:11,040
we will also be
bringing the data from backend

3403
03:53:11,560 --> 03:53:15,960
and then we will be
performing the testing.

3404
03:53:15,960 --> 03:53:19,880
So this is called DB testing
with selenium.

3405
03:53:20,400 --> 03:53:21,040
Okay.

3406
03:53:21,480 --> 03:53:23,960
And so

3407
03:53:24,960 --> 03:53:27,960
guys,
before you guys started using selenium,

3408
03:53:28,480 --> 03:53:31,120
you guys downloaded some dogs,

3409
03:53:31,120 --> 03:53:35,040
right?

3410
03:53:35,040 --> 03:53:38,400
Because selenium is something

3411
03:53:38,400 --> 03:53:41,760
that is out of code of Java,

3412
03:53:41,840 --> 03:53:46,360
the Java that you guys in Java classes,
by the way it is called or Java.

3413
03:53:46,680 --> 03:53:51,960
And let's say if you want to do something
advanced, you have to learn,

3414
03:53:52,480 --> 03:53:56,000
you have to use some kind of libraries
or dependencies

3415
03:53:56,000 --> 03:53:59,560
or frameworks
so that your task becomes easier.

3416
03:54:00,920 --> 03:54:03,800
So for the Selenium driver,

3417
03:54:05,200 --> 03:54:08,040
other than selenium driver driver, now

3418
03:54:08,040 --> 03:54:12,880
we also need a dependency
for my sequel as well.

3419
03:54:12,880 --> 03:54:15,000
So when you guys were learning

3420
03:54:15,000 --> 03:54:18,680
how to read selfies,
we downloaded the jobs manually,

3421
03:54:18,680 --> 03:54:22,600
then we added those jobs in our project
manually and.

3422
03:54:22,600 --> 03:54:23,120
Later on.

3423
03:54:23,120 --> 03:54:25,560
You guys learned about the Maven, right?

3424
03:54:25,560 --> 03:54:27,680
Well, what is the purpose of MAVEN guys?

3425
03:54:28,560 --> 03:54:32,320
Can I automate this dependency inclusion

3426
03:54:34,240 --> 03:54:36,280
inside a project with the help of MAVEN

3427
03:54:39,120 --> 03:54:41,600
support is the purpose of MAVEN Silver

3428
03:54:51,840 --> 03:54:53,640
is there is some kind of a rocket

3429
03:54:53,640 --> 03:54:56,280
that gives you scale

3430
03:54:57,720 --> 03:54:59,960
build management.

3431
03:55:00,360 --> 03:55:02,160
Yes. Guys, please

3432
03:55:02,160 --> 03:55:04,800
try to also pull

3433
03:55:04,840 --> 03:55:07,920
it is on not only for silver, try to use

3434
03:55:08,080 --> 03:55:12,880
try to focus on the terminologies
that you guys use to explain things.

3435
03:55:12,880 --> 03:55:13,520
Okay.

3436
03:55:13,560 --> 03:55:15,760
So that you look more professional, right?

3437
03:55:15,760 --> 03:55:16,440
Terminology

3438
03:55:17,400 --> 03:55:19,560
explaining the right things here.

3439
03:55:19,600 --> 03:55:25,000
Say build management tool, right in
so many other things that it helps us.

3440
03:55:25,000 --> 03:55:28,120
It also help manage dependencies,

3441
03:55:28,680 --> 03:55:33,840
which means you can just write
the name of the dependency and the maven

3442
03:55:33,840 --> 03:55:38,160
will take care of adding
and managing the version

3443
03:55:38,160 --> 03:55:42,920
of that dependency for us
so that we don't have to do it manually.

3444
03:55:43,760 --> 03:55:48,200
Whenever a new version comes
in, I can just change the name of the

3445
03:55:48,240 --> 03:55:52,360
I can just change version
of the dependency in my bombed out example

3446
03:55:52,680 --> 03:55:56,040
and then updated dependency
will be downloaded automatically

3447
03:55:56,040 --> 03:56:01,440
from remote repository
and it will be added in my in my project.

3448
03:56:01,840 --> 03:56:03,600
I think it's just blooming.

3449
03:56:03,600 --> 03:56:09,280
You guys did your project right?

3450
03:56:09,280 --> 03:56:11,760
Okay, maybe you guys can guide me
how to do that.

3451
03:56:12,360 --> 03:56:15,000
So Selenium driver is limited

3452
03:56:15,000 --> 03:56:18,920
to testing
your applications using browsers

3453
03:56:20,640 --> 03:56:21,680
to use selenium a

3454
03:56:21,680 --> 03:56:26,280
driver for database testing,
you need to use DBC.

3455
03:56:26,280 --> 03:56:29,440
So this is the driver name that we use.

3456
03:56:29,440 --> 03:56:31,840
It is Java database connectivity.

3457
03:56:32,400 --> 03:56:33,680
Stephen

3458
03:56:35,640 --> 03:56:36,160
Yeah,

3459
03:56:40,320 --> 03:56:40,760
thank you.

3460
03:56:40,760 --> 03:56:41,360
Thank you.

3461
03:56:41,360 --> 03:56:42,800
Sebastian

3462
03:56:46,520 --> 03:56:49,880
So it is short for Java database
connectivity.

3463
03:56:49,880 --> 03:56:52,920
It is an obscure level API

3464
03:56:54,120 --> 03:56:56,920
that allows you
to execute scale statements.

3465
03:56:57,560 --> 03:57:00,480
So as the

3466
03:57:00,480 --> 03:57:05,440
I almost diversely and Stephen away,
so as in the database

3467
03:57:05,440 --> 03:57:09,560
databases can be from Microsoft or IBM

3468
03:57:09,560 --> 03:57:13,040
or Google or other companies.

3469
03:57:13,040 --> 03:57:16,040
So Java guys, what they did,

3470
03:57:16,080 --> 03:57:19,960
they created a interface and interface

3471
03:57:20,640 --> 03:57:25,600
and they defined to be met, let's say,
for example, a method to bring the data

3472
03:57:25,600 --> 03:57:30,280
from the database, a method
to update the data inside the database,

3473
03:57:30,880 --> 03:57:34,200
and they the the polymorphism.

3474
03:57:34,680 --> 03:57:38,240
So you guys remember
the example of database I gave you in the

3475
03:57:38,240 --> 03:57:40,200
last classes of polymorphism

3476
03:57:41,520 --> 03:57:42,320
we use the

3477
03:57:42,320 --> 03:57:46,520
same we can use the same methods
to connect to my sequel database

3478
03:57:46,520 --> 03:57:53,760
to Oracle database to SQL
because they all implement that interface.

3479
03:57:53,760 --> 03:57:56,760
So me

3480
03:57:58,120 --> 03:58:00,480
really appropriate me

3481
03:58:01,560 --> 03:58:03,400
Sebastian, please do something.

3482
03:58:03,400 --> 03:58:06,600
So this is how professionally
we say we're taking the person.

3483
03:58:06,600 --> 03:58:08,640
Sebastian please do they need to fill

3484
03:58:10,920 --> 03:58:11,880
submission? Please?

3485
03:58:11,880 --> 03:58:15,040
Do they need full?

3486
03:58:15,040 --> 03:58:19,080
So there is a and there is an interface
which all of these companies

3487
03:58:19,080 --> 03:58:23,600
have implemented
and we don't need to learn different

3488
03:58:23,600 --> 03:58:28,120
methods, different names of methods
to execute this.

3489
03:58:28,120 --> 03:58:32,840
Curious as we have been seeing
with these skill concepts,

3490
03:58:32,840 --> 03:58:36,600
some of the concepts were different
for different databases.

3491
03:58:37,040 --> 03:58:39,640
So the Java guys,
they have solved this problem

3492
03:58:39,960 --> 03:58:45,000
and we don't need to learn new methods
for different databases.

3493
03:58:45,280 --> 03:58:47,840
We need the help of
polymorphism and interfaces.

3494
03:58:49,680 --> 03:58:52,880
So it is responsible for connectivity

3495
03:58:52,880 --> 03:58:57,360
between Java language
and a wide range of databases.

3496
03:58:57,760 --> 03:59:02,160
So whichever companies are locked

3497
03:59:02,160 --> 03:59:05,480
their databases
to work with Java seamlessly.

3498
03:59:06,000 --> 03:59:08,680
They already implement these methods

3499
03:59:08,680 --> 03:59:11,400
and we just need to know
how to use those methods.

3500
03:59:13,080 --> 03:59:16,680
So you see GBC is database independent.

3501
03:59:16,920 --> 03:59:21,360
It can work with any database
which has implemented that interface

3502
03:59:21,360 --> 03:59:23,600
and most of them
they implement the interface.

3503
03:59:24,480 --> 03:59:27,560
But the GBC is not as fully independent.

3504
03:59:28,040 --> 03:59:32,120
It will still be using good.

3505
03:59:32,120 --> 03:59:37,000
So a little bit more about it is DBC,
because I have seen

3506
03:59:37,000 --> 03:59:41,280
the questions related to GBC as well in.

3507
03:59:41,280 --> 03:59:44,880
Some of the interview databases
used to interact with the various types

3508
03:59:44,880 --> 03:59:49,040
of databases
such as Oracle, Microsoft Access,

3509
03:59:49,080 --> 03:59:53,720
my school SQL Server to connect the dialog
with different databases.

3510
03:59:53,720 --> 03:59:58,560
We have different drivers and jobs,
so each company

3511
03:59:58,680 --> 04:00:02,480
who will be developing the database,
they will develop the job.

3512
04:00:03,120 --> 04:00:07,520
We will just important that
the DOD in our project and that's state.

3513
04:00:07,560 --> 04:00:11,920
We will use the same exact
methods to query the database

3514
04:00:13,760 --> 04:00:15,840
Using databases we can execute

3515
04:00:16,480 --> 04:00:20,440
is using Java application
and retrieve the results in database.

3516
04:00:21,120 --> 04:00:23,480
To connect my skill to our application,

3517
04:00:23,480 --> 04:00:26,720
we need for download my Escuela de DBC.

3518
04:00:27,000 --> 04:00:30,000
Okay, so this is a little bit

3519
04:00:30,000 --> 04:00:34,080
about the structure of the GBC.

3520
04:00:34,080 --> 04:00:37,880
We have job application,
the code that you guys have been writing

3521
04:00:38,840 --> 04:00:41,800
that talks to the DBC driver

3522
04:00:43,200 --> 04:00:46,640
and that driver actually talks
to the industry.

3523
04:00:46,640 --> 04:00:49,680
That manager actually talks
to these specific drivers.

3524
04:00:49,680 --> 04:00:52,280
So these will be

3525
04:00:52,280 --> 04:00:53,960
this will this,

3526
04:00:55,080 --> 04:00:57,800
this part will stay the same in here

3527
04:00:58,320 --> 04:01:01,160
for you guys because we only work in here

3528
04:01:02,040 --> 04:01:04,280
and this part is taken care of by Java

3529
04:01:04,280 --> 04:01:08,400
and this part is taken care
of by each company which you are,

3530
04:01:08,480 --> 04:01:14,200
which wants their databases to work
seamlessly with the Java.

3531
04:01:14,400 --> 04:01:16,440
And then we have the actual database.

3532
04:01:16,440 --> 04:01:19,000
Does it make sense to use this picture?

3533
04:01:19,000 --> 04:01:22,000
Does it help you understand
this structure under the hood?

3534
04:01:22,800 --> 04:01:27,160
How can we work with different databases
so each different database,

3535
04:01:27,160 --> 04:01:32,720
we will have a different driver
like, this different driver,

3536
04:01:33,320 --> 04:01:37,280
but after after
this part will be sustaining same.

3537
04:01:37,400 --> 04:01:41,400
So as a developer, we will be in this

3538
04:01:43,400 --> 04:01:49,800
is so these are some of the famous classes

3539
04:01:49,800 --> 04:01:57,000
and interfaces that we can use to interact
with the database this manager.

3540
04:01:57,160 --> 04:02:01,560
So do you guys remember, first of all,
when we started learning school,

3541
04:02:01,560 --> 04:02:06,240
what was the first thing that we did
after installing the my sequel workbench?

3542
04:02:06,960 --> 04:02:09,000
We used the credentials

3543
04:02:09,480 --> 04:02:11,920
to first connected to that database

3544
04:02:12,240 --> 04:02:15,560
right before we can execute any query,

3545
04:02:15,800 --> 04:02:18,600
we must first connect to that database

3546
04:02:18,600 --> 04:02:21,320
using this some credentials, right?

3547
04:02:21,600 --> 04:02:25,080
This is our first step
all through username and password

3548
04:02:25,680 --> 04:02:28,200
so this driver manager takes care, this

3549
04:02:28,200 --> 04:02:32,040
driver manager and this connection

3550
04:02:32,040 --> 04:02:33,680
interfaces, they take care

3551
04:02:33,680 --> 04:02:37,160
about those things, that connection part.

3552
04:02:38,240 --> 04:02:41,440
This statement takes care.

3553
04:02:41,760 --> 04:02:45,720
So whenever we write the query,

3554
04:02:45,720 --> 04:02:48,920
that query is executed on database

3555
04:02:48,920 --> 04:02:51,560
server and in return we get some results.

3556
04:02:52,160 --> 04:02:53,600
This is statement part.

3557
04:02:53,600 --> 04:03:00,040
It's kind of in
this interface takes care of the issues.

3558
04:03:00,360 --> 04:03:03,360
It takes care of the Q report that we want

3559
04:03:03,360 --> 04:03:07,640
to execute this result START is again
an interface

3560
04:03:08,120 --> 04:03:12,880
and this is where we store
the results from the database.

3561
04:03:13,240 --> 04:03:17,280
So in Skill Workbench, we see the results
in full in the form of a table.

3562
04:03:17,720 --> 04:03:20,160
By the way, am I going fast?

3563
04:03:21,120 --> 04:03:21,760
All thing?

3564
04:03:21,760 --> 04:03:24,880
Are things making sense?

3565
04:03:24,880 --> 04:03:27,320
Yes, we will write queries inside Java

3566
04:03:28,800 --> 04:03:31,400
almost audio good Illini other guys

3567
04:03:35,440 --> 04:03:37,560
audio was able to connect the dots.

3568
04:03:37,560 --> 04:03:38,640
All right.

3569
04:03:39,480 --> 04:03:42,960
And then there are some exceptions

3570
04:03:43,000 --> 04:03:45,920
which are specifically related to school.

3571
04:03:46,320 --> 04:03:49,080
Do you guys remember if school exception

3572
04:03:49,080 --> 04:03:52,160
is a checkered exception
on unchecked exception?

3573
04:03:52,160 --> 04:03:55,520
I told you when we were learning
about the exceptions

3574
04:03:56,000 --> 04:04:04,200
file not found was a checkered exception.

3575
04:04:04,200 --> 04:04:06,080
It is also a checkered exception.

3576
04:04:06,080 --> 04:04:09,400
So we must also write the Pride
catch blocks

3577
04:04:09,400 --> 04:04:19,920
when will be writing the Java code.

3578
04:04:19,920 --> 04:04:24,160
So these are some of the steps guys
for us to create a connection

3579
04:04:24,160 --> 04:04:29,920
to do database, then create statements.

3580
04:04:30,960 --> 04:04:35,000
These statements
will help us execute queries.

3581
04:04:36,120 --> 04:04:39,480
Then We will be getting the results
from database.

3582
04:04:39,480 --> 04:04:44,320
We need some kind of data structure
to hold the results.

3583
04:04:44,640 --> 04:04:47,600
All right,
guys, here is one more question. Two.

3584
04:04:47,960 --> 04:04:52,360
So the results from the database
looks very similar to the

3585
04:04:54,840 --> 04:04:57,640
to how we stored the writing Excel files.

3586
04:04:58,280 --> 04:05:02,320
Again, can you guys tell me
how can I store the results

3587
04:05:02,320 --> 04:05:07,680
of a skill query?

3588
04:05:07,680 --> 04:05:11,040
They look very similar
to how Excel stores do that.

3589
04:05:11,040 --> 04:05:12,000
All right.

3590
04:05:12,640 --> 04:05:13,880
Column names, then.

3591
04:05:13,880 --> 04:05:14,760
Rules.

3592
04:05:15,360 --> 04:05:18,480
I mean,
I am giving you a clear, clear hint

3593
04:05:18,600 --> 04:05:23,360
that they look the same as Excel
File is saying file import.

3594
04:05:23,360 --> 04:05:27,000
Alex is saying to me arrays,

3595
04:05:27,000 --> 04:05:29,240
I think I should first tell you the answer

3596
04:05:29,240 --> 04:05:31,600
and then I should ask
the questions to you.

3597
04:05:32,280 --> 04:05:34,720
Or do you guys think so? Let me do this.

3598
04:05:34,880 --> 04:05:40,680
Well, you can store
do that from an inside a set of inside

3599
04:05:40,680 --> 04:05:45,560
IMAP or inside a list of maps
or inside the list of objects.

3600
04:05:45,840 --> 04:05:47,360
So let me ask this, guys.

3601
04:05:47,360 --> 04:05:53,000
How can I store the data from minuscule
field of I self, please, Alex, please.

3602
04:05:53,000 --> 04:05:53,760
You guys tell

3603
04:05:59,520 --> 04:06:00,760
by the way

3604
04:06:00,760 --> 04:06:01,320
you have I have

3605
04:06:01,320 --> 04:06:05,640
noticed this that whenever we grow up,
maybe it is because of the responsibility

3606
04:06:05,640 --> 04:06:09,360
to use the the common sense bar
to be active in this part

3607
04:06:09,840 --> 04:06:14,520
D times They are much,
much better in that as compared to others.

3608
04:06:14,520 --> 04:06:16,080
Right? I don't know.

3609
04:06:16,080 --> 04:06:20,440
I have noticed it
noticed it during the day can give much

3610
04:06:20,440 --> 04:06:24,400
more logical answers
if we even showed them a little hint.

3611
04:06:24,480 --> 04:06:25,200
But we are.

3612
04:06:25,200 --> 04:06:28,920
So I don't know why we missed this part,
although we have spent so much time.

3613
04:06:30,120 --> 04:06:32,920
First,
save it and copy paste in galah project.

3614
04:06:33,720 --> 04:06:35,760
Great answer and

3615
04:06:36,360 --> 04:06:40,680
please apply directly in Apple,
Amazon, Tesla or StarLink

3616
04:06:41,200 --> 04:06:42,960
over thinking full plate.

3617
04:06:42,960 --> 04:06:45,680
You will notice much more by time.

3618
04:06:46,520 --> 04:06:51,440
It is their brand is not polluted
with useless information. Yep.

3619
04:06:52,480 --> 04:06:53,560
I think some of the

3620
04:06:53,560 --> 04:06:56,160
universities
they are also did research on that.

3621
04:06:57,400 --> 04:07:00,000
And then guys, we must

3622
04:07:00,800 --> 04:07:05,160
close the connections because they are
very very expensive resource.

3623
04:07:05,520 --> 04:07:10,920
So can you guys tell me in Java
what is the appropriate place

3624
04:07:10,920 --> 04:07:16,400
where I should close the connection?

3625
04:07:16,400 --> 04:07:18,560
You get married first, also have kids.

3626
04:07:18,600 --> 04:07:23,480
Then we will talk.

3627
04:07:23,480 --> 04:07:25,880
Alexa, you remember that meme?

3628
04:07:25,880 --> 04:07:32,520
I want to do the same pause in here, Matt.

3629
04:07:34,320 --> 04:07:36,800
Meanwhile, that person got a yes.

3630
04:07:36,960 --> 04:07:39,000
That person got very famous.

3631
04:07:39,000 --> 04:07:42,120
So the they dropped the very simple catch.

3632
04:07:42,360 --> 04:07:44,440
And this person paused like this.

3633
04:07:44,440 --> 04:07:47,000
And it is all over the internet now.

3634
04:07:47,000 --> 04:07:51,000
He is also he is also an IP
guy who, by the way, is profile.

3635
04:07:51,160 --> 04:07:53,760
LinkedIn profile also got very famous.

3636
04:07:54,160 --> 04:07:56,640
So when you said hoax,
I also want to do this.

3637
04:07:56,640 --> 04:07:59,520
Let me know.

3638
04:07:59,520 --> 04:08:02,160
I don't know
if you guys will be able to see me or not.

3639
04:08:03,320 --> 04:08:06,800
Guys, they finally block

3640
04:08:08,520 --> 04:08:09,120
you remember?

3641
04:08:09,120 --> 04:08:12,520
They finally block is where we do

3642
04:08:12,520 --> 04:08:15,440
all of the important stuff,
all of the clothing stuff.

3643
04:08:15,720 --> 04:08:18,200
We closed all of the Excel files inside.

3644
04:08:18,200 --> 04:08:20,280
They finally. BLOCK

3645
04:08:20,400 --> 04:08:33,840
You guys also use it to close the browser.

3646
04:08:33,840 --> 04:08:34,880
All right, great.

3647
04:08:34,880 --> 04:08:38,320
So this is the

3648
04:08:38,320 --> 04:08:39,640
this is where we should do it.

3649
04:08:39,640 --> 04:08:42,440
So we will also close
the database connection.

3650
04:08:42,440 --> 04:08:47,600
And they finally block And as we created
be is your heart like Mario?

3651
04:08:47,600 --> 04:08:48,600
Or you would just stand up

3652
04:08:48,600 --> 04:08:52,800
and nothing changed or because my chair is
very, very tall so that you guys

3653
04:08:52,800 --> 04:08:55,520
can not feel the difference
when I am standing or sitting.

3654
04:08:55,960 --> 04:08:58,160
Special instructions for all muscle.

3655
04:08:58,160 --> 04:09:02,240
Please don't tell her. No.

3656
04:09:02,880 --> 04:09:03,400
Basically we are.

3657
04:09:03,400 --> 04:09:06,040
We will be closing the connections.

3658
04:09:06,040 --> 04:09:09,320
Quick question about family is family.

3659
04:09:09,320 --> 04:09:12,800
I you see I see family instead of finally
is finally

3660
04:09:12,800 --> 04:09:16,320
every time
get about a finally is all is executed

3661
04:09:18,960 --> 04:09:20,000
it's finally is

3662
04:09:20,000 --> 04:09:23,760
always executed.

3663
04:09:23,760 --> 04:09:26,400
So this is where we will
be closing the connection

3664
04:09:28,440 --> 04:09:30,120
and God most of you are married to

3665
04:09:30,120 --> 04:09:33,720
you can understand my pain already.

3666
04:09:33,720 --> 04:09:36,800
So guys, we inserted the

3667
04:09:38,600 --> 04:09:41,520
horse name or name database

3668
04:09:41,520 --> 04:09:45,680
name user and password inside the girl.

3669
04:09:45,680 --> 04:09:48,920
But to prevent you in the right in here
before

3670
04:09:49,120 --> 04:09:52,200
making that connection

3671
04:09:53,360 --> 04:09:54,440
in here.

3672
04:09:54,600 --> 04:09:57,720
So we need all of this information

3673
04:09:57,960 --> 04:10:02,440
inside the Java program
as well to connect to a database.

3674
04:10:02,440 --> 04:10:05,320
Right. So in here

3675
04:10:05,320 --> 04:10:08,760
we inserted the information
in different pieces.

3676
04:10:08,760 --> 04:10:13,040
Can you show some examples
how it in real life, Alexa?

3677
04:10:13,040 --> 04:10:21,400
What do you mean in real life or.

3678
04:10:22,040 --> 04:10:28,000
Yes, this is what we will
be doing in a minute.

3679
04:10:28,000 --> 04:10:30,760
So you guys are already familiar with this

3680
04:10:32,800 --> 04:10:34,480
this information, right?

3681
04:10:34,480 --> 04:10:37,520
Database name, user name,
password, the host name and forward.

3682
04:10:38,880 --> 04:10:41,200
So to connect to me

3683
04:10:42,040 --> 04:10:45,680
all time is more minutes.

3684
04:10:45,680 --> 04:10:47,480
Olga You mean I am rushing?

3685
04:10:47,480 --> 04:10:56,280
This is what this horse means.

3686
04:10:56,280 --> 04:10:57,400
I don't know.

3687
04:10:57,400 --> 04:10:59,800
Sometimes I feel like the mother.

3688
04:10:59,840 --> 04:11:02,280
The mother they can their children, even.

3689
04:11:02,280 --> 04:11:04,720
They are doing all they can understand.

3690
04:11:04,720 --> 04:11:08,480
If they are asking for the watermelon
or they are hungry or whatever,

3691
04:11:08,480 --> 04:11:09,760
they are right mothers.

3692
04:11:09,760 --> 04:11:12,760
They can just tell you by their gestures
or things like that.

3693
04:11:13,200 --> 04:11:15,280
I also sometimes feel like that

3694
04:11:16,480 --> 04:11:18,480
that's good. Not everything is about you.

3695
04:11:18,720 --> 04:11:20,400
Who? Why? What's the point?

3696
04:11:20,400 --> 04:11:24,000
That horse in this conversation
that we are trying to have

3697
04:11:31,840 --> 04:11:33,600
in 20, you really feel?

3698
04:11:33,600 --> 04:11:36,640
Student It was for Alex Okay.

3699
04:11:36,640 --> 04:11:39,360
Oh, you'll get all to hold your horses.

3700
04:11:39,600 --> 04:11:42,600
Oh, I got. So you guys started this.

3701
04:11:42,600 --> 04:11:47,080
I think that line was also best
and was also doing this.

3702
04:11:47,840 --> 04:11:50,400
Do you know someone in bed ten

3703
04:11:56,000 --> 04:11:58,440
Oh so glad the best.

3704
04:11:58,440 --> 04:12:00,600
Ten and nine.

3705
04:12:00,600 --> 04:12:05,120
Every time the students ask something
from future, they used to make this emoji.

3706
04:12:06,360 --> 04:12:08,880
They're smart to confuse me
because you guys didn't

3707
04:12:09,120 --> 04:12:11,280
use that too much in here.

3708
04:12:12,400 --> 04:12:14,880
You guys also do that.

3709
04:12:15,240 --> 04:12:19,280
So this is how we can combine
all the information

3710
04:12:20,520 --> 04:12:23,960
into something
that we can use in a Java program.

3711
04:12:24,720 --> 04:12:31,440
So we will be creating
something called a database.

3712
04:12:31,440 --> 04:12:32,640
You are in

3713
04:12:33,120 --> 04:12:36,680
that database, you are only contains

3714
04:12:37,960 --> 04:12:41,520
the information that the first part tells

3715
04:12:41,520 --> 04:12:45,000
you about the driver that you want to use.

3716
04:12:45,800 --> 04:12:50,640
Then the of day that I based
that you are working with,

3717
04:12:51,480 --> 04:12:54,320
then the IP address of the database

3718
04:12:54,320 --> 04:12:58,040
or the hostname, then the port name
and then the baby name.

3719
04:12:58,040 --> 04:13:00,760
So this is how we combine
all the information.

3720
04:13:01,160 --> 04:13:06,120
We create a very long string with stored
all of this information in here and.

3721
04:13:06,120 --> 04:13:10,440
Then we pass that information
to this method,

3722
04:13:10,440 --> 04:13:13,680
which is get connection,
and it threatens us connection.

3723
04:13:14,160 --> 04:13:16,920
Using that connection,
we can write queries

3724
04:13:16,920 --> 04:13:20,200
and we can get the results.

3725
04:13:20,200 --> 04:13:24,360
So now I want every one of you

3726
04:13:24,360 --> 04:13:36,880
to open your intelligence,

3727
04:13:36,880 --> 04:13:42,000
and I want every one of you
to create a Maven project this time.

3728
04:13:43,840 --> 04:13:44,480
And we

3729
04:13:44,480 --> 04:13:50,400
need any artifacts.

3730
04:13:50,400 --> 04:13:53,480
Let me know once you guys have

3731
04:13:54,240 --> 04:13:57,680
so let's call it

3732
04:13:58,160 --> 04:14:01,640
batch 11 baby testing

3733
04:14:04,320 --> 04:14:07,000
or or all of you are good.

3734
04:14:07,200 --> 04:14:09,480
Can I click on finish

3735
04:14:14,480 --> 04:14:14,840
guys,

3736
04:14:14,840 --> 04:14:36,080
are you here?

3737
04:14:36,080 --> 04:14:36,360
Okay.

3738
04:14:36,360 --> 04:14:39,560
Meanwhile, in days starting

3739
04:14:40,680 --> 04:14:42,480
from where I can find

3740
04:14:42,480 --> 04:14:46,240
the repositories for MAVEN project, write

3741
04:14:46,560 --> 04:14:49,440
my ask your old connector

3742
04:14:51,840 --> 04:14:59,480
and then maven.

3743
04:14:59,480 --> 04:15:01,560
Let me actually send you the link of this.

3744
04:15:02,400 --> 04:15:03,400
Please use this link.

3745
04:15:03,400 --> 04:15:05,920
If you are unable to find

3746
04:15:07,600 --> 04:15:11,880
and you guys already know
what what these numbers mean,

3747
04:15:12,120 --> 04:15:16,680
what is this usages and the dates,
the repositories and all that.

3748
04:15:16,680 --> 04:15:17,320
Right?

3749
04:15:17,960 --> 04:15:19,800
These are all vulnerable.

3750
04:15:19,800 --> 04:15:23,160
We should not
then is please focus in the class.

3751
04:15:23,160 --> 04:15:27,840
I know I know three or four
because I will be delaying that

3752
04:15:28,240 --> 04:15:36,520
about 10 minutes.

3753
04:15:36,520 --> 04:15:40,800
So right now this is the my what?

3754
04:15:40,800 --> 04:15:43,440
Your this one that is most widely used.

3755
04:15:43,440 --> 04:15:46,320
I mean, you're almost about to get this

3756
04:15:46,560 --> 04:15:49,600
vulnerable tag in here is flexibility.

3757
04:15:49,840 --> 04:15:50,400
This would

3758
04:15:51,360 --> 04:15:54,720
use this one.

3759
04:15:54,720 --> 04:16:00,800
You guys can call it anything or no,
it is already here.

3760
04:16:00,800 --> 04:16:01,920
Great. Know

3761
04:16:02,880 --> 04:16:03,840
who else is here?

3762
04:16:03,840 --> 04:16:11,560
Jamal, Are you also here?

3763
04:16:11,560 --> 04:16:16,560
And we are waiting for one more student

3764
04:16:17,760 --> 04:16:21,560
because some of them they asked that

3765
04:16:21,600 --> 04:16:24,600
please invite some female students

3766
04:16:24,600 --> 04:16:30,240
as well, especially.

3767
04:16:30,240 --> 04:16:45,800
So again, are you also here?

and just five more minutes.

3771
04:16:57,640 --> 04:17:00,080
Maybe you can also refresh this knowledge.

3772
04:17:01,560 --> 04:17:03,600
Okay.

3773
04:17:03,600 --> 04:17:06,000
Sorry I had to step out. Was that I may.

3774
04:17:06,240 --> 04:17:07,080
Yes it wasn't me.

3775
04:17:07,080 --> 04:17:08,400
When project

3776
04:17:10,000 --> 04:17:12,320

3777
04:17:12,320 --> 04:17:16,840
The I am changing my name

3778
04:17:16,840 --> 04:17:28,080
Olga, how do you getting married?

04:17:31,800 --> 04:17:35,760
of any use anymore.

3781
04:17:35,760 --> 04:17:37,440
You guys need real Steven.

3782
04:17:38,360 --> 04:17:38,720
Okay.

format already.

3787
04:17:46,680 --> 04:17:48,960
This the autumn of Steven from today.

3788
04:17:50,040 --> 04:17:52,760

No, no, no. I don't want to get killed.

3791
04:17:59,760 --> 04:18:04,120
If someone accidentally

04:18:04,320 --> 04:18:08,400
I am done.

3793
04:18:08,400 --> 04:18:09,800
All our guys.

3794
04:18:09,800 --> 04:18:12,240
Let's add this dependency.
I don't think so.

3795
04:18:12,240 --> 04:18:17,680
You guys are in the mode of learning
anything new.

3796
04:18:17,680 --> 04:18:22,360
We will continue from here.

3797
04:18:22,360 --> 04:18:22,600
Okay.

3798
04:18:23,560 --> 04:18:28,640
All right, guys. No.

3799
04:18:29,160 --> 04:18:32,600
Can you guys send me a message in here
so that I can make you host?

3800
04:18:32,680 --> 04:18:39,560
So I can also already allow them all?

3801
04:18:39,560 --> 04:18:44,320
I think you can talk now.

3802
04:18:44,320 --> 04:18:48,280
No, You should also be able to talk now.

3803
04:18:49,640 --> 04:18:50,400
Hi. Can you hear me?

3804
04:18:51,560 --> 04:18:53,040
Yep. Although I know I. Do.

3805
04:18:53,040 --> 04:19:00,360
You hear?

3806
04:19:00,360 --> 04:19:04,680
Nor are you here. Yes.

3807
04:19:04,680 --> 04:19:05,880
Can you hear me?

3808
04:19:06,000 --> 04:19:08,920
Yep, yep, yep. We can hear you.

3809
04:19:08,920 --> 04:19:11,600

for me.

3816
04:19:36,320 --> 04:19:37,680
Yeah, that's her.

3817
04:19:38,880 --> 04:19:45,080
No, she's not here.

3818
04:19:45,080 --> 04:19:47,200
She wrote something in a chat,
so she is here.

3819
04:19:48,000 --> 04:19:50,320
Her name is in Russian?

3820
04:19:50,360 --> 04:19:58,080
Yep Yep.

3821
04:19:58,080 --> 04:20:00,360
Okay, well, maybe you would.

3822
04:20:01,400 --> 04:20:03,040
I know you are here.

3823
04:20:03,040 --> 04:20:04,400
Okay. Why? Okay.

3824
04:20:04,400 --> 04:20:04,760
Okay.

3825
04:20:04,760 --> 04:20:08,000
Perfect. Oh.

3826
04:20:09,400 --> 04:20:11,040
What? I am unable to start.

3827
04:20:11,040 --> 04:20:15,160
Do I need a Russian keyboard
to search for her name? No.

3828
04:20:15,160 --> 04:20:21,360
You should be able to just and paste it.

3829
04:20:21,360 --> 04:20:24,600
It is not allowing me to copy and paste.

3830
04:20:26,640 --> 04:20:27,520
By the way, you guys can

3831
04:20:27,520 --> 04:20:31,280
share your camera's and.

3832
04:20:31,280 --> 04:20:33,360
And you can turn on your mic.

3833
04:20:33,360 --> 04:20:40,280
It's telling me I can start video
because hosts has stopped it.

3834
04:20:40,280 --> 04:20:43,680
Same here.

3835
04:20:43,680 --> 04:20:47,400
Let me change the settings

3836
04:20:48,720 --> 04:20:49,560
allow.

3837
04:20:49,560 --> 04:20:55,200
I know, I know.

3838
04:20:55,200 --> 04:20:55,480
Okay.

3839
04:20:55,480 --> 04:21:00,400
Now you should be able to do it.

3840
04:21:00,400 --> 04:21:01,320
There you go.

3841
04:21:01,960 --> 04:21:05,800
You know, can you also

3842
04:21:06,120 --> 04:21:09,240
I don't how the adoption

3843
04:21:10,320 --> 04:21:15,840
will share your screen.

3844
04:21:15,840 --> 04:21:16,400
I don't know.

3845
04:21:16,400 --> 04:21:21,000
I don't have the option.

3846
04:21:21,000 --> 04:21:23,200
Do you have a camera attached to your.

3847
04:21:23,280 --> 04:21:29,880
Yes. Yes.

3848
04:21:29,880 --> 04:21:31,160
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3849
04:21:31,160 --> 04:21:40,000
I know why you don't have any option.

3850
04:21:40,000 --> 04:21:40,920
Okay.

3851
04:21:41,080 --> 04:21:46,560
Yeah, I think.

3852
04:21:46,560 --> 04:21:53,480
No, Now you should have an option.

3853
04:21:53,480 --> 04:21:54,400
I'm good now.

3854
04:21:54,400 --> 04:21:59,920
Yeah.

3855
04:21:59,920 --> 04:22:03,520
Okay, so
you guys can start talking to each other.

3856
04:22:03,520 --> 04:22:07,200
Meanwhile, I will fix the issue. Oksana.

3857
04:22:08,440 --> 04:22:10,600
So this is batch 11.

3858
04:22:11,280 --> 04:22:12,600
They are.

3859
04:22:12,600 --> 04:22:14,640
They will be learning their last year

3860
04:22:14,640 --> 04:22:17,880
class tomorrow,
and they will be starting the police.

3861
04:22:18,840 --> 04:22:24,200
And here we have
law and all from batch ten.

3862
04:22:24,960 --> 04:22:27,520
I think you guys were in the group one,
right?

3863
04:22:29,040 --> 04:22:31,440
Yeah, one or two years.

3864
04:22:31,480 --> 04:22:36,160
It's like 2 to 3 weeks
since they started looking for the dogs.

3865
04:22:36,160 --> 04:22:41,680
And they can tell you very well,
how is the market now?

3866
04:22:42,360 --> 04:22:45,560
How many offers they got in.

3867
04:22:45,560 --> 04:22:49,560
Maybe they can also tell you the range
of salaries if they are kind enough

3868
04:22:50,200 --> 04:22:53,160
and you guys can ask

3869
04:22:53,160 --> 04:22:57,760
almost anything that you want just sure
that it does not offer any of that.

3870
04:22:57,760 --> 04:23:02,080
And if so, you guys can see the questions
in Life Channel, right?

3871
04:23:03,040 --> 04:23:04,640
Yes, I can see a screen

3872
04:23:06,280 --> 04:23:07,800
into yeah, yeah.

3873
04:23:07,800 --> 04:23:10,240
Let no take the stage
and then I'll go after him.

3874
04:23:10,960 --> 04:23:12,960
Okay. Okay.

3875
04:23:12,960 --> 04:23:15,600
So if you guys can start
from introducing yourself.

3876
04:23:15,960 --> 04:23:18,200
Sure. Hello, everyone.

3877
04:23:18,200 --> 04:23:23,120
My name is Anurag Hermansen
and I'm from Beijing.

3878
04:23:23,520 --> 04:23:28,680
So it's been almost I think it's
just been a month since actually,

3879
04:23:28,680 --> 04:23:33,280
I started looking for a job,
and within two weeks

3880
04:23:34,120 --> 04:23:37,200
I a job, I received an offer.

3881
04:23:37,200 --> 04:23:40,440
So the market is very hot.

3882
04:23:40,440 --> 04:23:43,720
And what ever we know so far,

3883
04:23:43,720 --> 04:23:46,040
what we learn in the index is,

3884
04:23:47,480 --> 04:23:51,240
it's just enough for finding a job.

3885
04:23:51,240 --> 04:23:54,600
So we shouldn't be worrying
about finding job.

3886
04:23:54,600 --> 04:23:58,560
I mean, we all have those questions,
especially when I mean, just

3887
04:23:59,160 --> 04:24:04,360
two months ago, I mean, I was still not
sure that will I learned a job or not.

3888
04:24:04,360 --> 04:24:07,960
But once you get into the market,
all the knowledge

3889
04:24:07,960 --> 04:24:11,520
that we have
that what we get and the syntax

3890
04:24:12,960 --> 04:24:14,160
is just

3891
04:24:14,720 --> 04:24:16,600
very, very good, that what we get

3892
04:24:16,600 --> 04:24:19,760
and then once we go into the market
and we can find a job.

3893
04:24:20,520 --> 04:24:23,160
But, you know, we just need a clear

3894
04:24:23,160 --> 04:24:25,840
and concise concept and learn

3895
04:24:26,400 --> 04:24:31,120
and never stop learning,
never stop practicing.

3896
04:24:31,120 --> 04:24:34,520
So that that's all that I can say.

3897
04:24:34,640 --> 04:24:44,840
Yeah.

3898
04:24:44,840 --> 04:24:48,360
Can should I say, okay.

3899
04:24:48,720 --> 04:24:49,640
Hi everyone.

3900
04:24:49,640 --> 04:24:51,960
My name is Jamal.

3901
04:24:51,960 --> 04:24:56,600
And when I started, I can also speak
to Saudi to you guys go, Hello.

3902
04:24:56,600 --> 04:24:59,760
Hello everyone looks a little. Yes.

3903
04:24:59,760 --> 04:25:02,760
You can also turn on your camera
if you are comfortable.

3904
04:25:03,400 --> 04:25:04,680
Yes, sure.

3905
04:25:04,960 --> 04:25:06,520
Yeah. Okay.

3906
04:25:06,520 --> 04:25:10,040
So just to tell a little bit about myself,

3907
04:25:10,720 --> 04:25:13,640
when I first learned about bootcamps.

3908
04:25:13,640 --> 04:25:18,480
I was very hesitant about it
because I didn't really like many of you.

3909
04:25:18,480 --> 04:25:22,280
I'm sure I didn't really trust
in bootcamps because how can you learn

3910
04:25:22,280 --> 04:25:26,040
something in six months
and then you can advertise yourself as

3911
04:25:26,040 --> 04:25:30,760
being experienced in that for five years
and try to land a job when.

3912
04:25:30,760 --> 04:25:34,440
There are real people who have been
working on the industry for more than us

3913
04:25:34,800 --> 04:25:37,280
and the they are struggling.

3914
04:25:37,640 --> 04:25:42,720
So I was hesitant at first,
but I decided to give it a shot,

3915
04:25:43,680 --> 04:25:46,680
take classes, see how they all go,
everything.

3916
04:25:46,680 --> 04:25:50,760
It starts slow, especially
since I have a computer science major.

3917
04:25:50,760 --> 04:25:53,840
So many of the things that we were
learning in the beginning seemed,

3918
04:25:55,480 --> 04:25:57,240
I guess easy in the beginning,

3919
04:25:57,240 --> 04:26:00,440
but as we kept going, it kept ramping up.

3920
04:26:00,440 --> 04:26:02,520
I'm sure by the time you guys get to

3921
04:26:02,560 --> 04:26:05,880
towards the end of the Java,
you guys realized that it's not just

3922
04:26:06,360 --> 04:26:10,320
just like Hello World and just that's it.

3923
04:26:10,320 --> 04:26:14,640
So once you get to polymorphism and stuff
like that, it starts getting crazy,

3924
04:26:14,640 --> 04:26:18,400
especially sequel API, Selenium, cucumber

3925
04:26:20,040 --> 04:26:20,960
like it is.

3926
04:26:20,960 --> 04:26:23,400
I guess it gets frustrating,
it gets confusing,

3927
04:26:23,400 --> 04:26:28,080
but if you put time in it, just listen
and just listen.

3928
04:26:28,080 --> 04:26:32,160
Study and put in that you
I'm sure everybody can get through

3929
04:26:32,560 --> 04:26:37,600
and like I'm sure everybody,
they work full time, They have kids,

3930
04:26:37,600 --> 04:26:42,440
they have like the married so so balancing
everything is not easy.

3931
04:26:42,440 --> 04:26:45,800
You have to put enough time
to for a full time job

3932
04:26:45,800 --> 04:26:48,280
and you have to put enough time
to study as well.

3933
04:26:49,200 --> 04:26:53,240
But If you do put time,
the market is like specialists

3934
04:26:53,240 --> 04:26:57,080
for the past several months at least,
as has been hot

3935
04:26:57,120 --> 04:26:59,960
like everybody in my batch
will have found jobs.

3936
04:27:00,280 --> 04:27:02,840
Everybody got at least two
or three offers,

3937
04:27:02,840 --> 04:27:07,000
and when you get two or three offers,
you can you can become picky,

3938
04:27:07,000 --> 04:27:12,040
you can choose what you want, you can like
even me in a beginning, like in

3939
04:27:12,560 --> 04:27:17,200
I would say in a week of interviewing,
I was able to land the offer,

3940
04:27:17,200 --> 04:27:20,880
but I didn't go with it because it wasn't
something I was looking for.

3941
04:27:21,280 --> 04:27:24,240
Typically, the salaries,
it depends on what you're looking for.

3942
04:27:24,240 --> 04:27:26,880
If you put at least five years
of experience in your resume,

3943
04:27:27,480 --> 04:27:32,040
you'll you will land something
at least more than 80000

3944
04:27:32,040 --> 04:27:38,280
to 130000, depending on how well you do
and how how complicated a job is.

3945
04:27:39,240 --> 04:27:41,600
The first one I landed was,

3946
04:27:41,600 --> 04:27:45,000
I think it was somewhere around 90,000,
which wasn't something I was looking for.

3947
04:27:45,280 --> 04:27:49,080
So I kept looking and after two weeks
of interviewing back and forth,

3948
04:27:49,080 --> 04:27:53,680
like every day, if you looked
at my calendar, like from 10 a.m.

3949
04:27:53,680 --> 04:27:57,640
to 5 p.m., 6 p.m., it would be
it was scheduled to interviews.
