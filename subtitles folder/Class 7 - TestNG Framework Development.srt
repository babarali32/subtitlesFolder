1
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,920
All right, guys.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,000
So today for us,
we will start with the recap

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,240
what we did in the last class.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,040
So the very first thing
which we were discussing in the last

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,600
session was reading the data from Excel

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,640
by correct.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,920
All right, guys,

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,920
what was the problem with data provider?

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,880
What was the problem with data provider?

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,960
Why have you switched on to the Excel?

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,760
Why are we passing their data?

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,840
Got it. Right.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
So the volume of data
basically is the problem,

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,560
the volume of data.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,160
If it is big,

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,120
if it is large, data provider

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,200
cannot handle this correct.

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,640
Good morning, Anna.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,320
So in this case, when we have our data

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,680
in large volume,
we need some other source.

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,560
We can not proceed
further with data provider class.

22
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,760
In that case,
we always go with the Excel file.

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,720
So the setup is we keep our Excel pilot.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,800
One place
and then to read this Excel file,

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,160
we write one dynamic universal function
irrespective of number of rows,

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,400
number of columns, number of keys
and values

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:50,520
in the Excel file, Correct.

28
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,560
So now whenever we talk about Excel file,
right, we write a universal function.

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,320
Doesn't matter how many keys and values
we have,

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,680
how many rows we have,
how many column we have.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,640
Right?

32
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,880
We can read any kind of data from Excel
file with the help of just one function.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,760
Hello, Jose.

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,520
Hello.

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,600
So if I open my utils

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,720
there.

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,200
You see,
this is the function we have written right

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,320
where we were opening the workbook.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,920
Okay guys, I told you one more thing.

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,760
The two formal topics are
what are those two formats?

41
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,760
The extension. Yes.

42
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,800
Dot Excel
six is the one in dark excellence.

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,160
The second one.

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,680
So now if you guys are using Dog
Excel six,

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,800
which workbook
and which library you are pointing to?

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,920
If you are using Dog Excel as X workbook,
which library access F,

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,960
and if you're using dark excellence
extension,

48
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,440
then which one

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,000
are it at?

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,480
F right.

51
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,760
Not except it is
edge as F and X is separate.

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,480
These are the two libraries
you generally deal with, correct?

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,840
Yeah.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,200
When you are dealing with dark x and six
extension x

55
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,360
and fighting and dark
Excellence Excel file extension,

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,680
it's already here.

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,720
It's already here.

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,800
If you see right now,
I already put it in the

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,120
this is the new what extension.

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,040
Right. We already discussed this

61
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,760
and I can see this.

62
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,680
All right.

63
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Now to deal with the Excel file.

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,640
The function
we have written in that function,

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,720
are we relying on number of lines?

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,880
Are we the number of games

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,360
are be relying on number of values
or something

68
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:21,080
or my function will get every data.

69
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,720
I'm not relying on anything.

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,920
My function is a universal function.

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,880
It is not relying on the size of file,
on the size of data or on anything.

72
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,120
You just store
your values in your Excel file.

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,560
And my this function, my
this function will read all the data

74
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,360
from my Excel file and will provide
me who used in Java classes.

75
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,920
Correct.

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,240
So that's what we did in the last class.

77
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
And then we parsed we pass this data

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,640
from there from R method,
right from our test case.

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,960
And then we have read this data

80
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,120
when we have read this data,
we have used it to create new employee.

81
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,720
That's what we did in our previous class.

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:13,200
Is it correct?

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,560
Right?

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
Student Are you getting what I'm trying
to explain what we did.

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,120
It is just static get Right.

86
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,400
That's what we did in the last class.

87
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,480
Fine.

88
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,600
So now the task which I gave you, right,

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:37,080
Let me open.

90
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:58,200
Come on. Fine.

91
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,280
So what was their task?

92
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,840
When you go and when you try to add
some employ rate, let's say you're

93
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,720
trying to add any employee, but the first
name, they'd say, I'm writing

94
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,760
this and last name also

95
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,560
this.

96
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,840
And when I create any user name,
nobody is.

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
Nobody is going to do it. Now.

98
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,160
I will do it for you.

99
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,640
So let me create one user name.

100
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,720
So I'm saying user name is

101
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,840
now normally it was just a task
I gave you, Right?

102
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,240
Anyway, I'm going to cover this here.

103
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,440
I just told you. Right.

104
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,880
So it was not a profitable homework,

105
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,480
you can see, but it was just I just wanted
to check your coding ability.

106
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,280
That's the only thing.

107
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,800
We will do it.
We will do it now. Like the task.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,560
All right,
So now I am going to give the name.

109
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
Let's see

110
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,360
this one and password is

111
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:43,560
well, fine.

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,800
So now, if you guys see
what I'm going to do here is

113
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,640
when I click on same option,
When I click on same option,

114
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,120
can you see this employee? Right.

115
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,360
This employee increased engagement.

116
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Mike employee generated

117
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,120
I will captured this employ it
from personal details speech.

118
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,040
The fourth thing
let me add one employee right.

119
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
Which user name is not created already?

120
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
So let me take some user names

121
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,000
something and I know I'm going to use.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:39,640
So let's see, I'm going to write one.

123
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,720
So when I create this,

124
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,280
it should clear Now you do that right now
from this page.

125
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,000
From this page, what we will do,
we will capture this employee, right?

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This employee,
we will capture the first thing and then

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and then we will go onto this name option
once again, right from Pim.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,280
Option go to employee list.

129
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,520
In this employee list,

130
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,200
in this employee ID in this employee,

131
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
we will use the same employer ID,

132
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,280
which we have got from the right,
which we got from there. Why?

133
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,720
Because we need to capture the employee.

134
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,760
And then if I click on this search option,

135
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,720
see guys, I created an employee,

136
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,400
I captured that employee ID
which was generated here.

137
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,640
I copied it from runtime only.

138
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,280
Right.
I'm not passing anything in my script.

139
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,960
I mean, I'm not going to pass anything
in my script.

140
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,120
That employer I.D.

141
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,360
we captured, we put it here.

142
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,440
And when I click on Search option,
tell me how many pools it should written

143
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,480
against this employee ID it should return.

144
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,560
How many points? Just one.

145
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
Just one. Correct.

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,920
And and if you see here it is
getting it is giving me what employee

147
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,920
81st and middle name and last name

148
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,440
correct?

149
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,640
That is correct or not.

150
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,720
Now this data, what I can do basically is

151
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,160
I can get this data the first name
relevant, last name from where

152
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,640
we are already passing this first name,
middle name and last name in our script.

153
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,960
Right.

154
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,680
So when we are passing this data
in our script, what we can do is

155
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,080
we can get the data
from this particular row, right?

156
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,480
We can get the data
from this particular pool

157
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,920
after searching this, whatever
the data is available,

158
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,800
I will get this data from here
and then I will provide a solution.

159
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,920
I will put a solution that, hey,
from my Excel file,

160
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,200
the first name, middle name
and last name is this.

161
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,240
I am using this post
name with the name Last name

162
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,680
to create a new employee
against this employee.

163
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,520
And then when I'm searching,
when I'm searching with this name

164
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,560
employed, it should give me the same data
because it might happen

165
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,040
if there is a glitch in the software
that you are trying to add one employ.

166
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,240
But when you're adding the employee
right against one

167
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,080
employee ID,
it might give you some other user,

168
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,520
it might draw some exception,
it might draw some X, Y, or Z data.

169
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,400
Right?

170
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,840
So this is a clear verification
and validation, correct?

171
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,240
Correct. Correct.

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,160
So from Excel file,
you will get one entity

173
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,960
and the second entity we are taking from
here as a search, it isn't

174
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,880
got the concept.

175
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,680
What we are going to do now based

176
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,800
students, everyone got the concept.

177
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,240
What we are going to do. So.

178
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,520
So now let me go into our code.

179
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,080
Here we are, right?

180
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,320
So we want to tell this point

181
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,600
after clicking on Save button
right after clicking on Save button.

182
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,800
Now I'm going to change
just one thing in this code.

183
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,360
What one thing I'm going to do
is can somebody tell me

184
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,400
I have to get
I have to get the employer ID, right?

185
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,520
So if I go if I go on the page
right on this employee page,

186
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,560
where is my pages?

187
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,680
If I go in my own employee page
right here, here,

188
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,320
I can give one more thing
I can add one more thing.

189
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,320
Which will this
tell me the employee ID like employed

190
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,120
from the confirmation,
but it's not going to change.

191
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,680
You see here, that's what
I'm trying to explain when I try to add

192
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,720
employ by default
it is generating employee I.D..

193
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,760
Right?

194
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,120
Can you see on an employee page
only you are getting this employee.

195
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,880
Correct.

196
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,240
And this employee ID is not changing.

197
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,640
This is system generated employee.

198
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,920
So from here we can capture this data

199
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,360
and then and then on that page we will go

200
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,040
and we will search
after getting successful message

201
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,440
right.

202
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
Is getting my point.

203
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:31,640
Now tell me now, tell me one thing.

204
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:31,920
Yeah.

205
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,680
Sometimes you generate, but the actual
functionality of application stays right?

206
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,240
It should always generate
it should always create a unique employee.

207
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,200
Okay, so let me find it.

208
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,240
Can you guys didn't notice
the look that I can find from you?

209
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,880
Can somebody tell me what is the location?
I can buy it from you

210
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,240
I.t. But I have name as well.

211
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,400
I have value as well.

212
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,280
I have ideas.

213
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,480
Okay, you're seeing it.

214
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,600
So let me take it point

215
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,800
on which I should have based.

216
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,240
I should ID on which page

217
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,000
and employee page dashboard page
log in page

218
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,480
an employee page click.

219
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,920
Let me go ahead and do it.

220
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,520
So I'm going to see an employee page here.

221
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,120
This is the I am writing the element
and then I'm writing

222
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
employee

223
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,720
Correct.

224
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,280
Now, now, see,

225
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,760
now when I'm coming here on my test,
write on my test.

226
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,840
First,
let me check whether I'm able to access

227
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,240
this data in this page or not,
whether I am able to get this I.D.

228
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,560
here or not.

229
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,920
So to do this
right to do this, I'm going to write here

230
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,720
on my an

231
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:16,360
employed page, don't employ 80.

232
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm getting I'm about to get this employee
correct.

233
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,160
Fine.

234
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,240
Now I want to store
I want to store this employee 88.

235
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,880
So let me create one variable.

236
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,520
So I'm going to write this string, right?

237
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,960
That is what we need.

238
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,080
What we need
from this particular location,

239
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,480
from this particular location,
we need what

240
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
next?

241
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,920
What can you see here?

242
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,520
I have one more thing.

243
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,000
I have one more thing here.

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:58,520
Can I take the value also?

245
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes, because if you remember
the attribute, right,

246
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,680
if you notice color coding part,
if you know the color coding.

247
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,760
But what does it brown color indicates?

248
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,760
What it indicates is brown color.

249
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,040
Is it attribute?

250
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,000
Is it tag?

251
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,920
Is it value?

252
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,000
Is it
what is what it is attribute? Correct.

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
The brown color.

254
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,000
So now when I can clearly see
that my employ ID is in numbers,

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,520
but it is available
as a value of one attribute.

256
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,360
So is there any method in selenium
which I can use

257
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,400
to get the attribute
of a particular element?

258
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,120
Do we have any method in selenium?

259
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,720
Right,
we have one don't get attribute y value.

260
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,480
Right.
So let me right here. Let me right here

261
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,720
employee I.D.

262
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,520
value I'm going to get
y are employed 80 dot

263
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
good attributes.

264
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,120
So what attribute I'm going to pass based

265
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,520
it is value correct.

266
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,880
So now from this line let me right here
let me right one

267
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,240
comment also, Mike, how many days

268
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,480
capturing

269
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,920
employee 80 from system right.

270
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,000
We are capturing it from system
only right.

271
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,040
We are not going to ID anything manually.

272
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,800
Fine.

273
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,520
Now after clicking on same button
after clicking one state

274
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,600
button dates again,
I have to go on to the option first.

275
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,960
Right. I have duplicate option.

276
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,080
Then I have to go where I have to go on
employee list page.

277
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,240
Right. Let me show you from team option.

278
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,880
I have to click this time
I have to click on employee list page

279
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,520
when I come in inside
employee list page right here.

280
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,920
I'm going to search this i.t. Addict

281
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,760
guys, is this correct or not?

282
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,560
So now tell me one thing.

283
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,440
This team option,
this employee list option are available

284
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,960
on which page

285
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,200
it is on dashboard page.

286
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,760
No, it is not on any employee pages here.

287
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,880
This right
this option and this employee list

288
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,320
option is available on dashboard
page only.

289
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,960
Yeah, that's that's completely fine.

290
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
We are learning. So it is fine. Right.

291
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,840
So now let me go ahead on dashboard
page and see, do I have the option here?

292
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,240
Yes, I have team option.

293
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,560
Do I have this option

294
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,800
and employee list option?

295
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,880
No, I do not have.

296
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
So I have to identify this right

297
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,960
employee list.

298
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,360
I'm getting this I.D.

299
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,440
from here right.

300
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,280
Let me copy this away from you
and I will go on dashboard page

301
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,520
here.

302
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,480
I will add this employee list
option here also.

303
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,360
So I'm going to write as

304
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:31,600
this part is ID fine.

305
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
So it is

306
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,640
employee

307
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,280
list option, correct.

308
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,360
So reduce.

309
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,480
Is everyone following me?

310
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:57,080
Everyone.

311
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
All right,

312
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,840
so now now
let me go on to an employee page.

313
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,240
All right.

314
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,760
Like I said, after clicking on after

315
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,480
clicking on same button,
right to enter the employee I.D.

316
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,840
first, what we have to do,
we have to navigate to

317
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,880
employee list page.

318
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,960
Correct.

319
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,240
And to do that to do that,
what I have to do

320
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,240
first, I have to click on where

321
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,680
again on

322
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,760
on the list

323
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,840
dashboard page start theme

324
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,360
option first, not Dashboard dashboard.

325
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,560
Right.

326
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,480
We have to click on Team Option Direct.

327
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:43,880
Well,

328
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,000
the first thing is
I have to click on team option

329
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,120
and then I have to
click on from dashboard page

330
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,080
employee list option.

331
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,640
This time right there
I was clicking on an employee button.

332
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,480
Now I'm clicking on employee list option
because my flow is different

333
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,360
after going on to this particular page,
after going on to this particular page,

334
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,960
I have to find another locator

335
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,040
that is I have to find another locators
on this page.

336
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,120
Employee list,
which tells me how many locators

337
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:34,560
I have to find from this page based.

338
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,560
The first is i.t Eugene.

339
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,680
Second is search option.

340
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,600
Also a correct

341
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,600
search option also.

342
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,320
And then the third one is the result
which I'm getting.

343
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
Yes. So let me go ahead and do it first.

344
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,880
I'm going to search it.

345
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,680
So it says search I.D..

346
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,440
Fine.

347
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,800
Tell me to do
I need to create new page one

348
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,560
employee list on what?

349
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:13,080
Okay,
so I'm going to create a new class called

350
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,720
employee List page.

351
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,520
Correct.

352
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,680
And then I'm going to excuse my

353
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,520
common methods. Now,

354
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,160
one by one, all the locators I will find,

355
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,720
but let me copy one from here first

356
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,760
so that I can use it as this index here.

357
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,400
This is my index.

358
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,240
So I'm going to write ID

359
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,640
employee first. Me.

360
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,480
Second
thing is for certain, written right?

361
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,720
So it is my search window.

362
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,840
Let me click here search option.

363
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,240
It gives me it again.

364
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,800
Let me take this ideal

365
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,360
correct

366
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,280
that is

367
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,200
Now why writing this specifically here,

368
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,640
tell me,
why do we need to write this three note

369
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,720
in the initialization of elements

370
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,960
to initialize
all the elements of this page

371
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
according to page object model design
by then

372
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,640
correct?

373
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,480
Is it correct? Grace

374
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,840
Now, now, let me ask you one thing

375
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,280
I'm seeing.

376
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,960
Let's consider a scenario

377
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,640
like a test, like a Q with correct.

378
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,960
You have entered this employee, right?

379
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,840
You have entered this employee now.

380
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,960
Now you are clearly
you're searching this data as a Q

381
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,960
If you have if you're thinking, yeah,
that's fine, you can do that also.

382
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,840
Now you see when I'm getting this data
while entering the I.D.,

383
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,960
it might be possible
that the same employee ID

384
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,640
can generate multiple data
if there is a glitch in the system.

385
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,720
Is it possible or not?

386
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,760
As a Q
when thinking of all the scenarios right

387
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,120
now. Now,

388
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,480
if I'm going to take if I'm going to take
just one rule, just one

389
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,600
or just one particular element, is it
just define my entire search criteria.

390
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,400
Tell me

391
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,520
that is getting my point.

392
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,640
What I'm trying to explain,

393
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,920
any one, any one field, for example,
this one or this or this.

394
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,680
But if I'm picking just one field
right after searching, is it

395
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,280
justify my entire criteria? No.

396
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,120
Right.

397
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,640
Maybe I can have two rows,
I can get three rows, I can enforce rules.

398
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,840
I can have five rules. Correct.

399
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,560
So I have to find this locator
in such a way that

400
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:58,280
even if there are multiple rows available,
my function should be able to identify

401
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,400
this, should be able to identify the data
from all the rules.

402
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,840
So if there is a glitch in the system,
my function will be able to verify that

403
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,920
before
getting my point, getting my points.

404
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,120
So let's try to identify

405
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,160
this locator first for this complete rule.

406
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,920
Let me check

407
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,520
when we are going

408
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:35,880
inside this fine.

409
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,160
Open it

410
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,600
again.

411
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,680
Opening

412
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,600
it is giving me this idea table, right?

413
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
This is the result table.

414
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,440
And from here, if I see right,
this is the body I'm getting.

415
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,720
This is the body body of duty.

416
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,040
But now here I'm getting draws.

417
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,200
Can you see this?

418
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,600
This is the row I'm getting.

419
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
That is.

420
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,560
This is the result table, right?

421
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,000
All the results are capturing here
inside this body.

422
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,760
Remember this drink duty.

423
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,000
How many of you guys
are aware of the duty?

424
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,960
Whenever
we try to get the locators of any table,

425
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,360
we use the odd instance law

426
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,840
that is dear state
the rules that actually got it right.

427
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,840
So this is what we are trying to do

428
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,080
with.

429
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,240
Might be we can have multiple beers, but
you see inside one row, inside one beer.

430
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,880
Can you see
multiple columns here? Can you see this

431
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,200
multiple data available?

432
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,040
Right. So do I need to take this?

433
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,280
No, I need to take this out only

434
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,440
so when I get this tier, it will give me
the complete data of all the rules.

435
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,240
All right, let's go ahead and search it.

436
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,560
So I'm going to write double slash start.

437
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,240
Tell me, guys, if I'm doing
something wrong or something correct.

438
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,000
I don't know how to find the data,
how to find the locators.

439
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,800
You guys knows better than me

440
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,760
inside this.

441
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,400
When I'm coming

442
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,720
slash, it says

443
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,400
where we were.

444
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,800
Body rate, right, Body and inside body.

445
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,280
We are getting clear. Is it correct?

446
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,720
One of what I'm getting right now is

447
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,240
just wonderful.

448
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,360
If there are multiple rules,
then what would happen

449
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,720
is if there are multiple rows,
then what would happen with this part?

450
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
With this locator?

451
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,640
We will get
will we get just in just a unique element

452
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,800
or we will get multiple elements for the.

453
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,520
Yes, correct. Correct.

454
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,240
Then it will identify the data
for all the rules.

455
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,720
Right.

456
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,760
So right now it is unique.

457
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,960
I'm getting my data.

458
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,120
It means my system is working fine or not

459
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,360
my system is working fine or not.

460
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,040
This working fine.

461
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,680
Let me go ahead.

462
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,800
But this is what we are
verifying right now manually.

463
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,480
Let's go ahead and do it. Wow. Automation.

464
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,720
So I'm going to write a list. Why?

465
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,800
I'm putting it into the list.

466
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,800
You guys tell me where many, many.

467
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,320
I'm seeing raw data, right?

468
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,000
Data from this particular rule.

469
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,080
So I'm saying try to find any make

470
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,600
by dot element.

471
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,680
Sorry, because I'm getting multiple data
from this particular portion.

472
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,720
Guys, how many of you guys got this
concept?

473
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,160
Why? I put it inside the list.

474
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,760
Tell me.

475
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,520
Mm hmm.

476
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,040
Correct.

477
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,680
See, you guys know Java better than me.

478
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,400
Fine.

479
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,200
Now. Now,
you know, through the data, right?

480
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:36,200
To get the data of this particular rule,
which I have to use,

481
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,480
while you should invite.

482
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,960
Look,
we have just one condition right here.

483
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,640
We have to pass the statement.

484
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,200
We have to pass the logic,

485
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,560
and then we have to pass a logic

486
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,040
we have to use for loop
because iteration requires.

487
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,800
Right.

488
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,200
So I'm going to write here in

489
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,560
I'm going to write in digit
I is equals to C2,

490
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,080
and then I is less than my raw data dart
sized builder time.

491
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,440
I am getting rules. Put it inside this.

492
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,680
Yes we can.

493
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,280
But right now

494
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,280
we don't need to because we are just
going to take the text from the array

495
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,480
and then I plus plus

496
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,080
ideally, guys, listen,
one more thing, right?

497
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,040
You have to send this locator here
first, right on this page,

498
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,760
particular page employee list.

499
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,040
And from there you have to call this.

500
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Okay, guys, this locator idea
you should put there.

501
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,600
Remember this point,

502
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,440
I'm just putting it right now
because we are creating the logic

503
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,200
and then we will switch on
to the next part.

504
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,640
So I'm leaving it on you guys.

505
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,440
Now. The next thing is post.

506
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,800
I have to check
whether I'm inside the loop or not.

507
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,520
So I am writing.

508
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,040
I am inside the new

509
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,360
gate values for

510
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,560
the newly

511
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,560
generated

512
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,440
employee connect.

513
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,960
This loop will give me the data

514
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,960
of the newly
generated employee from the system.

515
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,360
All right, so I'm going to say
whatever that text is available

516
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,440
in this role,
I'm going to store it somewhere.

517
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,080
So guys, tell me, can I use it
a string global to do this part?

518
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,320
Can I use a string or not?

519
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,200
Right. So I will write here
My road8 are dark.

520
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,480
The gate of I.

521
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,840
It means index y is one by one.

522
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm going dark.

523
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,120
Whatever the data you are getting,
just give it to me here.

524
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,360
Now my data is available
involved in road text.

525
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,480
I have my data correct in draw text.

526
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,560
So let's bring this data first.

527
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,120
Right.

528
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,280
I'm simply
printing this for my checking rate.

529
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,920
It has nothing to do
with the verification part as of now.

530
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,600
Now, now after this. Because

531
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,480
when I'm searching right

532
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,200
here,
first we click on employee list option.

533
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,880
Fine. We're done, guys.

534
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,720
We must do something.

535
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,680
Tell me what we missed. You

536
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,160
guys.

537
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,160
Can you see we missed something?

538
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:39,800
Can anyone verify?

539
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,400
The first thing is
I need to search in the employee.

540
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,240
Right.

541
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,960
So to start in the employee,
I have to create.

542
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,040
I have to create the object.

543
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,760
So let me create
the object of my employing

544
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,560
list page

545
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,200
is equals to new

546
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,160
employee list.

547
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,200
Correct. Now here,

548
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,640
if my right employee list

549
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,040
dart i.t employee.

550
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,880
Now tell me guys here
if I'm going to pass this employee

551
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,360
this employee from where I have to pass.

552
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,840
Can you see in our system
only we have captured this employee.

553
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,240
We have captured this data here.

554
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,600
Employee added value.

555
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
Can you see it, guys? Only one.

556
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,840
So my best guest is everything, right?

557
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,880
So I'm going to pass this data from here.

558
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,960
Only I'm not passing anything
hardcoded right?

559
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,840
Everything
I'm taking from runtime and I'm passing.

560
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,760
And after this, when I click,
click on this page for software.

561
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,560
Correct.

562
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,960
After such work done after such were done,
I'm getting this data correct.

563
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,960
And now.

564
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,760
Now when I'm getting this data right, I'm

565
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,440
going to right here is my history.

566
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,440
So I'm seeing my

567
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,600
expected data first.

568
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,960
So what would be my expected data

569
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,920
for this employee?

570
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,280
The value I'm getting it from my own time.

571
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,800
This data and talking about this, I'm
trying to generate this sequence now.

572
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,160
This sequence,
can you see everyone, this sequence?

573
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,240
So first
I'm getting my embroidery value, plus

574
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm going to provide my 10 minutes

575
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,000
if I want to take my first name,
middle name, last name.

576
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,720
From there, I can take

577
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,440
guys from where I'm passing
my first name and last name.

578
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,280
No, no, no, no, no, no. Nobody is.

579
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,480
Nor we are getting this data.

580
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,560
No, no, no.

581
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,960
See, we are getting this data, raw data,
this road next

582
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,280
we are getting I'm
trying to provide this from my example.

583
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,960
This is for a solution. I'm
trying to get it right.

584
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,840
See this data?

585
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,840
I've already got it.

586
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,280
Yes. Employee information.

587
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,840
This data, whatever the data I got from
this rule, I already got this data here.

588
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,320
Can you see it?

589
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,600
Everyone?

590
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,840
We got this data here.

591
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,160
Now, I'm trying to create a generate.

592
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm trying to generate a pattern
the way I'm getting the data

593
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,240
in this raw text, like this
I'm going to generate the data from.

594
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,920
I'm passing this data.

595
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,320
I'm passing this data from my Excel file.

596
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,400
Right?

597
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,440
So just think about it.
Just think about it.

598
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,240
You got this employee a revenue
from your time by your put it here

599
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,320
then then you are going to get

600
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,760
this data from MAP employee dog gate.

601
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,320
What is the first thing you're getting?

602
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:55,080
You're getting first name correct.

603
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,200
Guys, I'm just I'm
just trying to make this structure,

604
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
that structure
we're are getting this data from

605
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,080
because we are going
to compare the raw data.

606
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,840
So we have to make one raw
also because here in the road next,

607
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,360
we are getting one complete
through my complete process post

608
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,960
employ 80, then force, then middle name
and then last name.

609
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,280
So here I'm creating this post employee,
then my first name.

610
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,840
Now after first name,
what is the next entity?

611
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,040
Tell me guys

612
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:35,920
like me.

613
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,320
Right?

614
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,240
It's mad employee Dark Gate.

615
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,960
I'm going to get my

616
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,840
middle name from here.

617
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,880
And after this, again,

618
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,720
one space.

619
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,240
And the last thing
which I'm going to get is map.

620
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,080
Don't get.

621
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,280
The last thing would be my

622
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,840
last name from here.

623
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,960
Right, guys?

624
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,640
So now if you see my raw text,
give me employee ID,

625
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,600
false name, maiden name, last name.

626
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,680
My expected
data will give me employee I.D.

627
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,200
first name, middle name and last name.

628
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,160
Correct.

629
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,080
These four things,
I'm creating the data in the form

630
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,680
which I am receiving from my application.

631
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,280
Now to me to compare to data.

632
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,040
Now I have more this data
to compare these two data,

633
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,880
what I have in testing,
to enter this data, what I have

634
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,680
a session.

635
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,360
All right,
I want to execute my complete code.

636
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,160
So let me put one assertion There is
what kind of assertion I should pass.

637
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,320
If I want to execute my compute code

638
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,720
of is map

639
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,040
that is map twisting.

640
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,240
Map in is map.

641
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,520
This is the data
we are getting from Excel right?

642
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,680
See the same data we got here also?

643
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,200
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

644
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,920
This is the data we are getting from it.

645
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,600
Simply remember the function
we have written in the last class.

646
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:29,120
So from there, if I'm trying to get
the data from my Excel file,

647
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,680
the data which I'm passing right,
I have to use my that particular function.

648
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,840
So to do that function,
I have to store this

649
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,560
data.

650
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,200
This is this is the
these are the three details.

651
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,640
Right.

652
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,240
I have parsed from my excel file.

653
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,600
No, no, no.

654
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,480
I'm not going anywhere now
because I'm done with the code.

655
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,720
So now I'm going to explain everything.
Nobody.

656
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,520
Now I'm giving
you time to write everything.

657
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,720
So here, here,
if you see this is the expected data

658
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,160
we are hiding
why we are making these expected data.

659
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:12,640
Because in the same format,
in the same structure,

660
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,440
we are receiving
the data from application,

661
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,320
right?

662
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,600
We are receiving the data from application
in which for user username

663
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,080
first employ 80,
then first name, then middle name.

664
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,120
Then lastly,
if I'm getting this data in one row,

665
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,360
this RAW is returning me
the same data, right?

666
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,520
Yeah, just a moment.

667
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,240
So when this role is returning me,
this data, I have to create my data.

668
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,680
So in the same for me.

669
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,440
So this for me is giving me the same data.

670
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,720
This employee and first name, middle name,

671
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,360
and then lastly, right?

672
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,400
So that's how I have created this.

673
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,280
My expected data.

674
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,520
There you will

675
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,720
really add a whole new part of code,
right?

676
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,880
I'm just explaining that could only guys

677
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,480
everyone done with this employee list,
which is everyone done with this which

678
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
Andre

679
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,360
kind of

680
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,360
Now let me come here
See this is the code we have written.

681
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,560
This is the only code
we have written, right?

682
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,200
So what we are doing
after adding the employee again,

683
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,720
we are going on to employee list page.

684
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,320
I am clicking and entering the employee ID

685
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,800
which I took from the code
only from the system only.

686
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,000
And I'm searching for the employee
when I'm searching for the employee,

687
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,800
it is returning me
unique element in a row.

688
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,640
So when it is returning me in a row
here, right, I'm

689
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,000
getting it into the raw data
in this particular element.

690
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,080
When I got this data,

691
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,920
I'm trying to get every data one by one,
one by one, one by one.

692
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,560
So inside the loop I am putting
if my raw size is more than one,

693
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,880
it will go and capture all the data
and then it will give me invisible text.

694
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,440
So what I'm saying, hey, raw data, go.

695
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,280
If I is equal to zero, it means false
to get the text of this particular raw

696
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,640
submit here. Right.

697
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,760
And then I'm going to bring this data
here.

698
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,160
Correct? That is correct.

699
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,080
So when I'm going to print this data,

700
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,560
this raw text, when I'm going to print
it will print what?

701
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,640
It will print it is this first name,

702
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,200
this middle name, this last name.

703
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,920
This is the data and it will print correct

704
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,240
if you'll see there is no other data
available. Right.

705
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,720
So first name, last name, middle.

706
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,600
FYI, I got this data from raw text.

707
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,880
I got this for me. Great.

708
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,960
As you can see,
it is returning me Employee false name.

709
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,520
It says false name and middle name.

710
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,120
Both of them middle names, this last name.

711
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,520
Now, if I want to verify this data,
it is my responsibility

712
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,640
to create another string which will retain
the same structure of data.

713
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,400
Right.

714
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,120
So the same structure of data
since most employee fine.

715
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,440
Do I have any function?

716
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,240
Do I have any facility in my best
guess that can give me the employee idea

717
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,760
and remain so for every employee,
which we are generating?

718
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
Right. Right.

719
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,840
After generating that employee,
I will search the same employee last name,

720
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,840
employee value at the same time.

721
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,880
You'll see at the same time in
this iteration is still I am in radius

722
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,360
and this by loop
still we are working right.

723
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,560
We are adding the data at the same time
updating the data.

724
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,280
We are verifying the data also. Right?

725
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,760
So my employee
I am taking from brand name,

726
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,640
I am putting this posting
from my Excel file by

727
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,600
because this is the same data which
I've just passed to add the employee.

728
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,640
So now for verification
of the employee, also

729
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,360
I'm using my same data, correct?

730
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,760
Similarly, I'm putting my middle name,
I am passing my last name.

731
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,840
So this expected
data string is returning me

732
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,720
the structure
which I'm getting from my application now.

733
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,560
Raw text expected data.

734
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:09,160
Both are giving me
the same kind of structure, not tell me.

735
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,720
All right.

736
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,040
Actually, we will do that.

737
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,560
Also in Cucumber also will be having
the functionality. So there

738
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,080
there we will do that tomorrow.

739
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,760
We are starting with that,
but I'll keep that in mind.

740
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,000
Guys understood this functionality so far.

741
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,080
The logic which we have written here,

742
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,440
everyone

743
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,200
so far, any question in this part, anyone

744
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,560
know what the problem is?

745
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,120
The problem is there are multiple things
in the framework, right?

746
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,800
And when you try to memorize the things,
you will not be able

747
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,000
to memorize everything.

748
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,760
But I didn't write even a single thing.

749
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,680
And after that, right,
I didn't write even a single word.

750
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,480
I'm just explaining.
So how can you submit I'm going to pass.

751
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:19,200
No, I didn't write anything.

752
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,560
I didn't change anything anyway,
that's what I'm saying.

753
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,800
Oh, okay. All right, fine.

754
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,240
So what we did basically is
we just added these two fields.

755
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,360
First thing, what we did is we added this
is employ 80 search button first thing.

756
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,480
Second thing is second
thing is on dashboard page.

757
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,360
We added this employee list option, right?

758
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,080
This employee list option
because we need to search the employee

759
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,120
and to search in the employee.

760
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,280
We have to go on employee list, but then

761
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,080
and then in an

762
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,680
employee test, we added this data.

763
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,040
We added this data because on

764
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,240
clicking after clicking on employee
list option, we will add this employ ID,

765
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,640
we will search, we will click on search
button and then we will capture the data.

766
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,200
After searching. All right.

767
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,520
So we are capturing the data
after searching.

768
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:24,200
I think.

769
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,760
Yes, Yes. That's what I'm seeing.

770
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,600
We are finding this employee adoption rate

771
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,080
that is also on this page,

772
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,680
an employee page here.

773
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,080
This one because there is logic.

774
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,560
The reason of adding this employee ID

775
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,520
locator is
we need to get this locator from runtime.

776
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:48,120
We need to get the data,
the value of this particular field

777
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,920
from runtime, Right,
Because this is system generated part.

778
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,680
Okay.

779
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,640
So we need to get the value
of this particular portion.

780
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,920
All right.

781
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,080
All right, guys.

782
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,960
Yes. Correction. Correct.

783
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,560
Correct.

784
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,640
Exactly.

785
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,600
I think this is the last part, right.

786
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,160
Which is hard.

787
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,200
And I'll put this to three
very easy topics and then we are done.

788
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,680
It's like that, guys.

789
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,280
Now, tell me, is there anyone
who didn't understand this part?

790
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,640
Is there anyone who didn't
understand this part?

791
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,280
Why are we doing this?

792
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,360
How are we writing code like this?

793
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,840
What this code will work?
How this code will work?

794
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:55,560
Is there any question like
this from anyone?

795
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,160
Students

796
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:27,680
graduate.

797
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,320
I've got to

798
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,200
employ list

799
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,320
here in the employee list page.

800
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:44,520
So the on dashboard page here,

801
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,800
Stephanie The moment I execute this code,
I will commit everything

802
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,240
in the repository.

803
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,040
You guys can simply take the pull
of my code

804
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,040
and every single thing
will be available in your machine.

805
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,920
Right after execution.

806
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,200
I will commit this code in between
the class.

807
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,200
Don't worry about the code.

808
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,680
Okay? Yeah.

809
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,960
Yeah, I will.

810
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,720
I will do that. It is in my mind.

811
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,160
Do worry about it.
I will do that for sure.

812
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,200
I'm just trying to explain because still
this assertion part is yet to be done.

813
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,520
Right.

814
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,280
If you'll see,
I didn't put any assertion part here,

815
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:23,720
so we have to add a section, but also.

816
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,720
All right.

817
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:32,400
So there is now, shall we proceed
further the solutions here?

818
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,880
Fine. Okay.

819
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,680
Now tell me, guys, why do we need to add
soft positions and not hard positions?

820
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:50,120
Where do we need words of soft position?

821
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,280
Exactly? Because we are adding.

822
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:52,920
We are adding.

823
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,120
How many employs one employ to employ
three employ maybe four or five employees.

824
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,200
Right.

825
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,880
And when we are adding multiple employs,
if we put high distortion

826
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,040
and if error comes in,
the first iteration will allow our

827
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,600
execution to proceed for that

828
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,360
hard decision.

829
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,440
Allow no right.

830
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,600
But I want to add for all the three
employees and indeed I need to report.

831
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,240
Right.

832
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,880
So which one is the better approach
going with how the solutions are going

833
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,600
with softer solutions?

834
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,440
Soft one. Correct.

835
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,520
So let's define softer solution,

836
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,200
right?

837
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,920
I'm going to write before the attrition.

838
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,880
I'm going to write here
where I've created all the objects, right?

839
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,600
So I'm going to write soft

840
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,480
assert

841
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,960
is equals to new

842
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,960
soft percent, correct?

843
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,880
Correct.

844
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,280
Student's

845
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,960
on this line.

846
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,880
On this line.

847
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,280
On this line.

848
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,240
I'm adding a soft position. Why?

849
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,240
Because I'm going to use this
soft assertion in my best guess.

850
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:11,960
Right?

851
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:17,840
So if someone is writing the code,
make sure we are this soft assertion by PR

852
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,400
to verify their data
for every single employee.

853
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,640
Right now, if I want to verify this for
every single employee, what I have to do,

854
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,760
I have to go in my best case here
and I have to write here

855
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,080
soft assert or dark assert, assert equals

856
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:42,040
so true.

857
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,600
Assert equals right.

858
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,240
And we are comparing what doing Page

859
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,880
two by two character long chart by what do

860
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,160
is string.

861
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,280
So let me write it strings. Okay.

862
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,880
Which one?

863
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,120
The first one draw data Root text

864
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,480
is what we are getting the raw text.

865
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,600
Shetty The raw data is the data
you are getting

866
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,880
and converting it into the text,
right? See

867
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,640
here you can you see it is

868
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,000
what every single row you are getting
and you are taking get extra method

869
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,600
and then you're putting it
your text, right?

870
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,960
So this is the final output
you are getting.

871
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,480
And then we are comparing
this raw text to home

872
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,640
based.

873
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,280
What is the second entity expected data?

874
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:30,800
Correct.

875
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,160
So let me write expected data.

876
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,760
Is it correct?

877
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,640
This is my for loop.

878
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,080
This is my iteration which I completed

879
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,760
and here after iteration here
I'm going to write.

880
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,600
Then media is to get collective report.

881
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,800
Who get the collective report which method

882
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,640
I have to use in soft position
as the last statement of my best guess.

883
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,680
So I'll start dark

884
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:11,840
aside on

885
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:24,920
is this correct?

886
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,200
Their data.

887
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:30,280
Their data,
which we have got is the actual data.

888
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,800
So the actual data is the raw text, right?

889
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,480
Yes. Outside the loop. Correct.

890
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:37,840
Because we got the collective.

891
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,680
We need to get the collective report
outside of the loop

892
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:48,720
right.

893
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,840
See, expecting it
actually means the one thing

894
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,240
the one thing you're expecting
from the application

895
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,280
to give you another thing,
you have something in your hand

896
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,520
right now when you compare
that this is what I'm expecting.

897
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,560
This is actually what I got
when this actual and expected

898
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,160
both are equals, then
I can see my verification and relation

899
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,000
check points are done
connect two entities.

900
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,360
You need the one entity you provide
another entity application provided.

901
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,280
Compare this to introduce
together. Got it.

902
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,200
This is what we call a solution.

903
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,320
What one type of solution?

904
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,040
Another solution is whether the field
is available there or not.

905
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,960
We call it a side
not assigned to true means.

906
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,240
We are checking the existence, whatever
we are seeing, if it is benign or not.

907
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,240
If it is denied, then a solution fine.

908
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,200
If it is not benign, a solution is passed.

909
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,960
If it is agreeing with our statement,
a solution is passed.

910
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,760
At the same time.

911
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,640
If it is giving me some value
and I'm expecting some value.

912
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,480
So this expecting value in actual value,
both are equal,

913
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,520
then we a solution is passed.

914
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,520
This is what we call assert equals.

915
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,560
Correct? Yes.

916
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,040
I did this full line in my code.

917
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,160
The first one is right
after starting the employee

918
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:12,720
got their data
and as the last statement I put aside all

919
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,480
that.

920
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:29,240
But now you got the concentration. If.

921
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:29,880
All right.

922
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,640
So now, guys, so far, everyone

923
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,520
clear?

924
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,360
Students Andre, Anna, Mike

925
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:49,800
Great.

926
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,280
Now what is the next thing
we have to do before proceed further?

927
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,080
What is the next thing we have to do

928
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,520
to update the data in Excel file?

929
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:04,880
Right.

930
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:28,800
This is what we have to do.

931
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,200
Okay,

932
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,000
let me check that.

933
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
The 19

934
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,560
guys, please don't use this data.

935
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,120
Okay? What data? I have changed.

936
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,840
Please don't use this data as of now.

937
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,240
Please. It's a request.

938
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:49,840
All right, let's try to run this code.

939
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,200
All right, Mike. Now you don't use it.

940
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,000
See, I'm just trying to execute this
data this time.

941
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,080
Now you'll see my system
performance is enhanced, right?

942
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:10,760
Everything is working smooth
because I got new system.

943
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,080
So the first thing is, guys, what?

944
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,600
The very first thing is to

945
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:21,240
add the employee, right now
after adding the employee

946
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,120
after hitting the employee,
maybe we have to provide some weight

947
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:39,880
because it is taking time.

948
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,160
It is searched with this particular I.D.

949
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,880
clicked on search option right,

950
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,120
right now see it give you this data right.

951
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,040
Then the second part.

952
00:58:53,040 --> 00:59:09,640
The second part.

953
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,560
Yeah, correct.

954
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,880
Of because so many people are executing.

955
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,160
That's why

956
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,560
might be

957
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,960
the issue is with the application
file size exceeded.

958
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,360
All right.

959
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,840
Maybe we are using the file size
but still see it is starting their data.

960
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,960
Right. It is starting the i.t.

961
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,920
It when there click on start option
and give you just one line of eight.

962
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:37,520
Again the third data,
even if the assertion failed,

963
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:41,400
that is fine, but still
we are able to get the data in the room.

964
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,400
We are able to generate this
data and I will show you the log

965
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,320
also where we are getting this.

966
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:50,880
That's why we put that line system
down, out and in and passing

967
00:59:51,120 --> 01:00:00,680
and printing the raw text
so that I can show you.

968
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,080
Fine.

969
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:02,760
No worries.

970
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,040
Let's see.

971
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,840
Can you see it is giving me this data.

972
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,320
You guys

973
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,720
see this is employee

974
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,560
first name, middle name, last name, right.

975
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,200
It says See all the assertions B

976
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,200
we parsed Anna surely Ricky

977
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,040
it says Anna Jack B were this system
got the data

978
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,720
from somebody explains the employee here
also see this I.D.

979
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,040
it says black Malia Olin
this is their data.

980
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,880
We passed the expected menu.

981
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,120
But what we found in terms of raw text,
we found this employed

982
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,080
if same John James Carter.

983
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,400
Right.

984
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,280
Similarly for the third one, also,
we send this data, but we got this data.

985
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,240
But but is this the logic correct
or not to verify the data

986
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,720
while getting the employee
ID at one time from the application?

987
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,360
I hope guys understood the logic.

988
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:10,200
The logic which I put.

989
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,560
Yeah, correct. Correct.

990
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,960
But how many of you guys
is still having any issue

991
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,960
when investigating
this particular piece of code?

992
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:42,400
Now ask me,

993
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,320
Jamal, is it clear?

994
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,720
Yeah. All right.

995
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:56,760
No, no, we cannot say this.

996
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,000
Anna Andre Olena Verdu.

997
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:09,960
Why you guys are so silent today.

998
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:14,000
All right, All right.

999
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,720
Million employee list page.

1000
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:21,120
Okay.

1001
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:21,880
All right.

1002
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:28,640
Correct. But

1003
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,520
I hope you guys are understanding, right?

1004
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,120
The logic.

1005
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,840
You're understanding
what you will get for sure.

1006
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,480
Code is not a problem

1007
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,680
almost matched

1008
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:48,360
operate.

1009
01:02:48,360 --> 01:03:01,200
Yes, I can see that numbers are missing.

1010
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,920
All right. Good. Correct.

1011
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:10,440
Got it.

1012
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,160
All right.

1013
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:15,960
So now,
now everyone is done with this part.

1014
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,480
Okay.

1015
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:24,800
Is everyone done this?

1016
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:31,960
Let me commit this content.

1017
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,440
10232021.

1018
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:59,000
This is the correct date.

1019
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,800
No, we are creating the new project
from scratch tomorrow.

1020
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,880
Don't worry, we will do that.

1021
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,480
We will going to create a new project.

1022
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,320
Don't worry about it.

1023
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,280
All right, guys.

1024
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,360
So code
has been pushed right into the repository.

1025
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,120
Now the new code is available
in the repository.

1026
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,400
Whatever the code we have written so far,

1027
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:22,080
so far, whatever the code we have
written, it's already available.

1028
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,720
Great and great.

1029
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,720
So now,
now the next important point is here.

1030
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,080
Now let's talk
about another important point.

1031
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,360
What is that?

1032
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:37,160
We are executing so many things right?

1033
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,200
But what is the proof
that we are executing this?

1034
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,920
What is the proof we have?

1035
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:46,040
What is the best way to get the artifact?

1036
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,760
What is the proof we have right now?

1037
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:50,400
All right.

1038
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,480
Where we have reports

1039
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,480
in our framework, do we have any report

1040
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:00,000
as of now?

1041
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,240
Right. So that's what I am saying.

1042
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:05,800
Mike, do we have any reports right now
in our framework?

1043
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,200
No. So very, very.

1044
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,480
That's what I am saying.

1045
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,920
Émilie will report FEMA report extent.

1046
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,000
They will report anything.

1047
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,680
We do not have anything correct.

1048
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,880
Because.

1049
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,000
Yeah, because we know already how to add
listeners.

1050
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:26,840
How many of you guys are still remember

1051
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,160
I tested this interfaces,
we implemented that listener.

1052
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,840
How many of you guys know that? Correct.

1053
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,400
Everyone
knows it because we already did it in.

1054
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,840
While when you are learning
testing as a tool,

1055
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:44,200
we have gone through that particular
concept of listener from test.

1056
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,680
And now let's go a step further

1057
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:51,280
along with the listener, right
along with the listener.

1058
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:56,160
I'm going to provide a screenshot as well.

1059
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,960
What is the need of screenshot? This

1060
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,040
now this time.

1061
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,280
This time when my listener provides
everything grade with the test me,

1062
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,320
whether it is parsed or their test name,
whether it is B

1063
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:25,840
grade, because now
you are getting the updated data.

1064
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,560
So it is saying it will be overwrite

1065
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,840
your data so fine because you might
have changed something in your data.

1066
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,360
Right.

1067
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:34,400
And when you take the pull, it will take
the updated quote from the system.

1068
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,280
So yeah, that is fine.

1069
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:36,840
All right.

1070
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,080
So now

1071
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,120
as an artifact
to show trade, as an artifact to show,

1072
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,800
if my best guess is passed,
at which place it passed,

1073
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,560
when my best guess is based on
which point it failed.

1074
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:50,920
Right?

1075
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,080
These are the things these are the things

1076
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,720
we need to implement in our project.

1077
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:02,480
I want to show every single thing
in a sequence in an organized manner.

1078
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:03,320
Right.

1079
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:08,520
So similarly, I'm going to provide
one place in my framework

1080
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,080
where I will keep all of my screenshots
this getting my point.

1081
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,200
What I would say to my listener.

1082
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,920
Hey, listener, go ahead.

1083
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,560
If my best guess is parsed,
give me the best to me.

1084
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,800
Along with the test name,
take the screenshot

1085
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,880
after taking the screenshot
of the story, take one piece.

1086
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,520
Getting my point

1087
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,840
is getting the concept.

1088
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,320
We know already
what the listener does inside this.

1089
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,520
Thus we are seeing the screenshot
also whether test gives his boss

1090
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,120
or my best guess is well,
you have to take the screenshot

1091
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,480
and then you have to store it
at one place.

1092
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,320
Correct.

1093
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,360
To do this.

1094
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:53,400
To do this,
what I have to do is force thing.

1095
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,840
I have to write one function
to take this screenshot.

1096
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,800
Correct? Correct.

1097
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,360
I have to write one function
to take the screenshot,

1098
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,640
which will take this screenshot
for all the all the best guesses.

1099
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:08,080
Right.

1100
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,280
So tell me if I need something
which I would be utilizing

1101
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,160
throughout my project,
throughout my test cases.

1102
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,160
If there is a need of a function
like this, where should I

1103
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,640
read that kind of function?

1104
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,160
Well-tolerated function based

1105
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,640
students

1106
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,440
in common methods.

1107
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:33,880
Right?

1108
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,720
So let me open my common methods.

1109
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,320
Right.

1110
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,400
All right. We have so many methods.

1111
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,200
Let's write another one here

1112
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,400
then we guys, What might this method be?

1113
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,760
Static or not?

1114
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,120
Let me take the name of Take

1115
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,720
screenshot.

1116
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:07,040
Right, guys.

1117
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,200
So I'm seeing I'm seeing in my screenshot

1118
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,400
right

1119
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,480
guys, tell me when you are learning
this dominion,

1120
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:24,240
right when you are learning this selenium.

1121
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,160
Yeah. Correct.

1122
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,280
What is the method
of taking the screenshot?

1123
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,080
So the method is t is is equal to

1124
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,680
y is. I am not using new keyword.

1125
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,520
Tell me

1126
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:42,120
why we are not using new keyword.

1127
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,040
It's interface. Correct.

1128
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,040
And to use the interface
we cannot create the object.

1129
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,440
So I'm going to write here.

1130
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,080
Fine.

1131
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,640
Because I need this by the source file.

1132
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,640
Right? Why?

1133
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,360
Because I want to store it.

1134
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,760
So I am saying take a screenshot dot. Get

1135
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,120
get a screenshot as

1136
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,560
as I'm going to take is output

1137
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,480
type dart

1138
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,120
file.

1139
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,000
I will tell you write this code.

1140
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,560
Let me imported first.

1141
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,040
Now tell me is this two line says

1142
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,200
take the screenshot first.

1143
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:27,960
When you take the screenshot,
what kind of file you need, whether it is

1144
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,800
a pdf file, right or it is jpg

1145
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,080
file or it is jpg file
or it is something else.

1146
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:35,520
Right?

1147
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:43,680
So you need to define the file papers
or not.

1148
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,360
Right.

1149
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,080
I hope you are understanding this code.

1150
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:52,440
The code what I've written so far.

1151
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:57,320
Okay, let's proceed further
then I'm going to write file

1152
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:01,320
your case indicates
why I'm going to write file.

1153
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,800
What is the reason?

1154
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:14,880
File Utilities value
this dummy is you are already is.

1155
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,320
You have already done this part
right in your selenium.

1156
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,040
Why do we need to write this file

1157
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,840
and then dart copy fight.

1158
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,240
What is the reason to write this?
Come on. Yeah.

1159
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:42,160
No copy, Firebird.

1160
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,360
All right.

1161
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,040
Yes. Correct. Correct.

1162
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,120
To storage at one particular point.

1163
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:51,200
So let me write source file. Right.

1164
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:57,240
I'm going to put it a new place
to my new file would be would be.

1165
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,880
Now I have to Define the place

1166
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,960
now tell me whatever the screenshot,

1167
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:07,560
whatever the screenshot I'm going to take,
I need to define it.

1168
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,000
One particular place.

1169
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,520
So my place would be final or not.

1170
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:16,440
My place would be constant throughout
my project, throughout my framework.

1171
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,760
Whatever the test gives this
I'm going to execute, whatever the results

1172
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,160
I'm going to get, I will keep
all the screenshots at one place,

1173
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,720
not using it, not depending.

1174
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,160
It's my framework, right?

1175
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,840
So it's your framework.

1176
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,720
So you are going to decide, right,
whether it will be at one place

1177
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:35,960
or multiple place.

1178
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,680
But when we talk about framework,
it gives us an organized structure.

1179
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,000
So what organized structure says,

1180
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,200
it says you need to keep
all of your screenshot at one place.

1181
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,000
Correct.

1182
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,320
So now what we are going to do
is we are going

1183
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,640
to define that one particular place.

1184
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,480
Yeah, that is another point
we going to discuss there.

1185
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,640
Don't worry about it.

1186
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,920
We will discuss the other solution
for that also.

1187
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:06,800
So now to define
such parts, to define such parts right.

1188
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,320
Tell me which class we're

1189
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,480
in. Constants.

1190
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,880
So let's say I want to create one folder
here, right?

1191
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,160
I'm going to create another directory
because I want to stored it

1192
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:33,160
at one particular place in my project,
all of my screenshot.

1193
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,480
So to define all of this, a screenshot at
one place I need to define one directory.

1194
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,480
Right.

1195
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,760
So let's create a one directory call

1196
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,400
the screen shots.

1197
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,240
Correct.

1198
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,240
This is in my project or not. There is.

1199
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,720
Is this in my framework or not?

1200
01:13:51,720 --> 01:14:00,880
This is screenshot solution.

1201
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,000
It is now.

1202
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,600
If I go in my constant right let me right
another point here.

1203
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,040
I'm saying

1204
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,720
public static final

1205
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,000
I'd say stream and then

1206
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:25,320
screenshot, right?

1207
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,600
Correct.

1208
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:30,520
Because because it is already

1209
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,960
in my project
so system dot great property returns me.

1210
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,560
What is this?

1211
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,440
The standard gauge
property returns me. What

1212
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,560
because
all the values which are final right?

1213
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,160
We already discussed this point
earlier. Right?

1214
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,280
This is your part, right?

1215
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,120
So these are the values
which are already fine.

1216
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:57,960
And you kept them.

1217
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,520
You kept them in capital C Now tell me,
why is this system not good?

1218
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,000
Property returns me.
What my project. Right?

1219
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Where is my current project?

1220
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,760
The path of my current project.

1221
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,440
So now inside of my current project,
inside my current project,

1222
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,240
I have folder.

1223
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:25,480
Do I need to go inside this RC y?

1224
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:27,760
Correct.

1225
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,280
I have to write it as

1226
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,800
screenshots.

1227
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,400
Right.

1228
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,400
Why this slash?

1229
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,560
Because in screenshots
I'm going to define everything.

1230
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:38,320
Right?

1231
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,880
So it will be in this screenshot
of the example being this slash.

1232
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,640
Correct.

1233
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,840
Let's go ahead.

1234
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:49,880
Yeah, let's
go ahead and use this screenshot file.

1235
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,680
But in our methods. Now

1236
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,760
back to the discussion.

1237
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:59,840
Again, we were using this new file
to define the file, but now

1238
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,400
from where I can get this file. But

1239
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,000
constants DART,

1240
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,120
it gives me a screenshot file, but connect

1241
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,600
can aggregate

1242
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:22,360
of it.

1243
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:26,240
Now I'm going to say
I'm going to say right.

1244
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,000
That saved my finally write my final name.

1245
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,480
So what would be my file name? Tell me

1246
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,440
what would be my file Name it with my find

1247
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:40,320
it would be different every time or not

1248
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,920
nice if I don't give my file name unique.

1249
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,200
If I don't give my file
name unique. Right.

1250
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:52,320
What would happen?

1251
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,440
It will overwrite, right?

1252
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,000
It will. All right. Correct.

1253
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,360
So let me boss one parameter here
called string.

1254
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,360
Finally correct.

1255
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,080
This parameter.

1256
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,560
This parameter will give me all the times
my file name as unique.

1257
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,680
How did I originally

1258
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:13,400
write

1259
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:17,400
plus plus

1260
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,160
dark Be in

1261
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,560
my file name plus start paginated.

1262
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,200
So I'm going to provide s
dorky and g point.

1263
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,360
Is it correct?

1264
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,720
Is it correct?

1265
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,440
It is giving me one at us.

1266
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,400
Why strike it exception?

1267
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:39,840
Fine.

1268
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,240
So let me write Inside Bycatch BLOCK.

1269
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:44,440
So here

1270
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,480
I'm going to catch one exception

1271
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,480
flying E

1272
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,520
and it says Here

1273
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,320
E brings to class

1274
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,480
this one.

1275
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,760
This one, I'll tell you this.

1276
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,320
Yes, yes, I'll tell you this.

1277
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,600
I tell you just just just a moment.

1278
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,880
I will this.

1279
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,400
No, now I need
I need one of facility here.

1280
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,080
Right? I need one facility here.

1281
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,160
That's why I kept it intentionally.

1282
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,760
The next point is related to this part.

1283
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:26,160
Yeah, we are doing this.

1284
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,640
We didn't get any file name Oxana so far.

1285
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,520
We didn't get any.

1286
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,520
Finally. Now tell me De is

1287
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:35,560
what you think.

1288
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,800
Let's say you are going to validate
for test cases

1289
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,000
five test cases then best guess is it
one time, right?

1290
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,600
If you're executing
ten test cases at one time,

1291
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,840
how many you screenshot
your system will take

1292
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,080
in one execution.

1293
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,240
If your exec, for example,
let's take a very common scenario right

1294
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:05,880
in your logic test.

1295
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:11,800
If you see here you are providing this
data validation rate, error validation.

1296
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:20,160
How many iterations are there?

1297
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,200
Andrey?

1298
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,680
How many times
my this test has been executed

1299
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,080
four times

1300
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:34,240
now when I'm seeing big defined
name rate of my screenshot, take the fine

1301
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:38,040
name of it for the screenshots
would be having

1302
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:44,320
the same name or not.

1303
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,600
So do we need do we need something?

1304
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:51,040
Do we need something that can define
my everybody

1305
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,480
screenshot name as a different one
as the unique one.

1306
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,480
Right.
We need something like this or not me

1307
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:03,920
right now.

1308
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,240
Now things are making sense.

1309
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:29,520
What I'm trying to explain now
things are making sense.

1310
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:34,320
All right, now see, now
see what we are going to do here.

1311
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,240
There is a function trait
that is a function

1312
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,560
of taking current date and time in Java.

1313
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,760
That is a function of taking correct
to date in time in Java.

1314
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,760
All right.

1315
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,280
If you execute that function,
it returns current day.

1316
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:56,280
It means current year,
current month, current day,

1317
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:00,320
current hours, current minute
current seconds, current milliseconds.

1318
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,120
Now, now, tell me one thing.

1319
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:07,080
If I'm going to execute four times
single test case,

1320
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,680
are these disk is going to execute it
same time or different times,

1321
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:16,800
even if there is a difference
of milliseconds in the execution time.

1322
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:17,960
Right.

1323
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,720
Cannot gone by const IGA.

1324
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:22,960
Is it possible that I saved my function?

1325
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,040
They take back the screenshot

1326
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:29,680
when it executed
the exact time included in the fine name.

1327
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,200
Can I say this or not?

1328
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:38,320
Create a fine name
in such a way that it executes, let's say

1329
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:43,040
it, 23rd of October 2021 857

1330
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,560
8 hours, 57 minutes, 21 seconds.

1331
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,920
The second execution, 8 hours,

1332
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,440
58 minutes, 23 seconds.

1333
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,040
Then the third one 8 hours, 58
minutes, 25 seconds.

1334
01:21:56,200 --> 01:22:01,520
It means for every execution, right.

1335
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,000
And for every execution,

1336
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,080
it will give us a different screenshot
with different name.

1337
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,080
Unique screenshots we can pick or not.

1338
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,520
Tell me is it possible or not?

1339
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,000
Yes, correct. Seconds.

1340
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,200
Only seconds.

1341
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,000
Let let me show you how
we can do that. See?

1342
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,920
So another function I'm to write.

1343
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,600
It is public

1344
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,840
static.

1345
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,320
This function will return me.

1346
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,480
Want to get timestamp right?

1347
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,840
I'm going to return timestamp from here.

1348
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:32,880
Right.

1349
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,040
And the pattern. The pattern
which I will pass.

1350
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:40,240
I will tell you this pattern is you need
you need your time in which pattern

1351
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,440
you need your time in which python.

1352
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,640
You will pass this python from here.

1353
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:49,240
Once I implement
it will give you so much sense.

1354
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:53,440
It makes so much sense
or date I'm going to write is equals to

1355
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:58,880
new date.

1356
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,120
See it says Java u till date. Correct.

1357
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,360
So from Java you are taking it. And then.

1358
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:09,120
And then I'm going to formatted it
when I'm returning.

1359
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,000
When I'm getting this date, I'm
going to for my day.

1360
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,360
Remember, I'm going to write here to

1361
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:21,080
for make that date
according to our choice.

1362
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:27,000
According to our choice,
we have a function which function we have

1363
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,080
and even know which function we have.

1364
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,040
We have here simple bit forming

1365
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,360
SDF is equals to new

1366
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,120
simple date.

1367
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:45,240
What is the format that you're
passing it a paper fine.

1368
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,040
So it returns.

1369
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,480
This function will return your SDF dart

1370
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,960
format big.

1371
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,560
Now see now see what I'm going to say
here.

1372
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,200
This three liner function.

1373
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,520
What will it do?

1374
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,000
You will pass one python for example.

1375
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,400
You are passing the python here.

1376
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,080
See here

1377
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,400
month date

1378
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,960
our minute segments

1379
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,520
Milicic is correct.

1380
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,400
Let's add
this is the pattern you're passing.

1381
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,840
Let's say this is your python.

1382
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,720
So once you get after getting the date
what this pattern

1383
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:36,880
does, this template format
will change your date in this format.

1384
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,960
It will change your date

1385
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:43,840
in this particular format and it returns
this date in this particular form.

1386
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,000
Correct.

1387
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,680
So now, now, after when I'm

1388
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,480
going to save the break,
when I'm going to save my screenshot,

1389
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:56,360
when I'm going to save my screenshot here
after finally what I'm saying is see

1390
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:00,280
here, I'm seeing

1391
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,080
my file name.

1392
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,520
You're taking take it. No worries.

1393
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,840
After this.

1394
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,720
After this, add one prefix and one suffix.

1395
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,240
So what is the fixed good time spent?

1396
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,600
Now it is asking for python.

1397
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,120
So in this method you can pass the python.

1398
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:21,480
So what I can do like with it here first.

1399
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:25,680
Then we need month, then we need date,

1400
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,520
then we need hours.

1401
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,880
Then we need minutes,
then we need seconds.

1402
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,080
Right?

1403
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,400
Correct. Correct.

1404
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,040
Now this would be your filing space,
your time spent

1405
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,520
after this dot being image.

1406
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,840
Now tell me when you save your screenshot
in this format.

1407
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,960
Menu status screenshot.

1408
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,880
What is this going? Yes.

1409
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,480
When you save your screenshot
in this particular format,

1410
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,000
will it give you unique a screenshot

1411
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:20,840
all the times or not?

1412
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,200
Now forced, forced forced.

1413
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,880
You guys should write this part.

1414
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,000
Now go ahead and write this part.

1415
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,120
I know many of
you guys have already written

1416
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:32,320
it will return all the times unique name.

1417
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:35,880
So first guys, please write this to
and do let me know.

1418
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,040
I know the code is still small, but still.

1419
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,120
Please write it

1420
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:47,680
after 2 minutes we'll be having a break
so you have time to 3 minutes.

1421
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:57,000
You can write it after 2 minutes.

1422
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:07,440
Can you see it now?

1423
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,400
All you have to do is set your P.S.

1424
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:28,840
20. Can everyone see the code now?

1425
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,400
Complete code

1426
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,000
students.

1427
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,960
Can everyone see the complete code?

1428
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,080
Yeah, sure, sure, sure. No issues.

1429
01:27:45,080 --> 01:28:03,040
I will of

1430
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,760
should if you see right.

1431
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:09,440
I put the command here.

1432
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,360
Let me put the command here
also because it is I think

1433
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:13,800
you guys are already done.

1434
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,200
So that's why I didn't
want to take screenshot.

1435
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:18,120
Let me find it to take a screenshot.

1436
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,120
Fine.

1437
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:22,240
I come in for both this

1438
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:23,760
and this is.

1439
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:45,080
These are the only two methods
I have written.

1440
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:47,960
There is every one done with this code
writing for.

1441
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,080
Is there anyone who has a still

1442
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,320
Andrei, Jamal,

1443
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,600
Sergey, Mike nor

1444
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:09,960
Anna?

1445
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:10,920
Yeah.

1446
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,480
Then that's what I told you already.

1447
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,440
Right after 2 minutes
we'll be having break.

1448
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:20,160
So let me confirm with everyone
and then we'll proceed further.

1449
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,240
All right, fine.

1450
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:25,400
So now, now, the rest
rest of the part is very easy, right?

1451
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:29,640
Which we are going to do now, the rest
of the part, it is obviously easy.

1452
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,800
Yeah, right.

1453
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,520
Okay, guys.

1454
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:43,360
So if everyone is done.

1455
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,320
Oh, okay.

1456
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:55,160
Or in the north, you are saying?

1457
01:29:55,160 --> 01:30:04,480
Oh, okay, fine.

1458
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:11,960
Okay.

1459
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:12,800
Alright, guys.

1460
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,840
So now let's take a break for 15 minutes.

1461
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,880
Let's connect after 15 minutes. Right.

1462
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:22,320
So Break will take me right here.

1463
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:27,480
Break build 21.21

1464
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,960
connect 2121

1465
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:43,400
So before going onto the break,
before going on a break, we were here.

1466
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:46,560
We wrote this two methods, right?

1467
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,560
First is for taking the screenshot.

1468
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,520
Second,

1469
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,400
say okay, we got this time is ten.

1470
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,600
Why? Because.

1471
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:00,280
Because.

1472
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,000
Correct.

1473
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,040
So because we need to generate every time
unique

1474
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:09,120
screenshot name right now let's go ahead.

1475
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,120
Right now
we have just defined the methods.

1476
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,480
We are not using these methods anywhere.

1477
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,120
Correct?
We are not using this method anywhere.

1478
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,560
So let's go ahead and try to use this
method enemy, guys,

1479
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,880
because I want to get that report
straight.

1480
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:26,960
So which part of my framework works
for my reporting structure?

1481
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,360
Giving me the results? Name
every other thing.

1482
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:32,480
Which part of my framework

1483
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:42,200
reporting structure.

1484
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,040
We we are missing
one thing here in our framework right now.

1485
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:53,320
What is that, Miss Nuts, guys.

1486
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:53,960
Right.

1487
01:31:53,960 --> 01:32:00,080
The first thing is listen,
this correct? Yes.

1488
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,880
So let's go ahead and do this
next part first, okay?

1489
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,760
Now tell me how
we can create a list. Notice

1490
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,360
first if I am creating a list.

1491
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,720
Next class, right.

1492
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,520
Listener's class.

1493
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:12,480
The way we created.

1494
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,840
Remember, I exist in this net interface.

1495
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,560
We have created.

1496
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,800
Remember everyone
I just list, not interface.

1497
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,880
We had implemented that
and when we implemented

1498
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:27,520
we put we call all of the methods
and provided the body to our requirement.

1499
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:28,880
The same thing,

1500
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,640
the same thing we are going to do here,
but with very less amount of code

1501
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,360
within this amount of code,
let me show you

1502
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,080
now, tell me inside you didn't
have to create list nurse or not

1503
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,720
which which part suits the best pages,
best guesses utils.

1504
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:44,760
Which parts?

1505
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:48,840
What's the most odd.

1506
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,600
No, no, no. No test cases?

1507
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,480
No. Make see in your test
gives us your writing

1508
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,920
only your test cases
which you are executing. Right?

1509
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,480
These are the utilities of your framework.

1510
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:04,080
You will use this list in your test
and do not make symbol.

1511
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,280
It means what?

1512
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,560
For all the test cases
you will use this listener Correct.

1513
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:11,880
So it will be a part of your utility.

1514
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:17,440
Let me
create one Java class for listeners.

1515
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:19,840
Correct.

1516
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,960
Recognize I have created a class
for listeners in my utility.

1517
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:31,360
Now when I see I'm going to use my
I test the listener interface.

1518
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,680
So which you and I have to use here
for my listener.

1519
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,480
If it is interface

1520
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,280
extension,

1521
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:43,680
implements, implements, correct,
it implements it.

1522
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:45,440
Since I

1523
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,720
test listeners

1524
01:33:51,760 --> 01:34:04,200
correct?

1525
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,120
Correct. Yes.

1526
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,440
Now see

1527
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:09,200
just two methods.

1528
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,800
I am taking just two methods.

1529
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,760
I'm seeing if my best guest success

1530
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,760
and if my best guess fails escape.

1531
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:21,080
Skip a start and I don't all this
method just two methods

1532
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,800
on test success and on test failure.

1533
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,440
Right guys?

1534
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:28,080
Can somebody please
bring that code of honor

1535
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:31,920
based on test failure method

1536
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:34,200
from a previous class?

1537
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,280
Okay, let me write it

1538
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:39,880
on test

1539
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,920
success.

1540
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,680
Correct.

1541
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:48,480
Guys, this was the name
of my maternal mortality.

1542
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:52,680
You can check you have already this things
in your framework.

1543
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:57,160
Public void on test

1544
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,040
failure.

1545
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:04,680
Now, Now I'm missing one point here.

1546
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:06,040
What is that point?

1547
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:08,680
What is missing in method?

1548
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,800
What is missing here? And

1549
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:16,600
Anna,

1550
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,280
any idea?

1551
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,800
Andre Oliver.

1552
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,320
Mike Sherry Bourdieu.

1553
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:30,200
It's about which parameter should index
what I'm asking.

1554
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,720
Now you will remember

1555
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:36,920
how many of you guys

1556
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:44,440
did not tell me, right?

1557
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:46,200
We were not adding the result.

1558
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,680
How would we get the result?

1559
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,840
Guys, are you revising or not?

1560
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,080
The previous concepts.

1561
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:57,320
When we were learning this test
as a tool there, we used this, correct?

1562
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:02,160
Everyone We used it or not.

1563
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:05,720
And this result,
this result will give me want

1564
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:08,640
see, this result will give me

1565
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:14,920
the name of my test and every single thing
it will give me correct?

1566
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:15,720
Correct.

1567
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:19,080
So now I'm seeing I'm seeing

1568
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,080
if my test success
then give me this screenshot.

1569
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,720
So my a screenshot
method is available where tell me

1570
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,080
guys on my best access.

1571
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,280
I need a screenshot on my test failure.

1572
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,920
Also I need a screenshot common methods

1573
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:43,640
so common method start to get

1574
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,200
dark.

1575
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:48,560
Take a screenshot correct.

1576
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,400
In a screenshot I'm seeing.

1577
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:51,960
I am seeing. Right.

1578
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:54,120
It is asking for final name.
So I am seeing it is.

1579
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:58,440
I don't get name simple this time.

1580
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,560
This time
if you see in my fine name. Right.

1581
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,720
I'm passing this get name.

1582
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:06,360
After this get name I will get here.

1583
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:12,400
They must be hours minute, second week

1584
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:17,160
finally right with test name
I will get this much timestamp dot being.

1585
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:20,400
Got it. I will show you this same thing.

1586
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:24,720
Same thing I will put for my failure
says events of common method start

1587
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:27,920
take a screenshot in reserved

1588
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:31,000
dark get name simple

1589
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:36,040
now now if you see now if you observe
this to me there are just two methods.

1590
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,680
I'm taking dates.

1591
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:42,360
First of all, I tested is
not is the interface.

1592
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:47,360
I implement this interface just for
my test to success and for test failure.

1593
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,200
It means if my test is pass,
I'm concerned.

1594
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,680
If my test is failing, I am concerned.

1595
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,200
I need the result in this case.

1596
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:59,760
Only now, when I'm implementing this

1597
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,640
this don't get me
this got get name returns

1598
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:09,200
you the name of your test
which you are executing.

1599
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,600
Remember when we were learning
testing is a tool.

1600
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,720
We use the reserved door to get name

1601
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,320
because you are passing
this eye test in this.

1602
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,560
No you're not passing
I tested is that is the problem.

1603
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,400
Andrey.

1604
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:31,200
You'll see it is I tested is time passing.

1605
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,040
That's fine.

1606
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,200
That's what I'm saying.
This is a test listener.

1607
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,160
This is I tested is eight different
things raised

1608
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,720
and can you please check it in
your machine Also

1609
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,280
is this If you correct it right,
you will get that.

1610
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,920
Remember guys, when we were learning

1611
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:53,200
that best in as a tool there,
we used this listener's part

1612
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:58,440
and to get the name of the test
are executing the result don't get memory

1613
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:03,000
does the name of your test case
How many of you guys remember this point?

1614
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:07,880
It is I don't get name
it returns the name of your best

1615
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:12,800
guess which you're executing.

1616
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,880
Let me open that

1617
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,920
that project or

1618
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:25,040
I will show you that project later
that test and you framework

1619
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,080
you actually I might have left.

1620
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,600
They might be and it might be that's why.

1621
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,200
But we have already done this by right.

1622
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:38,440
We have already done this,
but it's not new.

1623
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:40,000
This result don't get name.

1624
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,520
The only new thing is this time.

1625
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,480
This time along with this name.

1626
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:47,720
I'm taking a screenshot.

1627
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,040
Right?

1628
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:51,200
And this name
I'm passing is the name of my screenshot.

1629
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,320
Correct.

1630
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,800
So now if you go in your common methods

1631
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,600
guys, this court understood everyone.

1632
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:01,800
It takes a screenshot and it will give
the name of your file name.

1633
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,080
Is this correct?

1634
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,960
Now if you go in your common
method, you said here

1635
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,680
the name of your file would be file name.

1636
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,480
So this is a result. Don't get name right.

1637
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,280
Result dot
gig name is giving you this by name.

1638
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:15,960
Correct.

1639
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,120
Plus the

1640
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,080
space
you book and then you're putting year

1641
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:24,240
month date our minutes against ending dot

1642
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,480
BMG now makes sense.

1643
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,560
Nothing makes sense guys

1644
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:33,760
when we are creating file
name and then timestamp and then not being

1645
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,760
someone was asking why we are putting this
a space in between.

1646
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,840
Right. Right.

1647
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,320
Just to just to verify.

1648
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,480
Just to identify the things.

1649
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:46,280
Correct.

1650
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,920
That is now things make sense or not.

1651
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,080
Tell me now.

1652
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:53,520
Now tell me what is this

1653
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,560
in this method when I'm passing this?

1654
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,120
What is this, Andre?

1655
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:59,360
Sheriff, surely.

1656
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,080
What is this here under date?

1657
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,240
Hours. Minutes.

1658
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:08,880
What is this?

1659
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,400
This is the back end, Right?

1660
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,600
I want my time in this then.

1661
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:17,040
Because this date, right when I see this
date, return something fine.

1662
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:22,480
Then with simple date for make method
right from this part simple date for me.

1663
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:23,600
I can.

1664
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:27,960
I can edit and I can customize the way
I want to see it.

1665
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:29,520
I can customize it here.

1666
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:31,480
That's what I'm doing. Fine.

1667
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:36,320
So now this method will work
where in my class, this list.

1668
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,680
This class is working?

1669
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,160
Kind of.

1670
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:41,760
Yes, because it will store all of my
the screenshot method.

1671
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:45,360
Now see now
see everything. How things work.

1672
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:46,160
Right.

1673
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:49,880
It takes the screenshot file
name from here in terms of great wizard.

1674
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,400
It will go here and create one file.

1675
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:57,480
This file will go and stored it
here in the screenshot file

1676
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,400
and this is on file,
but we have defined it in constants.

1677
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:05,040
Can you see
this is the path available here?

1678
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:09,120
Correct.

1679
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:09,960
Guys understood.

1680
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:14,720
The hierarchy which we did.

1681
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:17,160
All right. Superb.

1682
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:19,560
Now tell me now tell me

1683
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:24,360
from where I can pass listeners
what is the place from where

1684
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:26,880
I can pass my listener Well,
I can pass my listeners from

1685
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,240
extremely fine.

1686
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:31,920
Let me open.

1687
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:32,680
Excellent

1688
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,840
right where I recklessness inside best on.

1689
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,160
I would say this

1690
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:47,280
I would say test

1691
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,600
let me write it to your listeners

1692
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,680
and then I'm going to write

1693
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,440
listener

1694
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,560
in is where

1695
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:18,720
my listeners are available.

1696
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:19,800
Is this the correct part

1697
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,640
you can start listeners is correct.

1698
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:29,520
Fine, let's execute.

1699
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:32,760
Let's execute
this one log this right, this one.

1700
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,280
Why? I'm going to execute this one

1701
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,800
less time
consuming, less preparation here.

1702
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:41,600
Correct Notice?

1703
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:42,960
Correct or not

1704
01:43:43,880 --> 01:43:46,480
less time consuming plus four.

1705
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:49,480
Now here I have to write groups

1706
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,480
smoke

1707
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,840
break because I'm going to execute smokes.

1708
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,760
I'll make sure that there is no other.

1709
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,280
It is because belong to smoke.

1710
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:07,360
I'm going to change for all the smoke.

1711
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,880
I'm changing this. A smoke
just for a moment. Right?

1712
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:10,840
Just for a moment.

1713
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:15,840
I'm changing the smoke because I want to
execute just a one smoke here.

1714
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:20,600
Now, see,
package wise, I'm executing my inside.

1715
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:21,480
My best guess.

1716
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:23,120
This package

1717
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,960
before and after method.

1718
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:32,760
It should be part of the group are not.

1719
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:35,920
It should not be a part of the group
because we are writing always run

1720
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:36,840
is equal to to

1721
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:39,000
correct

1722
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:53,360
When you say always run.

1723
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:54,760
Yeah, correct.

1724
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:58,400
Then you run
whether on based on the group priority,

1725
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:01,760
whatever it is, as always run,
it means it will always run.

1726
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,560
It doesn't matter that your test case
is running or not.

1727
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:07,480
This condition
conditions will always execute.

1728
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:08,640
All right,

1729
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,120
So now, now let me execute this days.

1730
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,800
So far everyone understood the point
in this point,

1731
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,120
everyone understood what we are doing.

1732
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:24,240
How are we doing
what we have written so far?

1733
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,040
Great.

1734
01:45:25,120 --> 01:45:41,840
Let me implement it and admit I it.

1735
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:46,400
First operation done, second

1736
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:50,840
iteration done,

1737
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,920
third iteration done

1738
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,960
for preparation, then

1739
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,320
best guest post.

1740
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:02,080
Alright, everyone can see it or not.

1741
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:09,600
Destiny Now.

1742
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:15,480
Now let me open a screenshot.

1743
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,560
How many of you guys can see this
screenshot here?

1744
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:20,800
How many screenshots
I've got here? Tell me

1745
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,600
for right.

1746
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:28,320
See invalid log in error
message validation.

1747
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:29,520
Fine.

1748
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:33,120
Did the same for me.

1749
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,080
This is the python guys.

1750
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:37,280
Can you see this face?

1751
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,760
This is because we were talking about.

1752
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:41,880
Now you'll see this is the year month,

1753
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:45,360
date hours, minute seconds.

1754
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:46,640
Can you see the difference?

1755
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:49,680
39, 44, 49 people difference.

1756
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:54,680
I came straight.

1757
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:58,520
That is easy to understand
why we have put this time stamp

1758
01:46:58,720 --> 01:47:00,080
easier not

1759
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:06,680
students.

1760
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:19,920
Please update your status
whether you got it or not.

1761
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:26,400
Is there anyone who's
still writing the code?

1762
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,800
We didn't add
any screenshots to their test.

1763
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:32,240
We edit the screenshot,

1764
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:34,440
we added the screenshot in common methods

1765
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,160
is screenshot in common methods
and from there.

1766
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,680
Yeah, sure, sure.

1767
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:49,880
See in common method. See?
And I said right.

1768
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,880
Can you see this is screenshot file but

1769
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,080
static log binder.

1770
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:03,120
No, I'm not getting looks
and I will tell you don't worry about it

1771
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:12,120
all. 21 beam not Benji

1772
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,840
are no issues

1773
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:21,600
talking about error
I'm getting warning was the break

1774
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,680
all right obscenities

1775
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:36,760
is warning for your unlock for you so
it is nothing to do with your execution.

1776
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:40,120
Don't worry, there is a difference
in between error in warning rate

1777
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:43,200
error means you can not.

1778
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:43,840
Yeah, sure.

1779
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,160
This is your business.

1780
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:48,240
This is my business class again.

1781
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:51,600
You Are you calling them all
these big screenshot material

1782
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:53,640
in your listeners?

1783
01:48:53,640 --> 01:49:01,080
Are you calling it here?

1784
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,600
All right, let's do one thing.

1785
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,200
Let's do one thing.
Let me push my code right.

1786
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:10,760
Take the updated code from my repository
and then check

1787
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:14,080
whether it is taking the screenshot on
because it should take

1788
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:18,080
the screenshot.

1789
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:18,800
Right?

1790
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:19,600
Okay. Yeah.

1791
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:21,240
It's just just one more point.

1792
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:22,720
Just one more point. Conceptual

1793
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:24,960
it. See,

1794
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,360
I don't have access to my console, right.

1795
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:31,560
I do not have access to my console
and I'm not concerned about my console.

1796
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:34,800
I'm going to verify whether my test gives
this don't feed

1797
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:37,800
this for the screenshots I'm getting here.

1798
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,520
This one is screenshot.

1799
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,640
Fine.

1800
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:44,600
This to a screenshot is also point.

1801
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,600
Right? Similarly
I have for the screenshot.

1802
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:50,640
Now tell me where did the screenshot
to see which one is faster?

1803
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:52,800
Which one is fake? Out of this one?

1804
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,600
If I want to identify

1805
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:58,080
which one belongs to pass test,
guess which one belongs to test case.

1806
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:08,360
How can I verify that?

1807
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:14,040
Just let me do one thing.

1808
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:15,840
Let me do one thing.

1809
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,640
Tell me.

1810
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,880
Tell me here how many?

1811
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:24,960
How many data and validation we are doing?

1812
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,280
No, we do not need to work.

1813
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,320
We do not need to take a screenshot
method.

1814
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,920
We are adding already this right?

1815
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:34,920
In listeners and listeners we are passing
in our testing do not simplify.

1816
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:38,360
So maybe you are not executing
the same test in you.

1817
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:42,320
You have best in your take symbol file
from where you're passing.

1818
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:52,240
This listener might be You're not passing,
you're not executing that one.

1819
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,600
Now show me here, Show me

1820
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:57,720
you're passing the listener.

1821
01:50:57,720 --> 01:51:01,160
Kirkpatrick Then you're passing this group
also, correct?

1822
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:02,680
Let's check them all.

1823
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:05,080
Let's take a look, check notice.

1824
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,080
Tell me. NASIR, one thing.

1825
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:10,280
I'm going to intentionally fail
one best guess, right?

1826
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,880
This one, I'm going to fail.

1827
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,520
So instead of empty, I'm writing empty.

1828
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:15,720
Simple.

1829
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:19,480
Now Tell me how many test cases will pass
and how many test cases will fail

1830
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:20,760
intentionally.

1831
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:25,640
I changed it.

1832
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:28,520
Three pass. One, three. Correct.

1833
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:29,400
Let's execute.

1834
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,480
Let's see

1835
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:33,280
what are saying is correct or not.

1836
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:34,240
Let's see

1837
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:01,040
by right.

1838
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,240
You'll see one fail, three pass fixes.

1839
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,360
Correct

1840
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:06,080
Here I can see.

1841
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,720
But let's say
I do not have any access to my console.

1842
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:13,360
I'm going into my screenshot
now here it says

1843
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:16,400
for this one, this for

1844
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,800
am I able to verify out of this for

1845
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,960
write out of this for write in 945.

1846
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:24,400
This one which one belongs to fail?

1847
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,760
Which one belongs to pass?

1848
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:29,600
Can I see this?

1849
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:30,880
No. Right.

1850
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:33,720
I can't see

1851
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:35,600
in this case.

1852
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:38,160
What is the what is B Are

1853
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:40,560
output for this.

1854
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:43,400
I mean what is the root
cause of this thing?

1855
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:44,840
What is the solution for this?

1856
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:49,080
B If I'm getting this problem
in my folder,

1857
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:54,520
then what kind of segregation I have
to put so that I can have all the filters

1858
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:58,080
because it passed this test,
because this identify in screenshots.

1859
01:52:58,080 --> 01:52:59,160
Can I do that?

1860
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:08,280
Any idea?

1861
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,960
No, let me tell you

1862
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,080
there is no condition.

1863
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,440
I can say one thing, right?

1864
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:17,880
Because see, when we say
my framework is flexible, what does mean?

1865
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:20,720
It means I can tell my playing framework.

1866
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:24,280
Whatever the test gives are passed.

1867
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:28,280
Whatever the test scores are passed,
you can keep all this test

1868
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:31,440
case inside a screenshot
what under past folder

1869
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:33,680
and whatever the

1870
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:37,440
test cases are free,
you can keep all the screenshots

1871
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:41,640
of relative success
under screenshot in free folder.

1872
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:42,680
Correct.

1873
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,840
Now you got segregation point

1874
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:50,280
all the past test cases been going to past
folder all the fake test cases.

1875
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:57,600
The screenshots will going to fail.

1876
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,880
You're seeing because you did.

1877
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:01,800
Yeah because you didn't provide this.

1878
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:04,560
But that's the reason

1879
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,200
did you.

1880
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:09,000
Jesus, did you write this
Because let me show you

1881
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,800
in your content.

1882
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:14,640
Did you provide this screenshot
like this here?

1883
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,600
Because I'm not sure
whether you provided it or not.

1884
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:20,480
I'm really not sure about it.

1885
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:24,960
If you provided it like this.

1886
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:25,440
Right.

1887
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:26,400
He had.

1888
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:31,000
But actually, if you are providing
like this, this returns, right?

1889
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:36,680
This returns your project current root
right root path and slash.

1890
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:39,400
It means you have a folder with this need.

1891
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:41,760
Yeah.

1892
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,160
Correct.

1893
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:45,680
Maybe have put small or capitals
for screenshots.

1894
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:48,320
That's why That's why.

1895
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,320
All right.

1896
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:54,000
So now what I'm saying is I don't want
to save everything in a screenshot here.

1897
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:59,480
Instead, all the bars, the test cases
will be available should be available

1898
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:04,120
inside us and all the very best guesses
should be in field.

1899
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:04,920
All right.

1900
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:06,360
How can I do this?

1901
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:09,000
You don't have to do anything in nothing.

1902
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,080
Just do one thing.

1903
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:10,960
Just put it here.

1904
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,880
Make this fast

1905
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:20,040
right.

1906
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:24,040
What?

1907
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:27,880
Come on, fast.

1908
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:39,840
And similarly, here, be.

1909
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,000
That's it.

1910
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:46,080
Right?

1911
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,000
No, it's correct.

1912
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,640
Don't get afraid of saying anything.

1913
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:54,000
If some idea comes to your mind,
don't get afraid of that.

1914
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,760
Just explain. Just tell them.

1915
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,080
If we make mistakes,
we will learn more things.

1916
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:00,960
Now, guys, tell me,

1917
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,040
does it make sense or not?

1918
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,960
This time?

1919
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:15,600
Does it make sense or not?

1920
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:16,320
Should we execute?

1921
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:19,440
Not the only thing

1922
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:22,440
I changed in my existing part now.

1923
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,560
Yeah, correct. Correct.

1924
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:28,440
Because I'm sitting here, you just go
it and get a screenshot.

1925
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:29,400
Not all the test.

1926
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:31,360
Guess what? We're inside.

1927
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,240
So it will create.

1928
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,440
Now see, let me show you guys.

1929
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:38,400
Let me execute it first.

1930
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,280
Let me show you this time
the configurations,

1931
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:44,240
the configuration we make this time.

1932
01:56:44,240 --> 01:57:06,240
Let me show you.

1933
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:07,080
Fine.

1934
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,920
Now, now,

1935
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:14,160
how many of you guys see these two folders

1936
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:17,000
guys?

1937
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,640
Can you see these two folders? Now?

1938
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:29,000
Students, where are you?

1939
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,160
Now? If I open if I open this one,
it gives me three.

1940
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,760
If I open this one, it gives me one.

1941
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:39,000
It means my face just gives goes here.

1942
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,840
My positive disk gives goes here.

1943
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:49,320
Correct.

1944
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:49,800
Jamal

1945
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,920
Andrej, Anna,

1946
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:58,640
Olena Bourdieu, are you guys.

1947
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:01,640
Yes, yes, yes. I'm reading.

1948
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:21,040
I'm reading.

1949
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,120
Nice. How many?

1950
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:26,480
How many of you
how many of you are able to get this?

1951
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:30,000
Yeah, because all of your test cases
are positive.

1952
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:36,320
That's why Anna, if you intentionally fail

1953
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:39,720
the way I fail to one best guess
intentionally, then you will get failed

1954
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:44,360
folder is well, for me,
no screenshot here, so only one find.

1955
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,080
All right. So

1956
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,040
yeah so

1957
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:53,480
in your
in your list nurse In your list nurse.

1958
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:57,760
What you're doing basically
is you're simply posting this part,

1959
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:00,920
this particular part in your file.

1960
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:03,680
That's it.

1961
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,280
Right?

1962
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:07,680
This part and this part just

1963
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:10,920
so that you're seeing with the result,
get an employee.

1964
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:11,760
Go ahead.

1965
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,400
If it is bars then created a post.

1966
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:17,160
If it is near, you can safely correct

1967
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:29,520
it. We committed this code again

1968
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:32,280
so that in a timely manner
everyone will get

1969
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:53,760
this code.

1970
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:58,680
Gordon has been posted to the repository
now available of digit code is available.

1971
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:00,120
This case

1972
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:03,080
fine.

1973
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:08,280
So adding this test rate
according to the screenshot popping

1974
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:11,600
into the listener's
posting this list Nurse in your small

1975
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:13,640
Nordic single file

1976
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:17,600
and employed test

1977
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:18,760
fine.

1978
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:20,240
Sure.

1979
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,320
Which by this one

1980
02:00:22,680 --> 02:00:24,880
the last one for verification.

1981
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:46,360
What rate of you must be?

1982
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:48,360
You must be by something you know

1983
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:52,200
I see this an employee paying
and you're passing this things right?

1984
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:53,640
I need to check on this.

1985
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:56,520
I need to check them
because for sure there is

1986
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:59,280
there is some problem
with passing their data for sure.

1987
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:08,000
So we have to check that.

1988
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,920
All right, guys.

1989
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:13,320
So far, so far,
everything is clear or not any

1990
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:25,200
null parsed well

1991
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:27,280
that we have to check that

1992
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:30,000
instead of Melbourne's rate
it should be only paused.

1993
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:31,920
You're posting something else from there.

1994
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,640
That's right. Is taking Melbourne.

1995
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:35,760
But we will figure it out.

1996
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:41,240
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

1997
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:43,160
All right, guys.

1998
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:48,240
Now, now the most important point right?

1999
02:01:48,240 --> 02:01:50,520
Let me show you this

2000
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,320
So far.

2001
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:15,720
So far, what are the things they are doing

2002
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:18,960
right?

2003
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:21,840
We are executing

2004
02:02:21,840 --> 02:02:22,520
right.

2005
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:24,960
We are executing every single thing now.

2006
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:25,600
No more coding.

2007
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:27,600
There's no more coding at all.

2008
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:29,320
Don't about it

2009
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,640
now. See

2010
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:52,440
here.

2011
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,320
Can you see this symbol point, everyone.

2012
02:02:57,760 --> 02:02:58,280
Right on.

2013
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:14,920
Let me take this screenshot of symbol
that could make more sense.

2014
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:19,440
Yes. Now, if you see here

2015
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:24,080
we are
using this bomb Arabic symbol fight.

2016
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:26,080
So we are adding this dependencies, right?

2017
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,160
This dependency, this.

2018
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:32,800
Why are we building this
dependencies? This

2019
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:52,040
to use jobs.

2020
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:52,640
Right.

2021
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:56,680
Because we don't want to add
jar files manually.

2022
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:01,680
We have to take dependencies
that will get every single data

2023
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:05,400
from the central repository, correct?

2024
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:06,120
Correct.

2025
02:04:06,120 --> 02:04:08,960
That's what we are doing now
instead of me.

2026
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,360
One thing when I go here,
when I go actually on my application,

2027
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:18,240
right on my maven central repository
in when right here,

2028
02:04:19,120 --> 02:04:20,520
Melbourne

2029
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:25,160
Repository, right

2030
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:27,720
when I write this Maven repository
and I open it,

2031
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,520
let's say I'm going to read Selenium

2032
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:34,880
for example, I'm
trying to search selenium John files.

2033
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:40,080
Now tell me, am I the only one,
Am I the only one on this planet

2034
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:43,160
who can access digital files?

2035
02:04:43,160 --> 02:04:45,200
Am I the only one who can access this?

2036
02:04:46,160 --> 02:04:49,920
No. Right.

2037
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:52,720
You can be. You can also access this.

2038
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,240
Someone else can also access
based on what?

2039
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,720
X, Y, and Z can also access this. Right?

2040
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:01,200
Everyone can access this or not

2041
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:04,040
static.

2042
02:05:05,200 --> 02:05:07,440
Now tell me one thing.

2043
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:14,120
Hackers can access this or not, right

2044
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,480
now, people, people

2045
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:21,840
who are elderly, people
who are dealing with sensitive data.

2046
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:22,480
Right.

2047
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:25,720
And who wants to cut up
or who wants to make someone application

2048
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:32,640
can David can access this jar files A lot.

2049
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:33,440
Right.

2050
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:38,200
People who want to harm your application
can also access this repository.

2051
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:42,000
Now, can they inject

2052
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,120
can they inject some viruses,
some spyware,

2053
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:48,600
something in your application
by using this job points or more?

2054
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:52,480
If you are using the form,
they're using the simplest forms

2055
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:56,840
and their intentions are not correct,
their intentions are not ethical.

2056
02:05:58,280 --> 02:05:58,640
Is it

2057
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:01,800
possible that they can harm
your application easily from you?

2058
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:08,880
They can or not, right?

2059
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,080
They can.

2060
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,600
So let me let me show you one scenario.

2061
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:13,920
In this case

2062
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,080
when I see and then I assume, Evan.

2063
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:25,040
Right.

2064
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,360
Remember the concept we discussed? Right.

2065
02:06:28,080 --> 02:06:32,120
This is your
this is your central repository, correct?

2066
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:37,080
This is your central repository

2067
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:41,320
and this is your local.

2068
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:47,120
When you need this dingy,
when you need this stingy,

2069
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:49,360
when you need selenium, right.

2070
02:06:49,680 --> 02:06:51,720
You just provide the dependency here.

2071
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:54,240
It goes here and it makes it here.

2072
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:55,000
Correct.

2073
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:58,640
Now here, here, the things

2074
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:01,880
which you guys are using here,
the things are dependencies

2075
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:05,400
that jobs in the everything
which you guys are using here,

2076
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:08,760
the Problem is, if there is something

2077
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:12,720
if there is some problematic file
which is coming,

2078
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:15,800
which is coming from this repository
in your machine

2079
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:21,480
and simply you're using this job finds
in your application directly, If you are

2080
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:25,920
using this, then in your application
it will affect it again.

2081
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:27,520
Affect or it might affect

2082
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:31,200
on your system's performance
in your application, security,

2083
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:34,640
on performance and every single thing
of your application.

2084
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:36,760
Correct?

2085
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:41,880
That is the reason why That is the reason
why in many organizations

2086
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:45,240
which are highly secured
in dealing with highly secured application

2087
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:48,600
in data, for example, Jp
morgan Chase, for example,

2088
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:52,680
your Department of Homeland Security,
DHS or Department of Defense, D.O.D.

2089
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:57,080
or Wells Fargo Bank or liable Bank
or any other bank, Great.

2090
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:01,680
When they are dealing right,
when they are developing application,

2091
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:05,440
when they give access
of their applications to their developers

2092
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:10,320
and their testers, their testers
and developers are not allowed

2093
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:14,360
to use this central repository
directly to download

2094
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:17,720
all the data files and dependencies
from here

2095
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:23,040
into their local.

2096
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:27,040
Getting my point
these developers and testers

2097
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:30,360
cannot add any dependencies directly from.

2098
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:34,280
The central repository. Why?

2099
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:37,280
Why? They can they can not add anything
from there directly.

2100
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:40,560
What is the reason behind this?

2101
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:41,760
Because it is a threat.

2102
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:44,880
It is a severe threat to their security

2103
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:50,880
guys.

2104
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:58,200
Getting my point.

2105
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:00,720
So what they do in this case, yes,

2106
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:04,640
doing is already one step ahead.

2107
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:10,840
So what they do in this case,
when they don't,

2108
02:09:10,920 --> 02:09:14,000
then they can't add anything
from the repository, right?

2109
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:18,000
No, they have their own repository.

2110
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,600
For example,
this is for, let's say, Wells Fargo.

2111
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:21,320
Right.

2112
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:24,840
One client, Wells Fargo,
what you generally do is

2113
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:28,560
the you if you want to add some

2114
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:33,040
you request, you add this dependencies
from Wells Fargo repository.

2115
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:38,120
This Wells Fargo repositories border
connected to the central repository.

2116
02:09:38,120 --> 02:09:38,640
Right.

2117
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:40,520
So they take this jar, files this,

2118
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:44,680
get everything and put it here,
make it right free from all the spyware,

2119
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:48,920
from all the, you know, corrupt files
and it will,

2120
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:53,600
you know, this particular repository
will make all these dependencies directly.

2121
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:58,560
And then when you do a request,
they will allow you to add your jobs here,

2122
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:02,920
in your dependencies, here in your diet,
and the admins in your local park.

2123
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:06,480
Got it.

2124
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:08,360
So this is a central layer.

2125
02:10:08,360 --> 02:10:09,960
This is the central layer.

2126
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:12,200
Let me show you this part in our

2127
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:18,120
framework also, right.

2128
02:10:18,720 --> 02:10:23,040
You see one local repository,
three types of memory repository.

2129
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:26,920
Second, this central repository,
third is remote repository.

2130
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:31,800
Can you see this in the in the slides,
these local repositories,

2131
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:34,920
which one is tell me
which is this local repository

2132
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:44,080
dot in two folder.

2133
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:45,080
Correct.

2134
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:46,880
This is your local repository.

2135
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:49,680
Which one is the central one

2136
02:10:57,720 --> 02:10:59,880
right on the web, on the Google.

2137
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:01,960
And then every single thing is available.

2138
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:06,240
This remote one is the repository
that manages by the company's

2139
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:08,880
owned the software. Right.

2140
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:10,440
Who owned the software.

2141
02:11:10,440 --> 02:11:13,920
So organization based company builds
repository.

2142
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:16,920
The third one, correct.

2143
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:20,960
Got it.

2144
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:23,200
The students.
I hope you are understanding my point.

2145
02:11:23,200 --> 02:11:32,200
What I am trying to explain here.

2146
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:33,680
Great. Let's go ahead

2147
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:40,080
now. Now, So far.

2148
02:11:40,280 --> 02:11:40,800
So far.

2149
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,960
Tell me, how are we executing our

2150
02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:55,200
to get this?

2151
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:57,960
We are making them in a groups right

2152
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:05,920
batch execution.

2153
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:06,880
Okay.

2154
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:09,720
You're not then you will share soon.

2155
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:10,800
You will do it.

2156
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:14,320
Now let me show you right now
what you guys are doing.

2157
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:16,280
This is your Java class, correct?

2158
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:17,280
Let's see

2159
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:19,960
where you're writing your test cases.

2160
02:12:19,960 --> 02:12:25,520
So what you are providing,
you are providing your groups correct?

2161
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,440
This is what you are doing.

2162
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:30,480
The second thing is your test.

2163
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:34,680
And do not assemble class
in this configuration file.

2164
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:37,280
You are passing your package name
here, write

2165
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:40,520
all the package name inside package.

2166
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:42,560
You are passing this groups here. Correct.

2167
02:12:43,560 --> 02:12:46,160
So what it says

2168
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:49,400
in this particular package,
it means this package

2169
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:53,280
based on these groups, for example, smoke.

2170
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:57,560
So based on this group in this class,
this whatever

2171
02:12:57,560 --> 02:13:01,280
the test get, those are available,
go ahead and execute them.

2172
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:05,080
Correct.

2173
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:10,440
But we are focusing
we are focusing on one execution point.

2174
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:14,560
I have this MongoDB exhibit here, right?

2175
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,880
I have a regression dot exam in here.

2176
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:20,040
Let's see it tomorrow.

2177
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:23,880
I will be having a regression
to smoke to so many exam invites.

2178
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:28,720
So is it one stop execution,
one point execution from where I'm

2179
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:32,040
executing all the things that I'm having,
multiple points of execution.

2180
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:33,720
Tell me

2181
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:49,440
anyways,

2182
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:52,720
is it one point execution
or so many points of execution?

2183
02:13:52,720 --> 02:13:53,520
We have

2184
02:13:56,440 --> 02:13:59,440
we can execute on in
once the smoke integration?

2185
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:04,360
How how how should integration detect
some of the smoke detector?

2186
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:14,720
How we going to execute
all of them in a single shot.

2187
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:18,760
No group why is is packages
I am seeing integration

2188
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:23,840
the text images are different by the smoke
dot examiners are different file right

2189
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:30,400
now. Let me tell you one important point

2190
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,520
we are talking about.

2191
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:39,160
We are talking about all the possible
combinations which we can have

2192
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:43,760
only when only when my this framework

2193
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:47,400
is available in my intelligent ADC.

2194
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:48,840
Correct?

2195
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:56,000
Correct.

2196
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,480
You are going back.

2197
02:14:57,480 --> 02:14:58,520
I am talking about this.

2198
02:14:58,520 --> 02:15:00,840
Regression or submitted is not acceptable.

2199
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:02,240
Let's say you have a smoke.

2200
02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:04,560
One smoke to smoke. Three
not acceptable. Fine.

2201
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,840
I want to execute all of these three.

2202
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:10,080
So is it one point execution
or multiple point execution?

2203
02:15:10,640 --> 02:15:11,560
Multiple points.

2204
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:13,960
I have to execute. Right.

2205
02:15:13,960 --> 02:15:16,200
And that too, you can execute

2206
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:19,920
when you have this intelligent ID open.

2207
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:20,880
All right.

2208
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:23,360
Let's say
you are traveling somewhere, right?

2209
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:28,200
And you cannot access this intelligent ID,
but you have to execute

2210
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:31,800
you have to execute all of your script
without.

2211
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:34,280
Even having this particular I.D.,

2212
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:39,600
what is the way to execute your best
guess without even having this I.D.?

2213
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:41,480
What is the way to do that?

2214
02:15:41,480 --> 02:15:43,200
This is my question.

2215
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:44,000
Correct.

2216
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,680
We have to use now,
but I'm not accessible.

2217
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:51,480
FYI, before going into one segment,
let me just fix my error.

2218
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:56,240
My error was this Instead of empty,
I am putting empty once again.

2219
02:15:56,880 --> 02:16:01,560
Correct?

2220
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:01,880
Right.

2221
02:16:03,880 --> 02:16:04,840
I put it empty

2222
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:07,920
once again here
just to make my best guess.

2223
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:10,720
Buzzed. Fine.

2224
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:12,600
Now let's go in, run

2225
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:15,880
exam and fight right in this form.

2226
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:17,320
Vertex email fight.

2227
02:16:17,320 --> 02:16:19,360
Tell me when we talk about memory.

2228
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:21,120
What is memory?

2229
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:24,800
Let me put it in the notes

2230
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:26,640
we were writing.

2231
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:29,440
The moment someone is what

2232
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:33,480
students

2233
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:39,120
memory is a way

2234
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:43,160
automation tool.

2235
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:45,760
Memories work as a note automation tool.

2236
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,640
It is a build automation tool.

2237
02:16:47,640 --> 02:16:50,120
It makes your project is a building.

2238
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:55,360
If you want to make your complete project
in a single unit, go build right

2239
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:58,560
This Moment project
will help you to do that.

2240
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:02,480
Right now,
when I say my one project is a whole,

2241
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:05,760
I'm not able to achieve that point,

2242
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:06,400
right?

2243
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:09,840
I'm not able to achieve that point because
I'm having a regression vertex symbol.

2244
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,680
I'm smug, not accessible.

2245
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:14,680
I'm having so many other things,
but not a single build

2246
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:18,520
that will I will make from bomb, vertex
and then fight.

2247
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:19,360
Right.

2248
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:23,720
So here, here we have to add one base

2249
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:28,760
what we have to add one build
and then to add it to make that base

2250
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:33,080
we have to add one
in the name of this plugin

2251
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:36,240
to make my complete project as a build.

2252
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:36,920
Right?

2253
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:41,640
And then I can execute everything,
everything from my the next email file.

2254
02:17:41,640 --> 02:17:46,520
I have to add one plugin
and the name of this plugin is Maven.

2255
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:47,440
Sure.

2256
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:50,640
Fire plugin.

2257
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:52,440
What is this going to repeat with me?

2258
02:17:52,440 --> 02:17:54,000
We are going to add mixing thing. What

2259
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:01,920
is maven?

2260
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:05,520
Sure. Fire plugin cutting. Sure.

2261
02:18:05,520 --> 02:18:07,840
If you are a sure fire plugin.

2262
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:13,840
Alright, so let's go ahead.

2263
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,640
Let's go ahead and add this surefire
plugin here.

2264
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:18,120
So from where?

2265
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:21,600
From where we can get this guys,
everyone is on the same page

2266
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:26,680
with here.

2267
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:30,160
Please upgrade produced it as fast
so that we will proceed further together.

2268
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:35,760
Everyone can.

2269
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:36,880
Yes. Yes. Everyone.

2270
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:37,440
Everyone.

2271
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:45,600
Everyone.

2272
02:18:45,600 --> 02:18:47,600
All right, let's go ahead.

2273
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:50,360
What we have to do, we to open

2274
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:52,880
we have to write here Maven.

2275
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:54,640
Sure.

2276
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:57,680
Fire plugin search

2277
02:18:57,680 --> 02:19:00,840
maven should find a plugin, right?

2278
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:02,080
Search everyone. Maven Sure.

2279
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:07,280
Fire plugin
and you will get this sherpa plugin.

2280
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:08,640
Everyone.

2281
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:09,920
Everyone should get this.

2282
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:11,400
You remember that Apache?

2283
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:15,000
Not all are sure. Fire slash maven. Sure.

2284
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:16,920
Fire plugin.

2285
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:19,080
Is everyone able to get this?

2286
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:20,560
This particular screen? Everyone

2287
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:29,560
did now know what it says.

2288
02:19:29,680 --> 02:19:31,440
See if you go down.

2289
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:33,360
If you go down. Right.

2290
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:36,000
It says the following examples show

2291
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:40,080
how to use my sure
Fire plugin in more Edmonds.

2292
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:43,640
The used cases,

2293
02:19:43,640 --> 02:19:45,760
the first one says using test engine.

2294
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:51,080
Is this the one we are using these
you'll see here there's ten

2295
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:55,200
GJ unit five doing it for order test
skipping, test skip after failure.

2296
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,080
Which one we are using

2297
02:19:58,440 --> 02:20:00,600
using this DNG simple.

2298
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:03,080
So just click on it

2299
02:20:03,880 --> 02:20:05,240
and when you click on it

2300
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:08,000
right, it will give you this spark.

2301
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:09,800
Can you see the spark?

2302
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:14,440
Everyone is just not from this plugin,
right?

2303
02:20:14,440 --> 02:20:17,240
From this plugin to this plug ins.

2304
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:19,200
Just copy this.

2305
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:20,240
Right.

2306
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:23,520
Just copy this from
this plugins to this plugin.

2307
02:20:23,640 --> 02:20:24,480
Just copy

2308
02:20:36,080 --> 02:20:38,320
that is getting it using selectable files.

2309
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:40,680
Just copy this from plugins to plugins

2310
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:48,920
right now.

2311
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:51,360
Go into your symbol pomodoro symbol find

2312
02:20:52,400 --> 02:20:56,000
everyone is yet in one great example

2313
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:03,360
after your dependencies stick

2314
02:21:03,440 --> 02:21:07,120
Once you're done
with all of your dependencies.

2315
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:10,120
After your dependencies tag, just add

2316
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:12,640
one tag. Go

2317
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:26,400
build, add one bag,

2318
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:33,280
go build a right.

2319
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:34,920
All right

2320
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:39,000
then this part done everyone

2321
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,000
now based this plugin inside

2322
02:21:47,000 --> 02:22:00,120
the way it is

2323
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:09,440
giving is the error.

2324
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:09,920
What happened?

2325
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:33,800
Just a moment.

2326
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:51,120
Let me go here once again.

2327
02:22:51,120 --> 02:22:57,280
At this point,

2328
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:00,720
let me just take it once again

2329
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,440
and open Wikipedia first.

2330
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,160
I will right here.

2331
02:23:15,160 --> 02:23:32,000
And they begin on the

2332
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:42,120
line.

2333
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:42,920
Fine.

2334
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:45,320
Now, now it is not giving me.

2335
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:46,640
And yet it

2336
02:23:47,840 --> 02:23:53,360
let me just keep it.

2337
02:23:53,360 --> 02:23:56,360
What you guys need to do is just add
this build plugin rate

2338
02:23:56,520 --> 02:24:00,200
built in this starting
and in the ending and inside the build.

2339
02:24:00,200 --> 02:24:03,920
Put this plugins.

2340
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:05,200
Yeah. Yeah.

2341
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:06,360
We had this dart files.

2342
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:15,000
You have to delete this dot,
you have to delete every one. Yes.

2343
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,440
Do we have to do it?

2344
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:19,480
We have to do it

2345
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:22,920
all the time so
I mean if you are going to upgrade

2346
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:26,000
something in your project right,
you have to add the dependencies.

2347
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:29,600
If you are going to integrate
some new feature in your project,

2348
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:33,360
you have to add new dependencies
if you want to do so many other things

2349
02:24:33,360 --> 02:24:37,120
right for every single thing,
you have to do it now.

2350
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:39,000
Now see this, guys?

2351
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:42,240
What we are doing here, Right here.

2352
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:45,480
When I'm using this part,
if you guys see right,

2353
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:48,480
it is giving me this read
why it is giving me

2354
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:49,120
the right

2355
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:55,000
how to break from that boundary.

2356
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:00,400
Guys, tell me how to upgrade this example.

2357
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:02,880
Let me go to the project right

2358
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:14,840
where it says
return or click and not reconnect

2359
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:28,120
is till I reopen my.

2360
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:30,000
Yeah, it is working. It is working.

2361
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:30,920
It wouldn't work.

2362
02:25:30,920 --> 02:25:33,240
You can try one more thing
instead of in five.

2363
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:36,760
You can try it in four.

2364
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:38,520
Yeah. This highlights remove.

2365
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:43,320
But Jamal, if it is not taking four
and five, begin driving the M for this

2366
02:25:43,320 --> 02:26:00,680
3.0.0 slash.

2367
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:03,680
No, it says not found 3.0. 0m5.

2368
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:06,360
That's what I saying, Eugene.
I'm just trying to explain this. Right.

2369
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:09,680
If you guys are not able to see this
M5 right,

2370
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:12,480
just take the M4,

2371
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:14,760
just change it to M4. Right.

2372
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:17,200
And see the moment I took M4.

2373
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:19,760
It is no errors. No.

2374
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:20,000
Right.

2375
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,320
So maybe compatibility issue. Yeah.

2376
02:26:22,480 --> 02:26:24,760
Four for home in five is working.

2377
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:28,560
You can keep the M5 or who M4 is working.

2378
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:29,800
You can keep M4

2379
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:36,360
are not working in this. Why

2380
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:41,360
M5 is working for you guys?

2381
02:26:41,360 --> 02:26:44,120
20 so you can take M5 and

2382
02:26:47,360 --> 02:26:51,400
then you're putting this 3.0.0
and hash M4.

2383
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:54,840
Yeah. Find M5 is working then take the M5.

2384
02:26:54,840 --> 02:27:02,040
No issues.

2385
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:02,440
All right.

2386
02:27:02,440 --> 02:27:10,360
Can you guys try reload the project
from this from here.

2387
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:11,120
All right.

2388
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:14,240
Now just right after putting this M4
here, right.

2389
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:17,280
Just go into Melbourne
and then reload the project.

2390
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:24,600
Can you do it.

2391
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:26,920
If you reload the project right,
it will give you

2392
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:35,200
this dependency part here.

2393
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:36,680
All right.

2394
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:39,840
Because if you are taking this
from here, right, this part

2395
02:27:40,520 --> 02:27:43,360
3.0.0 M5 is the latest one

2396
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:46,800
and 3.0.0 M4 is the previous one.

2397
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:49,320
These two things right?

2398
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:52,320
Just M4 M5. It should work.

2399
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:56,160
Are you taking this lead part
inside the plugins and then plugin

2400
02:27:56,160 --> 02:28:00,560
take?

2401
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:01,560
All right. So for those

2402
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:07,440
yet this one, it's working now

2403
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:11,800
because you need to refresh,
you need to refresh rate

2404
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:15,080
even M5 is also fine. Correct.

2405
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:15,920
That's what I'm saying.

2406
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:19,360
What you need to do is write
like on your thumb vertex single file.

2407
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:22,880
First going to
this maven reload your project.

2408
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:29,800
It will add dependencies, right?

2409
02:28:29,960 --> 02:28:31,080
Reload the project.

2410
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:32,400
It will takes time.

2411
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:34,400
It will take time to add requirements.

2412
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:37,800
It now guys see now I see one thing

2413
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:40,960
it says you install excellent

2414
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:44,760
file, right?

2415
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:46,320
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

2416
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:48,520
We'll figure it out.
That screenshot issue. Don't worry.

2417
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:51,720
So now you'll see here in your mail

2418
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:56,520
it says if you want to execute something,
just add the name of your test in.

2419
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:58,840
Do not single file.

2420
02:28:59,000 --> 02:28:59,360
Right.

2421
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:00,560
If you want to execute,

2422
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:04,200
then it says just execute trunk
based in g dot next email like.

2423
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:07,360
So tell me
what is the name of my test in your logic

2424
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:10,440
symbol file?

2425
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:13,240
It surely will will will resolve
this problem. Don't worry

2426
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:18,400
today.

2427
02:29:18,400 --> 02:29:19,960
So can I put here?

2428
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:22,320
Can I put here the smoke dot symbol?

2429
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:27,720
Can I do this?

2430
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:30,120
Guys, please reload your project.

2431
02:29:30,120 --> 02:29:31,480
Reload the project. Right.

2432
02:29:31,480 --> 02:29:34,800
And then reloaded from disk again.

2433
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:37,560
It will work. It should work actually.

2434
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:39,120
Or do one thing. What I am doing.

2435
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:40,440
The one thing what I'm doing.

2436
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:42,720
Maybe it will work.
Could be showing you right now.

2437
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:46,480
Sometimes it
even if it also happens sometimes.

2438
02:29:47,800 --> 02:29:48,800
Yeah. Correct.

2439
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:51,240
That's what I'm saying.
Sometimes you get replaced everything.

2440
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:54,080
But it still it shows at a

2441
02:29:58,120 --> 02:29:59,120
So my new problem

2442
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:02,000
doesn't exist anymore, but still it shows
and it's like that.

2443
02:30:02,520 --> 02:30:04,640
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2444
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:06,160
Will see.

2445
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:07,560
Hold on for a moment.

2446
02:30:07,560 --> 02:30:11,920
Now if you guys see
if you guys see what I did, I'm passing.

2447
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:13,960
This is not not exemplified here.

2448
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:16,920
How many of you guys can see
this is MongoDB, single party

2449
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:26,560
dry file reload on Andre.

2450
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:31,880
Is it working for you or not?

2451
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:35,120
Great guys. Can you do it?

2452
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:37,440
Going to your file and it says reload

2453
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:40,720
all this one reload all from that is
can you do it?

2454
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:44,400
Click on file and reload all from this one
great strategy.

2455
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:48,040
So I told you
it was just a refreshing issue.

2456
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:48,600
Right?

2457
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:51,640
Do doing

2458
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:03,960
already to that.

2459
02:31:03,960 --> 02:31:06,960
We'll look into this, but don't worry

2460
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:25,520
because it says you have to pass your test
in your door.

2461
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:27,440
Take single file. Correct.

2462
02:31:27,440 --> 02:31:29,520
Do we have any file with the name?

2463
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:31,760
And you do take symbol here.

2464
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:38,160
Now, we do not have any test testing.

2465
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:39,920
Do not actually we have the smoke,

2466
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:42,440
not somebody or the ignition, not X
and we've got it.

2467
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:45,200
So we had to pass according to our find.

2468
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:47,240
So our file is
is moderate. Extremely correct.

2469
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,800
I Bosniak

2470
02:31:52,360 --> 02:31:53,680
correct. Not

2471
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:04,680
on M5

2472
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:09,840
is not on M5 means he had a smoker
take civilians to examine files.

2473
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:14,200
You're changing.

2474
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:15,240
Yes for everything.

2475
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:17,800
Yet Virgin has nothing to do
with the fight. Right?

2476
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:19,360
That is virgin.

2477
02:32:19,360 --> 02:32:20,720
And this is the file name.

2478
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,800
These are two different entities guys.

2479
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:25,200
Remember if M5 is not working.

2480
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:26,880
That's why I said use input.

2481
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:30,720
But still we had to change this
because there is no file

2482
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:33,040
called test
and did not exclude in our project

2483
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:47,280
guys so far.

2484
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:49,560
So everyone reached this point or not

2485
02:32:51,560 --> 02:33:02,000
everyone has reached this point.

2486
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:05,360
Great notion so we can change that.

2487
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:09,800
Yes, you have to you have to Oxana
according to your smoke integration

2488
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:12,360
or take similar
you have to change this binding.

2489
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:14,320
Otherwise what would you execute?

2490
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:16,080
Now let me show you how it works

2491
02:33:17,480 --> 02:33:23,640
this time.

2492
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:26,520
This time when you say smoke,
not single file.

2493
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:32,720
So your your form not accessible by great
having this

2494
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:37,680
the smoke dot examined
it will go and check.

2495
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:40,120
Do we have any smoke not examined

2496
02:33:40,120 --> 02:33:43,760
it says yes I have a smoke protection
well inside this exists.

2497
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:44,520
All right.

2498
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:46,880
Do we have any group
you say? Yes. Small group.

2499
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:48,440
Fine. Which package? User.

2500
02:33:48,440 --> 02:33:48,960
Best guess.

2501
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:51,640
Package it will go and check inside.

2502
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:55,360
This gives the gauge how many classes
we have so inside best gives us.

2503
02:33:55,360 --> 02:33:57,640
We have an employee does not exist.

2504
02:33:57,640 --> 02:34:00,320
How many best guesses
I have belong to smoke?

2505
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:02,280
It's just for point.

2506
02:34:02,280 --> 02:34:03,000
It will return.

2507
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,520
Therefore it will execute it from here.

2508
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:08,200
It's a one bomb or and file can execute.

2509
02:34:08,200 --> 02:34:12,440
Smoke can execute regression can execute
smoke to an executive regression

2510
02:34:12,440 --> 02:34:13,640
to and so many other

2511
02:34:14,760 --> 02:34:15,680
should it.

2512
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:17,160
That is a part of later discussion.

2513
02:34:17,160 --> 02:34:21,480
We'll go on to that part also let's
try to solve one it went right so you see

2514
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:25,200
this would exemplify the smoke detector
symbol we are passing your right one

2515
02:34:26,280 --> 02:34:27,000
right

2516
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:35,880
guys, can you see what we are doing

2517
02:34:38,640 --> 02:35:02,400
So yes, correct.

2518
02:35:02,400 --> 02:35:04,880
We pass the smoke in our Sure. Fire
plug in. Correct.

2519
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:08,280
Now it is making my complete made Why?

2520
02:35:08,280 --> 02:35:10,000
It is making my complete build.

2521
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,440
Tell me,
what is the advantage of having this?

2522
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:14,280
Remember

2523
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:17,920
when we talk about deployment,

2524
02:35:17,920 --> 02:35:20,480
right, when we are talking
about deploying our code

2525
02:35:20,480 --> 02:35:25,000
to one environmental exit from best
environmental protection environment

2526
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:28,600
or even from development environment
to pest environment,

2527
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:32,320
who deploy this good

2528
02:35:38,640 --> 02:35:41,080
students who deploy the good

2529
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:48,240
developers,

2530
02:35:48,240 --> 02:35:50,800
correct developers deploy the code.

2531
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:54,200
Now when they the code before

2532
02:35:54,200 --> 02:35:58,440
deploying any code on any environment,
are there any prerequisite?

2533
02:35:58,440 --> 02:36:01,640
Are there some prerequisites
that they need to follow

2534
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:04,640
or are checkpoints or their check boxes

2535
02:36:04,640 --> 02:36:07,920
they need to check before
deploying the code on any production?

2536
02:36:09,720 --> 02:36:11,000
Can they blindly deploy the

2537
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:17,160
code on any environment?

2538
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:18,920
No. Right.

2539
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:23,640
They cannot deploy any code on any mine
without checking.

2540
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:27,000
Right. I'm billion
unless you have to check.

2541
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,800
So what what are the parameters? Right.

2542
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:31,760
What are the parameters to check?

2543
02:36:31,760 --> 02:36:35,200
So The parameter is
when you make your project as a build.

2544
02:36:35,640 --> 02:36:37,800
This build has to be parsed

2545
02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:39,440
this way.

2546
02:36:39,440 --> 02:36:40,600
There has to be.

2547
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:42,960
Tell me, why is this bill to be parsed?

2548
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:46,720
If the bill is failing,
if the bill is failing,

2549
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,200
they cannot deploy their called on to any
and might need

2550
02:36:51,480 --> 02:36:52,320
to deploy.

2551
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:53,520
If they're caught on to

2552
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:57,240
any other environment,
they have to make the bait right now.

2553
02:36:57,880 --> 02:37:01,200
Let me show you
when we're talking about Maven.

2554
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:03,440
So you see this memory tag.

2555
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:05,280
Everyone can see this memory bag here

2556
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:06,840
on the

2557
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:14,240
right corner.

2558
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:16,240
Students How about others?

2559
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:25,440
Just three or four play.

2560
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:27,280
Just click on it.

2561
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:33,600
Just click on it and you will see here
in lifecycle, in lifecycle, it gives you

2562
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:36,880
clean validate compile, test

2563
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:40,440
package, verify, install, site and deploy.

2564
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:43,000
These are the lifecycles of MAVEN.

2565
02:37:44,280 --> 02:37:46,400
These are the lifecycles of memory.

2566
02:37:46,760 --> 02:37:47,760
All right

2567
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:51,120
now now

2568
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:55,320
we can test by this builder to exemplify.

2569
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:58,000
We can clean our entire project from here.

2570
02:37:58,200 --> 02:38:01,840
We can validate it compile,
we can install, we can verify,

2571
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:05,880
we can deploy every single thing
we can do via

2572
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:11,120
using this simple basic tool and to make a
we have to use this plug in.

2573
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:15,040
That's why we have added this plugin.

2574
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:17,920
Got it, Got it.

2575
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:27,240
Not everyone.

2576
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:28,800
Now let me show you something.

2577
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:30,680
Let me show you something here.

2578
02:38:30,680 --> 02:38:32,200
Can you see this target folder?

2579
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:37,960
Can everyone see this target for this

2580
02:38:43,480 --> 02:38:46,000
right now? See,

2581
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:49,600
I'm not using my intelligent ID anymore.

2582
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:50,840
I'm not using.

2583
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:54,400
I will use my terminal. Remember
two things.

2584
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:59,040
The first thing is you can execute
everything from your intelligent ID.

2585
02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:02,880
Now the state guarantees
you execute everything

2586
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:05,440
without your intelligent,
without your I.D..

2587
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:07,360
How c

2588
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:10,920
I have to go in my project
where these my project exist,

2589
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:15,720
so my project is in it
says new folder testing D framework best.

2590
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:16,800
Fine.

2591
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:19,240
So let me open my command prompt.

2592
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:21,920
Right.

2593
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:24,160
Let me open my command prompt. Once again,

2594
02:39:25,480 --> 02:39:30,240
I'm going inside my case directly.

2595
02:39:30,240 --> 02:39:32,240
Idea projects.

2596
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:35,840
Then again change directly from new folder

2597
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:39,000
and again change directly

2598
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,760
test in deep framework.

2599
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:43,800
So now I am inside my project.

2600
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:47,760
I'm inside my project
using command from you guys.

2601
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,480
Mac users can also use this part
terminal, right?

2602
02:39:51,480 --> 02:39:53,280
You guys have to use terminal part.

2603
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,920
You go going to your terminal
and go inside.

2604
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:59,920
Video project is available,
for example in this location on.

2605
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:01,920
This location, my project is available.

2606
02:40:03,520 --> 02:40:03,800
Are you

2607
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:10,440
guys here?

2608
02:40:10,440 --> 02:40:14,800
Everyone is here will do wherever
your project is available,

2609
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:18,720
wherever your project available,
open your command prompt.

2610
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:20,040
From there,

2611
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:26,520
let me show you another way
how you can open it.

2612
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:27,440
That's fine. That's fine.

2613
02:40:27,440 --> 02:40:28,920
You will get it shrink. Don't worry.

2614
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:30,600
I will show you next point.

2615
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:34,000
Now let me show you another way
how you can open

2616
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:36,920
open your project. Right.

2617
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:39,720
Let's say this is my project, right?

2618
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:44,320
This is my project in my folder.

2619
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:46,280
Just select it and. Right.

2620
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:48,120
See M.B. here.

2621
02:40:48,120 --> 02:40:51,080
What You need to see me for Windows users.

2622
02:40:51,080 --> 02:40:54,560
I'm seeing interest in there by default.

2623
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:56,640
Your inside your this folder.

2624
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:58,920
Can you see shortcut

2625
02:40:59,160 --> 02:41:01,200
by default your inside this folder

2626
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:17,120
should if open your project,

2627
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:20,240
the wherever you project is straight

2807
02:52:48,240 --> 02:52:52,560
Now, guys, see in this command bump
this time you have to write in the end

2808
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:56,000
space hyphen virgin

2809
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:00,480
yammer smart time.

2810
02:53:00,480 --> 02:53:02,160
Okay, let me give you the link.

2811
02:53:02,160 --> 02:53:04,680
Meanwhile,
what you guys have to do basically

2812
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:17,560
see this bin zip again,
you have to download

2813
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:22,440
right into the environment,
but right into the environment pop.

2814
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:26,520
And then here you have to provide these
two women and women

2815
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:30,840
who to provide this bin
falling apart from the terminal.

2816
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:32,280
You have to do.

2817
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:35,120
Let me share this link for me.

2818
02:53:35,640 --> 02:53:36,360
Marvin,

2819
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:39,240
where is Mac?

2820
02:53:39,240 --> 02:53:40,840
This is Mac.

2821
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:43,240
We open the terminal
switched to the directory

2822
02:53:43,240 --> 02:53:46,760
where file is extracted
and use this particular part.

2823
02:53:48,240 --> 02:53:58,560
So let me give you this one.

2824
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:03,200
By the way, just to make users rights,
I will give you a base just already.

2825
02:54:03,800 --> 02:54:09,360
Let me first finish it for this base
for all the Windows users.

2826
02:54:09,360 --> 02:54:17,600
Okay.

2827
02:54:17,600 --> 02:54:21,480
Anna, this is your project.

2828
02:54:21,480 --> 02:54:22,920
We are verifying Olena.

2829
02:54:22,920 --> 02:54:25,840
We are verifying that amendment
is installed or not. Correct entry.

2830
02:54:25,880 --> 02:54:30,760
You got the moment now, see,
And your project is available here, right?

2831
02:54:30,760 --> 02:54:33,080
This Is your framework available here

2832
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:36,320
just to select here and biopsy

2833
02:54:36,320 --> 02:54:41,160
and be just right
CMB here and press into this.

2834
02:54:41,320 --> 02:54:43,920
You just need to open
guy's command prompt.

2835
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:46,720
There's the simplest thing
you have to do, right?

2836
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:49,560
Just open the command prompt
and then right.

2837
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:54,480
And we end in the in space hyphen version.

2838
02:54:56,160 --> 02:54:57,480
This is the command

2839
02:54:57,480 --> 02:55:02,760
to verify whether MAVEN is available
or installed in your machine or not.

2840
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:07,760
So what we have to do, we have to open
command attempt inside the command room.

2841
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:11,040
Doesn't matter where you're opening
the command from, from just open command

2842
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:15,920
prompt and right
and we in space hyphen Virgin three

2843
02:55:17,080 --> 02:55:19,000
when you enter it

2844
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,720
it will give you this maven virgin

2845
02:55:23,440 --> 02:55:30,920
correct.

2846
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:36,720
Well then we are verifying
whether Apache is available or not. But

2847
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:48,760
all right.

2848
02:55:48,760 --> 02:55:51,120
So now it means you didn't add
the port correctly.

2849
02:55:51,240 --> 02:55:53,880
Means you didn't add the port correctly.

2850
02:55:53,880 --> 02:55:57,120
You just need to copy
the port of your Maven radial

2851
02:55:57,120 --> 02:55:59,160
bin folder and then you have to edit.

2852
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:01,760
This is the you are available, right?

2853
02:56:01,760 --> 02:56:05,280
You can go through that,
you want it and you can simply use that.

2854
02:56:05,280 --> 02:56:07,040
You want to build the bin folder, but

2855
02:56:09,480 --> 02:56:10,720
yeah, for that.

2856
02:56:10,720 --> 02:56:14,240
Eugene For that
what we have to do is we have to

2857
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:17,840
provide this being home also, right?

2858
02:56:18,160 --> 02:56:22,080
Without Maven whole,
if you want to simply verify this maven

2859
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:25,920
right slash kill bin trade,
then simply provide the path will be

2860
02:56:25,920 --> 02:56:29,200
and then you will get without
creating the home in we full maven.

2861
02:56:29,600 --> 02:56:36,480
Okay, this is the difference.

2862
02:56:36,480 --> 02:56:42,440
But right now when I'm when I'm assisting
you guys right so similarly

2863
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:46,840
with something right I will but right now
when I'm doing this with you.

2864
02:56:47,000 --> 02:57:02,040
So what is the problem
in downloading this things with me?

2865
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:05,880
So you guys in your downloads again,
I'm repeating guys again.

2866
02:57:05,880 --> 02:57:09,960
I'm repeating even though you guys
have added Java underscore home right?

2867
02:57:09,960 --> 02:57:11,640
In the same way. Right.

2868
02:57:13,360 --> 02:57:14,360
Okay, Sheriff, that's why I'm

2869
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:18,120
repeating this is the third time behnam
repeating the same process right?

2870
02:57:18,120 --> 02:57:19,600
You focus just for one time.

2871
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:22,360
It'll be more than enough
because this is the thing

2872
02:57:22,360 --> 02:57:26,200
you guys have done already for four months
back, right?

2873
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:28,720
When you were editing
the Java Java Underscore home.

2874
02:57:29,280 --> 02:57:34,160
If you didn't edit that, I'm assuming
and I'm thinking how your Java is working.

2875
02:57:34,520 --> 02:57:37,480
C you have downloaded Apache.

2876
02:57:37,480 --> 02:57:38,440
Everyone.

2877
02:57:38,440 --> 02:57:41,760
Everyone has downloaded Apache, correct
this Maven zip folder.

2878
02:57:41,760 --> 02:57:42,440
Everyone.

2879
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:44,840
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

2880
02:57:45,080 --> 02:57:47,840
I'm talking about understanding

2881
02:57:48,520 --> 02:57:51,960
what Jenna
So this is that this time I'm going.

2882
02:57:51,960 --> 02:57:53,480
Let's see.

2883
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:56,320
Nancy So now tell me
why is everyone got this zip

2884
02:57:56,320 --> 02:58:04,040
folder or not?

2885
02:58:04,040 --> 02:58:08,640
The people who didn't get this.

2886
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:11,280
But I'm explaining these things
for you guys.

2887
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:14,240
Once again,
you are getting this the folder.

2888
02:58:14,240 --> 02:58:15,600
Not everyone.

2889
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:20,280
Please update the status guys.

2890
02:58:20,280 --> 02:58:24,960
No, I'm talking about others.

2891
02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:28,920
When you guys got it
just right click on it and extracted.

2892
02:58:28,920 --> 02:58:31,160
First we have to extract it.

2893
02:58:31,920 --> 02:58:36,600
And when you extract it
right after extracting it, we ask you.

2894
02:58:37,280 --> 02:58:38,120
That's fine.

2895
02:58:38,120 --> 02:58:39,200
That's fine.

2896
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:43,400
In the end, after extracting,
you will get this folder right.

2897
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:46,360
You will get folders like this.

2898
02:58:46,360 --> 02:58:48,680
We just unzip, open it,

2899
02:58:50,040 --> 02:58:52,640
go inside the folder.

2900
02:58:52,640 --> 02:58:55,960
Yeah, correct. Correct.

2901
02:58:56,320 --> 02:58:59,320
And then open this bin in your Apache.

2902
02:58:59,320 --> 02:59:01,400
Open this bin folder.

2903
02:59:01,400 --> 02:59:04,440
When you open this bin folder,
you have to copy this.

2904
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:08,240
But just copy this part from here Right

2905
02:59:08,840 --> 02:59:12,480
now, when you copy this part,
everyone is so far

2906
02:59:12,680 --> 02:59:15,760
understood how we can copy the portal bin
folder, every one

2907
02:59:15,760 --> 02:59:17,160
to just move this

2908
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:24,960
how we reached this point.

2909
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:30,840
Now, now, when you copied this thought,
you have to paste it somewhere.

2910
02:59:30,840 --> 02:59:33,680
Then go on to your this PC,

2911
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:36,800
click on properties

2912
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:39,280
or my computer and click on properties.

2913
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:42,640
You will get this option
advance the system settings.

2914
02:59:43,440 --> 02:59:45,280
If you are not getting this option here.

2915
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:48,280
If you're using Windows 11,
we can search it here.

2916
02:59:48,280 --> 02:59:52,080
Also, advance the system settings
and when you open it warns

2917
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:56,120
the system settings,
it will ask you for environment variables,

2918
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:57,880
right?

2919
02:59:58,600 --> 03:00:01,320
When you click on environment variables,

2920
03:00:01,320 --> 03:00:04,760
it will give you this system variables.

2921
03:00:04,760 --> 03:00:06,000
Getting this system variable.

2922
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,200
We want to

2923
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:10,880
click on environment variables

2924
03:00:10,880 --> 03:00:13,600
and then click on system variables.

2925
03:00:13,600 --> 03:00:15,400
Inside this system variables.

2926
03:00:15,400 --> 03:00:16,680
If you see

2927
03:00:19,360 --> 03:00:19,840
inside

2928
03:00:19,840 --> 03:00:23,040
this system variables,
if you see you will get this fourth

2929
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:25,560
variable right, this part variable

2930
03:00:27,160 --> 03:00:30,960
getting it guys, everyone
this part variable

2931
03:00:35,120 --> 03:00:36,240
students

2932
03:01:17,880 --> 03:01:19,280
that is till this point,

2933
03:01:19,280 --> 03:01:23,880
everyone got it or not.

2934
03:01:23,880 --> 03:01:27,120
Now you have to simply edit
here, click, edit

2935
03:01:27,720 --> 03:01:29,800
and because why are we editing the things?

2936
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:32,280
Because we have so many parts
already available, right?

2937
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,040
So inside editing, right?

2938
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:38,720
The but we have to select this new

2939
03:01:40,440 --> 03:01:42,480
and then we have to select the new.

2940
03:01:42,480 --> 03:01:44,880
Then we have to select the new here.

2941
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:48,440
Here we have to paste the part
we copied for Maven.

2942
03:01:48,600 --> 03:01:51,280
All right. Right.

2943
03:01:51,360 --> 03:01:55,640
We have to just based the path like this
I posted on already here.

2944
03:01:55,640 --> 03:01:56,040
You see,

2945
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:58,640
I pasted this part already.

2946
03:01:58,640 --> 03:02:01,440
Yes. When you do it,

2947
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:04,520
when you do it, just select.

2948
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:06,240
Okay. Okay.

2949
03:02:06,240 --> 03:02:08,480
And then we'll find

2950
03:02:08,840 --> 03:02:11,520
right now

2951
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:16,080
now simply open command prompt.

2952
03:02:16,600 --> 03:02:18,840
Right. Simply open command from anywhere.

2953
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:20,600
Not in your framework.

2954
03:02:20,600 --> 03:02:23,280
Just open the command prompt in right here

2955
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:28,000
and we and bash the space

2956
03:02:28,160 --> 03:02:30,560
hyphen word in

2957
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:33,960
now everyone got it or not

2958
03:02:33,960 --> 03:02:35,600
this opportune moment

2959
03:02:42,880 --> 03:02:46,080
experience is everyone got it or not and

2960
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:24,280
all right

2961
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:27,880
okay so now it is working for you.

2962
03:03:27,880 --> 03:03:32,840
Great for
is there anyone still inside the class

2963
03:03:32,840 --> 03:03:34,800
who is still didn't
get this a patch amendment.

2964
03:03:34,800 --> 03:03:47,840
Mark, if you want, I can do it once again.

2965
03:03:47,840 --> 03:03:51,120
If it is a language issue, right,
then maybe

2966
03:03:52,360 --> 03:03:53,640
I can not.

2967
03:03:53,640 --> 03:03:55,200
And when is not a command right?

2968
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:57,800
Because you didn't install it properly
or it looks.

2969
03:03:57,800 --> 03:04:00,680
And let's connect after the session
and I will install it in your machine.

2970
03:04:00,680 --> 03:04:02,400
Okay, I will do that.

2971
03:04:02,400 --> 03:04:04,960
Rest all of you based on able
to do whatever

2972
03:04:04,960 --> 03:04:09,600
to do it.

2973
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:09,800
There

2974
03:04:11,400 --> 03:04:13,800
is this update the status.

2975
03:04:13,800 --> 03:04:16,480
Is there any other one
who still have an issue?

2976
03:04:16,960 --> 03:04:17,400
All good.

2977
03:04:17,400 --> 03:04:24,800
Correct.

2978
03:04:24,800 --> 03:04:26,520
All right, fine.

2979
03:04:26,520 --> 03:04:29,560
Now, now let's open

2980
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:32,600
let's open
your framework in common with them.

2981
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:33,880
Right.

2982
03:04:34,360 --> 03:04:36,680
So I already told you how we can open it.

2983
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:39,480
You'll see here it gives you this

2984
03:04:40,440 --> 03:04:44,840
where your framework is available
right in your terminal.

2985
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:47,440
You can open this part, right?

2986
03:04:47,440 --> 03:04:51,960
I told you already how you can open
simply just open command or terminal.

2987
03:04:53,400 --> 03:04:55,000
The city

2988
03:04:56,720 --> 03:04:58,800
I'm using inside my idea projects

2989
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:02,120
my project available in new folder.

2990
03:05:02,560 --> 03:05:06,360
Inside this my project is available
in Destiny framework.

2991
03:05:06,360 --> 03:05:09,120
This is my framework available.

2992
03:05:09,120 --> 03:05:14,560
So I came in my framework.

2993
03:05:14,560 --> 03:05:16,520
Has everyone opened this point?

2994
03:05:16,520 --> 03:05:17,600
Everyone

2995
03:05:23,280 --> 03:05:29,520
All right, guys in your here
step here to serve.

2996
03:05:29,600 --> 03:05:32,320
If you see this option, just write CMB,

2997
03:05:32,960 --> 03:05:36,400
raid CMB
and it will open your command or right.

2998
03:05:38,320 --> 03:05:41,880
For Mac users, it is terminal

2999
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:45,320
Now go where your framework is available.

3000
03:05:45,320 --> 03:05:47,400
So how you can go in your framework

3001
03:05:47,400 --> 03:05:51,400
just to see
what is the path available there right.

3002
03:05:51,400 --> 03:05:53,560
Or or the second way.

3003
03:05:53,560 --> 03:05:56,800
The second way to go there is open

3004
03:05:56,800 --> 03:06:00,480
your framework Video framework
is available in your folder structure.

3005
03:06:00,480 --> 03:06:03,760
For example
my framework is available here.

3006
03:06:03,960 --> 03:06:04,320
Right?

3007
03:06:04,320 --> 03:06:08,920
So I open to my framework in my folder
and on this block on this.

3008
03:06:08,920 --> 03:06:10,240
But I will type symbol.

3009
03:06:10,240 --> 03:06:13,560
See M.B., I will see them dictating.

3010
03:06:15,240 --> 03:06:16,840
Now just click

3011
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:21,720
here, press enter
and you will come inside this.

3012
03:06:21,720 --> 03:06:23,880
You will come inside this.

3013
03:06:23,960 --> 03:06:31,000
Now everyone is here.

3014
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:31,800
Great.

3015
03:06:32,080 --> 03:06:34,360
Now let me show you one thing and

3016
03:06:37,960 --> 03:06:40,760
yeah, so I gave you just a shortcut.

3017
03:06:40,760 --> 03:06:43,280
This one right now. See

3018
03:06:44,400 --> 03:06:47,560
if I go in my
project you will see this target folder.

3019
03:06:47,560 --> 03:06:51,320
Right Generated resources maven status.

3020
03:06:51,440 --> 03:06:53,600
Sure. Fire reports, best classes.

3021
03:06:54,120 --> 03:06:55,120
Remember the point?

3022
03:06:55,120 --> 03:06:57,000
I told you that I have to.

3023
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,160
I have to clean my project.

3024
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:00,960
So can I clean my project from here?

3025
03:07:00,960 --> 03:07:02,120
Someone says yes.

3026
03:07:02,120 --> 03:07:04,400
You can clean everything now.

3027
03:07:04,400 --> 03:07:07,920
See, I just raised one command
envy and clean

3028
03:07:09,240 --> 03:07:11,640
envy and clean

3029
03:07:11,640 --> 03:07:14,640
is the command I'm going to write.

3030
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:17,160
If I get build success message

3031
03:07:17,960 --> 03:07:20,520
If I get builder success midget message,

3032
03:07:20,880 --> 03:07:25,720
it simply means my command executed
my project is clean

3033
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:33,080
so I'm typing here and being clean.

3034
03:07:33,080 --> 03:07:35,240
It says what I see, what it is seen

3035
03:07:39,600 --> 03:07:41,520
is what it is doing.

3036
03:07:42,360 --> 03:07:43,320
Work the same. Cool.

3037
03:07:43,320 --> 03:07:44,400
It means build success.

3038
03:07:44,400 --> 03:07:46,120
Make for everyone.

3039
03:07:46,120 --> 03:07:48,520
Your project is cleared cleaned.

3040
03:07:48,840 --> 03:07:52,440
Now if you see here
your target folder is gone.

3041
03:07:52,680 --> 03:07:56,680
There is no target folder.

3042
03:07:56,680 --> 03:07:57,360
Can you see guys?

3043
03:07:57,360 --> 03:08:05,880
There is no target folder
in your framework anymore.

3044
03:08:05,880 --> 03:08:08,440
Then we have to check why
it shows builder failure.

3045
03:08:09,360 --> 03:08:11,440
Ideally they should see later pass

3046
03:08:11,440 --> 03:08:13,920
right build success rate guys.

3047
03:08:14,640 --> 03:08:25,000
So what we did,
we just clean our project right now.

3048
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,840
This is the time to execute our project.

3049
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:31,440
Now tell me if I'm going to is Yeah.

3050
03:08:31,480 --> 03:08:33,360
The last thing
which we are going to do now.

3051
03:08:33,360 --> 03:08:38,160
See, this is the last thing that we are
going to do now, Trace, here

3052
03:08:41,520 --> 03:08:43,520
the last thing which we are going to do.

3053
03:08:43,560 --> 03:08:46,960
Shady Last thing is a stupid thing
which we had you to do.

3054
03:08:47,760 --> 03:08:51,000
All right, so now now see, here

3055
03:08:51,960 --> 03:08:57,120
I am passing my smoke dot example here.

3056
03:08:57,120 --> 03:08:57,720
Correct.

3057
03:08:58,200 --> 03:09:03,680
If I execute my smoke notice symbol.

3058
03:09:03,680 --> 03:09:04,800
Yeah, I know.

3059
03:09:04,800 --> 03:09:09,800
I know this
maven installation part two time now here

3060
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:13,560
this part will execute my smoke,
not examine

3061
03:09:14,720 --> 03:09:18,280
my smoke dot
someone will execute all their test gives

3062
03:09:18,480 --> 03:09:22,280
in these packages
belong to smoke category correct.

3063
03:09:22,280 --> 03:09:26,960
But I'm not going to execute anything
anything from here.

3064
03:09:27,920 --> 03:09:30,360
I'm going to execute everything from here.

3065
03:09:30,360 --> 03:09:32,800
Only right from my command prompt.

3066
03:09:33,400 --> 03:09:36,480
So I will right here m v and

3067
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:38,480
test.

3068
03:09:39,080 --> 03:09:42,520
Just read this ambient test
and see the moment I press.

3069
03:09:42,520 --> 03:09:43,080
Enter

3070
03:09:56,120 --> 03:09:59,360
and you see execution starts

3071
03:10:17,760 --> 03:10:19,160
now. See

3072
03:10:20,680 --> 03:10:22,560
now see it says build success.

3073
03:10:22,560 --> 03:10:27,120
Can you see guys what it says?

3074
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:29,560
Guys, It says build success right.

3075
03:10:29,560 --> 03:10:30,960
You'll see your parsed

3076
03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:34,920
this one with this credential
with this credential with this credential.

3077
03:10:34,920 --> 03:10:35,800
With this credential.

3078
03:10:35,800 --> 03:10:46,680
Correct.

3079
03:10:46,680 --> 03:10:47,080
All right.

3080
03:10:47,080 --> 03:10:49,360
It will see that and see errors
out of point.

3081
03:10:49,720 --> 03:10:54,080
Errors are okay, right?

3082
03:10:54,080 --> 03:10:55,120
Mail is failure.

3083
03:10:55,120 --> 03:10:58,120
It means there is something
which is not are downloaded completely.

3084
03:10:58,120 --> 03:10:59,760
An area will see that.

3085
03:10:59,760 --> 03:11:01,680
Why will this mean you will see?

3086
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:04,920
Can you please posted a screenshot of that

3087
03:11:04,920 --> 03:11:06,920
now now if you guys see

3088
03:11:06,920 --> 03:11:10,440
we do not have to go
and check our console in our ADC.

3089
03:11:10,440 --> 03:11:11,040
Right.

3090
03:11:11,040 --> 03:11:13,440
We are executing everything smoothly from

3091
03:11:20,640 --> 03:11:21,120
Jamal.

3092
03:11:21,120 --> 03:11:23,320
It is too small.

3093
03:11:23,320 --> 03:11:38,760
I mean I can't even read what is this can.

3094
03:11:38,760 --> 03:11:41,640
Okay, so you have to close
all of your Excel file.

3095
03:11:41,640 --> 03:11:44,040
If your Excel file is available
and opened everywhere.

3096
03:11:44,040 --> 03:11:46,320
Right? Just close your
Excel point from implement.

3097
03:11:47,400 --> 03:11:49,680
It is
start talking, talking about your accent.

3098
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:55,560
So just close it.

3099
03:11:55,560 --> 03:11:56,040
All right.

3100
03:11:56,040 --> 03:11:58,240
So now it worked the correct.

3101
03:11:59,600 --> 03:12:00,320
Great.

3102
03:12:01,440 --> 03:12:01,880
All right.

3103
03:12:01,880 --> 03:12:03,280
So now if you guys see

3104
03:12:03,280 --> 03:12:07,080
right when I'm executing
it is giving me this result right now.

3105
03:12:07,080 --> 03:12:08,640
Let me show you one thing.

3106
03:12:08,640 --> 03:12:10,520
Let me show you one thing intentionally.

3107
03:12:10,520 --> 03:12:12,800
I'm going to fail my guess.

3108
03:12:14,320 --> 03:12:15,960
Yes. Yes, correct.

3109
03:12:15,960 --> 03:12:16,920
I'm going to fail.

3110
03:12:16,920 --> 03:12:18,320
My best guess intentionally.

3111
03:12:18,320 --> 03:12:21,080
One best guess. I'm going to fail.

3112
03:12:21,080 --> 03:12:24,280
Let's go ahead
and then execute it Once again.

3113
03:12:24,280 --> 03:12:27,600
I'm going to write in the end test

3114
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:39,160
again.

3115
03:12:39,160 --> 03:12:41,880
It starts execution here

3116
03:12:42,840 --> 03:12:57,600
right?

3117
03:12:57,600 --> 03:12:58,320
Fine.

3118
03:12:58,600 --> 03:13:02,720
Now see, it is saying run
one bus around to boss,

3119
03:13:02,880 --> 03:13:07,040
run three field in run for this
boss, can you see?

3120
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:09,280
But it is name build of failure.

3121
03:13:09,280 --> 03:13:13,440
It means what I'm saying
unless you get hundred percent result

3122
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:18,120
right
it will say bring the failure So before

3123
03:13:18,480 --> 03:13:21,720
until unless developers
get the boss message

3124
03:13:21,920 --> 03:13:24,840
they cannot deploy the things on
to any in mind.

3125
03:13:24,840 --> 03:13:26,160
Mean what does it mean?

3126
03:13:26,160 --> 03:13:29,320
It means their goal should 100%

3127
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:32,640
getting my point

3128
03:13:34,760 --> 03:13:35,160
right.

3129
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:37,720
Their code should work 100%.

3130
03:13:38,040 --> 03:13:43,600
Now you'll see it is very easy to identify
if you go here right?

3131
03:13:43,600 --> 03:13:46,160
If you go here,
it gives you the address. Right?

3132
03:13:46,160 --> 03:13:52,080
You see it says assertion
error message does not match.

3133
03:13:52,080 --> 03:13:54,720
It says password cannot be found.

3134
03:13:54,760 --> 03:13:56,480
The password cannot be empty.

3135
03:13:56,480 --> 03:13:58,720
You got this message, right?

3136
03:13:58,720 --> 03:14:01,080
It says failure. Fine in this test too.

3137
03:14:01,080 --> 03:14:02,760
So that is also funny.

3138
03:14:02,760 --> 03:14:05,760
It is giving me for logging based invalid

3139
03:14:05,760 --> 03:14:09,040
log in message validation, line number 41.

3140
03:14:09,600 --> 03:14:13,840
And you see it is giving me completely
does inside log in test.

3141
03:14:13,840 --> 03:14:17,680
Fine let me go inside logging test open
this is my logging this

3142
03:14:18,440 --> 03:14:22,080
it says invalid log in message validation
line number 41.

3143
03:14:22,080 --> 03:14:24,520
It means here right?

3144
03:14:24,520 --> 03:14:25,840
It means here.

3145
03:14:25,840 --> 03:14:30,160
So my fail point is here only because are
providing a solution here only correct.

3146
03:14:31,120 --> 03:14:34,560
Now Now let me fix it.

3147
03:14:35,280 --> 03:14:36,720
I just fix it.

3148
03:14:36,720 --> 03:14:42,200
And again, if I'm going here,
I will write in the end test.

3149
03:14:42,200 --> 03:14:44,720
I am simply executing everything
from here.

3150
03:14:44,720 --> 03:14:46,880
You see, this time

3151
03:14:57,160 --> 03:15:00,160
false test gives executed.

3152
03:15:00,320 --> 03:15:05,840
Second one executed,

3153
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:08,040
third one executed

3154
03:15:11,520 --> 03:15:13,080
and fourth one also executed.

3155
03:15:13,080 --> 03:15:13,840
Correct.

3156
03:15:13,920 --> 03:15:15,960
Now see, it says build success

3157
03:15:17,800 --> 03:15:20,720
in this case, it says build success.

3158
03:15:22,240 --> 03:15:25,240
So this time when you're done
with your coding part,

3159
03:15:25,240 --> 03:15:27,520
when you are completely done
with your coding part,

3160
03:15:27,520 --> 03:15:29,720
and even if you want to
execute your script,

3161
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:34,080
you don't need to go in your ID,
You can execute everything from

3162
03:15:34,080 --> 03:15:38,280
just one simple command wire command
from the wire terminal.

3163
03:15:38,280 --> 03:15:39,200
All right.

3164
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:42,280
So there is a formal step of this.

3165
03:15:42,280 --> 03:15:43,720
What is this for this step

3166
03:15:43,720 --> 03:15:47,720
right now you are seeing that
browser is opening, Browser is closing.

3167
03:15:47,720 --> 03:15:52,680
Hegel's browser, if you use
it means everything will execute, right?

3168
03:15:52,720 --> 03:15:54,000
Nothing can be.

3169
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,280
And we don't need to start intelligent,
no strategy.

3170
03:15:56,280 --> 03:15:57,520
That's what I am saying.

3171
03:15:57,520 --> 03:16:00,280
So even your Chrome browser will not open.

3172
03:16:00,920 --> 03:16:02,480
You will not see Chrome browser.

3173
03:16:02,480 --> 03:16:05,080
It will execute all of your script
you will get.

3174
03:16:05,080 --> 03:16:07,360
There is a
this is what we call chrome headless

3175
03:16:08,760 --> 03:16:11,280
if you
use headless browsers when witnessed.

3176
03:16:11,280 --> 03:16:14,720
You know what so many of us
do business in automation, we use headless

3177
03:16:14,720 --> 03:16:17,840
browser network, 10,000 scripts,
12,000 scripts.

3178
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:19,720
So it executes everything.

3179
03:16:19,720 --> 03:16:23,160
It doesn't open any browser,
it doesn't close any browser,

3180
03:16:23,280 --> 03:16:27,000
it just everything
it gives you that isn't there.

3181
03:16:27,000 --> 03:16:31,400
So Things work. I'm

3182
03:16:32,400 --> 03:16:34,280
getting my point based

3183
03:16:44,640 --> 03:16:46,080
guys, so far.

3184
03:16:46,080 --> 03:16:54,600
Any question in this explanation?

3185
03:16:54,600 --> 03:16:56,240
Yeah. Right now it is using Dex.

3186
03:16:56,240 --> 03:16:59,040
What I am saying it is a for better step

3187
03:16:59,040 --> 03:17:01,040
further, if we implement that

3188
03:17:01,040 --> 03:17:03,640
step, then even Chrome
browser will not open.

3189
03:17:04,080 --> 03:17:06,120
That is Chrome headless browser.

3190
03:17:06,120 --> 03:17:07,400
It is an advanced part.

3191
03:17:07,400 --> 03:17:11,160
We will see that right now it is because
we didn't provide headless browser.

3192
03:17:11,160 --> 03:17:15,240
Correct.

3193
03:17:15,240 --> 03:17:17,480
So this was the last point.

3194
03:17:17,480 --> 03:17:21,640
Right when we started our conversation,
I told you that we will reach

3195
03:17:21,640 --> 03:17:24,640
till the point where we will not meet it.

3196
03:17:24,640 --> 03:17:27,280
We will not use any of the file
for execution.

3197
03:17:27,440 --> 03:17:30,120
So right now we are not using any file
for the execution.

3198
03:17:30,400 --> 03:17:33,720
We are passing
just one command in our command prompt

3199
03:17:33,720 --> 03:17:36,960
and my entire test gives entire framework

3200
03:17:37,120 --> 03:17:40,680
based on my customization,
based on my configuration.

3201
03:17:40,880 --> 03:17:50,360
Executing is it correct or not?

3202
03:17:50,360 --> 03:17:58,440
That is getting my point.

3203
03:17:58,440 --> 03:17:59,400
All right.

3204
03:17:59,560 --> 03:18:03,000
So this is all from the test and you park.

3205
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:05,160
That's all we learn.

3206
03:18:05,160 --> 03:18:11,560
Your testing as a tool, correct?

3207
03:18:12,160 --> 03:18:12,920
Correct.

3208
03:18:13,160 --> 03:18:16,120
So now from tomorrow onwards, guys,

3209
03:18:16,400 --> 03:18:19,600
we are going to
start cucumber part, right?

3210
03:18:21,360 --> 03:18:23,760
We are going to start our cucumber part
from tomorrow.

3211
03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:27,840
The new framework,
completely new framework, less complicated

3212
03:18:28,320 --> 03:18:31,040
very easy to understand, very easy to use

3213
03:18:31,920 --> 03:18:34,840
as compared to test injection,
but is much easier.

3214
03:18:35,400 --> 03:18:37,600
All right.

3215
03:18:37,600 --> 03:18:41,680
Obviously, things are seen so many
things are seen in that framework, too.

3216
03:18:41,880 --> 03:18:44,080
Like, yes, it would be much easier.

3217
03:18:44,280 --> 03:18:47,280
So still still if you guys,

3218
03:18:47,280 --> 03:18:50,120
you know, lost a grip on best India
framework.

3219
03:18:50,520 --> 03:18:51,200
Right.

3220
03:18:51,200 --> 03:18:54,520
If you guys think, no, I didn't
get everything from this framework.

3221
03:18:54,520 --> 03:18:54,960
Right.

3222
03:18:54,960 --> 03:18:57,240
Not all the things fine.

3223
03:18:57,240 --> 03:18:59,160
Cucumber is another chance.

3224
03:18:59,160 --> 03:19:01,440
Go ahead, grab cucumber.

3225
03:19:01,440 --> 03:19:08,240
All right.

3226
03:19:08,240 --> 03:19:08,480
Yeah.

3227
03:19:08,520 --> 03:19:11,560
Are going to connect

3228
03:19:14,720 --> 03:19:15,440
shortly.

3229
03:19:15,440 --> 03:19:15,720
Sure.

3230
03:19:15,720 --> 03:19:19,440
Definitely.

3231
03:19:19,440 --> 03:19:23,960
I will take care of that.

3232
03:19:23,960 --> 03:19:24,880
All right, guys.

3233
03:19:24,880 --> 03:19:27,240
So like I said, right,
I will leave you early today.

3234
03:19:28,080 --> 03:19:34,200
So we are going to end the class now.

3235
03:19:34,200 --> 03:19:37,600
See you guys tomorrow, everyone.
