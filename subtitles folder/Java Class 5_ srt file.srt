1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,040
All right.

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,360
Good morning, guys.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,720
And then we can you guys hear me?

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,640
All right.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,160
Good morning.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,600
Good morning.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
All right.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,360
How is everyone doing this morning?

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,360
Early morning in Virginia

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,400
and doing good.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,680
Super cold.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,480
We have

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,520
all this here right?

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,240
Yeah. Feel a little better?

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,760
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,280
Thank you for asking, guys.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,000
Right.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,880
Or I am. Oh, wow. That's good.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,960
I hope you are.

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,360
You have an energy now, Mohammed.

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,520
All right, That's good.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,400
That's good. Let me ask you guys,

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:12,120
how was the homework?

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,160
You will go over some stuff.

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,560
You what?

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
That London.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,880
Okay, you know what?

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,400
We'll look into the homework, guys.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,880
But before that, let's do a quick recap
right.

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,880
There's already class five.

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,000
All right, So, guys, let's talk about
what did the

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,160
what did you guys learn yesterday? Do?

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,160
Well, yesterday

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,480
we looked into the scanner
and we looked into the nets that if right.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:03,640
So what what can you guys
tell me about the nest of if in

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,520
so we seen that nest of eve right.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,120
We said it's Eve inside another Eve Right.

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,880
So there is such variation
that it's available.

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,400
Right.

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
In which cases
you might want to go nesting

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,600
when you have one condition
that is dependent on another.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,400
Right.

43
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,240
So you want to make sure
that first checkpoint has passed

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,960
and then you want to do a further
check, right?

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,640
You want to do a more detailed check
right?

46
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,080
Typically. Okay. Yeah.

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,320
But those conditions
that kind of like dependable, right.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,160
So the most in that condition
is dependable on that.

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
Our condition. Right.
Do you have any allergies?

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,400
Yes. Okay.

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,280
If you have any allergies, let's check
what kind of allergies you have.

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,720
But if you don't have any allergies,
I'm not going to go and ask you

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,200
what kind of allergies you have.

54
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm not going to do any order detail
check.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,480
Right. So we said Eve, right.

56
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
You'll be Eve.

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,320
And here we have
a bowling ball in condition.

58
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,240
Right in.

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,720
Inside, Right inside.

60
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,480
We can have another eve
that will have its own bowling condition.

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
Right.

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,640
And as we said, we can place
Eve either inside,

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,800
you look right, or we can do nesting

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,080
and place it inside the else walk.

65
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,600
Right.

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,120
They'll squawk
then as if condition can have

67
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,680
just eve block

68
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,640
right, Right.

69
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,640
Then our air conditioned
can have this else.

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,440
BLOCK Right.

71
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,400
Or our eve statement can have Eve else
Eve and else blocks, right.

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,360
So any of those variations,
what we can do, we can do,

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,440
we can

74
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,600
look in this

75
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,800
right? And then what are we seeing?

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,920
How do we call this Eve
that stars on the line five guys?

77
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,240
I do.

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:23,480
We call this Eve.

79
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,440
This Eve the first eve there this
this first a what we call it in our eve.

80
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,240
Right.

81
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,200
And our our eve
always, always controls our inner eve.

82
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,480
Right. All in.

83
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,000
Only in the condition here will be true.

84
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,200
Only then we will get a chance

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,120
to check our most inner right.

86
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,600
And we will organize into nest in one eve.

87
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
But of course, we can do nest
in more than one eve.

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,080
Right?

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,160
So all depend on the condition,
but somewhere you guys can see multiple

90
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,000
Eve's inside.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,080
When it comes to us, to programmers,
to automation,

92
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,280
engineers, this we probably not going
to go more than three.

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,320
And most of the time
if you're going to use our nest of

94
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,080
if it will be,
it will be to eve conditions inside.

95
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,640
Right. But can it be more?

96
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,400
Yes, it can be more. I

97
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,960
think that's our nest.

98
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,840
It if in we look yesterday
into the scanner class.

99
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,920
What guys
can you tell me about the scanner glass

100
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,600
because there it's it's a clause in that

101
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,120
dedicated to take input from a user right
so now is the help of the scanner.

102
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,320
We tried to make our program
more interactive,

103
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,280
and with the help of scanner,
we can capture data.

104
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Data. No.

105
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,280
One we look in captured from our keyboard,
right?

106
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,800
Whenever we type in something, then
be able to take it to our program, pick

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,600
it up.

108
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
Tell me guys, how can I,
how can I create scanner

109
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:22,560
in? Okay, we will do import, right?

110
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,200
It will come from the import app.

111
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,000
But the line, right, The line,
the AP will come from import

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,440
and they will come Java that you
it comes from this packages

113
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,280
and then it will come
from the right import statement

114
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,400
and then

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,600
right then the
line that we need to bring the scanner.

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:43,800
Right.

117
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,680
So we'll take it with the scanner
and then in you name.

118
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,240
Right.

119
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,040
And they so here we know that
this is identifies the variable,

120
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,320
this is the type of the variable in
that was something new to us.

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,520
Right.

122
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,160
We have to
we have to do we have to use new scanner

123
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,720
and then identify that system therein that
will be taken input from the keyboard.

124
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,320
Right.

125
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,760
And then since there's a different

126
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
data available. Right.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,720
Since it's since this is

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,520
the user can enter different data and
there's a different data types in Java.

129
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,600
So scanner is going to use different
options, right

130
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,680
is going to use different ways
to capture different type of values.

131
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,320
Right?

132
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,840
So if I want to capture an integer days,

133
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,640
what can a what I'm going to use?

134
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,960
So I'll take the variable, right,
that refers to my scanner

135
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,760
and I'll just say next integer, right,
next integer.

136
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,040
If I want to capture a string this right,
just one string.

137
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,480
What am I going to use?

138
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,400
I'm just going to use next, right?

139
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,600
I'm just going to use next.

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,440
If I want to get your boolean dies,
you try it

141
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,640
with the bowling.

142
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
It just we're going to be next boolean,
right?

143
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,320
The same thing,
the variable that refers to the spinner.

144
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,560
And then we will use next fully.

145
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,760
Right.

146
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,680
The same thing will be for the double
double next double.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And another one.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,480
I don't know.

149
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:40,640
Did you guys try to capture one character?

150
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,760
One character, Not the line.

151
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,360
So if you want to capture the character
guys, what do we all do The same thing.

152
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
We will refer to the variable.

153
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,000
Then we will go for a next right

154
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,800
and then after next
we will just go char that

155
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,920
at an unspecified zero in here.

156
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,640
Okay?

157
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,920
Zero. Me Yep.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Because so basically what happens is look,
what happens

159
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,840
is this this party you guys learn
when when we are going to use strings,

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,560
okay, When we go into long strings,
you guys will understand what it means.

161
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,280
But for now, just think about what
next does, right?

162
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,480
What is the next test?

163
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,600
It captures a string, right?

164
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,440
It captures the string, for example.

165
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,960
Hello. Right.

166
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,560
And then you send Hey,
from this string that you capture,

167
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,480
take eight characters, take one character,
take one character and zero.

168
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,720
It means the very first character

169
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,200
refers.

170
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,280
That's what it means.

171
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,240
Take the character
at which position Position zero,

172
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,320
which identifies as first place can.

173
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,680
Right.

174
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,600
And once again, the scanner right in.

175
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,960
If you want to pick another character,
you'll just have to change this values.

176
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,640
If you want the second one,
you'll go for one.

177
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,280
If you want the third one,
you will go for two.

178
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,200
Right? But

179
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,920
the entire purpose will be to end
their specific character, right?

180
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,680
To enter the specific character.

181
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,320
Okay.

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,160
So I know once again,
guys, can we just using

183
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
for our learning purposes
are there won't be any

184
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,120
any use in the future

185
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,040
once you start going more into object
oriented concepts of Java.

186
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,040
And of course, definitely we're not
going to use it for our test automation

187
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,880
or not.

188
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,720
You can try, you can try it.

189
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
So remember, guys, right now
you're learning a lot of stuff.

190
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,960
So in your time you want to try something,
you guys can go ahead and try again,

191
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,320
but can you catch it early?

192
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,480
You can catch it right?

193
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,080
Okay.

194
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,120
And let's see our homework.

195
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,640
See our homework. Right.

196
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,520
So here now you guys saw that

197
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,160
the homework quiz is to

198
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,640
it is to come.

199
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,440
It is to combine our nested E Right.

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,720
And to combine it now with the Skinner.

201
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,160
Right. All this assignment,
you should have it.

202
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,280
Is this Skinner
And actually first assignment.

203
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,320
Let me see this first assignment.

204
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,400
Or you had to capture two numbers, right?

205
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,280
You had to capture two numbers, right?

206
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
That's what you guys had to do.

207
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,560
First one, was it easy?

208
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,520
I think first three supposed to be first.

209
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,800
First four, right? First four.

210
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,840
They were easy, right?

211
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,800
So what we what we had to do right.

212
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,080
You had to create a scanner, right.

213
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,200
And then ask user
to enter the loan amount.

214
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,120
And here
you guys could have go for capturing

215
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,800
next double or next integer.

216
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,880
And then we would throw in the
if condition, right?

217
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,040
Then we were throwing the
if condition. Okay

218
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,640
let's just look at one of them.

219
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,760
This out of this three.

220
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,160
Let's look at one of them actually,
for the first one, you guys have

221
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,600
to capture two numbers so we can look
at the first, second, third, third one.

222
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,840
Which one you guys want to look at?

223
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,800
This one is just the conversion.

224
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
There is no eve condition.

225
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,640
Let's look at this one or this one

226
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
in here.

227
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
They're all pretty, pretty
same good spread.

228
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,880
That's the best one.

229
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,920
So today is already New Day,

230
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,000
right?

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,560
I teach you that syntax, that

232
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,640
classic.

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,080
Right. Plus

234
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:15,120
homework.

235
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
And we will go over the fifth one as well.

236
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,000
This right. So in here. Right.

237
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,360
This is just a scenario, right?

238
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,120
So you already in the representative
you need to ask customer their age.

239
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,080
Right. So now what do we need to do?

240
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,760
We need to capture input from a user

241
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,040
and as we said,
to capture the input from the user.

242
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,760
What do we need?

243
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,160
We need to create a scanner, right?

244
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,880
We need to create a scanner.

245
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,080
And then after we create this scanner,
we can give an instruction, Hey,

246
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,280
what is your H? Right?

247
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,720
And then to capture
that H can you send me a code

248
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,160
just peek

249
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,320
and you'll see

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,960
I Right.

251
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,160
So designers have said this scanner,
it lives in different libraries.

252
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,040
So what will it have?

253
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,120
We'll have to import it, right?

254
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,200
You'll have to import it to our class.

255
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,440
Once is get imported.

256
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,920
Now we can use right.

257
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,400
And then once we

258
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,600
once we created,
once we created this scanner.

259
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
So this line just gives us
an instruction, right?

260
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,080
What we want the output to be.

261
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,800
So a user knows what to enter. Right.

262
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,160
And then since we're trying to capture
that integer value, right,

263
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,600
so we use it,
we are referring to the variable that

264
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,160
maybe we use in the variable
that refers to our scanner.

265
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,840
Right.

266
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,720
And then using the

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,960
next integer option, Right.

268
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Next integer
will allow us to capture an integer value

269
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,200
and then wants to be able to enter
and capture integer value.

270
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,240
We storing it inside this variable, right?

271
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,600
And now once we have the variable, once

272
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,200
we have the value that we placed inside,
now we can do our if condition.

273
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,800
Right.

274
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,200
And now this is our simple Eve statement
that consists of Eve block

275
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,720
and that consists of the else block right.

276
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,600
And as I mentioned,
what do you guys need to do?

277
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,760
Always, always.

278
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,520
When you have your program,

279
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,320
always try to test
that your program works correctly, Right?

280
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,920
In this

281
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,000
in this,
you have to test two options, right?

282
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,600
Where the E block becomes true and
the word else block becomes true, right?

283
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,880
Sure. Yeah. Right across

284
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,000
customer H, Right.

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,280
So we will make it 18 oh,
I get the right output.

286
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,800
Yes, we got the right output right.

287
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,680
Then we run in the second time.

288
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,480
What's your age?

289
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
My age is 15. Right.

290
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,600
Unfortunately, we can look provided
driver's license is my program works.

291
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,280
Yes, my program works.

292
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,800
So you guys test of your own code
in your code works, right?

293
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,280
I think your code works fine.

294
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,400
Okay, So.

295
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,640
And this was this
this was exactly the same thing.

296
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,000
The only thing in here just to practice
capturing different values.

297
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,720
If you guys wanted to capture a next
double, you could have used an X double.

298
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,840
If some of you also use next integer,
it's also fine.

299
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,920
And then the same thing
you would throw the if else block right.

300
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,840
You will try. Hey eve condition is

301
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,720
list then 200,000.

302
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,960
Then you will have the money.

303
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,280
Otherwise you would reject.

304
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,840
Right?

305
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,000
The first

306
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,400
the first one you guys had to capture
two numbers, right?

307
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,120
So when you captured your numbers,
you needed two variables, right?

308
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,720
So you will call and not
you would use another option.

309
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,360
Scan that next integer, you would capture
the second numbers, second number.

310
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,680
Now, when you have two numbers,
you can easily be either, right?

311
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,040
So all this
first three, four are the same.

312
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,760
This one, the five in the six, right.

313
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,200
So now when you look

314
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,320
at the five and the six right here,
we can look at this

315
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,080
one is what once

316
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,200
we met this

317
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,800
I am what I want you to do this right.

318
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,880
What I want you to do
always, always try to analyze, right.

319
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,280
Always try to analyze the tasks,
the assignment before

320
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,800
you start doing it right.

321
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,720
And that's what you guys guys going to do
in the future.

322
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,440
Right In the future, when we work as a

323
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,000
automation engineers, right?

324
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,480
So you guys already know what is the

325
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,960
what is the user story,
what is the test cases, right?

326
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,680
So you guys will be looking
at the user stories.

327
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,200
Then you will be creating the test cases.

328
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,920
And after that, while training the test
cases, you guys will start analyzing

329
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,240
what kind of automation you will be doing
right before jumping into it.

330
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,760
You guys will be analyzing.

331
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,840
So the same thing right now,
what are we trying to do?

332
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,240
We trying to analyze the task, right?

333
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,760
It's like analyzing the user's story.

334
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,800
Okay, So create a Java program

335
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,360
that will ask if the user
has a credit card or not, Right.

336
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,640
As a credit card or not.

337
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,840
We need to capture the same thing
from one user.

338
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,880
Then you guys will need a scanner. Right?

339
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,160
And then

340
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,240
if user does not have a credit card,

341
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,480
then you will add up if they do have one.

342
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,520
Right. So now only, only right.

343
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,960
You guys have to think, hey,
only and only.

344
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,680
If a user has a credit card, you realize
then what is good balance, right?

345
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,800
But obviously if you don't have a credit
card,

346
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,600
we're not going to ask
for the balance right.

347
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,040
And I see

348
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,960
I see this demo.

349
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,200
You try to capture a Boolean value.

350
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,520
Some of you try to capture a string value.

351
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,120
Some of you guys
try to capture a character value.

352
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,680
All the characters,
all the cards, all are correct.

353
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,000
And then the only will be difference
based on the value like you captured.

354
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,440
Right.

355
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,840
So let's look at the first one.

356
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:14,960
If you're going to go for a bonus right.

357
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,080
And we said, first we need a scanner.

358
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,680
We already know what's going on in here.

359
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,400
Then we send the instruction

360
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,680
right now in this scenario
and we look at the different scenario.

361
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,520
If you want to capture a string
or if you want to capture a store,

362
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,520
some of you
this capture is single character, right?

363
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,920
So in this case,
we trying to capture a bullet, right?

364
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,720
We're trying to capture a bullet.

365
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,040
So because we know in programing,
how do we say yes or no?

366
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,240
We say we seen it using true or false.

367
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,720
Right. So in here,

368
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,880
a student decided to capture a bullet.

369
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,640
Right.

370
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,760
So now and then once we capture Boolean
that we check

371
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,920
in, hey, if the condition is true, right.

372
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,280
If you do have a credit card.

373
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,640
Right.

374
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,080
Only and only

375
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,640
only when that condition is true,
then I'll execute this block of code.

376
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,280
Right.

377
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,360
So what did I include
in this block of code now?

378
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,640
Because you told me you have a credit
card.

379
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,440
Now, I will ask you,
what is the balance? Right?

380
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
And then I will be capturing the balance.

381
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,400
Now, you using

382
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,200
your storing it inside
a double tap of variable, Right.

383
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,840
And here you capture a double tap of that.

384
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,520
Right.

385
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,240
And if the balance is less than thousand,
you're doing this option.

386
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,840
Otherwise you're doing this option. Right?

387
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,920
This option.

388
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,960
So my only suggestion probably for
this quarter will be reminders.

389
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,240
If your condition is already rolling,

390
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,920
if your variable already holds
a Boolean type of value.

391
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,280
Right.

392
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,000
You don't have to say
if condition is true,

393
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,000
because what are you will look in here.

394
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,640
Right.

395
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,000
So this input boolean. Right.

396
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,960
This input boolean will capture either
true.

397
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,680
Right.

398
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,760
So for example, if you enter true

399
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,800
true will be stored inside this box
right now

400
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,000
basically here what you're saying
if true, is equal to true, right.

401
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,920
So you don't really need to say,
hey, if true is really equal to true.

402
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,960
Right. Is true equal. So true.

403
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,840
Yes. Right.

404
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,680
And then if you're doing this comparison
and then what you want to get,

405
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,240
you're going to get true, Right?

406
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,000
So we're saying when our condition is

407
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,200
when our variable holds
a Boolean type of value,

408
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,120
you don't need to say
true, true extension, right?

409
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,680
So here we can just say if condition,
if condition.

410
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,400
Oh, and this case. Right.

411
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,320
In this case, when you enter. True. Right.

412
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,720
You already know.

413
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,320
Okay.

414
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,080
Hey, Eve. Condition holds a true.

415
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,760
Yes, it's true.

416
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,480
You allowed to go inside that
block of code, right?

417
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,920
Then once you go inside, then
you will start checking for a balance.

418
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,400
Capturing the balance,
the value that will be stored in here.

419
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,000
Now, you using inside your eve condition

420
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,240
and coming out with the different options.

421
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,360
Right. So

422
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,400
how many

423
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,600
times if I want to test my code guys,
if I want to test my code,

424
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,560
how many times should I run it?

425
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,160
I want to test that my eve block works.

426
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,760
I want to test that my else block works
inside the Eve.

427
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,200
I have this eve and I have this else in.

428
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,760
I think I think three times, right?

429
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,600
I think three times. Right.

430
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,480
So first let's test that my else
block works right less as of my

431
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,240
you know, you have to remember this.

432
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,920
Okay, If you're using boolean,
then you have to enter boolean.

433
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,320
You have a credit card box.

434
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,080
Okay. Did my else blog that I executed?

435
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,280
Yes. My ls block that executed right now.

436
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,520
Do you have a credit card? I do. Right.

437
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,480
So now because my condition was true
now I've been prompted this question.

438
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,040
Right problem.

439
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,080
And then what's the balance now?

440
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,160
The balance we will enter.

441
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,120
I don't know, 900, right.

442
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,200
To make our eve statement.

443
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,040
Right to make our If block executed.

444
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,800
It is executed.

445
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,120
Yes, it is.

446
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,040
Or I think it should be.

447
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,760
If the balance is right,

448
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,560
the balance is larger.

449
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,280
Right. Okay.

450
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,000
The balance is larger. Right.

451
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,520
Just logically.

452
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,280
So this way
we get the correct logical right.

453
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,640
If the balance is more than 1000,
we want to pay it off immediately.

454
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,120
Right. Let's try again.

455
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,280
You have a credit card?

456
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,200
Yes, I do.

457
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,160
What's the balance?

458
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,800
The balance is 900, right?

459
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,880
900 ls black should get executed.

460
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,560
Right? Go.

461
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,960
You need to spend more right?

462
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,280
Credit cards. Want us to spend more?

463
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,240
Do you have a credit card? Sure.

464
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,000
Now let's test that.

465
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,400
If black works right,
If black works are 2000.

466
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,080
Right? And they go.

467
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,480
So either white and I enter values,
my code works.

468
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,160
Right.

469
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,720
And as you may see,
some of you went for the bowling, right.

470
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,600
Some of you want to to capture yes or no.

471
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,320
Can you do it?

472
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,600
Of course you can do it now, let me ask
you guys, let's look into this code.

473
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,680
But now,
instead of capturing true or false,

474
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,120
instead of capturing true

475
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,200
or false, I want to capture yes or no,
How can I do it?

476
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,800
Guess.

477
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,760
And based on death, we will.

478
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,800
We need to fix our statement. Right?

479
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,120
Okay. Yes. So, no, it's a word.

480
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,360
So we will use it.

481
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,400
We need to capture a string. Right.

482
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,960
Let's go top to the bottom
to fix in our code right up to the bottom.

483
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,440
So first now I'm not capturing boolean.

484
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,600
I need to capture string now. Right.

485
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
So now instead of the next boolean,

486
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,040
I will go for next. Right.

487
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,800
And you guys see right away.

488
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,080
Right away what happens in here.

489
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,200
You get in the arrow in here, right?

490
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,680
Because your job is smart.

491
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,160
Your job is smart.

492
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,720
So your job in your Java nodes, hey,

493
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,480
you will be capturing
a string type of value right here.

494
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,040
You expecting to capture a string?

495
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,360
Then why are you trying to store it
inside a bullet?

496
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,000
Right. So right away your java knows.

497
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh, okay.

498
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,960
If I'm right, if I'm trying
to capture a string, of course I shoot

499
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,120
stored inside a string type of variable.

500
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,600
Right.

501
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,960
So we will achieve this string in here.

502
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,320
String.

503
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,960
Okay.

504
00:26:44,960 --> 00:27:04,400
So now
why the line 22 complains right now.

505
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,000
Now. Right.

506
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,760
Okay, let me.

507
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,520
Let me see if card equals

508
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,480
they go. Can this in right.

509
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,800
So now when you think, okay,
now my condition is of

510
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,160
which type is a value of the string type.

511
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,000
Now how my EVE statement works,

512
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,960
my issue statement works
only with a bowling condition.

513
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,040
So now from this string,
I need to get a bowling.

514
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,600
Right. So
now it means I have to compare it right?

515
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,560
So now what we will use,
we will use equals.

516
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,240
Right?

517
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,080
And which answer are you expecting?

518
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,120
You expected. Yes. Right.

519
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,360
Expecting. Yes.

520
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
And now let's try this. Let's try.

521
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,960
Do you have a credit card?

522
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,280
Yes. What is the balance on your credit
card? 300.

523
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,160
They go right.

524
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,480
So whichever option you get selected,
as long as you

525
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,480
put the right logic
in there, you exercise will work right.

526
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,480
Oh, that's another

527
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,240
that's another good option.

528
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,440
Dice. Right.

529
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,480
When we talk about the case
sensitivity, Right.

530
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Case sensitivity.

531
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,160
Right now, what we look at

532
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,440
in this scenario

533
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
when we enter it.

534
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,800
Yes, right.

535
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,120
We in 30 years and it was stored
inside this variable right.

536
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,800
So now here, technically,
what are we saying?

537
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,680
Hey, is this small. Yes.

538
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,800
Equals to another small. Yes. Right.

539
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,240
And of course, condition was true.

540
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,600
That's why
then I was prompt to this question.

541
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,120
To this question Why?

542
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,400
Because I was entering my East
block right.

543
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,080
So now let's see what happens.

544
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,440
Let's see what happens

545
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,240
if I'm going to enter big.

546
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,440
Yes, right.

547
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,160
And you put the breakpoint in here
so you guys will see where my for will go.

548
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,760
We have a credit card.

549
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,560
I, I entered just

550
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,680
the first password case right.

551
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,760
Well,

552
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,000
here is the beauty also when we do in

553
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,840
when we doing the debugging right.

554
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,680
So now on the here and you guys
will see this window of variables.

555
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,040
Right.

556
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,560
You have a window variables
if you don't have it.

557
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,160
Remember this to bring anything you will
just type in here variables, right?

558
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,800
So this way
you can see their values, right?

559
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,480
No, in here.

560
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,800
Variable input. Right.

561
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,200
It refers to our scanner.

562
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,000
Now the value of the condition.

563
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,600
Right.

564
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,080
The value of the condition is big.

565
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,400
Yes. Right.

566
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,680
So now you compare and hey, is this the.

567
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,880
Yes. Yes.

568
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,040
We close to this? Yes.

569
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:02,520
What do you guys think
is the true or false?

570
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,360
So condition is false because everything
inside this string is matter.

571
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,960
Right?

572
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,400
So now your code book will go right away
into that spot, Right?

573
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,120
It will go to the else point.

574
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,120
So the same thing when you look right now,
a syntax is correct.

575
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,640
Right? There is no issues with my syntax.

576
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,280
But then logically
I should not be getting this output right.

577
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,240
Logically,
I should be prompt and ask all this

578
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,200
questions
that are there inside of Eve block.

579
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,640
Right. So now how do we fix this? Right?

580
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,080
So now when you comparing two strings,
right, when you compare it to strings,

581
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,080
if you want to ignore the case in right.

582
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,840
You saying, hey,
I don't care if you enter me big. Yes.

583
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,080
Or if you enter me small. Yes.

584
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,560
Because yes is what? Yes is yes. Right.

585
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,600
Whether you entered big or or small.

586
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,240
So there's an option from our string.

587
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,360
Or we can use
we can use option that says equals

588
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,800
is in our case.

589
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,440
Right.

590
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:10,160
So it means hey, regardless
if you enter me, big is small.

591
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,880
Yes, I don't care.

592
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,840
I will just compare the actual values.

593
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,560
Right.

594
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,200
I will ignore the keys and
and then compare those string values.

595
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,720
Right now, let's try.

596
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,800
You have a credit card?

597
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,080
I'm entering big. Yes.

598
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,040
Write them entering big. Yes. Right.

599
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,920
So now when I'm entering, big is right.

600
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,640
So in here, what is the condition?

601
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,280
What is the value of My variable?
Condition is big.

602
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,680
Yes. Right.

603
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,720
So now in here
you have your big years, right?

604
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,560
And then you say saying, hey, us

605
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,400
ignore, ignore any creation

606
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,920
and check is yes is equal to this.

607
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,960
And then this is
because we are ignoring the case.

608
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,160
Now the condition will become true.

609
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,560
We're going inside.

610
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,680
So now we will ask in
what is the balance on the card?

611
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,080
Right.

612
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,360
The next step we are expecting
for a balance and let's enter.

613
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,840
It's 3000, right?

614
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,840
So now we capture the balance.

615
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,880
You guys will see
right now balance also right

616
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,640
in you.

617
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,720
That is 3000.

618
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,120
But because now
the conversion happened again, right?

619
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,560
The conversion happened again.

620
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,640
You enter 3000, you stored it inside
the double tap of value.

621
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,920
That's why there is a got added.

622
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,560
And now we take in our
if condition, right.

623
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,600
In this case this if condition
became truly going inside this

624
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,640
if block execute
any block and exit in all my

625
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,160
if statements faith

626
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,520
why didn't the letter look

627
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,000
like my did you did you try

628
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,120
did you try is the big true
I want you to try it first

629
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,320
how can we are like yes, yes, yes.

630
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,040
All right.

631
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,760
Even if you're going to it, it's
it's depen Alexander.

632
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,240
Look,

633
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,960
if you want to enter in the spaces, right.

634
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,560
So let's see what happens.

635
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,040
We have a credit card. Yes. Yes. Right.

636
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,080
Which

637
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,840
will remember what is the option.

638
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,760
Let's does option next.

639
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,640
What it will take?

640
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,880
It will take only f first valid
before this space.

641
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,920
So it will ignore everything else
that you're going to have.

642
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,320
Okay.

643
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,120
Will ignore everything else that you have.

644
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,400
But then later
it will give you some issue.

645
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,800
Might give you some issue here. Okay.

646
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
But if you if you looked into

647
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,120
but if you looked into the condition,
you see what it did, it took only one.

648
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,200
Yes. Okay. It took only one.

649
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,160
So now you going you will get in
some error a little bit later.

650
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,680
Right.

651
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,480
You will get something
that are a little bit later.

652
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,640
So that's why this whenever you are,
if you want to capture only one value,

653
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:20,040
make sure you go for a next E, okay,
So let me explain it to you guys.

654
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,040
I'll just explain it
very briefly not to confuse you.

655
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,240
Right.

656
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,880
So let me try to dig.

657
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,080
So you write different notes or

658
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,680
or if you

659
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,920
want to do this,
if you want to try different answers.

660
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,480
Right.

661
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,560
If you want to enter different answers,
for example yes.

662
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,680
Yeah. Yep.

663
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,280
Then it means you will have to test

664
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:48,480
this condition for multiple values
you want to check is the condition

665
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,360
equals to use or condition equals to you
or condition equals two. Yep.

666
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,320
Whatever the values you want. Right.

667
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,720
You will have to put them
all in one statement.

668
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,040
Okay.

669
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,680
You will have to change them
all in one statement.

670
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,600
And now this is
will be our today's topic, guys.

671
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,520
They will be our today's topic.

672
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,440
Hey what if I want to test
multiple condition in the same statement?

673
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,160
Okay.

674
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,880
So for that
we need to use something different

675
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,920
because when you look in here goes right
We say, hey,

676
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,400
if condition equals two,
yes we test in only one condition.

677
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,600
But the news question was, Hey,
what if I want to test another condition?

678
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,240
I want to say
if my condition will be equal to.

679
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,840
Yeah.

680
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,360
And then maybe more and more and more.

681
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,960
Right.

682
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,080
So now we have not learned this option
yet, but we will be learning it today.

683
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,120
How can we test two
or more condition in one statement?

684
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,600
Okay.

685
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:52,080
Because so far, everywhere you look,
guys, everywhere you look, how many

686
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,120
how many condition between

687
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,400
testing inside one
if statement you test in one condition.

688
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,240
Here inside this
if statement you tested one condition.

689
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,000
But can you test to a more? Yes, you can.

690
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,680
After today's topic.

691
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,800
After today's topic, we can do it

692
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,280
also on the choice

693
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,840
between boolean versus string.

694
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,120
Okay.

695
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,560
So maybe in this scenario, this is will be
this is very optional for you, right?

696
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,920
This is depend how you structuring
your program in the real test scenario.

697
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,280
Of course would go for a string. Right.

698
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,960
And we will provide
multiple multiple options.

699
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,680
Right.

700
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,800
But in our scenario we could have use
boolean we could of use string.

701
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,520
Right.

702
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,160
And also I saw some of you guys,
you just use the use

703
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,800
that I tried
to capture one single character.

704
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,880
So I would go probably for a boolean
or I would go for next,

705
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,080
I would go for capturing strings.

706
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,960
So all thing in here, guys, was

707
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,120
the goal, right?

708
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,760
We always
look at the goal of the exercise.

709
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,080
What are we trying to practice?

710
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,200
This practice would as long as you use
scanner right

711
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,320
it means you are practicing Skinner

712
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,520
and as long as you understand
that you have to go for nesting.

713
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,720
Right? That was the whole purpose.

714
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,440
What whether you use Boolean,
whether you next.

715
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,880
That was, that was up to you.

716
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,640
Basic either or.

717
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,800
We saw in both variation either
or gives us the right output

718
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,720
right in

719
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,120
any questions?

720
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:39,400
Good questions.

721
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,720
Okay. I hope it's good. Right.

722
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,960
And this is was very similar guess right

723
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,280
this is was very similar.

724
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,800
So in here

725
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,280
we had to capture the years.

726
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,400
Right.

727
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,200
And we have to capture

728
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,480
as salary years.

729
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,080
Right. And eligible in salary. Right.

730
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,240
Yeah.

731
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,880
You guys can.

732
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,160
Right.

733
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,600
So we said hey only only right only
and only if you your work

734
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,520
for more than five five years
then we will consider a bonus.

735
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:17,960
Right.

736
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,640
And then we will consider a bonus. Right.

737
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,800
But if you as a work less than five
years, we're not looking into the bonus.

738
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,320
Right.

739
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,120
So the same thing to options
you need in Right.

740
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,800
You needed this Skinner
right. Is the help of Skinner.

741
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,320
You need you to capture a year

742
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,560
right You need to get the you
and you needed to capture the salary

743
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,640
and then we will have to go
for the next part, right?

744
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,120
We won't have to go for a nested part.

745
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,560
Okay.

746
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,320
One of what's for the homework, right?

747
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,760
That was the homework. Okay,

748
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,520
so this class goes to this class

749
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,120
we will still continuously use in our
if statements.

750
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,720
We will still continuously use
in our skinner.

751
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,360
Right.

752
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,440
And we will use a different variation of
if statement, whether it will be nested,

753
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,000
whether it will be just using
if else blocks.

754
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,840
Right. So we'll continue to use it.

755
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,040
All of that.

756
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,400
The only thing today
what we will try to look right

757
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,280
this scenario that we just look right now.

758
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,560
Right. Okay.

759
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,120
What if I want to test

760
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,960
multiple conditions, right.

761
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,880
Multi pole conditions in one statement.

762
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,120
Right. In one statement.

763
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,920
I'm not talking about
testing it in separate statements.

764
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,480
Right.

765
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,040
So in here, for example, right now

766
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
where we added

767
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,080
English class three, right, Right.

768
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,760
In here, when you look into it,

769
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
you are testing multiple conditions,
right?

770
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,680
Multiple conditions.

771
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,520
But you test in them inside
different statements, right?

772
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,280
You check.

773
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,360
And hey, if these equals to one,
you check in inside your if right here.

774
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,160
If these equals to two,

775
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,040
you check in inside it else if right
and then these equals strategic

776
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,920
and inside another else
if you are still testing in one condition

777
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,000
but do you have multiple,
multiple conditions.

778
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But in one statement only one write
only one condition in one statement.

779
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,320
So you know, hey,
what if there would be scenario?

780
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,760
For example, I want to see
if the day is Saturday or Sunday.

781
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,240
Right.

782
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:41,200
Hey, if the days six or seven,
I have a Java class, right.

783
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:41,960
Okay.

784
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,160
If the day is I don't know.

785
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,000
The day is Tuesday and Wednesday.

786
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,240
I have no class. Right.

787
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,640
So now what do you want to do?

788
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,680
Just you want to do test two conditions

789
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,080
and you want to combine them
under one statement, right?

790
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,680
In order for us to do that,

791
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,200
Java have something that
all logical operators.

792
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,480
Okay,

793
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,560
so logical all platonist

794
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,240
right.

795
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,920
So why do we use logical methods? Right?

796
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,960
Always remember this.
Try to understand why.

797
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,280
Right.

798
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,320
We'll try to understand

799
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:22,120
why do we need a if statement one
We want to check the condition.

800
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,040
Why do you want to have
that ls block inside

801
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,840
your even when you want to provide
the otherwise conditions, right?

802
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,480
Why do you want to go for it?

803
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,840
If else if when you want to test
multiple conditions right.

804
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,920
Why do you want to go for nested
when you have one condition

805
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,040
has a dependency on the other? Right.

806
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,440
Or we are saying what do we want to do?

807
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,840
A further check
based on the true condition.

808
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,760
Right. Okay.

809
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,960
Do we take any medication? Yes, I do.

810
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,400
Okay, now let's do the further chip.

811
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,680
So now when do we go for a logical
upgrade?

812
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,640
Is right. So many things in there.

813
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,800
Logical operators we use when we want

814
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,120
when we want to test two or more.

815
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,480
Two or more. Right.

816
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,720
It doesn't have to be
just a two or more condition

817
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:19,280
In one statement.

818
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,880
Right.

819
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,880
Hey, if the days equals two, Saturday

820
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,360
or day is equal to Sunday,
then to have a Java class, right?

821
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,960
Our test in either days equals to Saturday
or the days equals to Sunday.

822
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,520
I want you just to condition
in once statement in one statement.

823
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,640
So in this case
we need to go for logical operators.

824
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,280
Okay.

825
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:54,400
How many logical operators are there guys?

826
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,680
Okay, so what do we have?

827
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,280
We have the logical end, right?

828
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,280
We have the logical or

829
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,960
or we have the logical not right.

830
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,560
Not so not.

831
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,040
It will be reverse in that condition.

832
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,240
We will start looking one by one case,
Right?

833
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,480
Logical.

834
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,080
Where do you go?

835
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,680
And we will specify using 2% sign.

836
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,160
Right? You want emphasis.

837
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,120
So now think of this when you test two

838
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,680
or more conditions,
there's a different variations we can get.

839
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,360
Right?

840
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,400
So think on one condition on the left.

841
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,240
One condition on the right. Right.

842
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,280
So now, because we do test
a bowling values, right,

843
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,080
we do take a bool invalid,
How many bowling type of values?

844
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,320
Bowling. How many variations bowling has

845
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:50,960
bowling?

846
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,040
So only two.

847
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,840
Right? You can be true or false.

848
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,520
So now when we test
two condition is right.

849
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,960
So first of all,

850
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,200
first condition on the left can be true

851
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,560
and condition on the right can be true.

852
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,400
Right then we will have one condition.

853
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,040
On the left can be true and the condition
on the right and replace right.

854
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,760
Then we will switch them.

855
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,800
Condition on the left will be false

856
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,640
and oops,

857
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,520
end condition on the right will be true
or we can have that.

858
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Both condition on the left
and on the right can be false.

859
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,120
Right?

860
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,880
Both and false.

861
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,040
Right.

862
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,400
So when we check in two conditions

863
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,000
using and our prayer, right.

864
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,800
So when we check in the condition,
use and operator

865
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,680
you and will give you a true value only

866
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,800
and only
when both conditions are true, it.

867
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,760
So in here you will get one
big picture everywhere else.

868
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,240
Your end can

869
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,440
you and

870
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,960
operator if you going to check
one condition is true

871
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,720
and another condition is false
and then you will get big false in here.

872
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,960
If one condition is false, the other one
is truth, you still going to get false.

873
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,200
And of course, if both condition false,
if condition on the left is false

874
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,640
and the condition on the right is false,
then you will get one big false

875
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,240
thing. Right.

876
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,400
So now let's look in an example.

877
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:38,600
Let's look in an example, for example.

878
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,440
Right.

879
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,960
I'm going to take two variables

880
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:51,720
that will be called

881
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,720
by example, right?

882
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,760
Pick one variable.

883
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,920
Right. Let's take one variable.

884
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,600
So I will ask you. Right.

885
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,320
We're not going to scan that.

886
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,040
What we will take variable about
if you enjoy the class.

887
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,840
Right. Or let's
see if you understand our Java class.

888
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,800
Right. So I will say boolean

889
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,000
and this then.

890
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,240
Yeah. Right. Understand Java.

891
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,200
So as we said,
boolean can have only two options.

892
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,440
Tool, right.

893
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,160
For example, do you understand Java? This

894
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,960
I hope you guys do.

895
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,760
I hope you guys do.

896
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,400
And remember in the class

897
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,400
you don't have to get all hundred percent
as long as you get it.

898
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,800
7675, 80.

899
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,040
Then you just
you'll just have to practice more.

900
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,200
All right.

901
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,120
For example, if I want to write it,

902
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,400
if I want to write this simple statement,
right.

903
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,280
If you understand Java,
then then good job.

904
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,720
If you don't understand it, then
maybe you need to put more efforts right?

905
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,000
Or if you understand,
we'll just say that is awesome, right?

906
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,760
That is awesome.

907
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,960
For example, now
I'll say Eve and then I'll say, Understand

908
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,120
spell right.

909
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,480
If you understand, you will just say,

910
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:26,440
This is awesome.

911
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,160
That is awesome, right?

912
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,560
Otherwise, if you don't understand,
then probably I would tell you that

913
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,800
you guys need to put a little more
emphasis right,

914
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,400
because we usually end

915
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,120
right before you.

916
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,120
If you do understand, then I do.

917
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,680
Guys believe you practiced a lot.

918
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,880
Or maybe this is just
naturally coming to you, right?

919
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,000
So in here, I'll just say I would say

920
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:00,000
you probably need to study more, to

921
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,240
study more.

922
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,720
Right.

923
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,680
So in here, this is very easy for you
now, right, guys?

924
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,760
You just one condition, right?

925
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,280
And based on the true statement,
your eve block will get executing right?

926
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,160
So now what
if I want to add another variable right?

927
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,840
I want to add another boolean.

928
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,120
Enjoy. Right.

929
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,160
And so I enjoy Java. So now

930
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:30,840
whether

931
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,440
you are in this day and in,
but maybe you're not enjoying,

932
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,640
but maybe you do understand,
but maybe you don't enjoy it, right?

933
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:40,280
Or maybe you don't understand,
but you still enjoy.

934
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,360
Could be different variations, right?

935
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,680
So now the best.

936
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,440
The best probably, if you guys understand
and then do it right.

937
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:53,040
But so now, hey,
you know what I want to say?

938
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,960
Hey, if you understand Java

939
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,600
and enjoy Java at the same time, right?

940
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,360
If you understand and enjoy, that's
probably the best combination, right?

941
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,920
So now it means what I want to do.

942
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,920
I want to test multiple condition.

943
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:13,200
Hey, if you understand
and you if you enjoy.

944
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:13,800
Right.

945
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,480
So now if I'm just going
to put two statements like that,

946
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,640
Java will come
and Joe will say, Hey, hold on, hold on.

947
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,440
I have true in here
and a half truth in here.

948
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,640
So now I have two conditions in there
also.

949
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,360
Now, if you trying to test two
or more condition

950
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,600
inside our one statement, right then
Java says, you know,

951
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,320
now I'm giving you an and operator.

952
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,280
And so now as soon as you going to enter
in, now our error is gone.

953
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,240
So now you have condition
that is on the left

954
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,960
and you have a condition on the right.

955
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:51,640
Right.

956
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,480
So in this variation,

957
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,600
what we're looking
hey, what is the value of understanding?

958
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:06,720
What is the value of understand?

959
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,200
The value of understand is true, true.

960
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,160
What is the value of enjoy?

961
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,960
Sure. Right.

962
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,120
So now you have to true condition
and what am I using?

963
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,280
Amusing and operate.

964
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,880
So true and true.

965
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,880
What is true and true.

966
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,360
Going to going to give me

967
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,680
is going to give me now
what I'm going to get.

968
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,600
I'm going when I come by this to condition

969
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,080
using the end operator,

970
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,600
I'm going to get one big truth.

971
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,160
So now when my condition is true,
can I go inside

972
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:56,040
a book?

973
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,680
One condition is true. Yes.

974
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,080
I'm given the green light.

975
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,520
My condition is passed now.

976
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,960
I will go.

977
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,720
And what I'm going to do, I'm
going to execute this statement, Right?

978
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,160
I'm going to give you this statement
right.

979
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,920
That is awesome.
There you go. I got the output

980
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,240
right.

981
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,960
What I'll let's say

982
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,440
what could be the other variation?

983
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,400
Maybe you understand.

984
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,200
You understand?

985
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,200
Yes. You understand what
maybe you don't enjoy, right?

986
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,960
Maybe you don't enjoy it.

987
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,360
Maybe you don't enjoy it now. Right.

988
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,760
So now let's check.

989
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,640
Okay? Sure.

990
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,680
Now let's see what it will be.

991
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,000
What is the value of understand Java?

992
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Understand is true, right?

993
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,680
Understand is true.

994
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,000
What is the value of enjoying Java?

995
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,280
Enjoy. Java is false.

996
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,400
Now which operator I'm using
amusing the end

997
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,080
operator True and false.

998
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,360
True and false.

999
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,720
What is going to give me?

1000
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,640
It's going to give me a false right.

1001
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,720
So now what I'm going to get I'm
going to get a big false.

1002
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:08,640
Now can I go inside
if my Boolean condition is false?

1003
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,920
No, my access is declined.

1004
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,800
So now your code will go to the else part.

1005
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,480
Right?

1006
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,000
So now the way the operator works,

1007
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,360
in order for that,

1008
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,720
in order for the end operator, in order

1009
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,480
for the upward to give you a big true,
you need both conditions to be true,

1010
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,800
if you will have the variation,
true, false, or for example,

1011
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,920
false and true,
you are still going to get a false right.

1012
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,600
Or for example, now maybe you two.

1013
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,200
So let's run this one.

1014
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,320
You probably need to study more.

1015
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,520
Well, because this condition was true,
this false, and then you get false.

1016
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,760
Now, if you going to change to false,
right.

1017
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,640
We said, hey, if one condition is false
and another condition is false,

1018
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,720
obviously you're going to get false.

1019
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,880
If you work with one
but one it's considered to be,

1020
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,040
it's a little bit different.

1021
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,280
Operator So for the logical

1022
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,800
the logical upgrade is this

1023
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:21,600
we are going to use to importance.

1024
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,000
Okay.

1025
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,720
So now let's look into another example.

1026
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,800
This let's look into another example.

1027
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,720
Okay.

1028
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,800
So for example, this, right,

1029
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,680
For example, when we have a numbers, right

1030
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,760
when we have a numbers, for example,
right.

1031
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,160
For example, we can add this.

1032
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,040
Skinner
So let's do this this weekend as the user.

1033
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,160
Let's do this assignment. Now

1034
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,240
we can say ask the user

1035
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,560
to enter a number right

1036
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,960
now based on the entry number, right?

1037
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,080
Based on the entry number and the number

1038
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,760
three

1039
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,280
based on the third number.

1040
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:12,840
Right.

1041
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,320
We will find

1042
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,080
the number is it number

1043
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,120
is small,

1044
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,800
medium or large, right.

1045
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,600
Or extra large, whatever.

1046
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,560
So now what is my definition?

1047
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,640
What is my definition of small, medium
and large?

1048
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,880
Right.

1049
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,640
So I'm going to say, hey, even number

1050
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,720
it number is is

1051
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,280
between one and ten one instance, right?

1052
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,760
Or it means my number
has to be greater than one,

1053
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,120
but less than ten right at the same time.

1054
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,520
So I'm going to say this number is small.

1055
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,720
If I'm going to say if number is

1056
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,840
between 11 and 100,

1057
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,080
it means my number has to be smaller

1058
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,960
or it has to be larger than 11.

1059
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:25,920
But at the same time, it has to be
it has to be smaller than 100.

1060
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,640
I'm going to say
this is the medium number, right?

1061
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,600
And then we can have this number is

1062
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,120
between, let's say, one or one in

1063
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,800
1000.

1064
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,440
Then we going to say,
this is the large number, right?

1065
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,080
This is the large number.

1066
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:45,120
And can we do more?

1067
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,000
If number is more than right,
This number is more than

1068
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,600
than 1001.

1069
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,600
Right.

1070
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:58,440
We're going to see the number is extra,
extra large, right.

1071
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,440
Okay. So that is my scenario, right?

1072
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,080
That is missing there. Okay.

1073
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,040
So now we do analyze.

1074
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,640
We do analyze
right before we start quoting.

1075
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,040
You do analyze.

1076
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,640
So I want
you ask a user to enter a number, right?

1077
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,760
I want to ask the user to enter number.

1078
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,720
What are we going to use this?

1079
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,080
We are going to use a scanner, right?

1080
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,480
With the help of scanner,
we will be capturing integer value.

1081
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,080
Now, you have multiple conditions, right?

1082
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,000
You have multiple conditions.

1083
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,400
So when you want to test
multiple conditions, we will go for

1084
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,080
if else if else if blocks right.

1085
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,120
But now we will look okay within one
if statement.

1086
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,720
Right within one within one e block

1087
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,560
I want to test you conditions.

1088
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:55,960
I want to test
that my number is greater than one

1089
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,000
and at the same time is less than ten.

1090
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:05,800
So it means within one statement
I have to test two or more conditions.

1091
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,480
Now you have to think, okay, no,
I will have to use

1092
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,280
I will have to use a logical operator.

1093
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:12,760
Right.

1094
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,800
So once you have your plan,
then we can start doing it right.

1095
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,520
So let's create our scanner, guys.

1096
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,520
Equal review

1097
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,760
scanner, and then

1098
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,240
you see this

1099
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,800
morning, importing scanner, right?

1100
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,400
Once it's important.

1101
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:43,080
Now let's ask let's given instructions
right.

1102
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,080
You can say please enter

1103
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,920
any number.

1104
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,280
Any number. Right.

1105
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,600
This is fine within there. Any number.

1106
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,720
Okay.

1107
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,440
So now we will start. Okay.

1108
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,080
I want to capture a number.

1109
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,480
So how am I going to capture this

1110
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,520
number?

1111
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,000
Integer number.

1112
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:21,160
So how are we going to capture?

1113
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,960
So we will take the variable
that refers to our scanner number.

1114
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,160
We trying to capture the number next

1115
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,400
right?

1116
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,080
Next integer.

1117
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,800
Okay.

1118
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,640
So did
we ask a user to enter the number? Yes.

1119
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,640
We asked the user to enter the number.

1120
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,880
We captured the number.

1121
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,000
Yes, we are capturing the number. Okay.

1122
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,400
So now once we capture,
then what do we have?

1123
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,880
We have to throw the information, right?

1124
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,600
We have to throw this condition.

1125
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,240
And here I have multiple FS, Right?

1126
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,680
Multiple is
how do I test multiple conditions?

1127
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,560
I'll go for a

1128
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,040
block.

1129
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:58,680
Right.

1130
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,160
But now within this even else

1131
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,360
block, I have to test multiple permission.

1132
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:08,720
Now what else say hey, if mum.

1133
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,480
So what?

1134
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:14,000
My condition, my first condition
number has to be greater than one

1135
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,960
and at the same time, number

1136
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,680
has to be less than ten right

1137
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,520
in is just a variable.

1138
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,320
This is just a variable. Right.

1139
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,920
So now what
are we trying to do within one?

1140
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,000
If we then one is statement.

1141
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,760
I am testing two condition. Okay.

1142
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,840
If the number is greater than one
and the number

1143
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,360
to less than ten
to test two more conditions.

1144
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,600
If you want to test them together,
then Java gives us

1145
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,720
a logical operator stuff.

1146
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,560
Right?

1147
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:52,200
So hey, in this condition is true

1148
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,000
and this condition is true,
So we're going to say it's all

1149
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,560
paginated

1150
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:08,640
means is small, but it is just so.

1151
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,000
And then we will say the number
that you captured is small.

1152
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,800
Do I have another set of conditions?

1153
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,400
Yes, I do. Right.

1154
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,360
Get me out of your course.

1155
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,080
The point we can include one.

1156
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,440
We can include one. Right?

1157
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,440
We include one.

1158
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,600
Do I have another condition to test?

1159
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,040
Yes, I do.

1160
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,160
How do we add
How do we test more conditions?

1161
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:39,960
What do I need to add now?

1162
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,520
Right now, we'll go for it.

1163
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,240
Else you'll have more conditions to test.

1164
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,200
I do have more condition to test.

1165
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,680
Okay. What's your condition now?

1166
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,960
My number. Right.

1167
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,760
If you want to include you here, guys,
just decide up. Right.

1168
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,720
If you want to include the ten
or you don't want to include the ten.

1169
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,800
So yeah, maybe I included ten.

1170
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:05,360
So now if the number between 11 and 100,
so now my number has to be greater

1171
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,440
equal than 11 and then the same time,
less or equal than 100.

1172
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:10,800
Right?

1173
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,920
I am test

1174
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,680
in another condition,
but I want to test two conditions.

1175
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,000
Right. Two conditions.

1176
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,760
So now what I'm going to use,
Can't we use more than one?

1177
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,320
No. Again,

1178
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,040
I should remember
so we can test two or more condition.

1179
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,360
Two or more condition.

1180
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,960
I say what's what's
why do you want us to stop

1181
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,440
while the train is going?

1182
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,320
It's raining as well.

1183
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,240
So what exactly?

1184
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,760
You are lost then It

1185
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:07,320
goes.

1186
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:12,360
No, right now, guys,
we're just listing out multiple conditions

1187
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,360
to which that multiple conditions
we use in the elseif.

1188
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,760
The What are we trying to learn today?

1189
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,840
We trying to learn how to test two
or more conditions in one state.

1190
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,280
Right.

1191
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,320
In one state now to test one condition.

1192
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,040
Second condition.

1193
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,840
Can that have one more conditions?

1194
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,800
Yes, I can add one more conditions,
but to test two or more condition

1195
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,200
inside one statement, we're using that

1196
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,040
and upgrade right now.

1197
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,720
Do I have to test
another set of condition?

1198
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,760
Yes, I do. To this.

1199
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,080
And then the set of condition
be going for it else.

1200
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,600
Even now within this else, if again,
what I'm doing

1201
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,160
just in one condition
and second condition right now,

1202
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,800
if this condition will be matched,
then we're going to see

1203
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,560
that number is one.

1204
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:10,120
Then there is also
that's more medium, medium.

1205
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,360
Do I have another conditions to test?

1206
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,760
Yes, I do. Okay.

1207
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,680
If you have another condition that does
go for LC. LC.

1208
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,840
Now within this else
if how many conditions you test in.

1209
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,280
I am just in one and two.

1210
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,760
Right. Okay.

1211
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,200
Then you only try
the logical operator. Right.

1212
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,800
So now you will see hey, if number is

1213
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,760
more equal

1214
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,800
than one one

1215
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,360
and a

1216
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:45,240
number has to be smaller
or equal than 1000.

1217
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:48,840
Right then you've been here.

1218
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:53,960
If this condition will be match,
our number will be large.

1219
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,080
Right. For

1220
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:05,160
one plus.

1221
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,600
Okay.

1222
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,400
You will have more conditions to test
this.

1223
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,560
Do have more conditions to test.

1224
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,280
Okay, so now you guys tell me,
do you guys want to go for else black

1225
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:27,760
or do you want to go for it else if work?

1226
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:28,640
Well, let's go.

1227
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,640
What else

1228
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,360
else we're going to say?

1229
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,560
You want to say the number is
extra large, right?

1230
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:42,920
It is extra.

1231
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:47,400
But we want that extra large, right?

1232
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,320
So we saying, hey, is any of this?

1233
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,520
And then we said, hey,
if number will be greater

1234
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:56,840
than all of those,
then we'll go for extra lunch.

1235
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,440
Right.

1236
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:58,960
And we will limit this.

1237
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,440
We will leave it then,
then we will test our code.

1238
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,600
Remember, at first,
even when you don't think

1239
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,280
of all the variation, it's fine.

1240
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:11,840
How are you going to start in and chicken
your code?

1241
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,440
You will start doing it only only by
providing different different values.

1242
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,160
Right?

1243
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,720
And we will test on this.

1244
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:24,000
So now to test my code, I need to
make sure that my if block was correctly,

1245
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,400
if you want to test

1246
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,040
this block, you want to test this block
and we want to test this block.

1247
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,400
And then

1248
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,400
and then we will do other things right,

1249
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:40,040
because eventually we will have to think
from different sides.

1250
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,840
Right? But at first,

1251
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,960
we will look into all positive

1252
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,520
cases, right into all positive
to test my code.

1253
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,560
And then we will try
to look in some other stuff.

1254
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:52,800
Right.

1255
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,480
We'll check groupers,
but for now, just be cool.

1256
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:01,000
Any time you want to test the all the,
all the positive scenarios,

1257
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:05,160
not like in terms of the positive numbers
but positive possible scenarios,

1258
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,360
you we'll call it the happy part
list lists, our happy pass scenarios.

1259
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,520
It means something that will fit
within this range, something that will fit

1260
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,880
within this range or within this range.

1261
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,760
Okay, guys,
let us let us finish with this example.

1262
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,000
And then if we have to do more,
we will do more.

1263
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,440
Okay.

1264
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,000
So we define

1265
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,800
as new.

1266
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:35,840
What?

1267
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,600
Isn't there any number I want to end now?

1268
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,720
I want to just this French way.

1269
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,240
Let me insert ten

1270
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,880
right.

1271
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,480
So now let's see what happens. Right?

1272
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,480
So now holds the value of ten, right?

1273
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,040
Holds the value of ten.

1274
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,120
So ten we enter it, right?

1275
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,440
Ten we enter it
and we store it inside this variable.

1276
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,920
Now all we're doing, we're just providing
different conditions for this variable.

1277
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,680
Right now. Let's check.

1278
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,320
Is the number larger than one?

1279
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,440
Is a condition true or wholes case

1280
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,920
condition is true.

1281
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,840
Is the number less than ten

1282
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:29,920
less or equal?

1283
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,480
Right? Less or equal.

1284
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,360
Look at the operator. True.

1285
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:37,560
So now we're using end, true and true.

1286
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,960
What is going to give me

1287
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,120
going to give me true?

1288
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,120
Can I go inside
and then go inside my block? Now

1289
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,600
I can go inside, right?

1290
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,240
Because now my condition has passed.

1291
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,240
Now what?

1292
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,720
I'm going to go
I'm going to go inside my block

1293
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:03,120
and I'm going to execute this statement
saying that the ten is small.

1294
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,760
What happens after I execute line 34?

1295
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:18,120
Guess what happens after execute line 34.

1296
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,360
So where am I will go?

1297
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,040
Well, my code will go and check
other conditions or my code exists

1298
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,960
even if statement

1299
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,080
it will end right. Why?

1300
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,120
Because you're outside of the entire
if statement

1301
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,120
that consist of different,
only one gets executed.

1302
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:38,640
Right?

1303
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,400
So after line 34 it is.

1304
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,840
It's your eve statement
and that's it, right?

1305
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,400
You will stop.

1306
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,040
That's right.

1307
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,360
So condition became true

1308
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:57,360
now executing the line 34
and then exit in the main method.

1309
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,560
Right. Okay

1310
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,800
now let's check another condition.

1311
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,240
Please enter any number.

1312
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,480
Let's end there. 77. Right.

1313
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,200
Okay.

1314
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,480
Now what will happen

1315
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,920
Leathered if right if else.

1316
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,040
If it will go one by one by one
by one to check every condition

1317
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,040
is the number greater than one

1318
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,160
condition Troubles

1319
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,960
false.

1320
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,320
Is it smaller than ten?

1321
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,840
Oh, no, no, no.

1322
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,960
This is the number.

1323
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,400
Larger than one is the condition
to a false number larger than one.

1324
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,960
I entered 77

1325
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,320
and this condition is true.

1326
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,880
You confuse me. This condition is true.

1327
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,200
What about this one?

1328
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,040
Is the number less than ten

1329
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,440
Now we have in false.

1330
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,600
Now we are using an operator.

1331
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,400
Choosing false.

1332
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,560
What is going to give me?

1333
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,640
You will give me one big false, right?

1334
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,560
So now we'll get false.

1335
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:13,480
When I have false, can I enter the block?

1336
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,160
No. Right.

1337
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,680
So now what happens after this
when the condition is false?

1338
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:28,080
What happens next?

1339
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,680
Now it will go in, check another condition
like why lie to write this?

1340
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,440
Okay.

1341
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,520
That condition was false. That's fine.

1342
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,080
I'll go check this condition.
Now let's check.

1343
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:44,000
This condition is number
more than 11 days.

1344
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,760
Which condition is true?

1345
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:51,200
Is it less than 100?

1346
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:51,800
True.

1347
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:57,200
I'm using an operator.

1348
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,640
I'm going to get one bit true, right?

1349
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,600
I'm going to get one. Be true.

1350
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,720
So now when I get my true, now what I can
do, I can go inside the block.

1351
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,600
I will execute this statement right?

1352
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,480
As soon as I give you this statement,
then your quote will jump out of your one

1353
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:18,400
right?

1354
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,960
Oh, that condition was false.

1355
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,840
He was not able to enter.
Now check in this condition.

1356
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,880
Condition is true
and the rest will ignored.

1357
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,960
Right?

1358
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,680
Not try to enter. Enter any number.

1359
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,760
Let's enter 9000.

1360
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,040
Right. So you figures now

1361
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,480
out of the if statement.

1362
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,000
Right.

1363
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:50,320
So your call will go
and checks every single condition

1364
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,360
until it finds its true right

1365
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,400
here we have Hey is number more than one?

1366
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,240
Yes number is more than one.

1367
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,560
Condition is true but here is false right

1368
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:05,320
it will be skip K is number more than 11.

1369
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:10,000
Yes, condition is true,
but number is not less than 100.

1370
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
The condition is right.

1371
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:12,960
Okay.

1372
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,360
Is number is more than one on
one condition is true.

1373
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,440
Hey is number is less than 1000.

1374
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:25,760
No condition is false in now
because everywhere we use in an operator.

1375
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,640
Right.

1376
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,960
In order for the end to give me a true
in order for the end to give me a true

1377
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:36,080
what conditions must be true
everywhere else, it will give me false.

1378
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:36,680
Right.

1379
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,680
So now when your quote goes check, this

1380
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,600
condition equals
it went to check this condition.

1381
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,320
Then in the one to check this condition.

1382
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,840
Now, when none of this condition
give me the true where our code will go.

1383
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:55,240
Guys.

1384
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,320
All good. We'll go.

1385
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,080
All good.

1386
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,240
We'll jump into the Elkhorn
and it will execute the state

1387
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,480
checks one by one, goes to the else

1388
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,600
go right.

1389
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,120
So now what we did
as we look into the happy scenario, right?

1390
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,600
We tried to test the happy password.

1391
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,680
The number could fit either here
or either here, either here either here.

1392
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:23,640
Now, we got to think outside of the box
right now.

1393
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,840
We better think
a little bit outside of the box.

1394
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:27,840
Yep. That's.

1395
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,720
What are we going to try?

1396
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,040
Marieme can, you please try to send
your code in the support channel.

1397
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,440
Right.

1398
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,560
So now let's try this year. Right?

1399
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,840
So you see, now
you start thinking differently.

1400
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,440
Why isn't there any number? Zero.

1401
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,840
So now where are you?

1402
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:53,600
Well, what are this thing?

1403
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,200
Which block
you will go to the else block. Why?

1404
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,640
Because this condition
will give you false.

1405
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,400
This condition will give you false.

1406
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,560
This condition will give you false
when none of the condition

1407
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,440
you a true, your code

1408
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:13,320
automatically goes
to the counterpart, right?

1409
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:17,280
It will automatically go to the false
false.

1410
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,200
It goes to the LS. Right.

1411
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,560
So now we're saying
zero is extra large number.

1412
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,040
So now when you look at the syntax,
once again,

1413
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:29,080
this our is statement is perfect, right?

1414
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,480
Our if statement is perfect,
there's no syntactical issues.

1415
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:36,360
But now what we have
we have a logical right.

1416
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,720
We made a logical mistake, right?

1417
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:40,800
So now how can we.

1418
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,720
But let me ask you guys, how can I fix it

1419
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,640
all? We can do this.

1420
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,760
We can do here instead of the end.

1421
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:02,240
There is a multiple ways
how we fix of this.

1422
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,440
There's a multiple ways how we can fix it.

1423
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,800
The easiest one that I can think of,
we can instead of the ls.

1424
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,240
Let's add elseif.

1425
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,080
And any time you use an ls,
if you have to provide the condition.

1426
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,040
What's your condition? This.

1427
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:27,400
What's my condition?

1428
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,920
In which case
you want to see this output? Yes.

1429
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,000
In which case, as we

1430
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:37,200
we want to give the output
for our extra large more.

1431
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:37,640
Right?

1432
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:40,800
LS even number is more

1433
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,440
or equal than or one of 1001.

1434
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,360
Right.

1435
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,120
So of Eve right now let's Eve.

1436
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:54,920
If you enter 9000 the way we did
it will go for extra large.

1437
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,640
So now what will happen

1438
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:02,200
now? What
will happen to us if I enter zero?

1439
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,360
What if I If I enter zero?

1440
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,520
What will happen?

1441
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,040
What thing will happen? Right.

1442
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,520
Nothing will happen.

1443
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:16,640
If you want something to happen,
then we can add that else block

1444
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,680
or Or what are we can do?

1445
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:24,120
Guys?

1446
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,760
Now, if you don't get out of this,
it will still get out.

1447
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,920
Look, let's let's let's enter zero right?

1448
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,080
And then number zero.

1449
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,560
So because it's that ls
if it's like a log,

1450
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,560
they will go check every single condition.

1451
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:46,440
And because right now we don't have
that elsewhere, nothing will get executed.

1452
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,080
Nothing will get executed.

1453
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:49,800
So you're stuck, right?

1454
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,080
You're stuck.

1455
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,480
So now. Right.

1456
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,840
We can add it at the very beginning.

1457
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:01,440
Yes. If you want to guess, we can add it
to the very beginning right now.

1458
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,840
At the very beginning.

1459
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,120
Before we go to that.

1460
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,480
Greater than one. Right.

1461
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,080
Why don't we add one if statement. Right.

1462
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,600
We can write another one.

1463
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,680
So now what are we can say?

1464
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,000
Hey, Eve's right.

1465
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:22,120
Eve number is less
than one will know what it is.

1466
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:27,320
We'll that work for zero
and for negative numbers.

1467
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,200
It will work, right?

1468
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,600
We can say, hey,
even number is less than one.

1469
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,640
What do we can say? Right?

1470
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,680
And of course, here
we will have to continue.

1471
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:36,920
We can say, see, it's all right.

1472
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,160
We can say see. So

1473
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,120
number is

1474
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,400
zero or negative, write zero a negative.

1475
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:49,400
And then instead of here,
we will just continue

1476
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,840
using this right for next week.

1477
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,160
I can be done this week. Right.

1478
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,560
So now when you think

1479
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:59,160
so, any time, right.

1480
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:01,800
Any time you enter

1481
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,760
zero it will fall on there
is this if block

1482
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,240
now if you enter

1483
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,600
now if you enter number it's
also will fit under here

1484
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,520
only normally only it will go this way
if the number will be

1485
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:19,320
greater than one right.

1486
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,600
This is always, always those things.

1487
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,160
But how we were able to add that option
only normally,

1488
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:30,240
only when we test our code with multiple,
multiple values.

1489
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,880
Right? Yeah.

1490
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,960
And once again, guys, look,

1491
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,800
we tested multiple conditions
to test multiple condition.

1492
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,560
We use an F else if right reason
if else if.

1493
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,560
Now the only difference
which we see this right here within this

1494
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:53,560
if you test in one condition,
we already know how to do it

1495
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,600
within the next.

1496
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:59,040
LC If you wanted to test one condition

1497
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,600
and second condition at the same time.

1498
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,440
Right.

1499
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,280
So in one statement, Right.

1500
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,880
So and then if you want to combine two
or more condition,

1501
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,680
that's why we use the end operator
here, here and here.

1502
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:16,440
In this particular scenario,
in this particular scenario,

1503
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,600
we also had only one condition.

1504
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,120
So there's no need for an
or any other operator.

1505
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:22,480
Right.

1506
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,680
And then again, this is what you do
after you fix your code,

1507
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,440
then you try to run recheck
multiple options, right.

1508
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:35,440
With any number zero,
they go number zero or negative.

1509
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,480
Please enter any number -900.

1510
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,880
They go number is zero or negative.

1511
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:44,880
Please enter any number.

1512
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,840
Let's enter 8000 variable. Right.

1513
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,200
It is extra large.

1514
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:53,320
So you're the one those who can define
whether you put the right logic

1515
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,480
or why are you did not put it right.

1516
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,080
Logic

1517
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,640
little break.

1518
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:04,560
Yes, guys anything I need
a little breaks for me to do.

1519
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,200
So let me leave this

1520
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,600
and let me

1521
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,760
let me break it

1522
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,400
in two classes
so this way this can keep it absolute

1523
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,880
for all of you.

1524
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:59,360
If course,

1525
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,000
you have both examples on your screen.

1526
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,400
So now you guys can take it.

1527
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,720
And meanwhile, guys, let's take a break

1528
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,920
until 1145, right?

1529
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:31,760
Okay.

1530
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,400
All right.

1531
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,480
We are back.

1532
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,680
Right back.

1533
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,640
Welcome back.

1534
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:41,440
I hope you guys get some recharge, right?

1535
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:42,920
Okay.

1536
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,600
So today, guys,

1537
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,960
we are looking our logical operators.

1538
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,640
Yep, I did start recording.

1539
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,840
Okay,
We're looking into the logical operators.

1540
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,080
Right. So why do we need logical?

1541
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,800
Yeah, well, whenever we want to test

1542
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,560
two or more conditions

1543
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,720
in one, right.

1544
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,080
So for now,
we'll look at the logical end, right?

1545
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,240
For now we'll look at the logical end.

1546
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,160
And once again,
this cannot be more conditions.

1547
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:16,120
Yes, you can add.

1548
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,360
More condition if you want.

1549
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,120
But when it comes to the end.

1550
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:26,280
Operator, in order for the end operator
to give us a true,

1551
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:30,360
all the conditions must have true
value, right?

1552
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,960
Whether it's true, whether it's free
or whether it's more than that.

1553
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,640
Right. Okay.

1554
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,800
So any questions for the logical end?

1555
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,920
Any questions for a logical end

1556
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:50,760
And you guys will be

1557
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:54,040
given assignments to you
guys will be given that sentence.

1558
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,200
And probably once we look into the.

1559
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,960
All right, now,

1560
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,640
you'll start making sense.

1561
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,240
Right?

1562
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,200
So now

1563
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,640
another operator that we have

1564
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:09,000
to test two or more conditions, right?

1565
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,520
Another operator
that we have, it's a logical or

1566
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,400
we identify using two pipelines.

1567
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,080
Right.

1568
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:20,040
So the same thing exact the same scenario
we can have.

1569
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,480
True. Right.

1570
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:25,320
We looking in the 2
to 2 scenarios, to a true

1571
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,400
rig, what are we going to have?

1572
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,200
We going to have

1573
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,200
exactly the same thing.

1574
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,480
But let me see this.

1575
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,360
The outputs will be different, right?

1576
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,320
Because right now,

1577
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,240
instead of the logical

1578
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:44,280
and we are going to have a logical or

1579
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:48,000
logical or logical or okay

1580
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,160
the way

1581
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,440
the logical or works, right,

1582
01:23:56,120 --> 01:24:02,040
as long as you have one true condition,
as long as you have

1583
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:07,360
one true condition, logical
or will view as is a true right.

1584
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,440
So in here true or true

1585
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:17,200
will give us a true, so true or false,

1586
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:21,160
it still will give me true one
because at least you have one condition

1587
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,520
that is true for so true
also, we'll give it true

1588
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,960
and the logical or we'll give you false

1589
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:34,080
only only when the both conditions are.

1590
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:39,200
So the difference in here you may see
for the logical end to give you true.

1591
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:43,120
Both conditions must be true
anywhere else you.

1592
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,880
See at least one false.

1593
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,160
It gives you false. Right?

1594
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:50,240
We'll use you false.

1595
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,320
Let's do pipelines. Yep. Two pipelines.

1596
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:57,280
The way the logical world works,
the way the logical What all works in

1597
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,800
give you true conditions

1598
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,600
As long one condition is true.

1599
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,320
Right?

1600
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,520
And we will look right
now, guys, into example, right? Why?

1601
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:10,760
I mean, this is how this logic
has been developed, right?

1602
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,080
This is how those operators work, right?

1603
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,320
So now let's look in an example. Right?

1604
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,760
Let's look in an example.

1605
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,440
For example, in

1606
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,040
the previous
assignment that we've done in here, right?

1607
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:29,440
The previous assignment
that we've done here.

1608
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:29,880
Right.

1609
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,920
So you guys had a question, right?

1610
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,000
You guys had a question, right.

1611
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,200
Hey, orders for this credit card, right?

1612
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:43,400
So when we have
when we asked for the credit card

1613
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:48,040
and we wanted to give an answer work
and you guys asked, hey,

1614
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:52,440
what if the answer will be yes, Yep, yeah,
whatever the answer is, right?

1615
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,560
How can we combine it? Right.

1616
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,080
So let me copy this.

1617
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:00,960
Guess I'm not going to go for this, that,
but I'm going to copy this.

1618
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,880
Right. I'm going to copy this.

1619
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,400
So now we will look,

1620
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,800
what if the variation will be?

1621
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,800
Yes, yep, yep.

1622
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:12,680
Or what are whatever
that things will be. Right. So let's take

1623
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:31,600
what the

1624
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,040
and I'll give it

1625
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:42,080
I'll just rename in the answer

1626
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,440
the exercise that we had
where we wanted to have a credit card

1627
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:48,480
right when you want
if you have a credit card.

1628
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,200
And here we try to capture the answer.

1629
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:52,760
Right.

1630
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,240
So we did this scenario

1631
01:26:56,240 --> 01:27:00,240
here, even the answer right in the answer.

1632
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:05,760
Well now I will I will not ignore
the cases because it will become too many.

1633
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,760
I'll just say you said, hey,
the answer will be

1634
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,960
equals

1635
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,440
equals two years.

1636
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,320
Right.

1637
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:18,280
And we say, hey, look, there
could be different variations, right?

1638
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,680
What if the user will say

1639
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,160
enter equals to Yep.

1640
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,960
Right. For example.

1641
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:31,440
Or what The answer will be?

1642
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,240
Answer will be equals.

1643
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,480
And so

1644
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,840
equals

1645
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,840
equals to yes.

1646
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:43,600
Right.

1647
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,640
For example. Right.

1648
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,640
This is just a sample. So now same thing.

1649
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:49,320
What are we looking right now in here?

1650
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,200
We wanted to say
please tell me about bank.

1651
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,200
Right. Something like this.

1652
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,560
We need the balance

1653
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:57,920
on the

1654
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,160
switch.

1655
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:05,640
So now what do we have inside?

1656
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,160
Want each statement.

1657
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:10,080
You to check multiple conditions.

1658
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,440
You want to check?

1659
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,400
Hey, the answer could be the years

1660
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,400
or the answer could be or the answer.

1661
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,480
It could be yes.

1662
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,680
So now it means you test
in more than one condition.

1663
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:26,400
To test more than one condition,
we have to go for a logical operator.

1664
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,000
Right.

1665
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,600
So now.

1666
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,680
In this case,

1667
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:33,280
I am going to use the or operator
and we going to see what if we will add.

1668
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,000
But for now, let's look at four or

1669
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,920
I'm going to see.

1670
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:41,560
Right.

1671
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:45,880
So as soon as I add my logical operators,
my job is happy.

1672
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,800
It means syntax is correct.

1673
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:51,200
So it just do a multiple conditions.

1674
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:55,440
You need to add logical or operator
or logical.

1675
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,240
Right? Okay.

1676
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:59,840
So now let's see how it will work. Right?

1677
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,400
Let's see.

1678
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:04,760
Do we have a credit card?

1679
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,880
I'm going to say yes, right?

1680
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,880
I want to say yes.

1681
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,240
So now in here you have
I will have to make a decision.

1682
01:29:12,240 --> 01:29:14,320
Joe will have to make a decision.

1683
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,040
So now Java will start

1684
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,440
thinking in our condition.

1685
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:18,960
Right

1686
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,040
now, this element is this condition

1687
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:27,680
in is yes equals to yes.

1688
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:30,080
Just condition is true.

1689
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:30,880
Okay.

1690
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:37,000
This condition, is it true or false?

1691
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,880
Yes. Equals to you

1692
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:42,400
know. Yes.

1693
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,600
Is this award the same as this words,

1694
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,440
this condition, true or false

1695
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,600
was false, right?

1696
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,960
Yes. Is equal to years,
but yes is not the same is.

1697
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,160
Yep. Right.

1698
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,680
So condition is here is false.

1699
01:29:59,160 --> 01:29:59,880
What about here?

1700
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,360
Is the condition true or false?

1701
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,160
The mission is false.

1702
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,760
But now we look

1703
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,840
and we look into the operator, right?

1704
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:15,640
We're saying, Hey, true or false, Right.

1705
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,720
And here we're also using the logical

1706
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:22,640
or now true or false,
what is going to give us?

1707
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:26,640
We're using like e will give us one
be true right here.

1708
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:28,600
It will give us one. Be true.

1709
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:33,200
And now again, you're saying true or false
because of the logical

1710
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:38,400
or now at the end
you going to get one big true, right?

1711
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:45,600
So when my condition is true, Jim,
I go inside.

1712
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:45,960
Yeah.

1713
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,680
So no, all the control

1714
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:53,280
conditions will be evaluated at the end.

1715
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,920
We use as in the logical
or we going to get a

1716
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,960
we're going to get a true condition
and now we're saying please

1717
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,160
tell me the balance. Right.

1718
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:04,440
So now the same thing. Let me see.

1719
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,120
Do you have a credit card?
I'm going to say you right?

1720
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,760
So no, the same thing.

1721
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:13,200
We will check the condition here.

1722
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,080
Condition is false because.

1723
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:18,520
Yep. Is not the same as Yes. Right.

1724
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,880
This condition will be true
and this condition will be false.

1725
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,560
Right.

1726
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:26,640
So now on the left side you have false.

1727
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,760
On the right, true. You will get a true.

1728
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,440
And then you have true and you have false

1729
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:35,560
because of the logical operator,
you are going to get a true right.

1730
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,160
You're going to get a true sense.

1731
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,600
Please tell me the balance right in.

1732
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,320
For example,

1733
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,040
that's when we're going to write.

1734
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,840
Do you have a credit card? No.

1735
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,480
Right.

1736
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,720
Shouldn't the conditions will
this will start checking, right?

1737
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:55,440
It will say, hey, no, what is it
hey, is answer is equals three is no.

1738
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,600
Condition is false here.

1739
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,960
Condition is false
here, condition is false.

1740
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:04,560
So your false your false

1741
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,240
false or false will give us one big false.

1742
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:12,640
And then again for false
or false will give us a false right.

1743
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,680
So now all the conditions will be false.

1744
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:22,280
Now, you cannot go inside the
if statements.

1745
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,920
Look what you see right now, guys.

1746
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:26,520
The difference. Right.

1747
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:31,320
The difference between having a logical
and right

1748
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,400
and the logical or for the logical end

1749
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,000
to give us a true condition.

1750
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:44,040
Both statements
must be must have true value

1751
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:45,720
only and

1752
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:50,000
only if the condition on the left
has true and condition on

1753
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
the right has true,
then my condition become true.

1754
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:59,520
Right?

1755
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,040
Well, now you guys compare industry
and if you're going to enter. Yep.

1756
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:03,760
Of course, none.

1757
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,040
None of this will be much.

1758
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,480
If you want to add

1759
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:10,360
one more condition, then sure,
you can go ahead and add an extra.

1760
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:14,880
You add extra as many as your task
requires.

1761
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,360
Okay.

1762
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:20,880
And the way we're looking at the logical
or or the logical

1763
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,960
or at least one condition can be true
all others can be false.

1764
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,880
And what is the logical upgrade
it will give me

1765
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:34,600
the logical operator will give me a true
right.

1766
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:40,560
You need to know it's import in this.

1767
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,760
Yeah. All when it comes to the one,

1768
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:45,840
when it comes to this,

1769
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,480
when it comes to that one,
you can just check one.

1770
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,720
But let me add one thing and honestly full

1771
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:58,200
statement.

1772
01:33:58,200 --> 01:33:59,640
Statement

1773
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:03,240
and maybe let me statement

1774
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:08,160
and of the quotes now, because
let me put in the default and let me

1775
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,240
support this.

1776
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:14,720
Our exercise in there was to ask

1777
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,560
if you don't have a credit card,
would you like to get a credit card?

1778
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,880
Would you like to apply?

1779
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,000
Do you want to get a

1780
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:25,560
right?

1781
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,040
So now.

1782
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:31,160
All right, it's important, guys.

1783
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,160
That's what I want to show.

1784
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:34,800
But it's important

1785
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,560
not to confuse with an on or

1786
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,520
I mean, not like to confuse,
but to understand

1787
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:45,360
in which scenario to go for
and in which to not to go for it.

1788
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,200
All right.

1789
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:51,000
So let's say, for example, if instead of
the war, I'm going to use end

1790
01:34:52,400 --> 01:35:00,600
and what do this thing will be,
the output.

1791
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,080
What do you guys think will be the output?

1792
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:07,040
If I'm going to enter. Yes.

1793
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,320
So I enter it.

1794
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:10,320
Yes. My answer is yes.

1795
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,600
Where do this thing my code will go.

1796
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:16,960
I don't forget this.

1797
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,280
I added the LS block.

1798
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:27,520
I know that those block.

1799
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:33,480
So I added ls black
guys and I added the line 23.

1800
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,200
So now let's do this. Always,
always. Right.

1801
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:40,920
So now we think logically, logically
and so

1802
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,040
is equals two. Yes.

1803
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,080
This is a condition, Troels

1804
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:52,600
is Yes, equals two. Yep.

1805
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:56,080
What about this condition?

1806
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,520
All right.

1807
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,880
You don't have to check anything for this.

1808
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:02,760
You don't have to check anything
for it. Why?

1809
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:06,240
Because right now
you're using your end operator.

1810
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:11,160
So now, in order for the end
to give you a true,

1811
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:14,680
both conditions must be true now.

1812
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:18,840
Because condition is true
and the other condition is false.

1813
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:23,680
You're going to get a false
when bulling condition is false.

1814
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:28,760
Can you go inside that you book?

1815
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:30,160
So what happens now?

1816
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:34,800
Automatically you will jump to that.

1817
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,560
Automatically
you will jump to the L statement right?

1818
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:39,120
Automatically.

1819
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:42,000
Even though you should ask me for this.

1820
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:42,320
Right?

1821
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,000
Even though you ask me for this.

1822
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,600
So my output right now is not correct.

1823
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:51,600
So this is why in this particular case
we needed to use

1824
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,120
or also guys when comes to.

1825
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:56,040
All right, so always think of it.

1826
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,560
Let me ask you,

1827
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:02,760
the current the current variable, right.

1828
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:06,560
The current,
how many values your variable can hold,

1829
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:11,760
How many values?

1830
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:17,680
Only one Your variable can not have
at the same type at the same time.

1831
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:18,360
Right?

1832
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,600
This variable can not hold. Yes.

1833
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,200
Not a whole. Yep.

1834
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,520
Not a whole. Yeah.

1835
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:26,400
And all of that stuff. Right.

1836
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:29,760
One variable if you want to it
all these different things.

1837
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:30,240
Right.

1838
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:33,400
It's like here if you use in an operator

1839
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:37,240
what you want to say,
you technically say, Hey,

1840
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,680
I want my variable to,
have the value. Yes.

1841
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:46,400
And at the same time
I want my variable to have the value yolk.

1842
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:50,880
And at the same time
I want my value to have year.

1843
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,440
Is it possible?

1844
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:55,560
No, it's not possible
because you have a single variable.

1845
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:59,240
Single variable
can have only one single value.

1846
01:37:59,240 --> 01:37:59,440
Okay.

1847
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:04,800
That's what we have.

1848
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,880
We have this option right now, right?

1849
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,600
If you want to add more, more options,
you can list them out.

1850
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:15,000
You can list demand, all possible options
that you want, that you want.

1851
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,280
You think. Right.

1852
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:20,760
So in this case, logical and will give us

1853
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,440
a logical right, logical pair.

1854
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,800
So here we'll use or here.

1855
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,160
That's how we are, right,

1856
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:32,240
Alexia this how are of here
if the answer is equals to you.

1857
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,840
So you just add in another condition

1858
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:39,160
and to combine two condition
you need to use logical.

1859
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:43,360
Operator In this case we said
which logical operator will make sense,

1860
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:45,880
logical or logical

1861
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,480
is then your option to reassign.

1862
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:59,920
And when you use end or like,
what do we mean by reassign? Is

1863
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:03,800
because

1864
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,760
we can go for equals ignore case.

1865
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:10,480
I just didn't want the lines
to be too longest, that's all.

1866
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:14,400
But of course the best way
will be to go for equals ignores case.

1867
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:15,960
I just.

1868
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,560
I just did not use it guys,

1869
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:22,440
because this line will become right
that's all.

1870
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,880
But of course equals
ignore case will be the best choice.

1871
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,320
I just wanted to show you.

1872
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,640
So this way, guys, it's easier
to look for you.

1873
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:32,800
Network.

1874
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,560
Michael, can you please like

1875
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:42,600
when you present it in the support
channel?

1876
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:43,920
I do.

1877
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,680
We do get the answer,
but because we were using a wrong operator

1878
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,240
right now, if you going to say, Yep.

1879
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:56,040
But if you using a logical
or then we will get the correct output.

1880
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:56,680
Right?

1881
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:01,320
So your execution of this statement

1882
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:05,600
will depend on
what kind of operator you use.

1883
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,280
And in order for you to know
which operator to use,

1884
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,720
you have to understand this table, right?

1885
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,640
Or the order statement to give you true.

1886
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:18,960
You want at least one condition
to be true, right?

1887
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:24,000
So this way, let's say first time,
if you go and you enter.

1888
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:27,600
Yep. Right. If you're going to enter. Yep.

1889
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,760
And this will be stored
inside this answer.

1890
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:31,680
Right.

1891
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,560
So first condition,
it will give you false.

1892
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,440
Right.

1893
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,600
While this condition
will give you true right.

1894
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:43,080
When you have false or true
because of the logical operator,

1895
01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:45,480
we are going to get one be true.

1896
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:48,880
But before.

1897
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:53,160
But before what we did, we said, hey,
what if instead of the or

1898
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:58,200
I'm going to use end now,
the end will give you a different output

1899
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:05,640
when one condition is false
and another condition is true logical.

1900
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:09,640
An operator always gives us a false right.

1901
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:13,200
And when the condition is false
for the eve statement,

1902
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:20,400
you cannot go inside like you good
and say, Let's look at one more example.

1903
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,440
Let's look at the one more example

1904
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,400
because

1905
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:30,000
logical for them, right?

1906
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,400
The example
that also was telling you. Right.

1907
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,080
For example. Right.

1908
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,080
For example, when I want you there,

1909
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:40,920
we just want to see, for example, right.

1910
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:44,480
You want to say, hey,
we'll take our days of the week, right?

1911
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:48,120
You'll take our or we can bring
the scanner if you want to bring this.

1912
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:53,400
Okay.

1913
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,200
Can be reassigned Variables, yes
or not inside.

1914
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:59,560
After we check the condition
if you to perform

1915
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:03,720
some operations
of changing the values of the variables.

1916
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:04,480
Yes you can.

1917
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,960
And we will look probably later today.

1918
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,360
We'll look into those things. Okay.

1919
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,040
So for example. Right.

1920
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,320
So word we will ask.

1921
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:15,360
Okay, this one,
we can use a scanner as user

1922
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:17,400
to enter

1923
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,840
to these days, to these

1924
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,560
B Right.

1925
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,040
And now I want to say right, I want to say

1926
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,360
Eve Bay is Monday, right?

1927
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,640
These Monday or these Friday, Right.

1928
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:36,960
What Do you guys
have you guys have no class, right.

1929
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:40,880
If your days Tuesday or

1930
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,800
Wednesday

1931
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,640
Wednesday were the

1932
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:50,840
one day what do you guys have

1933
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,480
man all question how by the way

1934
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,360
how's the mental classes are going
those mental

1935
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,000
okay Interesting.

1936
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,000
Good. Fine.

1937
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:12,160
Okay.

1938
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:17,520
I think this week
you guys to have two more classes, but

1939
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:23,280
it does not mean that your SDLC process
or the mental process have finished.

1940
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,280
We will continue.

1941
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,760
I did those concepts.

1942
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:28,160
Once we start going into the automation,

1943
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:31,400
then you guys will have your user stories
there.

1944
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:35,640
Again, in the test cases,
all all those things will continuously

1945
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:36,840
practiced in more.

1946
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,960
Once you start learning automation, start.

1947
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,760
Okay, we'll be starting is
Do you know anything guys?

1948
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,120
Just make sure
you keep practicing this with JIRA

1949
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:49,040
because you guys will be using it
for later projects as well.

1950
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,560
Okay.

1951
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,400
So then you guys have Saturday
or Sunday, right?

1952
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,520
Saturday. Awesome.

1953
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,040
And a

1954
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:00,600
lot of theory or.

1955
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:04,160
Yeah, there is a lot of theories
when it comes to, especially

1956
01:44:04,160 --> 01:44:07,360
when you do the mental testing
and there's a lot of theory.

1957
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:11,320
Then you guys have class

1958
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,080
as most definitely
make sure you practice before the class.

1959
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:20,520
So this way
you'll refresh your memory right?

1960
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,040
Okay. It right,

1961
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:25,680
always analyze it right.

1962
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:29,960
And here
it's another piece and another right.

1963
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:35,160
So the same thing we need to ask the user
today's date, we going to use a scanner.

1964
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,920
We need to capture the day, right?

1965
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,240
We will need to capture the

1966
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:43,040
and then we will have to test
multiple conditions.

1967
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,840
We want to say if these Monday or Tuesday.

1968
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,680
Right.

1969
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:50,920
Or if these Tuesday or Wednesday,
if this Saturday or Sunday,

1970
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:54,240
we will be testing multiple conditions.

1971
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,920
Right. To test multiple conditions.

1972
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,680
You guys will tell me what do we need to

1973
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:00,400
want?

1974
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,680
So we will get our scanner and

1975
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,080
then right.

1976
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,320
We have system that

1977
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:20,240
right there

1978
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:26,880
and then we will say,
please enter today's date right.

1979
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:31,840
They right or whatever.

1980
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:32,440
Right.

1981
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:36,000
Then how are we going to capture that
they get then how are we going to capture

1982
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,640
the day

1983
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:45,720
will be

1984
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:57,480
inside is spring day
and how are we going to capture it?

1985
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:00,600
Will you scan that next?

1986
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,600
Right. And that's next.

1987
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,000
And now, once you have the variable,
you guys can throw your

1988
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,320
if conditions to test multiple conditions,
you go for that.

1989
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,800
If else if now within one statement,
you test in two or more conditions.

1990
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,800
So you will need to add
your logical operator

1991
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:24,160
so you guys can go ahead and complete it
and then you guys can send the code.

1992
01:46:24,320 --> 01:47:18,640
Okay.

1993
01:47:18,640 --> 01:48:12,960
I just want you to finish
the this, this test. It

1994
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:01,520
you guys type in

1995
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:04,080
your you are mostly done

1996
01:52:17,400 --> 01:53:23,040
for the authorities.

1997
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:27,360
Let me I copy one of your could

1998
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:40,120
let me formatted it in

1999
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:44,400
three

2000
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:49,160
right so whenever you capture the day

2001
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:52,400
right whenever you capture the day
now you check in.

2002
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:55,080
Hey, if your days equals to Monday

2003
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,160
or the value of the day

2004
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:01,520
could be Friday if any of this. Right.

2005
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:05,080
If it's Monday or Friday,
then there is no class, right?

2006
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:07,560
Then there's no clause

2007
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:07,920
else.

2008
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,200
If you have another condition. Right.

2009
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:15,320
You want to check in these Tuesday
or your days Wednesday.

2010
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:17,640
Then you said you guys have mental class.

2011
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:19,680
Another condition right here.

2012
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:20,320
What are you doing?

2013
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:24,560
You check in multiple conditions
using your else if statement right

2014
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:28,480
within your else ease you test in that.

2015
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:31,680
Hey, what if this condition is true

2016
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:35,280
or this condition is true.

2017
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:35,840
Right?

2018
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:39,360
And then when we go for debugging guys,
right.

2019
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,280
Let's go for debugging or

2020
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:45,960
please enter today's day,

2021
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:51,360
today's Saturday,

2022
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:56,760
the Saturday.

2023
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:57,160
Right.

2024
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,440
So now what? We'll start happening right?

2025
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,440
The way the evil it works.

2026
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:05,320
It's a like a letter Eve right
your java will go one

2027
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:09,080
by one and check condition in every block.

2028
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:09,960
Right?

2029
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:13,920
And now we static
and hey is day equals to Monday?

2030
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,040
Nope. Condition is false.

2031
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:17,560
Is day is equals to Friday.

2032
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:18,880
No condition is false.

2033
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:22,080
False or false will give us false. Right.

2034
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:27,720
What way we're going
and we're going to go one more time.

2035
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:34,040
We see.

2036
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:34,800
Right.

2037
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:36,920
Right.

2038
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:39,480
So here we said conditional is false

2039
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:44,640
and condition was false. Why?

2040
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,920
Because the date currently is what?

2041
01:55:48,560 --> 01:56:01,120
The date currently is, is a

2042
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,400
right then if this condition was false.

2043
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:07,840
Right.

2044
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,960
Your Geragos checks another block right

2045
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,080
now, it checks another block.

2046
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:17,000
He is the day equals that usually

2047
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:19,960
means again false.

2048
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:23,600
Okay is the name equals to Wednesday
conditions again false

2049
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:27,040
using the all operator or operator.

2050
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:31,320
Right and here he is
the day equals to Saturday.

2051
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:36,000
Yes, these equals to Saturday
we are going to get true in here.

2052
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:41,080
It is the day equals to Sunday
we're going to get false any right

2053
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,280
or false.

2054
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,800
It will give us one true condition.

2055
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:50,080
Right. Will give us one true condition.

2056
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:53,640
And when the condition is true,
we can go inside the block of code.

2057
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:54,200
Right.

2058
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:57,280
Then this statement will be executed.

2059
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:58,000
Right.

2060
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:00,320
And then your Java will exist.

2061
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:03,360
Your entire

2062
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:03,880
right.

2063
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:07,800
And then you bargain once again.

2064
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,920
Right? This was false. This is false.

2065
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:13,120
Now, this will become true.

2066
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:17,640
Your java will go inside
and then the rest of the code

2067
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:24,840
will be ignored
and the rest of the group will be ignored.

2068
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:26,600
What is the difference between equals?

2069
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:28,520
N equals ignore keys.

2070
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:32,000
So now if you enter small Tuesday

2071
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:38,880
or if you enter Tuesday in all caps,
Java will ignore the case

2072
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:42,720
and what it will compare
the actual down can does it do

2073
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:49,560
in the same thing in here?

2074
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:50,160
Right.

2075
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:55,040
We could not go for it and right
We could not go for our end.

2076
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,240
Right. Why?

2077
01:57:57,240 --> 01:58:00,440
Because for example,
if I'm going to enter, please

2078
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:03,920
enter O

2079
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:11,360
let's say

2080
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:14,240
for example, it will be Monday, right?

2081
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:18,600
Eve you would use the end operator Right.

2082
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,480
So Monday, right.

2083
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:24,160
Will give you the true

2084
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:27,040
and then Friday will give you the false.

2085
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:31,840
But because of the end operator
you will get one false

2086
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:35,320
and then your exercise one B right, right.

2087
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:40,080
Why should we hope we have
we don't have to have a rule entry.

2088
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:42,280
This is like copy the code days.

2089
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:44,440
This is just for this scenario.

2090
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:45,880
For example. Right.

2091
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:49,240
If you want choose, for example,
if somebody is going to

2092
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,720
please enter today's date, I don't know.

2093
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:53,760
I'm going to enter something wrong. Right?

2094
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,920
I'm going to enter something wrong.

2095
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,320
Then your Java will just execute this out.

2096
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:00,600
Do you have to have it?

2097
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,400
No, you don't have to have it.

2098
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:05,640
But this way we just try to show that,
hey, you know what?

2099
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:07,400
The wrong input, right?

2100
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:11,040
Or we can say invalidate is into something
like that, right?

2101
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,040
Do you have to have it?

2102
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:15,000
No, you don't have to
have to remember else either.

2103
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:18,360
Else is a very, very optional block.

2104
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:23,280
Right But here we just added
to show the message to use it.

2105
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,240
Right. Hey, you did the wrong output.

2106
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:29,560
That's why I did not show you
what class you have right for class.

2107
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:34,760
You have.

2108
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:37,560
So this is what our logical order

2109
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:41,000
and this is was our logical.

2110
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:42,400
And the same thing in here.

2111
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:44,480
Describe the same thing in here.

2112
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,840
It's important not to get confused, right?

2113
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:50,920
It's important
to know where to use the right output.

2114
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:54,280
And if some of the things are confused

2115
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:58,480
right now, you can easily,
easily days will understand

2116
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:04,080
which operator you need by providing
and by test in your own code.

2117
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:04,640
Right.

2118
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:07,800
For example, let's look at this one
and then I'll give you the task is

2119
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:12,600
let's look at this assignment
right when we wanted to check the number,

2120
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:16,400
when we wanted to say, Hey,
the number is small, medium or large,

2121
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:21,720
think going this what would have happened
now, Eve instead of the end?

2122
02:00:21,720 --> 02:00:25,520
I would specify all and I would specify or

2123
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:29,040
and I would specify or write.

2124
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:32,640
And now while running
my code, I would enter.

2125
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:36,480
While running my code, I would enter

2126
02:00:40,040 --> 02:00:42,440
900 our 10th or 900.

2127
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:47,800
So I would expect to see that
my number is large.

2128
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:50,160
But because I did the role

2129
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:53,280
of a logical operator, what to do?

2130
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:56,400
This thing will be my
what do you guys think will be my output?

2131
02:00:57,320 --> 02:01:01,440
So change from
and I change it to or where do this

2132
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,600
thing will be my output

2133
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:10,920
so it will go to the 26, right?

2134
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:13,440
Why not go to the 26?

2135
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:17,400
Because here is 900 larger than one.

2136
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:20,040
Yes, condition is true.

2137
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:23,880
Hey, is the number less than ten
condition is false.

2138
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:27,280
But because of using the rule operator,

2139
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,000
your main condition will become true

2140
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:33,720
and your code will execute this statement.

2141
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:34,400
Right?

2142
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:38,640
Instead of having is large,
that's what you should be expecting it.

2143
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:39,360
Right.

2144
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:42,920
But if you if instead of the end
you would use

2145
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:46,640
all you will get that mistake right here.

2146
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:50,720
That's where it will interact
and it will tell you that 900 is small

2147
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,880
and everything else will be ignored.

2148
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:54,280
Right. What is this thing?

2149
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:57,000
Will it let's let me enter 1 million

2150
02:01:58,440 --> 02:01:59,120
or whatever.

2151
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:00,400
What is it? 10,000?

2152
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:01,160
Where? Oops.

2153
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:02,440
Why is still still in me?

2154
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,400
Small

2155
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:17,680
Because this statement.

2156
02:02:17,680 --> 02:02:24,480
So now you can enter 1,001,010 million
because of the rule Operator

2157
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:28,840
This condition always and remember you in
three will be more than one.

2158
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:32,200
And then wrongly,
this statement will be executed.

2159
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:34,800
Right? So that's why it's important.

2160
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,520
And if at first side you feel confused,

2161
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:43,160
which one to use just right, you call this
and try to use different values.

2162
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,840
Okay. Now.

2163
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:48,400
Oh, there you go. Now. Correct.

2164
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:52,480
Right.

2165
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:52,920
Okay.

2166
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:55,560
So let me give you the

2167
02:02:56,320 --> 02:02:57,840
first two or three task.

2168
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:58,840
Let me see.

2169
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:01,120
So I think you guys already
saw the slides, right?

2170
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:02,760
The slides weren't can last, right?

2171
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:04,560
This is the same table.

2172
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:08,280
And let me give this test first
and then we'll look at the logical

2173
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,600
table and I'll paste this in the

2174
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:16,040
course announcement.

2175
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,440
And maybe let me add
one more task for you.

2176
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:21,440
This, or maybe I'll give you two years

2177
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,920
of homework

2178
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:40,640
figure, which does
because it is only two tasks in there.

2179
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:59,160
Okay, let's want to give you

2180
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:09,600
I give you four more minutes.

2181
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,360
All right.

2182
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:15,040
Let me ask you all,

2183
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:20,280
so for the first task, right
from the user to enter person's height,

2184
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:22,800
you knew that
you would have to go for Skinner.

2185
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,800
Let me ask you guys,
which operator did you use

2186
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:34,240
in here?

2187
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:35,400
Logical end.

2188
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:36,320
Right. Logical.

2189
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:39,600
And you were capturing
if you get your integer value, some of you

2190
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:42,600
double probably integer will be

2191
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:44,600
will be more suitable here. Right.

2192
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:50,280
And then in here
you wanted to test two conditions, right.

2193
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:53,040
You wanted to check that the height. Yes.

2194
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:58,640
You enter it more than 60
and in the same time a less than 72.

2195
02:04:58,640 --> 02:04:59,400
Right.

2196
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:03,800
In this case
you guys one for using and operator.

2197
02:05:03,800 --> 02:05:04,320
Right.

2198
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:08,600
So okay this as this test actually
could be done two different ways.

2199
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:10,840
Okay. So solid to ask. Okay.

2200
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:13,560
So which which operator did you guys use

2201
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:21,720
is or operator?

2202
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:24,360
Okay.

2203
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:27,600
Or okay, can you guys show me your code
because I've seen

2204
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:31,200
I've seen people can do it
different, different ways.

2205
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:31,680
Okay.

2206
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:35,320
So this way you guys will see it as well

2207
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:55,520
because of this one.

2208
02:05:55,520 --> 02:06:00,560
Let me see this.

2209
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:03,080
And the second one, they go, right.

2210
02:06:03,080 --> 02:06:05,120
So let me show you.

2211
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:06,920
So right now,
you guys share in the current.

2212
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:09,000
I'm sure you guys

2213
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:11,760
seen that it can be done
different, different way.

2214
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:12,560
Right.

2215
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:17,640
So let me see.

2216
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:18,880
Skinner

2217
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:29,400
was right.

2218
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:34,240
So when we have an Skinner,
we ask in the day, then

2219
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:37,520
you guys maybe captured it.

2220
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,880
They use it

2221
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,800
because they exercise is numbers.

2222
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:43,960
Maybe some of you captures an integer

2223
02:06:43,960 --> 02:06:47,480
some or you could
capture is a strange right different ways.

2224
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:50,760
But in this case
we went for a integer, right?

2225
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:52,600
And now we're saying, hey,

2226
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:57,000
that they could be equal
to one, two or three or four or five.

2227
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:57,880
Right?

2228
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,760
Because you could they can have
different values at different moments.

2229
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:03,760
Right.

2230
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:04,840
Okay. For a moment.

2231
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:08,800
So it was a weekday
as if the day is six or seven.

2232
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,600
It's a weekend.

2233
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,880
Otherwise we're just saying it's invalid.

2234
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:13,920
Then, of course, guess what do you do?

2235
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:15,240
You just run right.

2236
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:20,520
You always execute your code.

2237
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:22,400
Today's day one, right

2238
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:27,360
now your
Java will come and check the conditions.

2239
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:27,600
Right?

2240
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:28,920
This one will be true.

2241
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,280
This one will be false.

2242
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:32,320
And then false. And then false.

2243
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:33,760
And then false. Right.

2244
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:37,720
But you have one true,
and you have the other operator.

2245
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:41,400
So this condition will give you one
be true, right?

2246
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:46,640
And then you are allowed to go
and inside the statement will be executed.

2247
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:47,880
Right.

2248
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:53,120
So this statement will be true
for all the values anywhere.

2249
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:55,440
If enter one, two, three, four or five.

2250
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:56,000
Right.

2251
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:00,960
So all the way you'll find then
for example, if you going to enter six.

2252
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:04,000
Right.
If you're going to enter six. Right.

2253
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:07,600
All this conditions will be false alls.

2254
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:10,360
False. False. Right.

2255
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:14,080
So when you in false and all the others

2256
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:17,880
will give you false,
so then you'll go check this condition.

2257
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:20,520
This condition will become true,
this will be false,

2258
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:22,920
and this will give you the correct output.

2259
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:23,440
Right.

2260
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,120
And then as the last option
is the last option,

2261
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:30,440
if you're going to enter anything invalid,
you want to enter ten

2262
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,840
all forces will be here,
All forces will be here.

2263
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:38,120
So your code will go to the part, Right?

2264
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:39,960
So it works in the end, right?

2265
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:41,000
It works in here.

2266
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,200
So everything is correct. So in this case,

2267
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:48,520
one for you is in and use in or operates.

2268
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:51,680
But I saw some of you,
you guys did it differently right?

2269
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:55,600
Some of you
you guys went in and used the end up way.

2270
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:55,840
Right.

2271
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:58,520
So let me copy let me copy this

2272
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:05,280
in this one.

2273
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:11,880
Oh well

2274
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:15,760
remember, this is in programing.

2275
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:19,200
Everything can be done

2276
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:25,160
that leads to different types.

2277
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:25,680
Okay.

2278
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:30,240
So this is

2279
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:32,880
this is another example. Right.

2280
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:35,520
The same thing using Skinner doctrine.

2281
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:38,360
The they first reported
exactly the same. Right?

2282
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,560
Exactly the same.

2283
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:43,720
But then for the if condition

2284
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:47,560
that person
decided to use a different operator

2285
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:53,760
now instead of chicken
the equality operator when for a greater

2286
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:57,600
or less right, greater,
equal or less one equal.

2287
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:01,440
So now we see hey Eve there weekday

2288
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:05,040
that you end 30 will be larger than one

2289
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:09,560
and at the same time less than five.

2290
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:12,000
I'll tell you that it's a weekday.

2291
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,080
Otherwise
It will be greater or equal than six

2292
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:19,480
or and at the same time smaller
than seven.

2293
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:20,880
It's a weekday. Right.

2294
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:21,960
And what's this?

2295
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:25,320
Let's tested
mentally, this right. Let's say

2296
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:28,520
I'm going to enter one.

2297
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:31,480
Right. I'm going to enter one now.

2298
02:10:31,560 --> 02:10:35,280
One as we said,
will be stored inside this variable.

2299
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:36,640
And now we chicken.

2300
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:40,400
Hey, is one larger
or greater than one condition?

2301
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:42,000
12 false days

2302
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:50,480
or one year?

2303
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:52,560
Quote. Right. So condition is true.

2304
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:55,520
He is

2305
02:10:55,840 --> 02:10:59,240
is the winner
may is less or equal to five.

2306
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:03,040
Is it true or false?

2307
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:06,600
It's also true so now true and true.

2308
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:07,800
What it will give you.

2309
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:10,200
It will be give you one true.

2310
02:11:10,200 --> 02:11:12,440
Then your statement will go right.

2311
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:15,720
And the same thing,
whether you're going to enter two,

2312
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:18,720
three, four, all the way to five, right.

2313
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:22,840
Going to enter
five K is five larger than one.

2314
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:25,680
Yes. Condition is true, K is five.

2315
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:27,360
Less or equal to five.

2316
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,640
Condition is true. Right.

2317
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:32,040
That's work for all of those statements.

2318
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:35,120
Now let's say you're going to enter
six right.

2319
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:35,840
The same thing

2320
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:39,000
here will be false. You

2321
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,720
going even have to check everything else
because you have the end right.

2322
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:47,680
As soon as you have one false,
your condition will be given six.

2323
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:52,160
Then your statement will go check
the next set of conditions.

2324
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:55,120
Hey, is a big day more equals to six? Yes.

2325
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:56,680
Condition is true.

2326
02:11:56,680 --> 02:11:58,840
Is it less or equal than seven years?

2327
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:00,200
Condition is true.

2328
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:03,480
So week date will work right here.

2329
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:04,800
Should be with it.

2330
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,440
It's a weekend

2331
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:10,720
for people.

2332
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:12,240
It will work any time.

2333
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:14,800
If you want to enter ten. Right.

2334
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:17,800
If you're going to enter ten here.

2335
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:20,880
Hey, is ten more than one up?

2336
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:22,240
So here will be true.

2337
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:25,000
Here is the ten less than five condition.

2338
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,480
It will be false because you it
and operator you will get a false right.

2339
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:33,880
Hey is there more than six
Condition is true.

2340
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:37,680
Eight is the weekday
less than seven condition false.

2341
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:40,600
Right. And operator will give a false.

2342
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,040
So then your call will go inside
the ls one.

2343
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:45,360
So you're going to see

2344
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,880
different operators,

2345
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:53,360
different relational operators,

2346
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:56,400
and because of different
relational operators.

2347
02:12:56,400 --> 02:13:01,320
Now here a person
use a different logical operator to write

2348
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:05,280
both assignments
gives me the right output.

2349
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:08,520
Both assignments have a right lot,
so you will see

2350
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,560
what is the benefit
of when you will share in your code.

2351
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:16,640
When you get share in your homework,
and what is the practice to

2352
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:21,360
the practice when you do the other days?

2353
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:24,440
So this way you can pick somebody else
brain

2354
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:28,040
and also
try to think on different ways, right?

2355
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:33,000
And by looking at others you list
can also see that oh well this assignments

2356
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,840
could have been done
in different ways, right?

2357
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:40,840
All right.

2358
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:44,760
The largest number,
the largest number should be easy, guys.

2359
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:48,840
Write the largest numbers would be easy.

2360
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:52,200
Let me see. Largest mortgage

2361
02:13:53,680 --> 02:14:01,800
transactions.

2362
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:05,280
Not really.

2363
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:07,680
Well, that's when you start
thinking of different. That.

2364
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:10,080
That's actually a good point.
Okay, that's good.

2365
02:14:10,080 --> 02:14:10,840
That's good. Okay.

2366
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:14,800
We will look at small.

2367
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:15,360
Okay.

2368
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:21,160
So write

2369
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:24,480
scanner write asking for three numbers

2370
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:27,520
and capturing them in the form of double
values.

2371
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:28,200
That's fine.

2372
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:30,360
Write to that's fine.

2373
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:32,400
Then we go in the happy path.

2374
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:34,080
Just going happy back. Right.

2375
02:14:34,080 --> 02:14:37,280
Maybe we should have say
and are three different numbers.

2376
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:37,560
Right.

2377
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:40,360
But of course user can behave differently.

2378
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:42,600
But for now, just happy, right?

2379
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:46,200
Why do we comparing three numbers right
when we compared the numbers.

2380
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:48,960
So a happy pair scenario

2381
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:53,000
we check in that number one
could be larger than number two

2382
02:14:53,480 --> 02:14:56,800
and at the same time
it should be larger than number three.

2383
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:00,160
Then number becomes the largest number.

2384
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:00,920
Right?

2385
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:06,520
Then we say, hey, if number two, larger
than number three and at the same time,

2386
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:10,680
number two is larger than number one,
then two is the largest, right?

2387
02:15:10,920 --> 02:15:14,480
And then you do just all these conditions,
right within their numbers,

2388
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:17,720
11, 12, 13.

2389
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:20,040
They go 13 is the largest. Right?

2390
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:23,640
Then you enter 1211.

2391
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:27,360
The first one is the largest number.

2392
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:27,640
Right.

2393
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:31,920
And let's take the 111 1210.

2394
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:35,320
So in the happy scenario, it works, right?

2395
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:36,360
What do we mean?

2396
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:39,240
What do I mean by happy path?

2397
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:42,600
Right by Happy Party needs All
numbers are different, right?

2398
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:46,280
So now the easiest start coming

2399
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:49,720
when you want to enter three
the same numbers, ten,

2400
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:53,600
ten, ten, right.

2401
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:57,160
So then I put something on equal.

2402
02:15:57,840 --> 02:15:58,960
Please enter three numbers.

2403
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:01,200
Ten and ten.

2404
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:04,200
Oh, there's no output right?
There's no output.

2405
02:16:04,200 --> 02:16:08,800
So what do we want to see
when the numbers are equal.

2406
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:09,680
Right.

2407
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:13,160
When all the numbers equal to each other.

2408
02:16:13,160 --> 02:16:15,760
We want to say numbers are equal, right?

2409
02:16:15,760 --> 02:16:17,640
There is no largest number.

2410
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:19,920
All numbers are equal. Right?

2411
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:23,000
So then whenever you start
thinking of those very

2412
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:27,480
because all you do is you add the same,
you add more conditions,

2413
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:32,600
you add more conditions, or then once
you add that condition, then you start

2414
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:37,240
think of the scenario, Hey, what is the
first two number will be the same right?

2415
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:41,280
Then once you start of thinking
more and more options,

2416
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:43,680
then you guys will start adding those,
right?

2417
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:50,360
So now if none of the things will be much
right, we can we can add another one else

2418
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:54,960
if we are lucky,
we can say else is now one.

2419
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:57,960
Actually,
maybe I would put it as a first part.

2420
02:16:57,960 --> 02:16:59,880
This is better.

2421
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:01,520
So first let's eliminate that.

2422
02:17:01,520 --> 02:17:03,640
The numbers not equal. Right.

2423
02:17:04,080 --> 02:17:06,720
And I'll show you different ways
how it can be actually.

2424
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:09,400
Right. Let me add anything I want to say.

2425
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:15,000
Hey, Eve, actually, we can use the next
ending here that we can say, hey,

2426
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:18,200
it's no one

2427
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:21,280
equals two and

2428
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:25,560
now one equals to number three, right?

2429
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:30,840
So we want to say, hey,
if the numbers are just the equal, right,

2430
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:36,080
then we want to add the statement, right
then we want to see the numbers are equal.

2431
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:43,360
Once numbers are equal, Right.

2432
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:48,000
So if the numbers are equal,
do you guys want to do the comparison

2433
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,360
or you don't want to check
which? One is the largest.

2434
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:55,080
If the numbers are equal,

2435
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:58,160
you do check with No,
But if the numbers are equal,

2436
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,560
you don't want to check
which one is the largest.

2437
02:18:00,560 --> 02:18:01,880
No need. Right.

2438
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:04,760
So there is a multiple ways
it can be done.

2439
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:10,000
This if you saying, hey,
I want to check that all in.

2440
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:13,520
Only when I want to check
that the number is the largest

2441
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:18,600
only and only when I deal
with not equal numbers.

2442
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:19,120
Right.

2443
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:23,160
So what are we can do, guys,
to make it more complicated, right.

2444
02:18:23,160 --> 02:18:24,080
What? We can do this.

2445
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:29,200
We can add the ls block
and only know only inside that ls block.

2446
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:30,480
Do this. Just

2447
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:33,680
order this thing

2448
02:18:35,240 --> 02:18:35,840
here.

2449
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:37,280
Right here.

2450
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:40,520
What are we going to see here?

2451
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:43,040
And then we can look at different
variations right?

2452
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:45,400
It can get more and more complicated.

2453
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:49,760
Now, I was saying, Hey, if those numbers
are equal, right, those numbers are equal.

2454
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:53,040
I'll just say they're equal
when I want to check

2455
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:56,040
for different conditions only in

2456
02:18:56,200 --> 02:18:59,400
only when the numbers are not equal.

2457
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:01,480
Right. When the numbers are not equal.

2458
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:05,360
So as as I'm going to enter
what I intend in there.

2459
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:07,960
Ten, ten, ten.

2460
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:09,000
Right.

2461
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:14,680
So this statement will become true because
this will be true and this will be true.

2462
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:15,120
Right?

2463
02:19:15,120 --> 02:19:19,400
They will give me one, be true
and then this will get executed.

2464
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:21,120
LS black will get it.

2465
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,360
You can then. MILANI Yes, it can be done.

2466
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:27,400
Can then be thrown
as a very first statement.

2467
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:36,240
Yes, it can be thrown as a very,
very fair statement.

2468
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:37,560
There's a different variations there.

2469
02:19:37,560 --> 02:19:39,600
So no, the more

2470
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,840
so, but let's say.

2471
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:45,920
But if you're going to enter guys
ten, ten and ten.

2472
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:46,200
Right.

2473
02:19:46,200 --> 02:19:52,680
So now ten, ten and 12, it does shows me
that the 12 is the largest.

2474
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:53,160
Right.

2475
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:57,080
I wanted to find out that is the largest

2476
02:19:57,080 --> 02:20:02,320
if you're going to enter to a 12
and then the ten, it's okay.

2477
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:03,360
Now it's a good one.

2478
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:07,600
So let's see why there was no output
when I entered 1212 and ten, because

2479
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:13,760
every time you just will have to test
the more options you start thing,

2480
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:17,360
probably the more else
if statements you will look right.

2481
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:21,080
So now let me enter this before
this left me and they're all equal.

2482
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:23,600
And then we'll repeat this scenario then.

2483
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:26,280
Okay.

2484
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:30,120
It works when all equal, it works when

2485
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:34,880
when you are small and

2486
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:37,320
the biggest is the largest.

2487
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:43,760
But now we saw that it does not work
when this 12, 12 and ten does not work.

2488
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:44,160
Right.

2489
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:45,680
It does not work.

2490
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:48,120
Know we can think why
it does not work. Right?

2491
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:51,800
So what we entered, we entered in here 12

2492
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:56,120
we enter it here 12 and enter it ten.

2493
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:57,000
Right

2494
02:20:58,160 --> 02:21:00,960
now we say Hey is the number one
equals two.

2495
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:03,920
Number two,
this condition was true, right?

2496
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:08,760
Because 12 is equal to 12, but number one
was not equals to number three.

2497
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,680
This was false. Right.

2498
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:13,000
So our if statement was ignored.

2499
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:16,680
So our court when inside the block.

2500
02:21:16,840 --> 02:21:19,320
Right. You went inside the ls one.

2501
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:20,840
So inside the LS blockage.

2502
02:21:20,840 --> 02:21:25,520
The comparison here is number one
larger than number right.

2503
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:30,560
It was basic saying is the 12 larger
than 12 This give me false,

2504
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:32,960
give me false.

2505
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:36,520
I don't even have to check the second one
because of the end operator.

2506
02:21:36,600 --> 02:21:38,760
Right then it one next again.

2507
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:44,160
Now it says hey, is the number two larger
than the number three?

2508
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:48,480
12 is larger than is the 12
larger than ten years condition is true.

2509
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:52,000
He is the number two larger
than number one.

2510
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,440
12 is not larger.

2511
02:21:53,440 --> 02:21:55,920
The Number one, this gave me false.

2512
02:21:56,360 --> 02:22:00,560
So again in here I was not able to enter.

2513
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:05,400
Then when inside the ls if part we check
and he is the number

2514
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:09,600
three larger
than the number two condition was false.

2515
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:13,080
And now it did not go inside right again.

2516
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:28,200
So how did this thing
the easiest way to fix? No.

2517
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:29,720
Or one? No, no, no.

2518
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:32,400
Because the order one worked. The other
one works.

2519
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:33,600
How can we go for

2520
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:41,200
it. So we need to add

2521
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:45,240
that we can add
one of the equality operators

2522
02:22:45,440 --> 02:22:49,920
or we cannot some of the else
if statements in the other.

2523
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:52,080
Yes, we can add case.

2524
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:55,080
But to eliminate this scenario

2525
02:22:55,080 --> 02:23:00,680
right where we say is the most issue comes
when you have two numbers

2526
02:23:00,680 --> 02:23:03,480
that are the same
and they are the largest, right?

2527
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:09,080
So they may give us why don't we try
to enter the equal sign in here?

2528
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:13,840
Why don't we try to enter the equal
or larger or equal?

2529
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:16,720
Right. So let's say

2530
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:19,040
larger or equal, Right.

2531
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:22,640
Why don't you or equal now, let's see.

2532
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:24,760
Let's say right.

2533
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:27,920
So when I'm adding larger or equal, Right

2534
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:31,920
when I'm adding larger or equal,
now let's say what's going to happen.

2535
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:35,840
I have 1212 in the ten right now.

2536
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:39,080
Hey, is number one
larger or equal than number two?

2537
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:41,400
Yes. Condition will be true, right?

2538
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:44,760
Is number one
larger than the number three?

2539
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:47,040
Yes. Condition is true. Right.

2540
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:49,880
So now it tells me now one, but

2541
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:53,160
it does identify the largest, right.

2542
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:54,960
It does identify the largest

2543
02:23:57,640 --> 02:23:59,640
thing, 12 plus

2544
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:04,200
people identifies the largest.

2545
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:04,800
Right.

2546
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,840
And then you guys start adding more
when you add all of them, you we can try.

2547
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:12,840
Let's see,
what if I'm going to enter 12 and then ten

2548
02:24:13,480 --> 02:24:16,480
and then once again, no output.

2549
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:17,960
Again output.

2550
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:20,600
Then you start thinking,
okay, where is it?

2551
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:21,840
Had to have gone.

2552
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:25,760
I have now one and three that were equal.

2553
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:26,080
Right.

2554
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:29,520
And then you guys just thought do you can,
you guys can just add this

2555
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:34,760
probably one of these equality signs there
or there all you do you guys you tried

2556
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:38,640
you test it
and then by testing it multiple times,

2557
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,280
you guys will be able to do one

2558
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:45,320
that we'll be able to define.

2559
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:46,960
So you have two.

2560
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:49,680
So you have number one
equals to number two, you have them to.

2561
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:52,760
It was number three
and probably number three equals two.

2562
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:53,760
No one probably.

2563
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,760
So only right with this

2564
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:02,640
one. And

2565
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:07,280
I know it works right.

2566
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:11,760
Changing the line between two or

2567
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:18,120
but if I'm going to change the line
15 two.

2568
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:22,480
All right okay
so first let's let's in here

2569
02:25:22,480 --> 02:25:25,680
what I did I, I equality one

2570
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:30,880
number one is equal to number two
when them two could be equal

2571
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:35,240
to number three and when them three
could be equals to no one, right.

2572
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:37,680
When then they could be equal to one.

2573
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:40,120
So now any scenario I draw

2574
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:43,200
first to largest

2575
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,920
and then ten, it was fallen in here.

2576
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:49,480
Now I'm entering 12, ten and number one.

2577
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,320
And number two
is the large number number one.

2578
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:56,240
And number three are
the letters is still identified right now.

2579
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:58,680
They let me see. Okay.

2580
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:04,760
So what will happen is if I'll enter equal
in or in here, what will happen is

2581
02:26:05,760 --> 02:26:06,920
what will happen if I

2582
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:16,800
enter or in here.

2583
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:19,560
So in this particular scenario,

2584
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:22,760
I'm going to enter 12, ten and 12.

2585
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:25,600
What are you saying will be my output?

2586
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:27,680
Yeah, it will tell me that. Equal right.

2587
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:32,200
So number one is 12, Number two is ten.

2588
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:35,400
Number three is 12. Right now?

2589
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:40,440
Hey, is number one equals to number two,
no condition will be false.

2590
02:26:40,880 --> 02:26:41,160
Okay.

2591
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:44,920
But number one is equal with the number
three condition

2592
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:48,520
will true because of this Operator. Right.

2593
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:50,640
This statement will get executed, right.

2594
02:26:50,640 --> 02:26:53,400
So now it won't show me the write up.

2595
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:56,200
Okay.

2596
02:26:56,200 --> 02:26:58,920
So now in here we have to keep it as a

2597
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:04,120
given.

2598
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:06,120
And good point is with point this on.

2599
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:12,400
Okay, let me use
or that wants me to run it all in 312.

2600
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:15,480
Well, all right. Numbers are equal.

2601
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:16,520
They're not equal.

2602
02:27:16,520 --> 02:27:17,040
Right.

2603
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:19,200
Logically, that's not the correct output.

2604
02:27:19,640 --> 02:27:20,840
That's not correct.

2605
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:22,680
The numbers are equal.

2606
02:27:22,680 --> 02:27:33,600
So in here, we will keep it as a step.

2607
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:34,480
Okay. Right.

2608
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:38,600
And you guys see, probably at first
I was not able to capture that either.

2609
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:39,240
Right.

2610
02:27:39,240 --> 02:27:43,120
But how I was able to think
and add more statements

2611
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:46,240
by to by thinking of different ways

2612
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:49,600
and by providing
after that more and more conditions.

2613
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:49,920
Right.

2614
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:53,160
So on two

2615
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:57,880
equals two, three.

2616
02:27:57,880 --> 02:27:59,160
You mean in here.

2617
02:27:59,160 --> 02:27:59,920
Yeah, in here.

2618
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:01,040
It doesn't it need this.

2619
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:05,360
If now one will be equal to two it's
automatically right.

2620
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:08,920
It's automatically will mean in here
that number two is equal to number three.

2621
02:28:09,040 --> 02:28:11,320
Right.

2622
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:14,840
And could be
there's another way to fix it. Yes.

2623
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:17,520
Then there could be another way
to do it as well.

2624
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:20,760
But as long as you guys will come up

2625
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:24,520
to the right logic, the right output,
that's what's more important.

2626
02:28:24,600 --> 02:28:27,080
Okay, good, good, good thinking.

2627
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:29,120
That's really, really good thinking.

2628
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:30,480
As we're

2629
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:34,280
we are trying to become tested right
then when it comes to testers,

2630
02:28:35,160 --> 02:28:38,880
in order to become a good tester,
we have to think of different,

2631
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:40,680
different possibilities. Right.

2632
02:28:40,680 --> 02:28:44,680
And if you guys still have some questions
in here, you guys can try to do it

2633
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,600
at home,
try to do different, different ways

2634
02:28:47,840 --> 02:28:51,440
and then see that
there's a possibility to do it either way.

2635
02:28:51,480 --> 02:28:53,760
Right? I also will give you guys,

2636
02:28:55,560 --> 02:28:57,520
I'll give you this assignment.

2637
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:00,240
You'll find the largest number
as a homework,

2638
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:02,440
but I will add some restrictions.
Three grade.

2639
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:07,040
That will be your homework to do it.

2640
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:08,640
Okay, this in all the code.

2641
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:11,280
Remember, guys,
all the code is available on canvas.

2642
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:16,960
So after the class, please, please
make sure you guys always go over your

2643
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:21,000
over over the assignments
and always please

2644
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,400
make sure you guys look at those code
before our next class.

2645
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:29,040
Now that things are starting,
adding more and more.

2646
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:29,760
Right.

2647
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:33,240
So your knowledge will start
getting increased.

2648
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:35,600
The more practice needs to be done.

2649
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:40,480
And because you guys see we are more
our speed is slowly, slowly increasing.

2650
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:40,720
Right?

2651
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:43,760
So you have to make sure
there's your studying.

2652
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:45,440
So this you don't fall behind.

2653
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:48,760
Okay?

2654
02:29:48,760 --> 02:29:54,600
Okay.

2655
02:29:54,600 --> 02:30:06,280
Alright guys,
is this clear for the three numbers?

2656
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:08,760
Okay.
I hope it's good. I hope it's to keep

2657
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:16,840
so the break is before the break
because it will be short.

2658
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:19,000
One examples. Okay.

2659
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:22,080
So before the break,

2660
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:26,440
we're going to at the logical,
not logical.

2661
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:29,520
Not logical, not

2662
02:30:29,880 --> 02:30:32,800
where we
you will be using the exclamation mark.

2663
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:33,360
Okay.

2664
02:30:33,480 --> 02:30:37,600
So what is the logical not what it does

2665
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:40,280
it reverse

2666
02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:43,520
and mission reversing condition, right

2667
02:30:45,640 --> 02:30:48,160
now, when we think of

2668
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:50,440
what do we think of the condition?

2669
02:30:50,440 --> 02:30:51,480
Right. So remember this.

2670
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:54,160
When we work with the condition,
we are saying, hey,

2671
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:58,320
our condition can be either true, right?

2672
02:30:58,320 --> 02:31:01,440
Or either either either true or false.

2673
02:31:01,440 --> 02:31:02,920
Right. True or false.

2674
02:31:02,920 --> 02:31:04,480
So what does it mean?

2675
02:31:04,480 --> 02:31:07,440
Okay, What does it mean?

2676
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,120
So if it means
if your condition will be true

2677
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:16,840
with then not operating,
we can reverse it to false.

2678
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:21,960
And if your condition is false with
the note operator, we can turn it to true.

2679
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:22,560
Right.

2680
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:29,040
So let me show you. See

2681
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:43,760
me. So, for example, right.

2682
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:46,920
Really in

2683
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:53,600
full right

2684
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:58,920
now if I'm going to try to print
both right.

2685
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:02,440
So you know the output, right?

2686
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:06,320
You'll show me the true
what happened because the value

2687
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:10,040
that are placed, the boot was true.

2688
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:10,760
Right.

2689
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:15,360
So now what we can use,
we can use a not operator.

2690
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:19,760
So now if I'm going to use the not
and it's always added

2691
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:23,880
before the condition that it's
always operated before a condition.

2692
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:28,640
So what is the not operator will do it
basically say not true.

2693
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:30,120
What is not true?

2694
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:32,360
What is the opposite of not true?

2695
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:36,400
Now your true will get converted
to the false.

2696
02:32:36,440 --> 02:32:39,680
Right now
what they see it will show me false right

2697
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:41,640
or right.

2698
02:32:41,640 --> 02:32:43,680
This we will take boolean.

2699
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:47,280
You don't know right?

2700
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:49,480
Make it false and then

2701
02:32:51,040 --> 02:32:52,680
right.

2702
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:53,640
It's false.

2703
02:32:56,760 --> 02:32:57,680
Well,

2704
02:32:57,720 --> 02:33:01,920
if you're going to try to you
of course it will you false.

2705
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:02,600
Right.

2706
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:06,680
But now as soon as you going to add
the note operator,

2707
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:13,240
what I will do, you will change your false
you will change it to a true right.

2708
02:33:13,240 --> 02:33:14,960
You will change it to short.

2709
02:33:14,960 --> 02:33:17,000
So that's all it does.
This did not operate.

2710
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:21,000
It's what it does make.

2711
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,400
What is in use for the real world,
for example.

2712
02:33:23,400 --> 02:33:23,960
Right.

2713
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:27,960
So whenever we do in the coding,
right, we'll never be doing the coding

2714
02:33:28,680 --> 02:33:31,320
then we want to do something.

2715
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:35,480
What I want to say, I want to say,
hey, let's take a simple example, right?

2716
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:37,800
Let's take a simple example.

2717
02:33:37,800 --> 02:33:41,560
Right now is a
I know it's sunny or whatever.

2718
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:43,760
Let me take one variable boolean.

2719
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:47,080
Let me take it is rain, right?

2720
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:48,840
Variable is right.

2721
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:50,520
For example, there's no rain.

2722
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:53,480
Rain or if there's a rain does not matter.

2723
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:54,160
Right.

2724
02:33:54,640 --> 02:34:00,720
So now when I want to have a condition
right, I want to have a condition.

2725
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:06,080
If there is no rain,
If there is no rain, I'll go for a walk.

2726
02:34:06,200 --> 02:34:06,600
Right.

2727
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:09,840
I want to see if there is
no I'll go for a walk.

2728
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:13,040
There is no other conditions
I want You have

2729
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:16,440
I would want to have otherwise
my strictly condition.

2730
02:34:16,440 --> 02:34:19,360
If there is no rain, I'll go for a walk.

2731
02:34:19,440 --> 02:34:22,760
Right.
So now how will you do this exercise?

2732
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:29,200
Then you will say, Hey,
if there is no rain right, you will say.

2733
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:30,840
You will say is rain.

2734
02:34:30,840 --> 02:34:33,960
Right?

2735
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:37,440
No, you
you want to see if there is no rain.

2736
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,560
If there's no rain,
then what do you will do?

2737
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:46,760
You want to say I want to go for a walk.

2738
02:34:46,760 --> 02:34:47,520
I will go

2739
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:51,240
or what?

2740
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:54,600
I will go for a walk.

2741
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:55,080
Right?

2742
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:57,280
You don't want to have
the l'espoir, right?

2743
02:34:57,280 --> 02:34:59,840
You don't want to have that elsewhere,
but you want to say, Hey,

2744
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:03,840
if there's rain, only then I'll do
certain action, right?

2745
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:05,480
I'll do certain action.

2746
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:08,000
So now let's see what I will do right now.

2747
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:11,640
I said, Hey, holy moly,
if there is no rain.

2748
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:14,160
So what is the value of rain?

2749
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:16,040
The value of rain is true.

2750
02:35:16,040 --> 02:35:18,360
Now here you will have it for

2751
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:22,080
then use in the not operator.

2752
02:35:22,320 --> 02:35:26,240
Your condition will get converted
to the false right

2753
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:29,400
and then. Hey,

2754
02:35:29,400 --> 02:35:34,240
hey if the condition is false,
you cannot enter inside your program.

2755
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:36,160
Want to be finished? There's no else part.

2756
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:38,080
There's no other way. Right.

2757
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:41,040
So now in this speech there be any output.

2758
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:43,960
Okay. To holes comes from here,
right? That's.

2759
02:35:43,960 --> 02:35:46,200
But nothing comes right now.

2760
02:35:46,200 --> 02:35:50,880
As soon as you enter it, you falls right
now, what will happen?

2761
02:35:50,880 --> 02:35:57,360
Hey, the value of is rain is false, right?

2762
02:35:57,360 --> 02:36:00,120
The value of rain is false. Right.

2763
02:36:00,120 --> 02:36:01,880
The value of rain is false.

2764
02:36:01,880 --> 02:36:04,680
Now you have a not operator.

2765
02:36:04,920 --> 02:36:07,560
Your false will get changed to true.

2766
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:12,120
And then once the condition is true,
you're able to execute it.

2767
02:36:12,240 --> 02:36:14,520
Right. We were able to execute.

2768
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:17,200
You know, it says I will go for a walk.

2769
02:36:17,400 --> 02:36:20,880
I will go for a walk.

2770
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:21,080
Right.

2771
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:23,280
For example.

2772
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:25,240
Right. For example.

2773
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:29,760
And let me try to give you the example
from our automation.

2774
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:32,640
Right. From our automation,

2775
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:34,760
for example, like, for example,

2776
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:37,760
when doing the automation, right,

2777
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:42,000
when doing the automation,
we'll be going on the browsers, right?

2778
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:44,400
We will be going on the browsers.

2779
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:48,120
Now, for example,
when you navigate to the browser, right,

2780
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:52,560
you to make sure that there's only one
login button, right?

2781
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:55,360
There is only one login button.

2782
02:36:55,360 --> 02:37:00,720
So now if there will be two login buttons,
right there, all let's say for example,

2783
02:37:00,720 --> 02:37:05,000
you want to click on the one
only only login button, right?

2784
02:37:05,560 --> 02:37:09,120
All for example,
you don't want to click on some specific.

2785
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:15,720
So what you will say, hey,
if the value of this link or if the value

2786
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:19,320
if this button not equal to something,

2787
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:22,320
only then I'll perform some action, right?

2788
02:37:22,400 --> 02:37:27,720
Only then I perform some action only now
only those two links are not equal, right?

2789
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:28,320
Only.

2790
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:31,600
Only the text on those links
is not equal to each other.

2791
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:36,360
Only then I will click on the first link
and then I'll click on the second.

2792
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:37,200
Right.

2793
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:42,560
But if the links will be having the same
text, your code will get confused.

2794
02:37:42,560 --> 02:37:42,720
Then.

2795
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:46,200
Then then probably there is some error on,
on the on the application.

2796
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:46,760
Right.

2797
02:37:46,760 --> 02:37:49,080
So you want to perform action.

2798
02:37:49,320 --> 02:37:50,640
What do you want to perform?

2799
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:56,560
The click action only only the text on
those links is not equal.

2800
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:58,320
If it's not equal, then

2801
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:00,640
then I will perform

2802
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:03,720
some action
which I give username and password.

2803
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:08,280
Yes, you can say hey when I'm going to ask
right?

2804
02:38:08,280 --> 02:38:10,480
Only normally right when you guys

2805
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:14,640
when you this
trying to create your account.

2806
02:38:14,760 --> 02:38:15,040
Right.

2807
02:38:15,040 --> 02:38:19,680
When you trying to create a account and
you trying to enter I don't know password.

2808
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:20,320
Right.

2809
02:38:20,400 --> 02:38:24,480
So then your valid password will be all in

2810
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:28,280
only if it's not equal to username.

2811
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:29,040
Right.

2812
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:34,040
In which case password is that only
if it's not equal to username.

2813
02:38:34,040 --> 02:38:34,320
Right.

2814
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:35,920
So there will be

2815
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:38,320
some scenarios and probably this

2816
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:41,960
once we start going more into the machine,
it will start making more sense.

2817
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:45,720
But for now, what I want you to on
this thing is I want you to understand

2818
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:49,080
what is the mode operator does right?

2819
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:50,720
What is the not apparatus?

2820
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:53,400
Okay, let's take

2821
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:56,040
one more example
or second one more example.

2822
02:38:56,040 --> 02:38:58,800
Right, right.

2823
02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:02,880
I don't know.

2824
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:06,120
Let me think of example this,
but we think of the example.

2825
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:07,080
Right?

2826
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:07,600
Okay.

2827
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:12,360
Let's take let's take our
the username and password, for example.

2828
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:15,240
We will have string username,

2829
02:39:15,360 --> 02:39:19,560
write string username, and for example,
the username will be

2830
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:22,560
test, username will be test.

2831
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:25,240
Right. It right.

2832
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:29,000
So now we know that on our whenever
we try to create

2833
02:39:29,920 --> 02:39:32,840
create a password,
we have the warning right?

2834
02:39:32,840 --> 02:39:38,560
It's always a hey your password cannot be
the same as the username right.

2835
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:40,520
Your password cannot be the same username.

2836
02:39:40,520 --> 02:39:42,680
You know what you want to say, right?

2837
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:47,360
You want to say only lonely, right?

2838
02:39:47,360 --> 02:39:49,800
Online only username.

2839
02:39:50,400 --> 02:39:53,640
Actually let
let me add another string password.

2840
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:57,280
Like string password.

2841
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:57,520
Right.

2842
02:39:57,520 --> 02:40:01,680
Then for example, I'm
going to add for example for now also test

2843
02:40:01,960 --> 02:40:06,160
right now I want to say right now

2844
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:09,480
I want to say only, only if username

2845
02:40:10,920 --> 02:40:14,680
equals right and equals to your password.

2846
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:15,000
Right.

2847
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:18,760
For now me just password
or I can just type the word right.

2848
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:21,360
So now this will check for equality.

2849
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:25,640
But what I want to say,
I want you to say all in.

2850
02:40:25,640 --> 02:40:30,160
Only when a user name
is not equal to password.

2851
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:30,520
Right.

2852
02:40:30,520 --> 02:40:34,320
So now what I want to do,
I want to reverse this condition,

2853
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:38,840
to reverse this condition, I will add that
exclamation mark only more.

2854
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:42,200
Only when usernames are username
is not equal.

2855
02:40:42,200 --> 02:40:45,080
So your password
then I can say I am accepting.

2856
02:40:45,080 --> 02:40:45,520
I don't know.

2857
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:49,120
I'm accepting your

2858
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:52,880
doing this and doing this.

2859
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:55,560
And you say What's to happen?

2860
02:40:57,160 --> 02:41:02,000
So now your username is a test, right?

2861
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:06,000
Hey, is test equals to test

2862
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:10,560
condition in here will give me true right

2863
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:15,120
then I'm using logical not right

2864
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:19,320
so now a true will be turned to the false.

2865
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:21,760
Now you cannot go inside.

2866
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:25,200
You cannot go inside but a morning you're

2867
02:41:26,680 --> 02:41:28,160
ready.

2868
02:41:28,160 --> 02:41:30,800
Let me read you plug in in here

2869
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:31,400
you will see.

2870
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:33,120
Does one go

2871
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:35,400
here?

2872
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:36,040
Right.

2873
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:38,160
What is the username?

2874
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:39,800
Username in test?

2875
02:41:39,800 --> 02:41:42,720
What is the password?
I entered for example.

2876
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:43,800
Also test.

2877
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:48,600
Right now
I'm saying hey only only is user name

2878
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:51,840
which test equals to password.

2879
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:53,880
And then I'm saying not

2880
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:58,120
only only do they not equal only
then I will accept your password.

2881
02:41:58,120 --> 02:41:58,800
Right.

2882
02:41:58,920 --> 02:42:01,360
I'm not providing
any other match conditions.

2883
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:04,400
So now you could go. So.

2884
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:05,560
So now all in.

2885
02:42:05,560 --> 02:42:07,600
Only if I know

2886
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:14,760
now. Only know me right now.

2887
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:15,960
If you will check.

2888
02:42:15,960 --> 02:42:19,440
Hey, the username which is test

2889
02:42:19,960 --> 02:42:22,840
K is the test equals to password.

2890
02:42:23,040 --> 02:42:25,840
No condition will be false

2891
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:29,640
now because I'm using the note operator.

2892
02:42:29,640 --> 02:42:30,080
Right.

2893
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:36,120
So now my false using
not operator will turn into the true.

2894
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:38,400
So now one condition is true.

2895
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:42,040
I can inside
and now I'm going to get the output.

2896
02:42:42,400 --> 02:42:59,440
I am accepting your password case.

2897
02:42:59,440 --> 02:43:01,680
Maybe you can think good.

2898
02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:04,320
I mean, I would think more of that.

2899
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:06,280
It's reverse the conditions.

2900
02:43:06,280 --> 02:43:09,640
That's that's what I that's
I was doing for example.

2901
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:11,920
Right. Actually another example

2902
02:43:14,680 --> 02:43:16,640
when we looked in the application.

2903
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:16,840
Right.

2904
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:20,160
So let me see
if we can find any application

2905
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:24,120
we have

2906
02:43:25,560 --> 02:43:27,840
probably not going to find in here,

2907
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:31,720
but we see

2908
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:38,200
there's no checkbox.

2909
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:38,640
Okay.

2910
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:41,480
But I want to get

2911
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:45,920
think of this on our applications.

2912
02:43:45,920 --> 02:43:47,400
What do we have? Right.

2913
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:51,000
Sometimes we have
there's something that called checkbox

2914
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:53,640
write something that culture box

2915
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:56,920
like for example, it will act.

2916
02:43:56,920 --> 02:43:59,800
It will ask us, do you accept something?

2917
02:43:59,800 --> 02:44:01,840
Something right? You accept.

2918
02:44:02,520 --> 02:44:05,040
And then we will have to select
this checkbox.

2919
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:07,320
We will have to select it. Right.

2920
02:44:07,320 --> 02:44:08,960
But what happens, guys?

2921
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:09,840
What happens

2922
02:44:09,840 --> 02:44:14,400
if your checkbox is already selected
and if you're going to click on it?

2923
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:15,400
What's going to happen?

2924
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:19,320
This if you checkbox is already selected,
then now you want to click it again.

2925
02:44:19,320 --> 02:44:24,720
What will happen,

2926
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:28,360
what it will do, it will select,
it will uncheck.

2927
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:28,920
Right?

2928
02:44:28,920 --> 02:44:31,280
And then of course
you won't be able proceed.

2929
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:37,920
So now what we will do, we will add our
if statement we will say only in

2930
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:41,760
only if the box not checked

2931
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,480
only and only If the box is not checked

2932
02:44:44,800 --> 02:44:49,600
only then what I would like
to do click on that on that checkbox.

2933
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:51,760
Only then I want you to click.

2934
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:52,160
Okay.

2935
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:54,600
That's actually another good scenario.

2936
02:44:54,600 --> 02:44:55,320
Right?

2937
02:44:55,320 --> 02:45:00,440
But if, if, if it's if it's already
checked, if it will be, give me true.

2938
02:45:00,520 --> 02:45:00,800
Right.

2939
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:03,320
That's
how actually those checkboxes have worked.

2940
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:06,120
So whenever it will be checked,
it will give you true.

2941
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:08,200
Whenever it's unchecked,
it will give you full.

2942
02:45:08,200 --> 02:45:13,240
So now all in only when box
is not checked, then I'm going to click.

2943
02:45:13,240 --> 02:45:14,520
Click. Okay.

2944
02:45:14,680 --> 02:45:17,920
That's our automation scenario.

2945
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:24,080
When we're going to use this note
operator.

2946
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:25,440
I hope that makes sense best.

2947
02:45:25,440 --> 02:45:32,120
If that doesn't make sense.

2948
02:45:32,120 --> 02:45:32,360
Okay.

2949
02:45:34,320 --> 02:45:34,920
Right.

2950
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:37,560
So if you're going to write it in
here, right.

2951
02:45:38,520 --> 02:45:39,720
Okay. I hope it's good.

2952
02:45:39,720 --> 02:45:42,480
I hope that's how it works.
That's right. So let's see.

2953
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:45,680
Let's take that checkbox right.

2954
02:45:45,680 --> 02:45:48,560
Booleans it box, Right.

2955
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:51,640
So say if it's selected. Right.

2956
02:45:51,640 --> 02:45:55,400
So when you saw that, it says, Yeah, yeah,
we're going to take a break.

2957
02:45:55,760 --> 02:45:58,680
And now I wanted to say all in only,

2958
02:45:59,240 --> 02:46:03,720
only or actually not checkbox
Let's make it selected.

2959
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:05,000
So like, right.

2960
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,800
So I want to say only in only

2961
02:46:07,800 --> 02:46:11,040
if my checkbox is

2962
02:46:11,040 --> 02:46:13,760
not selected right, then

2963
02:46:15,360 --> 02:46:16,520
that's what I will do.

2964
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:22,080
Oh, duplicate.

2965
02:46:23,360 --> 02:46:23,840
Right.

2966
02:46:24,840 --> 02:46:30,000
So this way if your record will be shown
that the checkbox is selected,

2967
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:34,200
which is true,
then it will convert it to the false.

2968
02:46:34,200 --> 02:46:38,160
Then you will never perform
the click on the trip box,

2969
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:43,120
but the checkbox will show you that hey,
no, it has never been checked.

2970
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:47,440
Now false converted into true.

2971
02:46:47,440 --> 02:46:48,040
Right?

2972
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:51,120
And then what
you will perform from this click

2973
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:57,720
on for the let's let's take a break

2974
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:02,800
133 Let's take a break until 155.

2975
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:05,400
Okay. I'm starting the spinning.

2976
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:05,800
That's good.

2977
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:10,320
As long as you get started this week
and then you'll do practice

2978
02:47:10,320 --> 02:47:12,760
and they will start giving you more
and more and

2979
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:14,880
more thing.

2980
02:47:14,880 --> 02:47:17,280
It's 135 or 155.

2981
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:20,480
Get it break.

2982
02:47:20,480 --> 02:47:26,800
You want 55.

2983
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:28,720
I'm right.

2984
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:29,760
Okay.

2985
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:47,480
I hope you guys were able
to take your little break.

2986
02:47:47,480 --> 02:47:48,920
So we back.

2987
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:52,880
Well, I hope you guys
I hope you guys are all back My car.

2988
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:54,640
More coffee to your body?

2989
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:56,280
Well, that's what you guys will need.

2990
02:47:56,280 --> 02:47:59,760
Make sure you get enough coffee, teas,
whatever you need for the next six months.

2991
02:48:00,440 --> 02:48:01,800
That's I can guarantee you.

2992
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:04,160
You guys will need it, right?

2993
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:05,880
Especially people on the

2994
02:48:07,080 --> 02:48:08,400
West coast.

2995
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:11,280
Your Sunday and Saturday stars
at seven in the morning

2996
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:11,960
right

2997
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:19,600
where I am.

2998
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:24,600
Mariam was taking the power naps.

2999
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:27,560
All right,
guys, let's get back to our Java.

3000
02:48:27,560 --> 02:48:28,280
Right.

3001
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:33,240
So today
we said we are looking into the logical

3002
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:37,440
where logical upgrades
are given in our Java

3003
02:48:37,440 --> 02:48:40,840
programing
whenever we want to test write up.

3004
02:48:40,960 --> 02:48:41,280
Right.

3005
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:44,880
Not all logical upgrades right
logical operators

3006
02:48:44,880 --> 02:48:49,320
and or enough right logical
and on or a given to us

3007
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:55,600
when we want to test choose
or more conditions in one statement.

3008
02:48:55,600 --> 02:49:00,040
Right so and then the not operator right
very simple

3009
02:49:00,040 --> 02:49:03,960
very easy note operator what it simply
does it reverse the conditions.

3010
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:04,480
Right?

3011
02:49:04,760 --> 02:49:08,920
And because our condition
it's a Boolean type of value.

3012
02:49:09,400 --> 02:49:10,760
And what is the Boolean?

3013
02:49:10,760 --> 02:49:13,680
Chappell Now
type of value can be the true or false.

3014
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,440
So what is the note Operator?

3015
02:49:15,440 --> 02:49:17,920
Does it reverse the condition? Right?

3016
02:49:17,920 --> 02:49:22,200
So whenever you have a true right,
so you what your

3017
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:27,320
not operator is going
reverted to the false one

3018
02:49:27,360 --> 02:49:30,840
and we have a false is going
reverted to the true right

3019
02:49:31,720 --> 02:49:36,160
and here what we did right example right
if there is no rain

3020
02:49:36,600 --> 02:49:40,080
if there's no rain
then I'll go for a walk.

3021
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:42,840
Right. So when the value will be false.

3022
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:47,920
Now we can worry if false good true,
then the condition becomes right.

3023
02:49:48,840 --> 02:49:50,080
And in here. Right.

3024
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:52,880
Okay. Is the check checkboxes
selected? Right?

3025
02:49:52,880 --> 02:49:56,120
If the checkbox is already selected,
then we say.

3026
02:49:56,120 --> 02:49:56,920
And only.

3027
02:49:56,920 --> 02:49:59,520
Only if the check box is not selected.

3028
02:49:59,840 --> 02:50:01,920
Only then I'll do click right.

3029
02:50:01,920 --> 02:50:06,600
So now our true condition
will be converted to the false

3030
02:50:06,760 --> 02:50:10,160
and then the statement
will never be executed.

3031
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:13,720
Okay.

3032
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:14,240
All right.

3033
02:50:14,240 --> 02:50:17,360
Any questions
for any of these logical operators?

3034
02:50:17,360 --> 02:50:30,160
Any questions?

3035
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:33,360
Okay. I hope it's clear.

3036
02:50:33,360 --> 02:50:35,040
So know what?

3037
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:37,920
I want to show you this.
I want to show you a little

3038
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:42,560
a little things for our code.

3039
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:42,880
Right.

3040
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:46,680
So a little enhancements
that we want to start adding.

3041
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:47,400
Right.

3042
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:52,960
So before we go and maybe we will test
this statement, maybe not.

3043
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:54,040
So we'll see.

3044
02:50:54,040 --> 02:50:55,960
But I want to show you something like.

3045
02:50:55,960 --> 02:50:56,440
Right.

3046
02:50:57,480 --> 02:51:02,440
Okay So when you look into this scenario,
when we look into this scenario.

3047
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:03,040
Right.

3048
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:05,760
And we can look at a very simple one,
we don't have to

3049
02:51:07,280 --> 02:51:08,800
take an assumption. Well, that's fine.

3050
02:51:08,800 --> 02:51:10,520
We'll take examples. Right.

3051
02:51:10,520 --> 02:51:12,720
So, for example,

3052
02:51:13,200 --> 02:51:15,000
what if right now, guess

3053
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:21,160
what if right now,
what if right now this given exercise.

3054
02:51:21,160 --> 02:51:21,880
Right.

3055
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:26,800
I have to add something else for.

3056
02:51:26,800 --> 02:51:28,320
Example, right.

3057
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:30,600
In my exercise right now,

3058
02:51:30,600 --> 02:51:34,800
the goal of this exercise is to find
the three largest numbers, right?

3059
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:38,840
The goal is to find out, sorry,
that the the largest number out of the

3060
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:40,480
three numbers.

3061
02:51:40,480 --> 02:51:40,960
Right.

3062
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:45,240
So what if now I want to do

3063
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:49,440
based on their result,
based on the result that I'm getting.

3064
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:50,000
Right.

3065
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,840
Whichever number is the largest, worse
than the one or number two

3066
02:51:53,840 --> 02:51:57,840
or number three,
based on which number is the largest.

3067
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:00,960
Now, I want to check another condition,

3068
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:03,960
not I want to say, hey, now,

3069
02:52:03,960 --> 02:52:06,600
can you tell me that the largest

3070
02:52:07,200 --> 02:52:11,400
whether the largest number
is even or art, right.

3071
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:13,360
Even or so.

3072
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:16,360
Now, let me ask you guys, how do you guys
think you will start doing it?

3073
02:52:16,360 --> 02:52:21,320
So now, once you find out
which number is the largest,

3074
02:52:21,800 --> 02:52:26,240
please tell me whether this largest number
is even or odd number.

3075
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:27,720
Are you going to do it

3076
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:47,080
using percentage?

3077
02:52:47,080 --> 02:52:49,160
Yep. So we will add that right.

3078
02:52:49,160 --> 02:52:52,800
And that we will add
that we will have to throw that right

3079
02:52:54,040 --> 02:52:54,840
actually in this

3080
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:59,040
exercise because you guys said now
one is the largest, which is one, right.

3081
02:52:59,080 --> 02:53:03,880
Which is like the
I want to show you a little bit diff,

3082
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:07,960
not different way, but probably more

3083
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:11,840
preferred way of how this assignment

3084
02:53:11,840 --> 02:53:15,240
could be completed and how this assignment
could be completed.

3085
02:53:15,720 --> 02:53:19,720
I'm not going to change the logic
of using EVE statements,

3086
02:53:19,720 --> 02:53:23,160
not going to change the logic
of using the logical approach.

3087
02:53:23,160 --> 02:53:28,160
No logic in call will stay the same,
but what we will try to do is

3088
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:32,480
we will try to write a little bit
a cleaner code,

3089
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:39,040
because when we look into our exercises
right now, right,

3090
02:53:39,040 --> 02:53:42,240
we look into our exercises
where we know that

3091
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:44,640
the words are

3092
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:45,600
right.

3093
02:53:46,360 --> 02:53:51,640
So in here, so everywhere,
what we are doing right now is great.

3094
02:53:51,720 --> 02:53:56,800
Based on the condition
I have some specific output, right?

3095
02:53:56,800 --> 02:53:59,880
I have some specific
output, some specific output

3096
02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:01,920
by for

3097
02:54:01,920 --> 02:54:07,200
when it comes to coding guys, coding is,
not just about print outs.

3098
02:54:07,240 --> 02:54:07,960
Right.

3099
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:11,280
The code is actually about

3100
02:54:12,200 --> 02:54:16,120
performing
some particular task right in here.

3101
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:20,080
Hey, if the checkbox is not selected,
then I'm going to do

3102
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:22,600
going to perform the click right.

3103
02:54:23,160 --> 02:54:25,640
Actually,
it shouldn't B.S. South. It will.

3104
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:28,520
It should be an actual actual clip. Right.

3105
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:31,880
So and we will
we will see how those things work.

3106
02:54:31,880 --> 02:54:35,120
Right. So now another thing, right?

3107
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:38,960
What I mean here we kind of like already
did it the little bit, right?

3108
02:54:39,280 --> 02:54:41,760
So now we said now
one is the largest, number two.

3109
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:45,960
And now if we want to define
which number is

3110
02:54:45,960 --> 02:54:49,200
if your largest number is equal or right.

3111
02:54:49,520 --> 02:54:53,040
So now you guys
probably would have to come in here

3112
02:54:53,240 --> 02:54:58,200
and hey, if num one right num one more

3113
02:55:00,040 --> 02:55:01,720
now one

3114
02:55:02,640 --> 02:55:05,040
more to equals to zero.

3115
02:55:05,400 --> 02:55:05,840
Right.

3116
02:55:05,840 --> 02:55:10,880
Then you probably will say the number is
equal or the number is right.

3117
02:55:10,880 --> 02:55:14,080
So then you will at this

3118
02:55:14,080 --> 02:55:16,320
and then then you'll see

3119
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:19,760
now one I don't know that that one plus

3120
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:22,200
in this

3121
02:55:22,520 --> 02:55:25,560
is the model number

3122
02:55:26,840 --> 02:55:29,400
and near or else

3123
02:55:29,400 --> 02:55:34,040
it's an even number right.

3124
02:55:34,040 --> 02:55:38,080
And then what you would have to do
you will have to observe even right

3125
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:42,720
evening and then you would have to
do the same thing for a num to

3126
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:46,360
and then you probably would have to
do the same thing for an empty

3127
02:55:46,600 --> 02:55:48,360
as one of the would. Right.

3128
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:50,360
So now one to me and I'll look into this,

3129
02:55:50,360 --> 02:55:55,000
our code becomes a little,
a little messy and too big.

3130
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:55,720
Right.

3131
02:55:55,960 --> 02:55:58,960
So now what we will try to do,

3132
02:55:59,120 --> 02:56:02,160
there is a way how we can start writing

3133
02:56:02,160 --> 02:56:05,400
a cleaner code and there is a way

3134
02:56:05,640 --> 02:56:09,320
how we can improve our coding in here
as well.

3135
02:56:09,320 --> 02:56:10,040
Right?

3136
02:56:10,040 --> 02:56:13,240
So any time we look into the improvement

3137
02:56:13,280 --> 02:56:16,800
or we talk about enhancements,
you guys will start here.

3138
02:56:17,080 --> 02:56:18,720
A lot of terms enhancing.

3139
02:56:18,720 --> 02:56:22,680
Okay, let me enhance my
let me enhance my automation in sprints.

3140
02:56:22,840 --> 02:56:23,360
Okay.

3141
02:56:23,520 --> 02:56:26,120
Or whenever you guys will be going more,

3142
02:56:26,120 --> 02:56:29,960
more and more and over,
you guys will hear that's very, very.

3143
02:56:29,960 --> 02:56:30,840
All right.

3144
02:56:30,840 --> 02:56:36,480
So for example, I want to do guys I want
to I'll take exact the same exercise,

3145
02:56:36,920 --> 02:56:39,000
but now we will try to do it

3146
02:56:39,480 --> 02:56:42,080
in a little bit, enhance with it.

3147
02:56:43,400 --> 02:56:44,680
Let me copy this.

3148
02:56:44,680 --> 02:56:48,680
So this way
you guys will have somewhat better look

3149
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:57,800
because your largest number right.

3150
02:56:57,800 --> 02:57:01,800
Are it spots, largest

3151
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:13,880
number of events.

3152
02:57:13,880 --> 02:57:15,800
Right. Exact the same thing I'll take.

3153
02:57:15,800 --> 02:57:19,720
But now I will start doing all of it.

3154
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:25,800
So I think lots of others.

3155
02:57:25,800 --> 02:57:26,440
Right.

3156
02:57:26,880 --> 02:57:28,360
So now they all

3157
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:34,200
look think I will try to.

3158
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:36,440
Well, that's fine.
It will be everywhere like that. Right?

3159
02:57:36,920 --> 02:57:41,400
So now you know what I want to do
instead of having this results.

3160
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:45,880
So it has a bit time
and hey, now one is the largest.

3161
02:57:45,880 --> 02:57:48,840
Number two is the largest number.

3162
02:57:49,040 --> 02:57:51,000
Number three is the largest number.

3163
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:55,240
What is what is instead of this C out,

3164
02:57:55,680 --> 02:57:59,120
I actually will perform some operation.

3165
02:57:59,640 --> 02:58:01,080
What kind of operation?

3166
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:04,680
I would perform,
I would declare a variable.

3167
02:58:05,160 --> 02:58:07,080
I will declare a variable, right?

3168
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:11,240
I will declare the variable double

3169
02:58:11,240 --> 02:58:14,800
largest number I largest number largest.

3170
02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:18,680
As of now, I don't know
what is the value of the largest.

3171
02:58:18,680 --> 02:58:19,240
Right?

3172
02:58:19,240 --> 02:58:21,680
So now want to say, hey, you know what?

3173
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:24,320
Now of the typing.

3174
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:26,720
Now one is the largest number.

3175
02:58:27,160 --> 02:58:30,680
Why don't I initialize the variable?

3176
02:58:30,680 --> 02:58:32,640
And let's let's take it simple.

3177
02:58:32,640 --> 02:58:36,240
I'll remove this
because I want to show you different ways.

3178
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:36,880
Right.

3179
02:58:36,880 --> 02:58:40,080
So for now, where there's a list,

3180
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:43,760
we will we will pretend
that all numbers are entered are distinct.

3181
02:58:44,040 --> 02:58:47,640
So now I'm saying, Hey,
why instead of this out,

3182
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:52,800
why don't I say,
why don't I initialize my variable?

3183
02:58:52,800 --> 02:58:56,600
So now, if all those values will be true,

3184
02:58:56,800 --> 02:59:00,600
you already find that
you know one is the largest number.

3185
02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:03,000
And why don't I do something that.

3186
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:07,600
Why don't I say that largest number

3187
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:11,760
equals to no one, Right?

3188
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:15,800
So now, instead of the long C sound,

3189
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:19,840
what I'm doing,
I'm actually performing some operation.

3190
02:59:20,080 --> 02:59:24,560
I'm performing that operation
all initialize in a variable.

3191
02:59:24,560 --> 02:59:27,000
Right?
And the same thing. I'll do it here.

3192
02:59:27,240 --> 02:59:32,160
Now I'm going to say, Hey, now two,
we already said that will be the largest.

3193
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:35,160
Now I'm going to say, Hey,
I'm going to say

3194
02:59:35,840 --> 02:59:39,040
largest number is number two, right?

3195
02:59:39,560 --> 02:59:42,280
Largest number is number two

3196
02:59:42,280 --> 02:59:43,400
for right.

3197
02:59:43,520 --> 02:59:46,360
And then and then in here,

3198
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:49,440
we already said that
the number three will be the largest.

3199
02:59:49,640 --> 02:59:53,400
So now what I'm going to say,
I'm going to say largest

3200
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,560
is equals to number three, Right?

3201
02:59:58,280 --> 03:00:00,800
So now what will happen right now?

3202
03:00:00,800 --> 03:00:02,320
What will happen now?

3203
03:00:02,320 --> 03:00:05,320
Because, you know,
guess how that statement works right

3204
03:00:05,880 --> 03:00:08,600
out of the entire statement, Right.

3205
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:12,400
If we have the look out So all we want

3206
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:15,360
and if only one condition
will become true,

3207
03:00:15,680 --> 03:00:21,200
if non condition will become true,
your call will go to the else part right.

3208
03:00:21,200 --> 03:00:24,760
So this means and we will pretend
that all the numbers are distinct.

3209
03:00:24,880 --> 03:00:26,800
We will pretend
that all the numbers are just

3210
03:00:28,560 --> 03:00:29,680
now we have

3211
03:00:29,680 --> 03:00:33,960
we will enter I don't know, 2010 and five.

3212
03:00:34,120 --> 03:00:34,840
Right.

3213
03:00:34,880 --> 03:00:38,880
So we know that the number one
will be the largest.

3214
03:00:39,160 --> 03:00:41,760
So you caught this condition will be true.

3215
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:45,760
Your call will match, will go inside
and what it will do,

3216
03:00:46,120 --> 03:00:51,240
the value of
no one will initialize value of largest.

3217
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:55,240
So now the largest
will become to number 20.

3218
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:56,000
Right.

3219
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,680
And then we know that
as soon as one condition becomes true,

3220
03:00:58,680 --> 03:01:00,680
the rest will be ignored. Right.

3221
03:01:00,680 --> 03:01:04,680
And the same thing will be happening
if you will enter, for example.

3222
03:01:04,680 --> 03:01:08,400
Right. We will enter 1025. Right.

3223
03:01:08,400 --> 03:01:12,440
We will take indistinct numbers
so we know this condition.

3224
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:14,880
One be true, right?

3225
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:17,520
We know that number two will be true.

3226
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:21,400
So then this else if becomes true, right.

3227
03:01:21,400 --> 03:01:23,440
And this statement will get executed.

3228
03:01:23,440 --> 03:01:27,320
Right is based on
we will get it is all we need right now

3229
03:01:27,320 --> 03:01:30,400
guys instead of the playing style.

3230
03:01:30,400 --> 03:01:31,080
Let's see.

3231
03:01:31,080 --> 03:01:33,600
Let's see that on every single line.

3232
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:37,560
What we did, we initialize our variable.

3233
03:01:38,280 --> 03:01:41,280
Now What?
We will do this now what will do?

3234
03:01:42,680 --> 03:01:43,440
Well,

3235
03:01:43,440 --> 03:01:46,920
you'll largest will be initialized
inside this condition

3236
03:01:47,360 --> 03:01:51,880
or inside this condition
or inside this condition.

3237
03:01:51,880 --> 03:01:54,760
Right now what I can do is

3238
03:01:55,160 --> 03:01:58,080
I can just add one statement in here

3239
03:01:58,080 --> 03:02:00,840
and now I can see the largest

3240
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:09,360
number is, the largest number is

3241
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:13,080
and plus the largest

3242
03:02:13,640 --> 03:02:14,600
realized.

3243
03:02:14,840 --> 03:02:17,400
There will be some error,
but don't worry about it.

3244
03:02:17,400 --> 03:02:18,480
We will fix.

3245
03:02:18,480 --> 03:02:21,120
Now this. I want you to look at this code.

3246
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:25,000
At first I want you to look
at the cleanliness of the code.

3247
03:02:25,480 --> 03:02:30,120
Now let's look at this code
that we have worried ahead.

3248
03:02:30,120 --> 03:02:30,360
Right.

3249
03:02:30,360 --> 03:02:35,520
Even if I remove this for now,
we had a lot of sea, thousands suits out.

3250
03:02:36,120 --> 03:02:38,760
And now look at this code on our right.

3251
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:41,160
This look at the code on our right.

3252
03:02:41,440 --> 03:02:45,440
So what happened
out of the entire exercise?

3253
03:02:45,920 --> 03:02:48,000
I have only wants to start statement.

3254
03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:51,960
I was able to do
all we want to show statement. Why?

3255
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:57,880
Because instead of having sea
cells one, two, three times what I did,

3256
03:02:58,280 --> 03:03:03,400
once I identified the largest number,
I assign to the variable.

3257
03:03:03,840 --> 03:03:08,160
Once I identify which number is
the largest, I initialize right?

3258
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:11,000
And then I'll set of my

3259
03:03:11,360 --> 03:03:15,520
if else in blog I have only one print out.

3260
03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:19,440
So now let me ask you this
just from your eyes.

3261
03:03:19,440 --> 03:03:23,680
Just just by looking at this code,
tell Me guys, which code loops

3262
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:26,400
And even if I'll remove the spaces
that way,

3263
03:03:26,400 --> 03:03:30,240
there is no spaces in that world right?

3264
03:03:30,240 --> 03:03:35,600
Which code looks more cleaner?

3265
03:03:35,600 --> 03:03:38,960
Second one,
right. Second one looks cleaner.

3266
03:03:40,160 --> 03:03:42,120
So that's one point, right?

3267
03:03:42,120 --> 03:03:44,080
That's one point.

3268
03:03:44,080 --> 03:03:46,320
Now Think it this

3269
03:03:46,320 --> 03:03:49,320
I added another condition in here. Right.

3270
03:03:49,480 --> 03:03:52,640
I added another condition I added.

3271
03:03:52,640 --> 03:03:58,080
I say, Hey, what
if now the largest number that you found,

3272
03:03:58,320 --> 03:04:01,440
tell me if this number is even or odd.

3273
03:04:02,080 --> 03:04:07,320
So what you had to do,
you would have to put all this

3274
03:04:07,320 --> 03:04:10,120
If statements for your are one,

3275
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:14,360
then you would have to draw this statement

3276
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:18,960
or the number two right.

3277
03:04:18,960 --> 03:04:22,520
And say to two.

3278
03:04:23,040 --> 03:04:28,720
And then you would have to draw
this statement for the number three right.

3279
03:04:28,720 --> 03:04:31,920
That's probably the most
if you think a little bit more, of course,

3280
03:04:31,920 --> 03:04:36,400
there's can be other ways to fix it,
but this is how it will come.

3281
03:04:36,400 --> 03:04:38,040
Right now?

3282
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:40,080
You will become more and more.

3283
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:42,720
And then when you look inside, Right.

3284
03:04:43,080 --> 03:04:47,280
So what are we having,
guys this is repetitive line, right?

3285
03:04:47,640 --> 03:04:51,480
Is The largest is
the largest is the largest.

3286
03:04:51,960 --> 03:04:55,720
So what I have
I have a repetitive lines of code.

3287
03:04:56,400 --> 03:04:59,080
And now the thing what I have

3288
03:04:59,080 --> 03:05:02,440
this statement,
it's also kind of like repetitive.

3289
03:05:02,880 --> 03:05:06,720
The only thing what I'm changing right now
I'm changing just the variable.

3290
03:05:06,720 --> 03:05:09,120
Now, one num, two and three.

3291
03:05:09,480 --> 03:05:14,040
But this is again
becomes my repetitive lines, right?

3292
03:05:14,400 --> 03:05:18,800
So eventually the goal of our
x is a coding.

3293
03:05:18,800 --> 03:05:23,040
This will be two
if it's possible to eliminate

3294
03:05:23,400 --> 03:05:27,920
repetitive lines
now by looking at this code.

3295
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:31,000
Right. You complete this eventually.

3296
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:32,760
Did you complete the exercise?

3297
03:05:32,760 --> 03:05:35,040
Yes, we did complete the exercise. Right.

3298
03:05:35,360 --> 03:05:37,840
We did find out
which number is the largest.

3299
03:05:38,520 --> 03:05:42,120
And now we did define
whether the largest number is even or not.

3300
03:05:42,480 --> 03:05:43,440
The task is done.

3301
03:05:43,440 --> 03:05:46,920
Yes, the task was done,
but can it be done in the better way?

3302
03:05:46,920 --> 03:05:48,920
Yes, it can be done in the better way.

3303
03:05:48,920 --> 03:05:51,480
Think it goes now. I'll go back in here.

3304
03:05:52,200 --> 03:05:53,680
I'll go back in here.

3305
03:05:53,680 --> 03:05:57,240
I closed that
and then we will come here again. Now,

3306
03:05:58,200 --> 03:05:59,640
now think of this.

3307
03:05:59,640 --> 03:06:01,880
And don't worry,
I'm going to add the zero right now.

3308
03:06:01,880 --> 03:06:04,960
I will explain why
I'm not in the zero for now.

3309
03:06:04,960 --> 03:06:06,120
Just ignore.

3310
03:06:06,120 --> 03:06:09,560
So now think of it this because in here.

3311
03:06:09,760 --> 03:06:14,520
Because inside this if statements.

3312
03:06:14,520 --> 03:06:19,000
Because inside this, each statement,
what I'm doing, I'm being a little bit

3313
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:20,400
more smarter. Right?

3314
03:06:20,400 --> 03:06:25,000
Instead of print out what I'm doing,
I am initializing variable

3315
03:06:25,680 --> 03:06:28,640
now because I have a variable

3316
03:06:28,640 --> 03:06:32,640
that holds the value
right outside of this statement.

3317
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:36,240
The largest will hold
the value of that number.

3318
03:06:36,440 --> 03:06:41,320
And now think what I can do
is I can throw one statement in there

3319
03:06:41,320 --> 03:06:44,280
and I can say, Hey, I've learned number

3320
03:06:46,160 --> 03:06:50,400
what two equals equals to zero.

3321
03:06:50,400 --> 03:06:53,400
Then I'm going to say

3322
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:58,080
how you can initialize variables in here
if I want, but if I want I can just say

3323
03:07:00,440 --> 03:07:01,880
blah. This

3324
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:05,400
number is on my

3325
03:07:16,280 --> 03:07:17,480
and I cannot otherwise,

3326
03:07:17,480 --> 03:07:21,040
if I want, I can write

3327
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,360
or I can even observe even right?

3328
03:07:27,360 --> 03:07:29,560
I can make it even clean after that.

3329
03:07:29,560 --> 03:07:33,480
But what I to show you right now
because right now,

3330
03:07:34,360 --> 03:07:38,640
because right now this what you did,
you didn't just boost, it's out.

3331
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:45,160
So first we initialize your variable and
then you have only once this out, right?

3332
03:07:45,160 --> 03:07:46,920
You have only one source out.

3333
03:07:46,920 --> 03:07:49,160
So this makes your code clean.

3334
03:07:49,160 --> 03:07:52,680
There you try
you are eliminating some unnecessary

3335
03:07:52,680 --> 03:07:55,680
C cells that are kind of
like saying the same thing.

3336
03:07:55,680 --> 03:07:56,360
Right?

3337
03:07:56,480 --> 03:08:00,400
And then because you did initialize
this variable,

3338
03:08:00,400 --> 03:08:02,160
you did initialize this variable.

3339
03:08:02,160 --> 03:08:06,680
Now this variable holds a value now
instead of the destroying if statements

3340
03:08:06,680 --> 03:08:12,720
here and here and here what you did,
you just added one each statement

3341
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:19,200
and you just identify which numbers
even or it or even to make it better.

3342
03:08:19,200 --> 03:08:21,320
We make it even cleaner code.

3343
03:08:21,320 --> 03:08:22,160
Let me see.

3344
03:08:22,160 --> 03:08:24,200
We can make it even cleaner code, right?

3345
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:25,640
We can see.

3346
03:08:27,160 --> 03:08:28,680
We can see.

3347
03:08:28,680 --> 03:08:31,080
We can take a moving variable. Right?

3348
03:08:31,320 --> 03:08:32,600
I will explain that.

3349
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:36,040
I can I can explain that we can see these

3350
03:08:37,280 --> 03:08:39,120
even right.

3351
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:40,960
So now I can say, right.

3352
03:08:40,960 --> 03:08:44,440
Hey, if the number will be an even number.

3353
03:08:44,560 --> 03:08:45,400
Right.

3354
03:08:45,480 --> 03:08:47,560
I am going to say right

3355
03:08:48,560 --> 03:08:50,840
I'm going to say is even equal special.

3356
03:08:51,240 --> 03:08:54,600
Right to say is even equals to true.

3357
03:08:54,960 --> 03:08:59,080
Otherwise, I can say is
even if it will become too

3358
03:08:59,080 --> 03:09:02,160
complicated again let me no false right

3359
03:09:02,720 --> 03:09:06,400
and then I can have one to self oops.

3360
03:09:06,800 --> 03:09:09,080
I can have one two steps. Right.

3361
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:13,200
So I can say largest number,

3362
03:09:14,840 --> 03:09:16,040
largest

3363
03:09:17,920 --> 03:09:20,480
number E needs

3364
03:09:20,600 --> 03:09:22,080
or is

3365
03:09:22,880 --> 03:09:24,720
even right or something like that.

3366
03:09:24,720 --> 03:09:30,040
You just have to come up with a
right sentences and then concatenate this

3367
03:09:31,360 --> 03:09:33,880
figure right?

3368
03:09:33,880 --> 03:09:35,280
Yes, I will repeat again this.

3369
03:09:35,280 --> 03:09:37,920
I will repeat again. Right.

3370
03:09:38,160 --> 03:09:40,520
So now first thing, don't worry
about this.

3371
03:09:40,520 --> 03:09:41,280
Don't worry about this.

3372
03:09:41,280 --> 03:09:46,520
This I will explain you after
we understand this right now.

3373
03:09:46,520 --> 03:09:47,840
What are we doing in there?

3374
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:49,640
Inside my eve statement.

3375
03:09:49,640 --> 03:09:51,720
Right inside my statement.

3376
03:09:51,720 --> 03:09:54,840
Because our exercise was first right,

3377
03:09:54,840 --> 03:09:57,040
First identify,

3378
03:09:58,720 --> 03:10:01,320
identify largest number.

3379
03:10:01,440 --> 03:10:01,760
Right.

3380
03:10:01,760 --> 03:10:06,120
That was our first thing to do
within the same task

3381
03:10:06,480 --> 03:10:13,160
and set second
continuation was identify right, identify

3382
03:10:14,120 --> 03:10:18,360
eve largest number is
even if largest is even.

3383
03:10:18,360 --> 03:10:19,880
All right.

3384
03:10:19,880 --> 03:10:23,120
So this is important

3385
03:10:23,120 --> 03:10:25,120
even or right even number.

3386
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:32,040
So now what do we did once we capture
all numbers inside our eve statements?

3387
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:33,600
We Identify them.

3388
03:10:33,600 --> 03:10:38,880
Hey, if the first condition match,
then the value of the largest

3389
03:10:39,520 --> 03:10:43,280
will will take the value of now one.

3390
03:10:43,280 --> 03:10:46,800
Otherwise
it will be the value of number two

3391
03:10:47,280 --> 03:10:50,400
or otherwise
it will be the value of number three.

3392
03:10:50,880 --> 03:10:54,960
So what do we do in this if statement this

3393
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:59,160
if statement identifies the largest number

3394
03:10:59,960 --> 03:11:03,880
now based on result,

3395
03:11:04,520 --> 03:11:08,160
based on the result of this statement,

3396
03:11:08,520 --> 03:11:11,440
we can continue doing

3397
03:11:12,600 --> 03:11:15,000
it. We can continue doing more check.

3398
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:15,840
Right?

3399
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:18,000
We can continue to do more check. Right.

3400
03:11:18,240 --> 03:11:22,520
So now what I did right,
we learned, right?

3401
03:11:22,520 --> 03:11:27,680
We said, hey, if I'll take my largest
number, if I try to divide it by two,

3402
03:11:27,680 --> 03:11:31,520
if there is no reminder,
if there's no reminder.

3403
03:11:31,520 --> 03:11:33,520
So here I took a variable.

3404
03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:36,720
I'm saying hey, is even number right?

3405
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,280
Will get the value of true.

3406
03:11:39,280 --> 03:11:40,360
I did not have to do it.

3407
03:11:40,360 --> 03:11:44,200
I could have leave this size,
but to make it more cleaner, click right.

3408
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:48,120
Otherwise
there will be any reminder of cause.

3409
03:11:48,120 --> 03:11:50,840
Then the number one be even right,

3410
03:11:51,200 --> 03:11:53,880
the number one be even

3411
03:11:55,560 --> 03:11:56,320
I'm on. Yes.

3412
03:11:56,320 --> 03:11:59,240
Because we we
we can do more of that stuff.

3413
03:11:59,280 --> 03:12:01,840
Yes, we can easily
make do that stuff. Okay.

3414
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:06,120
But once we learn what is there
why do we do initialization one

3415
03:12:06,120 --> 03:12:08,400
we don't do, we'll come to that. Right?

3416
03:12:08,400 --> 03:12:11,640
And then now
my program has one output, right?

3417
03:12:11,640 --> 03:12:15,720
It will say, Hey,
what is the value of the largest number?

3418
03:12:16,200 --> 03:12:16,920
It will come.

3419
03:12:16,920 --> 03:12:19,920
It will be the value of number one
or number two or three.

3420
03:12:20,280 --> 03:12:24,120
And then I'll say, hey, is that is
this number is even

3421
03:12:24,400 --> 03:12:28,920
and then either going to see true
or either going to see false.

3422
03:12:29,000 --> 03:12:29,520
Right.

3423
03:12:29,720 --> 03:12:32,360
Although we will come to zero,
we will come back to zero.

3424
03:12:32,520 --> 03:12:35,640
So I will explain. But in this way

3425
03:12:37,720 --> 03:12:38,240
and this

3426
03:12:38,240 --> 03:12:42,080
way, what I wanted to show you,
number one, what are we achieving?

3427
03:12:42,080 --> 03:12:44,520
We are achieving
the cleanliness of our code.

3428
03:12:45,280 --> 03:12:50,320
We are eliminating
redundancy of the code, right?

3429
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:53,200
We are eliminating unnecessary see sounds.

3430
03:12:53,960 --> 03:12:56,800
And the second thing,
what are we doing this?

3431
03:12:56,800 --> 03:12:59,600
Because right now
we don't just say systolic.

3432
03:12:59,640 --> 03:13:03,920
Number one is the largest
because we perform some operation

3433
03:13:04,600 --> 03:13:07,640
and now result from operation

3434
03:13:07,640 --> 03:13:11,600
that we have done inside our IF statement

3435
03:13:11,880 --> 03:13:15,160
we are using for the further

3436
03:13:15,400 --> 03:13:19,560
check right, not like for the chin,
but we can use it for more things.

3437
03:13:19,600 --> 03:13:20,160
Right.

3438
03:13:20,160 --> 03:13:24,560
For example,
this think of it like when think of

3439
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:28,560
some application where maybe you guys
I don't applying for mortgages right

3440
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:32,880
so there is a lot of information
that has been taken right

3441
03:13:33,200 --> 03:13:36,680
And then your information
has been calculated right.

3442
03:13:37,080 --> 03:13:41,280
And then for example,
when when you applied for a loan, right,

3443
03:13:41,280 --> 03:13:45,040
maybe the check in your credit score
and they check in your income.

3444
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:47,640
Right.
So there is some operation performed.

3445
03:13:47,640 --> 03:13:51,200
And then if some condition is match

3446
03:13:51,200 --> 03:13:54,360
as the result of this operation,
you will get improved.

3447
03:13:54,920 --> 03:13:57,160
Otherwise you will get declined. Right.

3448
03:13:57,600 --> 03:14:01,200
So there inside the code,
there is no scissors, guys.

3449
03:14:01,480 --> 03:14:06,240
There is a lot a lot of calculation
and variable initialization is done.

3450
03:14:06,520 --> 03:14:09,920
And then after that, there
is a lot of statement in there, right?

3451
03:14:10,080 --> 03:14:12,760
If your score is this,
if your income is this,

3452
03:14:12,960 --> 03:14:16,520
then if all those conditions on match,
then you are getting improve.

3453
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:19,280
Right? So that's
what are we trying to do in here?

3454
03:14:19,280 --> 03:14:22,360
We did one task

3455
03:14:22,680 --> 03:14:26,280
and inside this task
we perform some operation

3456
03:14:26,760 --> 03:14:31,720
and then the result of this operation
we using to define

3457
03:14:31,720 --> 03:14:34,560
whether our number is low is even

3458
03:14:34,840 --> 03:14:37,560
or whether our number is okay.

3459
03:14:38,200 --> 03:14:42,400
So and then eventually,
when you look in our entire

3460
03:14:42,640 --> 03:14:46,560
in various screen,
what I have have only once this out,

3461
03:14:47,360 --> 03:14:50,120
I have only one print out statement.

3462
03:14:50,360 --> 03:14:54,200
And within this print statement
I know which number is the largest

3463
03:14:55,400 --> 03:14:56,400
and I know whether

3464
03:14:56,400 --> 03:14:58,800
my large number is even or

3465
03:15:00,120 --> 03:15:01,160
even or so.

3466
03:15:01,160 --> 03:15:04,160
Now, when you guys are going to compare

3467
03:15:04,600 --> 03:15:07,440
this code, write this code,

3468
03:15:08,680 --> 03:15:10,680
this code with this code

3469
03:15:10,680 --> 03:15:15,480
that don't even fit on my screen right now
here you have

3470
03:15:15,840 --> 03:15:21,000
is even is is even is largest
large is larger.

3471
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:23,000
So a lot of live repetition.

3472
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:27,440
Now when you look on the code on the left,
your code looks clean there.

3473
03:15:27,440 --> 03:15:31,760
So now we are looking more like

3474
03:15:31,800 --> 03:15:37,560
it's a code of or, you know, programmers
that are doing their stuff.

3475
03:15:37,880 --> 03:15:38,480
Right.

3476
03:15:39,720 --> 03:15:40,160
All right.

3477
03:15:40,160 --> 03:15:42,840
So now let let I'll take your questions.

3478
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:46,200
Anyone is besides zero

3479
03:15:46,200 --> 03:15:50,000
Michael still choose the right it's okay
you can still choose the right

3480
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:54,640
but at the same time start practicing
the things of the on the on the left.

3481
03:15:54,640 --> 03:15:54,880
Okay.

3482
03:15:54,880 --> 03:15:58,320
Because eventually we will come slowly

3483
03:15:58,560 --> 03:16:01,160
to the solutions
that we use in on the left.

3484
03:16:01,360 --> 03:16:05,560
Okay, So my main question, guys,

3485
03:16:05,800 --> 03:16:09,400
I want you to ask me
if you did not understand

3486
03:16:09,400 --> 03:16:15,520
why we doing it.

3487
03:16:15,520 --> 03:16:16,400
Zero is coming.

3488
03:16:16,400 --> 03:16:21,560
The zero is coming, why we are doing it.

3489
03:16:21,640 --> 03:16:24,120
We're doing it to make our code cleaner,

3490
03:16:24,640 --> 03:16:29,160
to eliminate any redundant,
unnecessary lines right.

3491
03:16:29,400 --> 03:16:32,360
And also this code will be beneficial

3492
03:16:32,720 --> 03:16:35,760
if you want to perform from the order

3493
03:16:36,200 --> 03:16:39,640
or if there's any other things
you want to do

3494
03:16:39,640 --> 03:16:48,000
based on the result.

3495
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:50,080
On the interviews,
they will look into your logic

3496
03:16:50,080 --> 03:16:55,680
and they will look into the clean
cleanliness of your code.

3497
03:16:55,680 --> 03:16:59,040
And does your Java recognize
largest of the building

3498
03:17:03,520 --> 03:17:06,320
your job identify is why I will show you

3499
03:17:06,320 --> 03:17:10,440
those teeny tiny details, of course,
because I will have to explain it to you.

3500
03:17:10,440 --> 03:17:10,960
And I will.

3501
03:17:10,960 --> 03:17:13,000
I am coming to why It's zero.

3502
03:17:13,160 --> 03:17:15,480
Okay.

3503
03:17:15,480 --> 03:17:18,080
We know size

3504
03:17:19,440 --> 03:17:20,360
for whatever.

3505
03:17:20,360 --> 03:17:21,960
I got these comparisons.

3506
03:17:21,960 --> 03:17:23,840
That works for you, right? Eventually.

3507
03:17:23,840 --> 03:17:26,480
Because you will have to come to that
site.

3508
03:17:26,480 --> 03:17:30,560
Okay.

3509
03:17:30,560 --> 03:17:31,880
I am confused.

3510
03:17:31,880 --> 03:17:34,920
Okay, let's do a

3511
03:17:34,920 --> 03:17:36,960
can focus any more.

3512
03:17:36,960 --> 03:17:39,120
So we're not going to look into this,
which is.

3513
03:17:39,160 --> 03:17:39,920
But let me do it.

3514
03:17:39,920 --> 03:17:41,240
Let me do this things.

3515
03:17:41,240 --> 03:17:41,960
Let me do this.

3516
03:17:41,960 --> 03:17:43,680
Let's do this assignment.

3517
03:17:43,680 --> 03:17:45,960
Okay. And I will come back to zero.

3518
03:17:45,960 --> 03:17:50,040
I will come back to zero.

3519
03:17:50,040 --> 03:17:53,640
Let me look at the this assignment
that I wanted to give it to you

3520
03:17:53,880 --> 03:18:05,640
right. You

3521
03:18:15,640 --> 03:18:16,080
okay?

3522
03:18:16,080 --> 03:18:18,360
Right. We're going to look into the task.

3523
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:22,800
If we're going to look into the task
and then we will look into that.

3524
03:18:22,800 --> 03:18:27,760
So because I want you to show again,
how does it make so clean, right?

3525
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:34,680
Oh, for you.

3526
03:18:34,920 --> 03:18:35,560
Right.

3527
03:18:36,240 --> 03:18:39,760
It will take a longer
wait and we will take a

3528
03:18:40,640 --> 03:18:42,000
we will look into the cleaner.

3529
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:45,560
We do.

3530
03:18:45,560 --> 03:18:45,960
Right.

3531
03:18:47,400 --> 03:18:48,920
So now we want to see, right?

3532
03:18:48,920 --> 03:18:53,240
So we want a program that will ask user to

3533
03:18:55,640 --> 03:18:58,400
to to input a current time.

3534
03:18:58,640 --> 03:19:00,640
Right. A current time.

3535
03:19:00,640 --> 03:19:03,840
So time we will take in 24 hours.

3536
03:19:03,840 --> 03:19:05,120
Try to go slow. Okay.

3537
03:19:05,120 --> 03:19:08,800
I'll try to go slow, even though I am
already a little too slow now.

3538
03:19:09,240 --> 03:19:09,960
Okay.

3539
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:16,200
So now we say based on the given time,
we will define, we will see.

3540
03:19:16,200 --> 03:19:17,160
Right now it's morning.

3541
03:19:17,160 --> 03:19:19,800
Right now
it's afternoon, evening or night.

3542
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:22,080
Right. Okay.

3543
03:19:22,080 --> 03:19:25,320
You know, the same thing
we will be called scanner, right?

3544
03:19:26,600 --> 03:19:29,520
All equals new scanner.

3545
03:19:29,520 --> 03:19:32,000
This party,
you guys already know you don't.

3546
03:19:32,040 --> 03:19:35,320
You need to.

3547
03:19:35,320 --> 03:19:37,840
But I will ask you guys to type it.

3548
03:19:37,840 --> 03:19:39,520
Don't just copy it. Right.

3549
03:19:39,520 --> 03:19:43,480
So just call it import our scanner.

3550
03:19:43,480 --> 03:19:46,720
We should all go now.

3551
03:19:47,760 --> 03:19:53,040
All please.

3552
03:19:54,120 --> 03:19:55,200
Sensor

3553
03:19:57,960 --> 03:20:00,080
a one time

3554
03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:03,160
know you will have to capture the time.

3555
03:20:03,160 --> 03:20:05,320
It will take 24 hour format. Right?

3556
03:20:05,360 --> 03:20:07,320
11, 12, 15, 16.

3557
03:20:07,320 --> 03:20:11,440
All the way to 20 right now
we will capture this time

3558
03:20:11,440 --> 03:20:12,800
and we'll save your time.

3559
03:20:12,800 --> 03:20:14,160
Equals

3560
03:20:15,600 --> 03:20:18,000
in that next integer.

3561
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:18,320
Right.

3562
03:20:18,320 --> 03:20:18,960
All those lines.

3563
03:20:18,960 --> 03:20:21,480
You guys are ready. Right.

3564
03:20:22,200 --> 03:20:25,080
So now I will need to happen here.

3565
03:20:25,080 --> 03:20:28,800
This is just based on the given time.

3566
03:20:29,080 --> 03:20:33,160
I want to define whether it's morning,
afternoon, evening or night.

3567
03:20:33,600 --> 03:20:51,400
How can I go for a days, Eve if what

3568
03:20:57,800 --> 03:21:00,840
if right, if time is

3569
03:21:01,880 --> 03:21:04,280
it times is more than one.

3570
03:21:04,280 --> 03:21:08,560
If you want to include we can include
one more is equal than one

3571
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,680
so and or organize

3572
03:21:15,840 --> 03:21:17,920
and okay and

3573
03:21:19,400 --> 03:21:21,480
time is less.

3574
03:21:21,480 --> 03:21:24,360
And if we want to include
we will include for example

3575
03:21:25,440 --> 03:21:26,560
and let me just go for.

3576
03:21:26,560 --> 03:21:28,000
I see. So it's

3577
03:21:28,720 --> 03:21:31,480
I want to see I don't know

3578
03:21:31,480 --> 03:21:34,320
right now please in morning

3579
03:21:35,360 --> 03:21:38,160
or we can just say morning right now is 20

3580
03:21:41,800 --> 03:21:42,400
right.

3581
03:21:42,920 --> 03:21:44,800
Do I have another condition to just.

3582
03:21:44,800 --> 03:21:47,480
Yes, I do. I'll go for LTV. Right.

3583
03:21:48,120 --> 03:21:50,400
I'll go for a elseif and same thing.

3584
03:21:50,800 --> 03:21:53,920
So now my times
would be more equal than 12.

3585
03:21:54,480 --> 03:21:57,760
And then the same time, time has to me

3586
03:21:59,440 --> 03:22:03,080
less or equal than 15.

3587
03:22:03,080 --> 03:22:04,320
Then we will see.

3588
03:22:05,760 --> 03:22:06,360
Right now

3589
03:22:06,360 --> 03:22:13,240
it's like.

3590
03:22:13,240 --> 03:22:15,760
And then we will go for it else. Right?

3591
03:22:15,800 --> 03:22:17,160
I'll see.

3592
03:22:17,320 --> 03:22:21,040
And then they going to save time from 16
to 24, right?

3593
03:22:21,480 --> 03:22:25,520
More inclusive to 16 in the same time.

3594
03:22:26,280 --> 03:22:29,400
Time is less or than 20.

3595
03:22:29,640 --> 03:22:30,320
Right.

3596
03:22:31,400 --> 03:22:34,480
We will say right now it's only

3597
03:22:39,560 --> 03:22:41,000
and then we have it's

3598
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:44,360
always between 21 to 24 right.

3599
03:22:45,160 --> 03:22:49,960
Is time is more than equal in 21,

3600
03:22:50,800 --> 03:22:53,600
but less than 24.

3601
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:54,480
Right.

3602
03:22:54,600 --> 03:22:57,680
We know.

3603
03:22:57,680 --> 03:22:59,840
And then if nothing else. Right.

3604
03:23:00,360 --> 03:23:02,640
Just in case. Just in case. Right.

3605
03:23:02,880 --> 03:23:06,800
Eve user is 100.

3606
03:23:06,880 --> 03:23:07,280
Right.

3607
03:23:07,280 --> 03:23:10,680
User is 100.

3608
03:23:10,680 --> 03:23:13,280
Else we can say I don't know.

3609
03:23:14,360 --> 03:23:15,920
We can say

3610
03:23:16,320 --> 03:23:19,240
no. Valid.

3611
03:23:19,240 --> 03:23:22,320
Fine. And

3612
03:23:22,320 --> 03:23:24,640
I like this.

3613
03:23:24,640 --> 03:23:26,440
Something like this.

3614
03:23:26,880 --> 03:23:31,760
So can you tell me why didn't you
go for and instead of that or

3615
03:23:55,400 --> 03:23:56,520
so yeah.

3616
03:23:56,520 --> 03:23:58,120
When we check in the time.

3617
03:23:58,120 --> 03:23:58,440
Right.

3618
03:23:58,440 --> 03:24:04,240
For example, what if I'm entering
right now it's 2:00, so it's 14, right?

3619
03:24:04,240 --> 03:24:06,640
If you're going to 20 4:00, it's 14.

3620
03:24:06,840 --> 03:24:08,520
14. Right.

3621
03:24:08,520 --> 03:24:10,480
So now

3622
03:24:10,920 --> 03:24:12,480
when I'm using end.

3623
03:24:12,480 --> 03:24:15,240
Right. Okay. Is that time more than one?

3624
03:24:15,760 --> 03:24:17,400
Yes, time is more than one.

3625
03:24:17,400 --> 03:24:21,000
Condition is true
and time is less than 11.

3626
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:23,800
Condition is false because of the end.

3627
03:24:23,840 --> 03:24:26,640
Operator You will give me false, right?

3628
03:24:26,640 --> 03:24:28,720
My end will give me false.

3629
03:24:28,720 --> 03:24:31,000
And then I'll go to check next condition.

3630
03:24:31,080 --> 03:24:33,600
Right.
And then I'll go check next condition.

3631
03:24:33,840 --> 03:24:35,800
And here it will give me true.

3632
03:24:35,800 --> 03:24:37,680
And here it will give me true.

3633
03:24:37,680 --> 03:24:40,400
And my end operator will give me true.

3634
03:24:40,400 --> 03:24:43,320
So now if we are going to have

3635
03:24:43,560 --> 03:24:49,400
or right, if instead of the end
I'm going to have or right,

3636
03:24:49,440 --> 03:24:53,280
I'm going to have or
and my time is still 14.

3637
03:24:53,920 --> 03:24:56,360
So then what will happen here is the

3638
03:24:56,360 --> 03:24:59,880
time is more than one
use condition is true.

3639
03:25:00,200 --> 03:25:02,880
Time is is less than 11.
Condition is false.

3640
03:25:03,600 --> 03:25:06,120
Now because of the or operator

3641
03:25:06,120 --> 03:25:09,720
I am using, I will get one true.

3642
03:25:09,720 --> 03:25:11,280
And then what happened?

3643
03:25:11,280 --> 03:25:16,440
The statement will get exact
like we will get situations.

3644
03:25:16,440 --> 03:25:20,920
So if you want to use or this condition
always will be true.

3645
03:25:21,400 --> 03:25:23,240
This condition always will be true.

3646
03:25:23,240 --> 03:25:26,280
Your other statements
will never get a chance right?

3647
03:25:26,280 --> 03:25:28,520
So that's why I will meet with our

3648
03:25:35,800 --> 03:25:36,280
book.

3649
03:25:36,360 --> 03:25:36,880
Right.

3650
03:25:38,600 --> 03:25:41,160
So this is like how how can we do it?

3651
03:25:41,160 --> 03:25:42,640
Is there something wrong?

3652
03:25:42,640 --> 03:25:44,880
No, there is nothing wrong.

3653
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:48,160
Yeah, I say basically,
if any time when you talk

3654
03:25:48,160 --> 03:25:51,720
about range right,
you you kind of like use an end.

3655
03:25:51,720 --> 03:25:56,120
But when we check in for specific values
we are using or okay

3656
03:25:58,200 --> 03:26:02,040
in okay.

3657
03:26:03,480 --> 03:26:04,680
All right.

3658
03:26:04,800 --> 03:26:10,360
So now this is how we used to do
this is how we used to do this.

3659
03:26:10,360 --> 03:26:13,480
Now let me just let me try to do it

3660
03:26:14,040 --> 03:26:17,440
with the concept of instead of that. See?

3661
03:26:17,480 --> 03:26:21,080
So why don't I initialize the variable

3662
03:26:21,240 --> 03:26:24,920
instead of the sea that
why don't I initialize the variables.

3663
03:26:24,920 --> 03:26:25,480
Right.

3664
03:26:25,560 --> 03:26:28,920
So all with me on the so

3665
03:26:30,120 --> 03:26:35,440
for actually here.

3666
03:26:35,440 --> 03:26:38,720
So now I'll take this as it is. Right.

3667
03:26:38,720 --> 03:26:41,640
I'll take this it as it is now.

3668
03:26:42,120 --> 03:26:46,440
I will one variable
I will introduce one variable.

3669
03:26:46,880 --> 03:26:49,320
I'll say I don't know string

3670
03:26:50,320 --> 03:26:54,360
of the next.

3671
03:26:54,360 --> 03:26:54,880
Right.

3672
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:59,240
What about
I don't know the value of time of D

3673
03:26:59,240 --> 03:27:02,560
right now I'm going to see

3674
03:27:03,000 --> 03:27:05,960
hey if the time

3675
03:27:07,480 --> 03:27:11,760
if the time is between one and 12 right.

3676
03:27:11,760 --> 03:27:14,040
So what do we have right now?
What is it? Time of the day?

3677
03:27:14,040 --> 03:27:15,840
Guess what is it Time of the day?

3678
03:27:15,840 --> 03:27:30,560
If the time is between one and 12, it's
morning, right?

3679
03:27:30,680 --> 03:27:34,680
So now what I'm going to do,
I take this variable

3680
03:27:35,200 --> 03:27:37,800
and I'm going to assign the Valley

3681
03:27:37,800 --> 03:27:39,560
of Morning to

3682
03:27:42,640 --> 03:27:45,680
else is right else.

3683
03:27:45,680 --> 03:27:49,360
Even this condition is true.

3684
03:27:49,800 --> 03:27:54,520
Now of this this out I'm
going to initialize the variable, right?

3685
03:27:54,880 --> 03:27:57,720
I'm going to say time of the day

3686
03:27:58,200 --> 03:28:02,640
is equals to evening.

3687
03:28:02,640 --> 03:28:03,120
Right.

3688
03:28:04,240 --> 03:28:08,880
Then another right then another else is.

3689
03:28:08,960 --> 03:28:11,200
I'll see what time

3690
03:28:12,600 --> 03:28:14,520
is between here.

3691
03:28:14,520 --> 03:28:16,880
Right is between here.

3692
03:28:17,520 --> 03:28:20,680
All the fine.

3693
03:28:20,680 --> 03:28:22,720
Oh I skip the evening. Right.

3694
03:28:22,720 --> 03:28:25,480
Oh I skipped this one.

3695
03:28:25,480 --> 03:28:26,640
I skipped after that one.

3696
03:28:26,640 --> 03:28:33,240
Mm. Week in the afternoon.

3697
03:28:33,240 --> 03:28:35,360
That's right.

3698
03:28:35,640 --> 03:28:39,360
And I'm copying
because I'm adding the same conditions can

3699
03:28:40,160 --> 03:28:41,520
sometimes

3700
03:28:44,840 --> 03:28:49,360
1 to 11, 12 to 15, 16 to 20.

3701
03:28:49,440 --> 03:28:52,320
Right now it's evening

3702
03:28:53,520 --> 03:28:57,000
last evening and then optional evening.

3703
03:28:57,080 --> 03:28:59,800
I'm going to say time of the day.

3704
03:28:59,840 --> 03:29:00,120
Right.

3705
03:29:00,120 --> 03:29:03,960
Instead of this use that I'm going to say
time of the day

3706
03:29:03,960 --> 03:29:07,120
is equal to what is equal to evening.

3707
03:29:07,320 --> 03:29:07,920
Right.

3708
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:13,960
So now what I'm doing inside
my every block, inside my eve block

3709
03:29:14,400 --> 03:29:16,560
or then inside my ls a block

3710
03:29:17,000 --> 03:29:20,560
instead of having C sounds what I'm doing

3711
03:29:20,920 --> 03:29:23,520
actually is store in the value

3712
03:29:23,760 --> 03:29:26,800
inside this variable silence variable.

3713
03:29:26,800 --> 03:29:28,000
Right.

3714
03:29:28,160 --> 03:29:31,120
And then you send the elsewhere right.

3715
03:29:31,120 --> 03:29:31,720
That's for

3716
03:29:33,440 --> 03:29:34,440
there's l point.

3717
03:29:34,440 --> 03:29:36,000
I can see the time of the day.

3718
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:40,000
It means when we come to the l sports
when user will enter

3719
03:29:40,000 --> 03:29:43,680
something invalid, the right
one user to enter either

3720
03:29:44,040 --> 03:29:48,200
negative number or user will enter zeros
or something.

3721
03:29:48,480 --> 03:29:50,480
Here I can say time of the day.

3722
03:29:50,640 --> 03:29:52,640
I'll just see that for example.

3723
03:29:52,640 --> 03:29:55,760
Right. I'll just say in the

3724
03:29:56,040 --> 03:29:57,280
in norms.

3725
03:29:58,280 --> 03:30:00,400
And now if I want to have one C

3726
03:30:00,400 --> 03:30:03,560
so back into one C stop
now what I can say.

3727
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:04,320
Right.

3728
03:30:04,520 --> 03:30:08,160
So I want you,
I can just print it and then we can have

3729
03:30:08,200 --> 03:30:13,080
another condition.

3730
03:30:13,080 --> 03:30:17,000
Right now we and I will come to me

3731
03:30:17,560 --> 03:30:19,120
time of but

3732
03:30:21,840 --> 03:30:26,960
finally.

3733
03:30:26,960 --> 03:30:28,920
So what are this key?

3734
03:30:28,920 --> 03:30:31,880
I want you to okay I added to extra space,

3735
03:30:31,880 --> 03:30:35,480
extra spaces for now you guys. So

3736
03:30:36,840 --> 03:30:37,880
what are you guys?

3737
03:30:38,200 --> 03:30:40,880
It will do exactly the same thing

3738
03:30:40,880 --> 03:30:43,720
I'll put will be exact the same.

3739
03:30:43,720 --> 03:30:47,400
But when you look into this code

3740
03:30:48,040 --> 03:30:50,400
and when you look into this right.

3741
03:30:50,680 --> 03:30:56,040
So now our code becomes pointer, right?

3742
03:30:56,040 --> 03:31:00,840
As we enter
the current time, it's 43 words.

3743
03:31:00,920 --> 03:31:03,320
Outputs gives me the same thing.

3744
03:31:03,320 --> 03:31:06,240
Right now
it's afternoon, right now it's afternoon.

3745
03:31:06,720 --> 03:31:10,080
But when we look into our actual code

3746
03:31:10,400 --> 03:31:15,160
that we do now on the line
30 code looks clean.

3747
03:31:15,400 --> 03:31:17,920
Okay? And eventually this,

3748
03:31:17,920 --> 03:31:20,760
once we start doing more
and more practice,

3749
03:31:21,240 --> 03:31:25,640
you guys will start seeing it
that there is actually some things

3750
03:31:25,680 --> 03:31:29,320
we are performing,
not just doing the principles,

3751
03:31:29,320 --> 03:31:33,360
but we will be doing some calculation
and assignment of variables

3752
03:31:33,560 --> 03:31:35,040
and different, different stuff.

3753
03:31:35,040 --> 03:31:36,840
Okay, so what now?

3754
03:31:36,840 --> 03:31:39,480
Just think
what it looks way cleaner, right?

3755
03:31:39,480 --> 03:31:39,960
It looks

3756
03:31:41,880 --> 03:31:42,440
okay.

3757
03:31:43,080 --> 03:31:44,400
So now

3758
03:31:45,120 --> 03:31:46,840
at least I hope you will see.

3759
03:31:46,840 --> 03:31:50,080
And let me explain you guys, for now,
just please pay attention.

3760
03:31:50,160 --> 03:31:54,240
So now I will explain you why there
there were zeros.

3761
03:31:54,240 --> 03:31:56,160
Why there was no zeros.

3762
03:31:56,160 --> 03:32:02,480
And see.

3763
03:32:02,480 --> 03:32:05,400
Okay, good. Now. Yeah, like I like that
you got this message.

3764
03:32:05,400 --> 03:32:06,760
So now let's take a look.

3765
03:32:06,760 --> 03:32:08,040
This.

3766
03:32:08,040 --> 03:32:09,640
Let's take a look, guys.

3767
03:32:09,640 --> 03:32:11,480
Why? Right?

3768
03:32:11,480 --> 03:32:13,080
Why? We.

3769
03:32:13,080 --> 03:32:15,600
We got zero before, right?

3770
03:32:15,600 --> 03:32:20,080
Why we had to do zero before
and why some of you are having issues.

3771
03:32:20,480 --> 03:32:23,360
Why some of you are having issues.

3772
03:32:23,360 --> 03:32:23,800
So now.

3773
03:32:23,800 --> 03:32:24,800
Yeah. Was the difference.

3774
03:32:24,800 --> 03:32:27,080
I didn't hear inside my else

3775
03:32:28,160 --> 03:32:30,280
I did initialize my variable.

3776
03:32:30,480 --> 03:32:33,720
Okay I did initialize my be able to now

3777
03:32:34,840 --> 03:32:37,040
show you

3778
03:32:40,160 --> 03:32:41,000
what happens.

3779
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:42,840
Right? What happens.

3780
03:32:42,840 --> 03:32:46,440
So remember this our code is always

3781
03:32:46,440 --> 03:32:49,720
executed up to the bottom, always right.

3782
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:53,560
And so now in here on the line

3783
03:32:53,560 --> 03:32:58,080
36 on the line 36, you created a box.

3784
03:32:59,040 --> 03:32:59,960
Is there any

3785
03:32:59,960 --> 03:33:04,160
value at the current moment
when your Java is at the line?

3786
03:33:04,160 --> 03:33:07,560
36 Are there any value inside this box
right now? This

3787
03:33:09,320 --> 03:33:11,760
there's no we did not initialized, right?

3788
03:33:11,760 --> 03:33:13,440
We did not initialize.

3789
03:33:13,440 --> 03:33:15,240
So now what happens, right?

3790
03:33:15,240 --> 03:33:16,920
What happens

3791
03:33:18,960 --> 03:33:21,440
inside Eve statement.

3792
03:33:21,640 --> 03:33:22,960
Inside the eve statement.

3793
03:33:22,960 --> 03:33:28,440
Right now your java looks at every single
possibility.

3794
03:33:28,760 --> 03:33:30,720
Actually there's someone before
Java looks.

3795
03:33:30,720 --> 03:33:32,440
But for now we'll just say Java.

3796
03:33:32,440 --> 03:33:36,360
Okay,
so now your code is always being checked.

3797
03:33:37,080 --> 03:33:39,360
So now. Okay, Right.

3798
03:33:39,360 --> 03:33:42,960
Eve, My code
will fall inside the eve block

3799
03:33:43,480 --> 03:33:46,800
and my place in the valley,
inside this box and my place in the value.

3800
03:33:46,800 --> 03:33:54,880
This I'm placing the value which valley
I'm placing this string morning.

3801
03:33:54,880 --> 03:33:55,320
Right.

3802
03:33:55,320 --> 03:33:57,920
So when you will go in there, Eve,

3803
03:33:58,240 --> 03:34:01,880
my quarter will be in here
then Bucharest, Czech.

3804
03:34:01,880 --> 03:34:03,640
Okay. What if.

3805
03:34:03,640 --> 03:34:05,400
What is her condition?

3806
03:34:05,400 --> 03:34:06,480
Right. One there. Right.

3807
03:34:06,480 --> 03:34:08,800
The code would have
the code will fill in here.

3808
03:34:08,800 --> 03:34:10,840
Are they initializing the variable?

3809
03:34:10,840 --> 03:34:13,080
Yes, they do initialize the variable.

3810
03:34:13,080 --> 03:34:16,560
If the code will come in here
and they initialize in the variable.

3811
03:34:16,800 --> 03:34:19,280
Yes they are initializing the variable.

3812
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:23,800
Hey, could be this scenario
when none of the conditions are match.

3813
03:34:24,240 --> 03:34:24,480
Yeah.

3814
03:34:24,480 --> 03:34:27,320
There could be a scenario
when none of the condition match.

3815
03:34:27,320 --> 03:34:30,000
So then the code will go to the else
block.

3816
03:34:30,480 --> 03:34:33,560
Are they initializing the variable
inside the LS?

3817
03:34:33,600 --> 03:34:35,520
BLOCK Yes, they do.

3818
03:34:35,520 --> 03:34:40,200
So remember this if statement
does this selective execution.

3819
03:34:40,720 --> 03:34:42,200
So your code is check.

3820
03:34:42,200 --> 03:34:46,800
Hey, if possibility will be here or here
or here or here.

3821
03:34:46,800 --> 03:34:49,080
Are they giving the value of this box?

3822
03:34:49,200 --> 03:34:51,280
Yes, they do give the value of this box.

3823
03:34:51,280 --> 03:34:52,320
Okay, cool.

3824
03:34:52,320 --> 03:34:54,960
So now on the line 48,

3825
03:34:55,480 --> 03:35:00,240
you are asking to display the value
inside this box, right?

3826
03:35:00,440 --> 03:35:02,280
That's why your code looks fine.

3827
03:35:02,280 --> 03:35:04,560
That's why the code looks fine.

3828
03:35:04,560 --> 03:35:08,640
But what before
and what happens is the zero

3829
03:35:08,640 --> 03:35:11,960
get as soon as I'm going to remove

3830
03:35:12,200 --> 03:35:15,760
my ls block,
as soon as I'm going to remove

3831
03:35:15,760 --> 03:35:21,080
my LS block, my code will complain,
my quota will complain.

3832
03:35:21,960 --> 03:35:24,440
And if we're going to hover over

3833
03:35:24,440 --> 03:35:27,120
it tells that our variable

3834
03:35:27,640 --> 03:35:30,480
may not have been initialized.

3835
03:35:30,880 --> 03:35:33,280
What does it mean? This?
What does it mean?

3836
03:35:33,960 --> 03:35:38,320
So you could before it lets Java run it.

3837
03:35:38,400 --> 03:35:43,120
Okay, so there is one guy that checks
your code all the time.

3838
03:35:43,120 --> 03:35:43,440
Okay.

3839
03:35:43,440 --> 03:35:45,760
And this guy we it compiler this.

3840
03:35:45,760 --> 03:35:47,760
Okay, so compiler.

3841
03:35:47,800 --> 03:35:50,440
It's like your best friend
compile is the poly.

3842
03:35:50,440 --> 03:35:54,160
So your program compiler
wants to make sure

3843
03:35:54,560 --> 03:35:58,000
that before it handles the code to Java

3844
03:35:58,000 --> 03:36:01,000
to execute to execute

3845
03:36:01,480 --> 03:36:05,000
it wants to make sure that code is correct
okay.

3846
03:36:05,280 --> 03:36:07,400
So now know here it won't be zero.

3847
03:36:07,400 --> 03:36:08,640
Guess I'll explain it to you.

3848
03:36:08,640 --> 03:36:10,720
So first of all, follow
my logic. This place.

3849
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:12,520
So now what happens?

3850
03:36:12,520 --> 03:36:14,640
Code executes that to the bottom.

3851
03:36:15,240 --> 03:36:20,200
Your compiler quickly checks compiler say
okay here they created empty variable.

3852
03:36:20,600 --> 03:36:23,880
Right now they have the eve

3853
03:36:25,080 --> 03:36:25,720
now they

3854
03:36:25,720 --> 03:36:28,680
said if this condition is true,
are they initialize in years?

3855
03:36:28,920 --> 03:36:31,440
Is this condition
is the initializing? Yes.

3856
03:36:31,640 --> 03:36:32,800
Is this condition is true.

3857
03:36:32,800 --> 03:36:34,360
They initialize in years

3858
03:36:34,360 --> 03:36:38,520
hey but there could be a possibility
when none of the condition is match.

3859
03:36:39,000 --> 03:36:42,800
So if none of this will match,
are you initializing

3860
03:36:42,800 --> 03:36:44,360
the time of the day somewhere against?

3861
03:36:44,360 --> 03:36:49,040
Are you initializing it?

3862
03:36:49,040 --> 03:36:51,480
We are not initializing it. Right.

3863
03:36:51,480 --> 03:36:56,000
Is there a possibility
that none of the condition could be true?

3864
03:36:56,280 --> 03:36:57,600
So your compiler.

3865
03:36:57,600 --> 03:37:02,520
Okay, if none of the condition is true,
they're not placing any value.

3866
03:37:02,520 --> 03:37:05,040
They're not placing any value
inside this box.

3867
03:37:05,520 --> 03:37:08,880
However, on the line 46,

3868
03:37:09,240 --> 03:37:13,840
they asking for me
to print the value of this box.

3869
03:37:14,320 --> 03:37:19,440
How can I print the value of the box
if there won't be any value,

3870
03:37:19,880 --> 03:37:23,720
if there possibility
that this things might not be initialized?

3871
03:37:23,720 --> 03:37:26,880
Remember,
I guess your program is not going to take

3872
03:37:27,840 --> 03:37:30,160
in my place and it's something to you.

3873
03:37:30,160 --> 03:37:34,120
So now what your program will ask?

3874
03:37:34,360 --> 03:37:38,520
Your program will ask, Hey,
can you give it this initial value.

3875
03:37:39,120 --> 03:37:40,200
Initial value.

3876
03:37:40,200 --> 03:37:45,000
I want to have you as a you as a program.

3877
03:37:45,120 --> 03:37:47,640
I take responsibility,
put in the initial value.

3878
03:37:47,640 --> 03:37:49,560
If you're not having the LS block in here.

3879
03:37:49,560 --> 03:37:51,960
Right.
Because I can look for anything you want.

3880
03:37:52,440 --> 03:37:55,480
So now, if you are going to click in here

3881
03:37:55,680 --> 03:37:58,880
right, your compiler will help you.

3882
03:37:59,160 --> 03:38:01,880
You will help you to initialize it.

3883
03:38:02,320 --> 03:38:03,280
So now.

3884
03:38:03,280 --> 03:38:07,560
But the only thing compiler can do,
it can initialize

3885
03:38:07,800 --> 03:38:10,720
only two default values.

3886
03:38:10,720 --> 03:38:14,680
Guess so now because we have
a different data types.

3887
03:38:14,880 --> 03:38:19,840
Different data types
has a different default values, right?

3888
03:38:20,200 --> 03:38:24,480
So if you want to click initialize,
it will show us now.

3889
03:38:24,720 --> 03:38:25,280
Okay.

3890
03:38:25,440 --> 03:38:28,520
So what what we mean in here.

3891
03:38:28,520 --> 03:38:32,880
So to initialize compiler in

3892
03:38:33,520 --> 03:38:37,160
we've only default

3893
03:38:38,600 --> 03:38:42,360
values to the variables to the variables.

3894
03:38:43,400 --> 03:38:47,880
So for example, if it sees
your variable is not being initialized

3895
03:38:47,880 --> 03:38:51,200
and if the variable of the integer type
it will get zero,

3896
03:38:52,080 --> 03:38:54,200
if it will be a double type,
what are this thing?

3897
03:38:54,200 --> 03:38:55,200
It will be

3898
03:38:57,640 --> 03:38:59,880
it will be zero zero.

3899
03:39:00,240 --> 03:39:03,960
If it will be string.

3900
03:39:03,960 --> 03:39:05,160
All our you guys will learn.

3901
03:39:05,160 --> 03:39:06,960
It will be for all non primitives.

3902
03:39:06,960 --> 03:39:08,960
It will give null.

3903
03:39:09,320 --> 03:39:13,880
If you will use a boolean,
it will be false.

3904
03:39:13,880 --> 03:39:14,200
Okay.

3905
03:39:14,200 --> 03:39:19,560
So if this is the default values
and this is what happens,

3906
03:39:19,800 --> 03:39:22,760
so now your compiler will say, okay,

3907
03:39:22,760 --> 03:39:27,120
so they did put some value just in case.

3908
03:39:27,120 --> 03:39:32,480
If this quarter will come to the support,
then I'm not responsible.

3909
03:39:32,520 --> 03:39:33,520
I am not responsible.

3910
03:39:33,520 --> 03:39:36,240
But the it has a default value.

3911
03:39:36,480 --> 03:39:38,520
So this way I can print it. Right.

3912
03:39:38,920 --> 03:39:40,880
And let me go back to the largest number.

3913
03:39:40,880 --> 03:39:44,960
This this same thing,
what's happening in here?

3914
03:39:45,120 --> 03:39:45,840
Right.

3915
03:39:45,840 --> 03:39:48,000
The same thing was happening in here.

3916
03:39:48,000 --> 03:39:50,680
So your code looks great.

3917
03:39:51,520 --> 03:39:53,240
Let me remove.

3918
03:39:53,240 --> 03:39:55,280
So here, if you're not going to have zero,

3919
03:39:56,440 --> 03:39:58,840
your code was complaining in here, right?

3920
03:39:58,840 --> 03:40:01,280
Your code was complaining in here. Why?

3921
03:40:01,280 --> 03:40:03,520
It was complaining the same thing.

3922
03:40:03,720 --> 03:40:06,200
Largest right now it's an empty box.

3923
03:40:06,360 --> 03:40:08,520
It's an empty box. Right.

3924
03:40:08,520 --> 03:40:11,160
So now your job, your compiler checks.

3925
03:40:11,160 --> 03:40:11,720
Okay.

3926
03:40:11,720 --> 03:40:15,000
If this scenario will be true
and they place in the value.

3927
03:40:15,000 --> 03:40:16,560
Yes, they do.

3928
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:20,520
If this scenario is true
and they place in the value, yes, they do.

3929
03:40:20,880 --> 03:40:24,400
If this scenario is true
and they place and the values do,

3930
03:40:24,760 --> 03:40:28,400
hey, what if, as we said,
the numbers will be all distinct?

3931
03:40:28,560 --> 03:40:29,840
What will happen?

3932
03:40:29,840 --> 03:40:32,880
None of the cases will get executed.

3933
03:40:33,240 --> 03:40:38,080
So below
the box still will be empty by now.

3934
03:40:38,080 --> 03:40:43,440
On the line 29 you you need to check.

3935
03:40:43,880 --> 03:40:47,160
Use the mode Operator. How can I use this?

3936
03:40:47,160 --> 03:40:51,560
Operator How can I perform
any operation on the empty box?

3937
03:40:52,000 --> 03:40:54,120
How can I perform any operation?

3938
03:40:54,560 --> 03:40:58,280
Even your variable
have not been initialized.

3939
03:40:58,800 --> 03:41:01,440
The variable have no initialize.

3940
03:41:01,440 --> 03:41:03,600
So there's a two ways this.

3941
03:41:03,600 --> 03:41:07,640
You either can initialize it
at first, right?

3942
03:41:07,640 --> 03:41:11,840
You can either provide the default value
at first, right?

3943
03:41:12,360 --> 03:41:14,960
Or the way we had it in here.

3944
03:41:15,320 --> 03:41:19,680
If you want, you have the ls block
and inside that ls block.

3945
03:41:19,920 --> 03:41:24,320
If going to initialize
your variable, it's an invalid

3946
03:41:26,160 --> 03:41:27,120
invalid,

3947
03:41:27,120 --> 03:41:29,880
then you
don't need to initialize it in here.

3948
03:41:29,880 --> 03:41:32,040
So this way you java checks. Okay.

3949
03:41:32,040 --> 03:41:35,640
If none of the condition is match
my code will java code

3950
03:41:35,640 --> 03:41:38,720
will go to the ls block of the initialize
in there.

3951
03:41:38,880 --> 03:41:40,760
Yes. The place in the value

3952
03:41:40,760 --> 03:41:44,640
I can have the java can have you print it
as long as there is a value.

3953
03:41:44,640 --> 03:41:44,880
Right.

3954
03:41:44,880 --> 03:41:48,000
Java cannot print that something
if there is no now Lee

3955
03:41:48,000 --> 03:41:51,600
has been placed.

3956
03:41:51,600 --> 03:41:54,320
Okay. Does it make sense guys?

3957
03:41:54,320 --> 03:41:54,720
I hope.

3958
03:41:54,720 --> 03:42:03,600
I hope all the zero questions are are gone
now. Yes.

3959
03:42:03,600 --> 03:42:06,400
So the way to solve it,
you either add the ILS

3960
03:42:06,880 --> 03:42:09,680
because maybe somewhere else
combination, right?

3961
03:42:09,920 --> 03:42:13,200
So now we can just add it
or just initialize it before

3962
03:42:13,680 --> 03:42:16,840
it's the machine.

3963
03:42:16,840 --> 03:42:17,160
Okay.

3964
03:42:18,480 --> 03:42:21,000
Now it's my
but we are the one who making it smarter.

3965
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:21,520
Right?

3966
03:42:22,480 --> 03:42:25,200
So in here because

3967
03:42:25,200 --> 03:42:28,600
in the year because it was an integer
value or double rate

3968
03:42:28,840 --> 03:42:33,440
but we know what happens with a double
write in it will add that that zero to it.

3969
03:42:33,440 --> 03:42:36,240
Right will add that zero. Right.

3970
03:42:36,240 --> 03:42:39,320
Because it's a double it at zero zero
it would be integer,

3971
03:42:39,320 --> 03:42:44,040
it will be just zero.

3972
03:42:44,040 --> 03:42:45,560
And these are what yes you can have.

3973
03:42:45,560 --> 03:42:47,840
But if you want to have both,
you can have it.

3974
03:42:48,120 --> 03:42:52,440
But I probably would not initialize it
unnecessary.

3975
03:42:52,440 --> 03:42:53,120
Okay.

3976
03:42:53,120 --> 03:42:56,920
So if you want to provide the ls
I can provide right, then

3977
03:42:56,920 --> 03:43:09,840
throw it.

3978
03:43:09,840 --> 03:43:12,800
Let's code less problems
if you put the right logic.

3979
03:43:12,800 --> 03:43:12,960
Right.

3980
03:43:12,960 --> 03:43:15,640
But yes,
when you guys can start having let's see.

3981
03:43:16,040 --> 03:43:18,080
So your code will still look clean.

3982
03:43:18,080 --> 03:43:25,080
I probably can concentrate even more.

3983
03:43:25,080 --> 03:43:25,600
All right.

3984
03:43:25,600 --> 03:43:27,840
So please practice with this.

3985
03:43:27,840 --> 03:43:33,080
And of course you guys will practice
more on the review classes.

3986
03:43:33,080 --> 03:43:35,480
Now I'll give you more homework, guys.

3987
03:43:35,880 --> 03:43:39,600
So the same thing right now,
we try to follow this approach, Right?

3988
03:43:39,920 --> 03:43:40,800
So here

3989
03:43:42,760 --> 03:43:43,320
you will be

3990
03:43:43,320 --> 03:43:45,800
asked to enter the name of the month,
right?

3991
03:43:46,440 --> 03:43:48,840
September, October, November, December.

3992
03:43:48,840 --> 03:43:52,080
And then based on the month,
I want you define the season.

3993
03:43:52,080 --> 03:43:52,360
Right.

3994
03:43:52,360 --> 03:43:56,400
If the birthday is January, February,
December, your season when you were

3995
03:43:56,400 --> 03:44:01,480
born is winter right in the
you born in June, July, August.

3996
03:44:01,480 --> 03:44:03,520
Your season is summer. Right.

3997
03:44:03,840 --> 03:44:05,640
So then try to use it the same way.

3998
03:44:05,640 --> 03:44:08,520
So here
you guys will have another one, right?

3999
03:44:08,520 --> 03:44:10,440
You will have another one and.

4000
03:44:10,440 --> 03:44:13,560
Of course you guys are going to have

4001
03:44:13,560 --> 03:44:19,720
ripple assignments as well.

4002
03:44:19,720 --> 03:44:21,280
Okay, Many questions.

4003
03:44:21,280 --> 03:44:25,320
What our homework is.

4004
03:44:25,320 --> 03:44:26,160
Jamie is happy.

4005
03:44:26,160 --> 03:44:27,280
I see that

4006
03:44:28,800 --> 03:44:29,320
homework.

4007
03:44:29,320 --> 03:44:32,040
As long as you guys tried to do it
before the next class.

4008
03:44:32,280 --> 03:44:35,000
But my suggestion guys
see one of the homework and reply.

4009
03:44:35,000 --> 03:44:38,160
I probably will try to do it
before Thursdays.

4010
03:44:38,160 --> 03:44:43,720
So this week, in case there's any issues
you have, you guys can try to.

4011
03:44:43,720 --> 03:44:48,800
So it might also be some concerns
you have you this can bring on Thursday

4012
03:44:48,800 --> 03:44:51,360
class.

4013
03:44:51,360 --> 03:44:55,200
Yes I'll send you an announcement
and one thing guys please please, please.

4014
03:44:55,200 --> 03:44:56,520
Next week will be very

4015
03:44:57,720 --> 03:44:58,680
important week.

4016
03:44:58,680 --> 03:44:59,200
Right.

4017
03:44:59,200 --> 03:45:03,400
And please look into switch case,
which case will be easy.

4018
03:45:03,920 --> 03:45:05,520
Switch case will be easy.

4019
03:45:05,520 --> 03:45:07,920
But then next week
we're going to start with loops.

4020
03:45:08,120 --> 03:45:08,840
Okay?

4021
03:45:08,840 --> 03:45:13,560
Loops are very, very huge an important
concept when it comes to the programing.

4022
03:45:13,920 --> 03:45:17,560
It's those loops,
any basics that we're learning

4023
03:45:17,560 --> 03:45:18,960
that's actually right now,

4024
03:45:18,960 --> 03:45:19,440
they do

4025
03:45:19,440 --> 03:45:23,000
exist in every other programing language,
but loops are very, very important.

4026
03:45:23,280 --> 03:45:28,720
Okay, so we will open some ripples,
but one thing is remembered by ripples.

4027
03:45:28,720 --> 03:45:29,080
Okay?

4028
03:45:29,080 --> 03:45:32,680
So because we want you to continue
studying and not just.

4029
03:45:32,680 --> 03:45:33,840
Oh, I'll do it later.

4030
03:45:33,840 --> 03:45:37,200
Okay. So over time, this ripples, right?

4031
03:45:37,200 --> 03:45:42,440
We will be opening up new ripples,
but the all ripples will start closing.

4032
03:45:42,560 --> 03:45:43,440
Not right away.

4033
03:45:43,440 --> 03:45:47,280
This week, after about two weeks,
we were going to start closing

4034
03:45:47,280 --> 03:45:48,640
those ripples. Okay, So that's why.

4035
03:45:48,640 --> 03:45:51,160
Please make sure you guys
practice, practice, practice.

4036
03:45:52,200 --> 03:45:54,400
And then next class, I will upload slides.

4037
03:45:54,400 --> 03:45:56,360
Please make sure you guys prepare. Okay.

4038
03:45:56,360 --> 03:46:00,120
Don't come on, prepare for the next class
loop.

4039
03:46:00,120 --> 03:46:02,640
So loops are very, very fun.

4040
03:46:02,640 --> 03:46:03,160
Oh yeah.

4041
03:46:03,160 --> 03:46:07,200
They're there will be
I think there's again will be about 16

4042
03:46:07,200 --> 03:46:09,480
or 15 exercises in Ripple. Okay

4043
03:46:11,960 --> 03:46:13,040
so everything

4044
03:46:13,040 --> 03:46:16,520
all the points until we learn today,
that's what you guys going to see on ramp.

4045
03:46:16,800 --> 03:46:17,520
All right.

4046
03:46:18,160 --> 03:46:18,960
Okay guys.

4047
03:46:18,960 --> 03:46:23,680
Then the,
uh, so when it comes to the slides goes,

4048
03:46:23,680 --> 03:46:26,720
the slides are not when you have tasks,
the slides are going.

4049
03:46:26,960 --> 03:46:29,160
I have an all mine information.

4050
03:46:29,160 --> 03:46:30,880
That's what the slides have.

4051
03:46:30,880 --> 03:46:32,880
The task are not they're on the slides.

4052
03:46:32,880 --> 03:46:35,080
They won't be uploaded. All right.

4053
03:46:35,080 --> 03:46:36,120
Okay, good.

4054
03:46:36,120 --> 03:46:37,040
Thank you.

4055
03:46:37,040 --> 03:46:42,120
And please make sure you study one
so when you enter, the seating

4056
03:46:42,560 --> 03:46:49,000
has two words like you, Catalina.

4057
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:51,880
In that case,
you will have to use the next slide.

4058
03:46:52,200 --> 03:46:56,440
But actually, I forgot that some of you
you were having the easiest.

4059
03:46:56,440 --> 03:46:59,760
Sometimes those issue comes
when you use next and next slide.

4060
03:46:59,800 --> 03:47:04,280
Okay, So if you guys face
any of that issue, please ask Asghar.

4061
03:47:04,280 --> 03:47:08,280
He will explain it to
There's a there's a process

4062
03:47:08,280 --> 03:47:12,240
that happens behind when you use next
and when we use next line. Yep.

4063
03:47:12,560 --> 03:47:16,440
So please ask him if he will explain this.

4064
03:47:16,440 --> 03:47:17,280
All right.

4065
03:47:17,280 --> 03:47:20,360
Thank you, guys. In great work, everyone.

4066
03:47:20,560 --> 03:47:23,400
And I'll see all of you next week
and then hopefully,

4067
03:47:23,400 --> 03:47:26,880
as I should be, start
feeling better by next Saturday, right?

4068
03:47:27,160 --> 03:47:30,120
Okay. Thank you, guys.
