1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,880
All right.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,880
On the stand, Steven Hopkins

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,360
read a couple of Nelson Mandela's stories.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,840
The great

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,720
unknowable phrase, we never peace

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,840
all of the legends seen in the glass
screen.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,640
Let's start the commercial.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,960
So now, starting 20 minutes,
I'm not going to beat you.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,400
You would like me to open up a project?

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:46,920
This is a project you.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,600
It's glass of selenium.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,160
We have great.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,760
Is this the right

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,040
particles?

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,480
Right.

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,520
Let's start from the start,

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,280
guys.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,760
When we already have this dingy,
then why do we need to use it?

19
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,800
Firstly, start with the basic requirement.

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,360
It's a game of supply and demand.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,840
Demand is there.

22
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,800
Then we have to use supply at a faster
rate.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,400
We need cutting.

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,400
So the main point is

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,040
to increase,

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,920
increase

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,080
transparency or

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,600
reduce the resulting molecule ether.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
This is

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,720
actually the definition of framework
you're seeing.

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,280
Empathy is a tool is of not or to reduce

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,480
to reduce communication death rate.

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,360
It is the way I am explaining rate.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,760
Even if you see here,
even if you see here,

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,600
these details are different
than what I think.

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,680
You always find their definitions.

37
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,320
Even though these points are very small.

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,720
But if you use these points
in your interview, if you use these points

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,080
to explain the concept, believe me,
these are unique

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,440
points.

41
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,040
Unique.

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,840
You need a unique explanation.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,240
And this is the one you're looking
for, right?

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,320
So please take care of this points.

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,680
And whenever you go to the interview,
just follow these notes.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,960
I'm not talking about job or selling them
because I don't teach, right.

47
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,000
I didn't need to take part.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
So what I'm teaching.

49
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,400
I'm just asking you
to follow this particular part of it,

50
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,960
to increase transparency or reduce
communication.

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,280
Get divorced.

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,520
These are
we had this problem in earlier frameworks.

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,600
That's why we came up with
the new framework to give a second thing,

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,600
because it supports

55
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
it supports we really or because

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,120
it is in language, right?

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
It supports the language.

58
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,280
So easy, easy to understand for

59
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,040
ethnical, it's

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,160
right

61
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,760
not only for technical,
but also for technical.

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,160
Another important point,

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,200
right?

64
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,080
Another important point.

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,840
When you lose good language,
you'll see this logging feature, right?

66
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,240
You know,
let me tell you one word about it.

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,160
From the kind
we use this particular scenario

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,920
as a menu in this is

69
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,120
we can use rate

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,560
we can use this scenario as a test case.

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,080
So now now let's say tomorrow
you become a lead rate user.

72
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
And I hope I wish that you guys
will get reported as our guest.

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,760
So, so ignite your management will ask you

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,800
to have an effective solution.

75
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
What is workaround.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,320
So that is the workaround.

77
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,680
You can suggest a key in menu testing.

78
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,840
We will follow that language.

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,440
In working language
we will rate all the test.

80
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,160
Is this correct?

81
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,800
Now when you read all that
is because this isn't working,

82
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,440
which is tips are already available
in your scenarios, correct?

83
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,400
Everything that scenario explains
your one best case.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,840
Understood.

85
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,480
In every test case,
you will be having multiple steps.

86
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,200
Now, when it comes to automation,

87
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,400
you need to read new scenario.

88
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,480
At this point, no.

89
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,760
In that time what you can do
now, just open your manual test case.

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,880
Do your best to see
who is available current.

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,240
Just copy those scenarios from there
it is due to you.

92
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,040
Simple linking from your testimony
is meant to be.

93
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,120
Your automation script is also available

94
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,160
whenever you create in a test because in

95
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,240
you always get one is ideal
not what you did with this because 80

96
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,000
correct Easy 101 DC 102103
something like this.

97
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,000
That is because I really know
you can provide in your test scenario here

98
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,360
right so now whatever just is
because you're executing

99
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,920
it is directly linked with
your test is in Gita.

100
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,880
Obviously it's a part of later discussion,
but again, I'm telling you

101
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
so that, you know, you can at least
visualize the things, how you can make

102
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,840
the things connected as a lead,
because your responsibility,

103
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,400
if you make this process,
this complete cycle, your entire project,

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,240
your big data company is
going to rely on you, right?

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,400
So understand

106
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,000
you don't get the salary based on the
what did you do?

107
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,960
You get the salary based on the value
you added to the project.

108
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,240
You get the salary based
on your significant role,

109
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,360
how significant you are for the project.

110
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,880
There are a lot of extras on the label.

111
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,120
No one needs a,
you know, really good test,

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,640
but if you can bring some additional value
addition to the project you're working

113
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,920
on, that same company is going to rely on
do things remember?

114
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,440
So it's more of building
a positive character, right?

115
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,640
The energy to get it in the industry
next would be a learning

116
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,320
file.

117
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,080
Already supports

118
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,440
ability building language easier
to understand for non-technical people.

119
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,240
Also thing to focus on any user, right?

120
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,960
Why? I'm saying it focuses on any user.

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,200
Remember when user clicks

122
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,840
on log in, written
when user knows username and password,

123
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,720
every given user is navigating
to a Jeremy's application.

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,960
So what is this user user user
you see available here?

125
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,800
Why do we have this user
using that all the next?

126
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,000
Because this particular language

127
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,320
we need to
combine is based on users, right?

128
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,800
It always focuses on end user perspective
things from a user perspective, right?

129
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,880
There's the main part of this be

130
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,560
the functionality understanding
based on a user as a user.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,720
Correct.

132
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,880
Because of this reason,
a program should satisfy the user.

133
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,760
Correct.

134
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,840
You're making the software for a users
getting customers.

135
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,640
The customers are not happy that say we do
have you existing

136
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,360
user acceptance this right as a user.

137
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,320
Right? We work as a user, we

138
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,080
operate the application, we use
the application.

139
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,040
Is that the end user?

140
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,080
And then we believe outputs or sometimes
what happens.

141
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,160
A company provides
multiple people trained from the industry

142
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,440
or from X-Y-Z location
and deployed access to the application

143
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,480
before deploying it
right into the market before go,

144
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,080
and they provide it to
then ask them to provide the feedback.

145
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,960
Just use this application.

146
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,160
If you're lucky enough one day,
maybe you know Amazon will buy you

147
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,720
and then they will give you like $500
or $1,000 just to check that application.

148
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
User application is a user.

149
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,400
It also happens, for instance, basically

150
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,560
all rate focuses on user

151
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,120
so as to why do we need to use we, But

152
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,000
everyone

153
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,480
nice right now

154
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,880
forget about framework, forget about

155
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,160
we are just underspending on particular
what is it framework it's on me.

156
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
I will take care of the entire framework.

157
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,440
I will explain you.

158
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,760
Every single piece of business
was are distinct.

159
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,760
It does include the way we understood
best into as a tool.

160
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,360
Now I'm explaining it.

161
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,640
It is a right because students
would be confused in between framework

162
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,160
and consumers one by one.

163
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,280
And picking first to begin
and then framework plain things.

164
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,080
No, no.

165
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,280
When I say that I'm going to write my best
guess this grade is in use.

166
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,280
So what is the least in automation
using do.

167
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,120
But I have my best guess is

168
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,760
what is that

169
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:38,080
is what is the name of that piece.

170
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,720
See can your find which file is this
you the

171
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,520
be nice

172
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,520
if you're just getting to mastered.

173
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,520
I'd like I think some of Nelson Mandela

174
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,400
Nelson Mandela got in the class

175
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,000
feature might

176
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,840
be use feature by

177
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,680
you right are best estimates
cutting the rate our business menus.

178
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,480
We need beta in order to commit framework

179
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
and it can be have late

180
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,520
equals two menus in one picture by

181
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,760
you just begin to rate

182
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,360
the meaning of scenario is basically one
best guess you're going to define

183
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,160
in that particular list
gives you device in your feature.

184
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,440
But so now let me show you.

185
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,040
You'll see here, great.

186
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,600
Okay.

187
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,720
I did

188
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,680
not if you see here read

189
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,040
this scenario comes under this
particular feature getting

190
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,960
any now tell me

191
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,200
I can have multiple scenario
in which we can

192
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,640
I have late table feature
inside this particular part.

193
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,040
No right.

194
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Because you consider this as
a big scenario is a big user story, right.

195
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,200
For example, log in feature.

196
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,360
So any log in feature
you can have the usual mean,

197
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,000
you can have invalid log
in, you can have admin log in,

198
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,800
you can have normal employee log in,
you can have is a lot of log in scenarios.

199
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
You can have current it.

200
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,080
Let's see the error
verification validation part.

201
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,000
So force time to enter correct username
wrong password.

202
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
One best guess can be said this.

203
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,880
This is one test case.

204
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,640
Aisha, this is your one best use grade.

205
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,640
And here this is using best scenario.

206
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,320
So internet.

207
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,800
You can only debate this cases on board
or consider it as a user story.

208
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,200
So in one user
you only because scenarios or not

209
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,080
you can have.

210
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,760
Right?

211
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,080
So now, for example, if you have well,
it was an invited password.

212
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,960
One scenario in when you lose an embedded
password against A

213
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,520
that you write in
that he was indeed the password,

214
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,280
the blank person that you give
the username will blank.

215
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,360
And the password for cementing
all these scenarios are related

216
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:29,160
to login functionality or not.

217
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,920
Yes, they contain.

218
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,320
The title of this menu is
when you can change,

219
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,200
it's up to your competition and therefore
everything is completely up to you based.

220
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,080
Okay, so now remember, whenever
we talk about this feature by date,

221
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,600
whenever you work in the industry,
the users to you get read

222
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
this feature file

223
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,600
would be the name of getting user story
and then all the best uses.

224
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,440
The spin that news you would be having.

225
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,040
This will be the part of your one
particular feature by,

226
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,160
for example, if you see here
that on my notes I explained to you

227
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,040
this particular two points
like this particular two points getting.

228
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,480
So my user story was a me should be able

229
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,000
to search and employ
in a job in this application

230
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,520
right?

231
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,160
Based on me.

232
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,880
It is correct or not.

233
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,240
Okay.

234
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,880
Now now you see here

235
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,160
when admin should be able
to search and employ a Jarvis application.

236
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,360
So there it is. Users voting.

237
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,240
I have acceptance criteria for two things.

238
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,840
It means I can search my employee

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,440
using to use my ID by a name current.

240
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:51,840
So now these two are my scenarios are not.

241
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,360
These two are mercenaries, correct?

242
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,680
Fine.

243
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,640
Now I need to know what this
and how to use in one feature

244
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,400
file on or do I need to create
multiple features for this?

245
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,520
No, I don't need to write
just one feature.

246
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,760
It would be enough for me.

247
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,560
Correct. For

248
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,680
so long feature image
and really right to test

249
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,240
iterate this to use in feature fighting.

250
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,000
Can we look at image translation with that
and just in the

251
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,200
it is a part of eight months,
but we will learn their story.

252
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,280
I mean I'm a transition participant
based on Kubuntu

253
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,600
where based on minimal translation,
based on external every single thing.

254
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,720
A lot of things are coming

255
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,320
out right now.

256
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,000
We are going to talk about a couple
of other keywords into that space.

257
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,920
So remember whenever we write scenarios,
whenever we write scenarios

258
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,280
in the scenarios, that is a particular
format we generally follow for

259
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,880
follow one particular following

260
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,280
that forward is occupied
by one thing that is keywords, right?

261
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,280
So in these keywords I have to write
particular part one example

262
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,520
if I am using given keyword.

263
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
So what is the meaning of given keyword?

264
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,120
It simply means I have to write
precondition, precondition

265
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,480
with given keyword.

266
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,720
Similarly, if I am writing when keyword
what I have to use,

267
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,280
when keywords, is there a way particular

268
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,200
to automatically
make a jump from other keywords

269
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,720
We are we are creating
or the code for the assignment, correct?

270
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,960
For instance, definition.

271
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm coming to that point.

272
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,920
I'm coming to the end point, right?

273
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,840
No double bind the country but the code
we need to consider in one night,

274
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,840
which it is okay, we can rate

275
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,880
we can rate what example if you see here

276
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,120
in my log in I provide when I use a valid
the username and password.

277
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,560
Right.

278
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,360
So the way we are performing
admin username and password

279
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,840
which actions we are providing correct
also rate I will rate when we proceed.

280
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,600
Go to the we will perform
username password it click on log

281
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,240
in better everything in just for one.

282
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,840
So if we have read the feature,
why we have to copy the good.

283
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,640
Everything okay?

284
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,400
Why do of the feature by

285
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,360
If you are changing to this training
this particular step, then yes.

286
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,080
Then yes.

287
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,800
What do you have to do?

288
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,480
The steps
which is going to generate that step

289
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,440
you have to replace
and you can keep your code inside.

290
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,160
It's time.

291
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,840
I will tell you how things work in the

292
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,880
This could be a part of everyday you that

293
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,280
file.

294
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,640
So now when to perform actions

295
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,360
actions
that is another keyword causing why

296
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,160
we use database

297
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,880
Bob Aisha

298
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,120
basically right
we were told to never do that.

299
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,480
For example if there is a jumbos
in any of you ever been an integer?

300
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,360
There are 15, 20, 25 steps are available

301
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,800
in every steps
you have to perform the collections rate.

302
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,560
For example,
you will get a couple of times.

303
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,200
So this to many of your really quite late
people puts in one

304
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,760
weight multiple bootstraps of video people
from political collections, correct.

305
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,560
So even if it is not recommended
but it is very glad when some things

306
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,080
that you have been make
okay and this is the see guys

307
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,040
that is

308
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,800
a bit can be used with all the steps
to aid

309
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,560
normal editing this video question.

310
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,560
So basically the point we talk
you'll give my what you're

311
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,240
looking for a simple word supporting actor

312
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,160
supporting day simple

313
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,280
right
that can be associated with any other leg.

314
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,160
Right.

315
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,080
So what I'm saying
basically is of the actual definition

316
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,080
read the actual definition
is something else that is nothing

317
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,280
gold ideal in the industry.

318
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,520
Keep this point in your mind
that is nothing.

319
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,760
Or it's always because

320
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,560
late in when things are practical means

321
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,400
you can always customize the things
according to your requirement.

322
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,520
So be a professional right?

323
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,280
Be an experienced in public,
an experienced person.

324
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,600
You example would use that
you put into the home.

325
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,920
We will try to push for the example

326
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,160
you gentlemen, I'm going to write.

327
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,440
I'm going to accidentally deposit ideas
in one bite and you're not in.

328
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,080
And when do you write this?

329
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,120
Before starting the employee training.

330
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,680
So it is almost a

331
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,560
you know, the most data wants to work
there will get you a lot of things

332
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,920
more quickly

333
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,880
right now

334
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,360
when we you then you would

335
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,360
in simple it's correct

336
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,080
so then that's the main reason
why I always focus

337
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,840
and give more distress
towards the practical explanation

338
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,800
because you guys did work or some of you
lazy many work in the industry.

339
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,120
Great words need to understand one thing
what we learn and what we implement.

340
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,960
These two are different things.

341
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:54,080
How many of you guys will keep
proficiency?

342
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
I'm not talking about writing district
in any industry.

343
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,440
How many of you guys are working
professionals?

344
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,720
Women working menial?

345
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,080
Majority of you guys?

346
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,800
Correct.

347
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,360
It doesn't matter
which food you are working in. Right.

348
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,000
Or responsibility or dealing with
any one thing from your own experiences.

349
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,680
As I've been working in the industry
for from last five, six, seven or we would

350
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,360
use based on you actually implement
those voguish definition of what this

351
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,400
then is

352
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,600
do you follow all the
ethics of professionalism when you have to

353
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,640
appreciate or when you have the motivators
by your teammates

354
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,280
or your peers? No.

355
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,480
Right.

356
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,120
Sometimes you have to go out of the works
of majority of times you have to think,

357
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,680
okay, from your experience
and many of problems is made matters.

358
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,040
This professionalism and ethics.

359
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm not against this professionalism
and ethics, but this bookish definition.

360
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,800
We can't
we don't rely on this part correct.

361
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,720
So remember, similarly,
when you work in industry,

362
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,080
if you completely I learned
how to write reports professionally.

363
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,640
Great.

364
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,840
Nice. Congratulations on that.

365
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,000
And send one certificate to your you

366
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,600
the report grade certified report

367
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:28,640
generate the most.

368
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,400
All right so

369
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,280
remember think
whenever it comes to explain or print

370
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,920
this kind of things on
with as long as it works correct

371
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,480
got it right always extremely professional
and professional

372
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,160
people never explain location information.

373
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,800
Keep this thing in your case.

374
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,040
We are professionals.

375
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,760
We never will explain bookish definition.

376
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,600
Yes, the negotiation is revisions
and it is then it is more good this move.

377
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,000
That one.

378
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,040
We will explain.

379
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,160
But then what is the difference?

380
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,720
How you integrate your experience
with your explanation?

381
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,680
That creates a difference.

382
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,480
That's what I'm here to teach you.

383
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:16,840
Understood.

384
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,040
So far, things are going pretty easy.

385
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:27,680
So far things are going slow based.

386
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,680
All right, now tell me if I'm writing
only this particular feature.

387
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:38,280
By the way, I promote this, particularly
typically if I want to execute

388
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,360
only with this feature,
but can I give my code

389
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,280
non first?

390
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,480
You didn't get my question.

391
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,200
Only the feature I'm embedding

392
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,080
here and it's not straight mythical people
giving a quick information slide.

393
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,320
I'm giving you detail information. Right.

394
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,760
We need to implement

395
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,600
definition.

396
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,160
We need step definition.

397
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,520
Remember the concept of interest
declaration and definition.

398
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,600
The on not

399
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,520
so what is declaration just skeleton?

400
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,960
Nobody.

401
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
What is definition?

402
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,120
When you provide body right.

403
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,880
So here
when you write this actual scenario

404
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
this is just to hallucinate
you're you're just declaring the steps.

405
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,000
You're not actually implementing trade.

406
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,040
So now let me show you one thing.

407
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,800
Let me just intentionally
create a new stipulate.

408
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,760
You can intentionally create a new script.

409
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,440
So let's say I'm going to create over
the distinct only given

410
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,720
the user is what is

411
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,960
intentionally emulating this.

412
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,280
Okay taking it.

413
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,960
I think

414
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,800
now Siegfried

415
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
Whitefield it is a step undefined

416
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,520
you can implement them
we missing steps right with this

417
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,680
to do what is giving the code
also to implement step

418
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,200
it is telling you which is undefined
see it says

419
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,360
now missing implementation
right now that we copied is a step here.

420
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,200
I'm going to show you a couple
of information which is very important.

421
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,800
Let me go in my log in two steps.
Right and hit me.

422
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,680
Copy this.

423
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,360
I'm going to delete it anyway.

424
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,680
So see now,

425
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,000
now, if I go here, right is gone.

426
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,240
It's not related anymore.

427
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,120
Like I told you that Me If I want to check

428
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,840
the implementation of this,
I can get it deleted from here.

429
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,120
But what?

430
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,600
How we can.

431
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,280
How can I check right click on the step

432
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,280
go to

433
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,040
and there is a declaration plate
when you click on this declaration.

434
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,280
See, my gazette is coming here.

435
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,600
Public void user underscore is underscore

436
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,640
x lazy.

437
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,440
Let me do one more nine days
in case if you missed it.

438
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,080
When I click here, go to

439
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,720
a declaration read in declaration.

440
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So when they go into their declaration
right here you see

441
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,440
it's coming here user underscore

442
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,160
is underscore lazy bugged

443
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,280
but if you see on log in that end user

444
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,120
underscore is underscore x, y, z.

445
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,040
No, no.

446
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,720
But here it is
taking me to this particular path.

447
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
It means more.

448
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,720
Is this step
linked to the Western scenario?

449
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,240
Or this could link to domestic edu

450
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,960
dysfunction link to in edu
or this is linked to my selecting

451
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,760
this particular method.

452
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,400
The function
which I have written over here.

453
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
It is linked to myosin manual.

454
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,200
So what does it mean?

455
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,080
It simply means when you write here
anything, it is different in the consumer.

456
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,880
When you write any state in the consumer
leads,

457
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,800
it's a Java code.

458
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,080
It is generating what is Java code?

459
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,720
Now, if you come here and if you
observe it closely, tell me a public void.

460
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,280
What is this?

461
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,800
Public means access, modify it,

462
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,280
void means non written bait method.

463
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,520
User underscore is the notice code.

464
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
X-Y-Z Z is method name

465
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,440
and this is open clause method signature

466
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,520
Curly braces block of code
where you're going to write

467
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,080
whatever the actions you want to perform
from this particular method.

468
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,640
Is this Java or not? The

469
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,560
So now answer to your question.

470
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,440
Right let's put in was asking the question
maybe

471
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,400
I'm not sure the name

472
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,520
I didn't write
it was asking it to create a Java place.

473
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,840
So sorry we cannot create a java
by using cucumber, but the code

474
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,360
which we need to write it out
in Java place that we can go to.

475
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,520
So that would be clear.

476
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,440
You think

477
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,560
if you have the steps in one scenario,

478
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,520
you simply click on it, generate
all the data steps

479
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,560
that you can cross,

480
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,400
Correct?

481
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,840
That it takes.

482
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,120
Can you see now, see
what kind of explanation of explanation

483
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,600
it is giving the information
provided by us.

484
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,360
It sees right code here, very helpful.

485
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,080
We can write code here that turns
the phrase above into concrete actions.

486
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,240
The phrase about which phrase
this is the phrase.

487
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,120
So it means this particular part

488
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,280
is linked
to this particular part, correct?

489
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,800
That's why it is being read code here
that does the above freeze

490
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,680
into concrete actions.

491
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,000
Now we have to perform the actions, right?

492
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,440
Whatever the brands we are explaining,
it is all of these.

493
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,600
We have to give the definition.

494
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,920
So to provide the emission in Java,
we need a function.

495
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,760
We need method
just because we need the method, it

496
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,960
creates the method,
it gives us this method.

497
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,200
And when we already have this
method, this is the time to write the code

498
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,560
so that we can actually perform
the actions.

499
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,560
What we're actually
just defining in our feature

500
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,240
is it clear

501
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,640
is students

502
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,880
minds now?

503
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,840
P And also if you see for this exception,
right, if this exception from particular

504
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,320
audio could convert Java bending
exception, nobody is available next.

505
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,040
Next is finding exception

506
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,520
read.

507
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:36,760
Just give me this just give me.

508
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,640
All right.

509
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,120
You're so tired already.

510
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,760
It's only morning Saturday morning on
then you're already tired.

511
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,160
All right, fine.

512
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,080
So now here.

513
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,000
Here.

514
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,640
Any kind of code we can implement, right?

515
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,680
Yet the window. Agreed.

516
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,200
And I appreciate it. I respect suspended.

517
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,680
So now, here, you see, I'm going to write.

518
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,600
Simple. Could see.

519
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,640
Hello, file.

520
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,240
Now I provided the body.

521
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,600
Doesn't matter
what kind of code I'm going to provide

522
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,600
right.

523
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,760
Nasty is what I'm explaining here.

524
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,360
This code I have written correct?

525
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:27,640
Correct.

526
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,720
But in actual my log in

527
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,920
feature,
you'll see it comes on the first place.

528
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
It comes on the first place.

529
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,960
And in my log in step, it is coming on
the last step of the last implementation.

530
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:49,680
Will it work?

531
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,160
Experience.

532
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,280
Good.

533
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,920
To my question, I am defining it here.

534
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,080
Write it first place.

535
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,680
But actually implement it last place.

536
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,280
Would it work

537
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,360
a little?

538
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,520
Said no and I say yes.

539
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,800
So it wants to use it should?

540
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,080
I think so.

541
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,600
Now. Now why explain the linking portion
now? See?

542
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,160
But even code will always have a priority.

543
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,640
Oh, then it's not about the priority.

544
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,480
Let me believe you.

545
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,680
Kimber works on implementation

546
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,160
just because you have to contribute.

547
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,160
It says that removal clearances, removal

548
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,600
clearances
before this, given bed removal clearances

549
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,240
where you see the right amount
does move that clearances

550
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,080
because you already have this calibrates
in the end of the

551
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,040
this part or a menu
that is successfully loaded.

552
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,720
You already know when this and you put
in the extra one, you just remove this.

553
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,760
Now negates the concept of implementation.

554
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,640
When you right click here
go to declaration or usage.

555
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,680
So when I go on declaration,
it is stating within this particular part

556
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,680
it means all order doesn't matter
implementation make this.

557
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,080
If at this point ending the definition
in the feature fine, it will get executed.

558
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,480
Now order
Date of execution defines from here.

559
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,560
It defines from here.

560
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,160
So it doesn't matter
which place in which class like implement.

561
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,080
Take the body of this method.

562
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,440
As long as the method body is available,

563
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,120
it will execute understood to,
but will definitely execute.

564
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,400
So order of definition be based on

565
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,560
the person implementation of the method,

566
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,800
not based on the position
where we actually defined this part

567
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,680
already

568
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,160
understood this point.

569
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,080
Everyone

570
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,520
declaration usage is not available, but

571
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
if we are not actually

572
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,280
clicking on any citizen, click
on this particular part.

573
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,800
See the way
I'm clicking here right on this

574
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,480
and then I perform right click
and then declaration.

575
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,360
You will see your clicking
this exquisite place.

576
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,160
There's the problem

577
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,440
or requirements.

578
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,680
So what I'm saying is it depends. Great.

579
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,680
The execution need to be based

580
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,920
on the implementation of step.

581
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,000
If you're implementing the step,
as long as the step

582
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,640
definition is available in your project,
your is executed like a Kimber.

583
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,680
It's not depending on the position

584
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,280
where you are actually defining your.

585
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,240
If I'm defining this given step
at the last place, in most of definition,

586
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,400
big doesn't matter.

587
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,880
As long as I am providing this,
The definition that I provided here

588
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,280
in the last place,
it will definitely work.

589
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,760
And as to so the execution,
depending on the method, the body,

590
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,120
the implementation of the step,
not on the execution and not on the order

591
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:36,400
or the position of state,
when we placed it.

592
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,280
Yes, Correct.

593
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,520
These methods are independent
of this method.

594
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,400
Similarly,
this method is independent of this method.

595
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,000
Correct.

596
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,240
It's only the order we are defining here.

597
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,600
This is the only order we are defining.

598
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
You understood

599
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,800
us to not

600
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,680
get. No, let me be rigid.

601
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,120
Let me be clear.

602
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,080
I don't need this method.

603
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,680
It was just for the explanation I created.

604
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,640
So I'm going to delete it.

605
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,440
Guys, before deleting.

606
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,520
I'm telling you, I'm
going to delete this particular part.

607
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,840
This is step because we don't need it.

608
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,440
We implemented it just to show you.

609
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,000
Okay, we deleted from here

610
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,240
and let me take it from here

611
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,160
is from from both places in my step.

612
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,280
Two steps also in from my log in feature.

613
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,480
Also.

614
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,680
So I told you to remove

615
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,560
this from the above portion
you remove from the normal portion. See?

616
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,800
Let me do it for you here.

617
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:52,200
After this then you have
another curly process to put it like this.

618
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,720
You have one more curly braces
here, remove this braces, not this one.

619
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,040
Otherwise you will get the other.

620
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,240
There's the issue you have.

621
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,960
Please check the code word you guys
are doing and how you are writing.

622
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,360
It's clearly showing that
you have a problem with your can leave.

623
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,920
This is Please do it now.

624
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,720
I imagine initial file

625
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,680
cutting
scenario can be different sequence.

626
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,680
I'm not sure why
it doesn't need to be proposed straight.

627
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,960
The support. Don't worry about it.

628
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,000
Just do proper just because you know
it is a very silly mistake.

629
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,480
I can remove it here in the classics
and normally I will handle this things

630
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,800
instead of making some small mistakes.

631
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,560
And you don't need to be worried about it

632
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,240
when things are out of control.

633
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,280
Then on the other side it the way
they can handle this because always.

634
00:36:45,280 --> 00:37:01,760
All right, there is no

635
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,040
All right, let me rephrase it.

636
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:18,320
Otherwise I will handle these geniuses
here will point the one.

637
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,040
All right.

638
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,240
Let me clear.

639
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,920
Let me create another picture by right.

640
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,200
They could create another feature
fail here in time.

641
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,280
We've been the name of this feature Employ

642
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,440
Search Dart Features

643
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,720
Database Employee Search Dart features.

644
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,480
Okay.

645
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,920
And why?

646
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm going to write an employee search.

647
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,080
If you see in my notes
I identified scenario as the user story.

648
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,560
One, two, three, four, five.

649
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,960
Then I have those in any

650
00:37:52,240 --> 00:38:14,720
and everyone see this.

651
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,920
Now let's write a scenario here.

652
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,280
So I'm going to write feature
find LLC users

653
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,520
20 123456 is definitely employee

654
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,440
and here I'm with direct scenario
so search

655
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,760
the search employ by I

656
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,960
first I'm going to search employee by I.T.

657
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,880
All right
so let's create one scenario point

658
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,120
given

659
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,880
user is

660
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,960
navigated to

661
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,680
it is application

662
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,920
the job premise sweepstakes application

663
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,360
course owns me.

664
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,880
Follow you as well, sir.

665
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,680
Not the one number
you don't need to follow.

666
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
We already

667
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,120
hurry then I'm writing here

668
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,840
first,

669
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,440
then me for starting the employee
by adding.

670
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:29,880
Great.

671
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,600
I was expecting actually this point
from you for searching the employee first.

672
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,640
What I have to do

673
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,000
long.

674
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:48,840
Do we have any method for logging?

675
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,040
Yes, we do have.

676
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,200
Well, is the method that you.

677
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Can I take all this bullet points
from you?

678
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:02,080
Promote me.

679
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,280
So let me copy
this. Policy steps from here

680
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,920
and simply is to give

681
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,040
categories.

682
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,520
This is what we call called reusability.

683
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,360
Next time, if you are going to create
a new scenario, just for the points

684
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,360
you and your scenario is done,
Isn't it easy, guys?

685
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,440
You don't need to write anything
in this table again and again and again.

686
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,360
Getting

687
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,880
Yes, yes, yes.

688
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,320
Correct. Kick
Ember is all about copy copying

689
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,560
right now after then.

690
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,000
Right.

691
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,560
Nobody paid this page
but then was not completed.

692
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,200
I have to wait when user

693
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,440
maybe gets to

694
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,000
employ in this speech.

695
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,640
Let me show you this.

696
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,160
We open on application first

697
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,000
more than

698
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:16,920
27.3.

699
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,840
Can you see this?

700
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,640
First, what I have to do if I am on
dashboard page, create by default,

701
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,200
it should take me to this particular page
coming from this beach.

702
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,320
I have to go on bin
and then I have to click on employee list.

703
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,360
Correct? That's correct.

704
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,600
First employee bin and then employee list

705
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,320
and then only I will see
my employee is too big

706
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,680
for me.

707
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,480
So I have written over here.

708
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,640
You see,

709
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,160
when user name begins to employee
list page,

710
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,760
I will make these steps create
also and here I'm going to write

711
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,240
with the user

712
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,040
enters

713
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,680
appended android I.D.

714
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,960
and end user takes on

715
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,320
virtual button

716
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,560
and you see

717
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,640
raw information is

718
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,200
is displayed.

719
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,120
Is this correct?

720
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,520
Is this the correct scenario or not

721
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,040
correct scenario.

722
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,760
Fine.

723
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,080
So now first let me create

724
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,960
steps for all these highlighted systems

725
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,080
and then I will keep
all of these steps in an employee.

726
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,120
Such is steps plus again,

727
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,760
it's created

728
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:54,800
so far.

729
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,040
Any question

730
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,280
anyone has any questions for you.

731
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:15,640
So I think is we're going to head within

732
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,680
those body gates.

733
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,440
Before the break.

734
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,240
We can we go in and then one more thing.

735
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,800
It's my humble request to use this code

736
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,720
and see a lot of people
I have been applying to this on the issue.

737
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,320
I've seen their machines.

738
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
They're doing it my code, even for us.

739
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:44,640
And believe me,
the quality of code is good.

740
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,000
You actually included this

741
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,160
one. It

742
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,400
added running

743
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,600
scenarios was not employed in my eighties.

744
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,640
Why is this so?

745
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,280
I need to check this.

746
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,320
Should we also mention how to navigate
employee list page

747
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,520
one user name? Yes.

748
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,280
Shouldn't contain big M.

749
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,880
I didn't implement the code like I said.

750
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,320
Great.

751
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,200
So when I say user name,
we gets to employee speech inside

752
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,280
that particular step, we implement
the code for clicking on emotion,

753
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:28,240
clicking
one employee list option following.

754
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,880
After you create this new you would
you have another log in steps like

755
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:33,920
yes Jimmy.

756
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,720
Yes. Yes.

757
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,280
I that

758
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,640
we will create we will clean.

759
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,360
Okay so now we execute this menu first

760
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,120
I it is completely fine.

761
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,240
It is completely fine.

762
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:18,840
Delicious.

763
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,480
Now you see here

764
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,680
it is giving me all this step straight,
which I am missing.

765
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,440
Can you see create

766
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,160
navigates to employees to page index?

767
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,400
Well it employed Click on search
button and users see

768
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,240
employee information is displayed

769
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,640
is it search the meters road package

770
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,880
solve one Yes everything you
so you there 17 here

771
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,760
let me copy this right and here

772
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,040
let me create another Java class for

773
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,240
employee such race

774
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,440
employee statistics

775
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,000
create.

776
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,960
Now I'm going to based here all the steps

777
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,200
I got from this

778
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,880
Now one thing
one thing, one thing to show.

779
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,040
You see, I provided here a can you see

780
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,800
and a user clicks on search for complete.

781
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,520
I provided your ID,
but when you go in your steps,

782
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,280
you see it says when it is no and

783
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,200
you observe so far what I see.

784
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,040
If you see here, it gives you end.

785
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,160
But here
actually it implemented automatically.

786
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,520
Yeah I

787
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,080
obviously know if I'm raising the point,
this is because I'm going to explain.

788
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,600
Correct.
I'm not going to leave in between.

789
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,600
So why is it so?

790
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,280
Because.

791
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,520
No, that's completely fine.

792
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:05,760
I'm just kidding.

793
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,920
So now why is it so?

794
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,160
Because this end keyword,
like I said, we are using it

795
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,800
and the supporting cast
as a supporting cast.

796
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,960
This is not the mean keyword, right?

797
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,840
And it always gives
you only main keyword, correct.

798
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:25,840
If you put it with then it gives you then
if you put it with when it gives you one.

799
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,880
All right.

800
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,320
All right.

801
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:35,040
Great.

802
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,400
Another thing,

803
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,000
if you seen employee
statistics is the post

804
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,960
a stable speaking user name
begins employee list page

805
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,960
by because my username password
and everything is available here.

806
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,360
Great. So let me copy this.

807
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,560
The steps also following two steps.

808
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,280
First, if we completed the steps to

809
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,080
take me pasted here,

810
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,000
why does giving me the error eliminate?

811
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,320
Why this error? Yes.

812
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,720
Correct.

813
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,840
Because these methods are available
in my common methods

814
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,280
and I'm not using this
extensive keyword here

815
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,640
now and it is gone now.

816
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,320
You see navigate to a gentleman's
application.

817
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,800
Enter submitted admin username
and password clicks on log in button,

818
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,040
maybe gets to employee list page.

819
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,000
Fine.

820
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,640
So first I have to implement my good here,
but it makes

821
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,600
let me write that element.

822
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,600
And same option is equal to

823
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:45,920
take me.

824
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,560
Take the look at the efforts
from here for the option

825
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,320
to find do

826
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,960
now going to take

827
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:10,000
88 is a part of the attribute

828
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,080
a lot this is attribute this is value.

829
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,320
Remember color coding the purple one egg

830
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,160
and this one

831
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,880
attribute this one value.

832
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,640
Let's take the value from here.

833
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,720
So I'm going to write right.

834
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,240
I'm going to write Driver Dark,

835
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,920
find element by

836
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,280
door I.D.

837
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,160
And this is my

838
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,520
is this correct?

839
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,600
Now what I have to do,

840
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,360
I have to click on promotion.

841
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,800
So bin option don't click.

842
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,040
So password everyone

843
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,880
I'm going really slow

844
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,080
but it's

845
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,920
after clicking on this theme option.

846
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,360
I see I see employee list page.

847
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,960
First
I have to click on employee list page.

848
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,680
So let me find Yes, we can see that

849
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,280
I have to take the spirit to leave

850
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,120
very hard.

851
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:27,720
Now use it.

852
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,800
Bin Menu rate Employee list.

853
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,280
So let me pick this particular one
and here

854
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,640
I'm going to write web element.

855
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,360
I draw a list option is equals to

856
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,960
very dark

857
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,640
point element by dark I.D.

858
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,840
in here I am going to provide

859
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,680
and then employee list option don't click

860
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,120
now we implemented

861
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,000
it is a step or not should we navigate
to employee list page click on option

862
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,680
We got employee list option
Now we are on employee list page.

863
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,520
Correct

864
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,680
so far so what everyone

865
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,920
is that anyone who has any question

866
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:33,760
related to this particular point, no means

867
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,520
no next point here.

868
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:41,120
Next point I have to click on valid
employee but employee, right.

869
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,840
So let's see,

870
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,200
I have to take the locator
of this particular

871
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,760
peak, such

872
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,720
exists.

873
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,560
It is equal to GMB search party.

874
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,800
If we did again from here

875
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,560
there is I can create x
but also we can create see as selector.

876
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,560
Also since I is directly available.

877
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,320
So to save your time, I'm directly
taking it.

878
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,120
Don't ask why we are not creating
the expectancy assistant.

879
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,840
We can do that as well.

880
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,360
So I'm not the culprit.

881
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:23,120
Okay.

882
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,680
Web element

883
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:31,160
search my I got it right here.

884
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,280
So finally made by no I.D..

885
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:41,000
This is the i.t.

886
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,480
Now know what i have to do here.

887
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,200
Simple.

888
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,800
I have to send the data,
so search by the same keys.

889
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,280
And what is the id?

890
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,240
So I kept it somewhere in my notes.

891
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,680
If we check,

892
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,120
this is the data, so let me check
for whether it is working or not.

893
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,920
If I put this employee in search,

894
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,760
they you it is giving you the data, right?

895
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:20,080
So it is employee bank

896
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,440
and then simply find a duplicate search
option.

897
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,160
Right.

898
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,880
So web element,

899
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,320
search button in sequence

900
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:37,120
to try to find anything and I don't i. D

901
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,560
in case if it is available. Let me check

902
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,200
search why it is available

903
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:54,720
stick this I'm taking this from here

904
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,360
this and I'm coming to my screen

905
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:01,160
sometimes if I changing

906
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,960
it will ask
why are you doing this so fast?

907
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,000
So I'm telling you, okay, in your command

908
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,200
to make you there so you can go there.

909
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,520
Search button.

910
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,840
Don't click.

911
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,080
So first of what everyone

912
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:22,600
is that

913
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:27,120
unique want It is unique.

914
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:38,200
This is the application we have mine
shows to well, let me check

915
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:48,680
this.

916
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,920
The best place to check using the example

917
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,320
one only

918
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:05,960
where you're showing to 80.

919
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,520
I put the next

920
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,000
better.

921
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:19,240
So it is 80.

922
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,040
Oh guilty.

923
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,880
Forgot it.

924
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,400
You put that next.

925
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,760
So what based is not available?
You did this either.

926
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,440
You can take name value of 88
three things and then you have a good

927
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,400
forget about this part.

928
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,480
The user employee information is displayed
the verification button. Why?

929
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,320
Because we are going to use different type
of position in particular.

930
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,720
So right now our focus is
not as the shift, our focus is on the step

931
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,600
definition that we actually implement
because I'm going to looks as you

932
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,720
information

933
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,920
is displayed

934
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,200
displayed on the page

935
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,320
because there
we used the stingy annotations.

936
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,880
Remember it's been stingy.

937
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,240
We use just in general patients
in Katoomba,

938
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,240
we have separate
kind of locations that we will be using.

939
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,680
So that's why I'm not implementing
any annotation as of now, I'm

940
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,200
going to implement those annotations up
something that clear

941
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:22,560
front.

942
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,720
So far, so far in this code,

943
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,760
any confusion

944
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,840
connotations?

945
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,400
No, there is no connotations

946
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,240
or take this in any way already.

947
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,080
And some of this method and again,
these methods in new words or

948
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,080
in each of the last line, why not?

949
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:51,640
Sorry, this is the point.

950
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
Now let me go employ search.

951
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,600
See very good looking scenario.

952
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,840
And so I have shall we implement

953
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,280
and I should be executing

954
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,600
things

955
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,840
let's it

956
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,160
and it's going to be feed

957
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,600
it's speed

958
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,040
eliminate

959
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:39,720
by its speed.

960
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,440
Now let me explain just something

961
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,320
like many people

962
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,080
inheritance is not possible in duplicate.

963
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,600
Well and as one duplicate

964
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,640
and it's duplicate

965
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,320
we did something at all
I get the I know what we did.

966
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,600
I know what would be like this.

967
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:05,400
I'm explaining guys why multiple
inheritance is not possible in Java

968
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,000
because yep

969
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,240
because for example,
if you have E method in your E class

970
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,800
and method in your B class

971
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,680
in your C class is going to take
the proper deeds of from either the C.

972
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:28,120
If you are calling this method in class,
right, then Java will get confused

973
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,600
whether to take this method
from class E or from

974
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,040
class B.

975
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,520
Nice. Tell me. I don't know.

976
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,760
Is it correct or potentially

977
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,600
it is correct.

978
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:54,120
Now, now just keep this concept in mind
and here comes you write one.

979
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,880
Is it going to give one user is blah,
blah, blah.

980
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,000
You implemented,
you take the one piece the same step

981
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,680
you call somewhere and you provide
the same is the definition in two classes.

982
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,680
This is your log in two steps.

983
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,960
This is your employee.

984
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,360
So just

985
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,480
now when you're actually calling

986
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,120
the scenario, so Google to get confused,

987
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,400
did you ever get confused as to

988
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:22,960
where should

989
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,040
I go and take this user is navigate
to to H&M.

990
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,440
This application is two.

991
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,160
Should I take this step from employee
search step skills

992
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,280
or should I take this
step from log in the steps?

993
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,600
Plus understood.

994
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,400
We are dealing with the goober
with the help of which programing language

995
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,280
we are dealing with,
which programing language Java.

996
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,560
So Java always get confused
when we have two things.

997
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,600
Java is very loyal, always stays with one.

998
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,160
Understood.

999
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:03,560
And this one right.

1000
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,760
So what? You got it.

1001
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:12,960
So when we saw this problem
that if we played one particular step

1002
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,400
in one particular class,
we don't even need

1003
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,000
to define this step again
and again and again.

1004
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,880
So we are simply going
next grade in one class

1005
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,360
and let's just call those steps again
and again in every feature.

1006
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,040
But you don't need to copy paste it.

1007
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,640
Every other step would employ statistic.

1008
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,680
So what we will do, we will simply delete

1009
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,960
all these particular part of log
in the steps from this particular class

1010
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,640
because people already have these steps
in the steps class.

1011
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,240
Right?

1012
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,960
So let's do this part.

1013
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,880
Correct. Now.

1014
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,880
Now I am having unique is steps

1015
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,520
only one is there definitions
for log in every single step.

1016
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,840
Having
a single is still between issue correct

1017
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:05,040
that it?

1018
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,920
Yeah Alex be already dedicated
now let me go here

1019
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,360
on employee search and let's see see still
my scenario is

1020
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,080
and so let's go ahead and implemented

1021
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,960
and execute file

1022
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,720
that it gave me correct

1023
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,120
now see it's working fine

1024
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,440
yes so when I Neil
but you asked question early that's

1025
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:34,360
why intentionally I told you to wait
because I was about to export next to you

1026
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:39,120
if I on on night Question
from where did you copy ask Glenn code.

1027
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,440
I was reporting standard
from common methods A nasal identical B

1028
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,000
anything in the last line? Good.

1029
01:01:45,000 --> 01:02:06,240
I wrote everything correct.

1030
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,560
Arsenate is working or not.

1031
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,240
They tell me

1032
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,880
it works.

1033
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,360
It works, but it is a complete synonym.

1034
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:23,360
No, because my browser is still open.

1035
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,760
My problem is is still open.

1036
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,520
So let me write one thing
here. Just one more is different.

1037
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,200
Implement. I'm going to write.

1038
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,240
Then user flows

1039
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,920
rules the

1040
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,200
browser

1041
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,160
correct.

1042
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,920
The same mistake,
the same mistake and I copy it.

1043
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,640
Also make

1044
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,520
and I copy the same mistake here as well,

1045
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:54,880
because I'm going to implement
just one step for this fight.

1046
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,640
So there is a step in this monster
log scenario.

1047
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:25,160
So it wouldn't be much I find we got this.

1048
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,920
Could any reasonable.

1049
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,800
Yes, Yes, please. I will.

1050
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,840
Before the break I will upload the code.

1051
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,120
Now this use then to close the browser.

1052
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,520
It's up to you.

1053
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,000
If you want to keep it
in, log in, keep it in, log in the steps.

1054
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,160
If you want to keep in employee
structure steps, keep there,

1055
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,080
but make sure you're
keeping it to just one piece.

1056
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,680
So I'm keeping it in my log. A space.

1057
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,120
All right. Let me

1058
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,720
know you guys for closing the browser.

1059
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,600
Do we have any code

1060
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,320
gone from common methods?

1061
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,080
Fine. Closed browser. Right.

1062
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:12,480
This is the matter to be correct,
we need to get the steps.

1063
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,680
What we missing? Yeah. Alex. Yes, correct.

1064
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,920
We need to run it. No.

1065
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,240
Another way.

1066
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:20,840
None. A little bit.

1067
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,400
Every time we have to run the code.

1068
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:27,080
But yes,
there are ways to simplify the execution.

1069
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,440
So next time when you run, you run
only the particular code,

1070
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,680
which will give you a step.
Not all the code.

1071
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,440
We will come down to that point.

1072
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,200
How does it know?

1073
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,840
Without the code it has to log?

1074
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,680
How does it know?

1075
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,760
Without the code,
it doesn't know anything without the code.

1076
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,080
See, this is automation.

1077
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:51,040
It does what we build trade.

1078
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,120
If we are not seeing anything,
it's not going to execute anything.

1079
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,960
How did it link to log in code?

1080
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,560
You deleted?

1081
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,120
The log in code is correct.

1082
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:03,680
I deleted the log in code from here
from employee search.

1083
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:04,800
Right.

1084
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,480
But I didn't believe anything
from employee search.

1085
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,840
You see, it is coming from here.

1086
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,800
The execution is done through feature
by and in feature by.

1087
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,920
I again explain.

1088
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,000
I'm going to explain to this part.

1089
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,720
It is depending on the implementation.

1090
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,680
So when it starts execution,
you see this board is designed

1091
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:29,480
already implemented as any matter
in which class it gets implemented.

1092
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,480
But it is
it is implemented somewhere, right?

1093
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,880
So first
my feature file will execute this system.

1094
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,760
Then there's a step, then business step,

1095
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,000
then business step
and so on to my master's degree.

1096
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,840
But in my last step
it gets executed in the store.

1097
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:52,280
So now I have to, like I said,
if you put it, make people places,

1098
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,320
you will get duplicate the step
exception, correct.

1099
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:57,640
So you have to place reject one place.

1100
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,200
I placed this particular steps
in my scenario

1101
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,120
because it belongs to a log in page.

1102
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,360
So any log in two steps defined.

1103
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:15,320
But I can go anywhere.

1104
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:18,360
It is best practice to
to use the code from different classes.

1105
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,200
Yes, we have to use the code belongs
to one particular class.

1106
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,760
We have to take the code
from the particular class.

1107
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,240
Now, let me tell you why we need this way.

1108
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,360
For example, tomorrow
you have 100 classes, right?

1109
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,600
And you're executing the code.

1110
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,080
Your code fails only to some X-Y-Z
class 54th class.

1111
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,360
This building in the 54th class,
if you keep all this code in one class or,

1112
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,440
you know, just to mess up

1113
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,120
the code of multiple classes
in one place, isn't it hard to identify

1114
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,120
when it comes to

1115
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:54,720
fixing the code?

1116
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:59,520
Isn't it hard to identify
which code unit to fix me?

1117
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,440
The file will be huge, right?

1118
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,960
A lot of scroll
up and down everything now.

1119
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,760
Now, if you keep everything
right in the separate places

1120
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,280
now, while looking into here,
you know my code is spending on which far

1121
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,040
log in page. Fine.

1122
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:18,720
Just going to log in the steps open
very very small amount code

1123
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:24,520
available check which code is not working
and either fixed spend saving part

1124
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,400
understood.

1125
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,800
That's why we have different systems

1126
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,600
so that if you answer
this are in the same page,

1127
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,200
you have scenario events
and then you search

1128
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,240
employee by page

1129
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:41,360
normal.

1130
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,600
And we cannot do this.

1131
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,040
We cannot do this
because this feature file explains.

1132
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:46,320
Right.

1133
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,320
This feature might explain
the scenario log

1134
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,080
in scenario break is a different part.

1135
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,200
I can have my people scenarios
related to log logging.

1136
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,680
What example log in.

1137
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,200
Similarly,
I can have invalid admin log in.

1138
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,240
Similarly, I can have negative log rate,

1139
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:08,000
so multiple log in related distances
belong to one particular feature template.

1140
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,880
Similarly for employing such see,

1141
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,360
I have redundant steps for search
employed by i.t.

1142
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,800
Now what I'm doing.

1143
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,640
Let's see.

1144
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,120
It is
it will make things more clear this time.

1145
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,920
I'm going to copy this complete scenario
and here I'm going to write

1146
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,920
such employee by name.

1147
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,720
So now can both scenarios I have

1148
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,720
because today.

1149
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,360
Because today yours yours actually is
steps are not implemented.

1150
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,720
That's one

1151
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:42,480
computer code.

1152
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,360
Don't worry.

1153
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,760
You'll be having this code
so that it will work.

1154
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,840
Now, tell me in this code

1155
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,560
how many things I have to change,
how many steps I have to change

1156
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,080
According to my scenario, such employee,
my need

1157
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:57,840
Just one.

1158
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,800
Which one is one, right?

1159
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,680
So instead of providing valid, add

1160
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,520
what I have to provide this time.

1161
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,600
Relatively simple.

1162
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,760
Okay, so let me write what it is.

1163
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:17,240
Instead of this I'm going to employ
name correct.

1164
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,000
Now see what is very elegant.

1165
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,480
It is highlighting this particular step
because

1166
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,680
even if you remove just one word, one
even put it from inside it

1167
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,040
played, it's not going to change
because it's going to change.

1168
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,600
So now we need employee name.

1169
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,600
I'm going to provide that

1170
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,120
this time.

1171
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:39,960
This time, if I

1172
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,880
want to execute this particular scenario,
I have to execute it to generate.

1173
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,120
This is going to

1174
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,160
get in case

1175
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:39,640
liquid would go.

1176
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:49,600
This is template
index with an employee name, correct.

1177
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,920
It is here today.

1178
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,160
We got this particular part.

1179
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,680
Now tell me in
which class I have to copy this code.

1180
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,640
I have to implement in which class

1181
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,160
know employee search, employee search

1182
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,280
that's automated what I can keep it in
the last position.

1183
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:13,280
Also gives begin

1184
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,120
people last position
implementation matters.

1185
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,640
Not all of my participate.

1186
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,840
Now let me go here and see employing me.

1187
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,600
I need to a point.

1188
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,440
So let's see.

1189
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
It is giving me the IFB.

1190
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,560
Is this correct?

1191
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,000
If we take this by the

1192
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,080
I'm going to write

1193
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,280
that my

1194
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,840
name is it wants to try a third element

1195
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,400
by the I.D.

1196
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,440
This is the idea I'm going to provide
name same piece.

1197
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,240
What is the name?

1198
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,360
I copied it in my notes. Correct.

1199
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,880
This is the name X, Y, Z.

1200
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,760
First, let's check
whether it is identifying or not

1201
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:08,720
with this neat.

1202
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,120
Yes, it is giving me the data. Correct.

1203
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,240
So let's do it.

1204
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,440
Let's take this part here

1205
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,320
and put.

1206
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,320
So first of all, this

1207
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,240
student's

1208
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,360
grade.

1209
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,120
So now this time.

1210
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,320
This time, right this time you'll see

1211
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,120
it's gone.

1212
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,360
Not and shall we execute
both these scenarios in a single shot

1213
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:44,160
or not?

1214
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,920
That is, we can. How? Let me show you.

1215
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,840
Can you see here
also I got an option for the feature.

1216
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,120
It means when I execute
my complete feature, see if I execute

1217
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,560
my complete feature.

1218
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,160
It's asking for search
to run the feature employee search

1219
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:07,800
box. Should we.

1220
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,800
We should.

1221
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,840
We should

1222
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:16,920
share should must read this for later.

1223
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,120
This will add.

1224
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:22,960
I will give you the executive meeting
of this board one day.

1225
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,800
Cookies Best

1226
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,960
of actually when I was giving

1227
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,040
decision rate in one company
and there is a

1228
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,120
related to some items part in the next
an English language testing system.

1229
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:41,320
So nag put the awesome question
and then I explained this forwards.

1230
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,320
There is a story I do that one day
and then you will never

1231
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:48,440
even if you forget that English language
ranking one

1232
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,680
forget this code words

1233
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,320
see it execute in the first one.

1234
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:06,800
Now it is executing the second one.

1235
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:07,760
Yes, sir.

1236
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,520
Yes, sir.

1237
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,080
Correct.

1238
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,000
Yellow one break.

1239
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,800
I'm going to put it,

1240
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,640
sir. I got 8.5.

1241
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:19,400
Been listening, 8.5,
reading eight and speaking in 818 writing.

1242
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:31,200
That is my school.

1243
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:31,560
All right.

1244
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:37,200
Can you guys
see those in areas to past 18 steps past

1245
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,200
eight now,

1246
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,840
if you can correctly and also you'll see
all the 18 instead of 11.

1247
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,520
Then I paused and

1248
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,080
cutting

1249
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,040
so far

1250
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:59,280
is that anyone who has any question
if yes, please ask.

1251
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,440
Meanwhile
and the quote from the repository

1252
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,120
for simply

1253
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,840
are It's more easy
to get missing the steps or format.

1254
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,800
Just delete this
or duplicate the steps from your log

1255
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,600
employee Search page
and then it will work.

1256
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,600
It just keep the steps unique.

1257
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,520
So we already have
those as displayed in a log in.

1258
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,040
Then we don't need to take the steps
in our search class.

1259
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:44,920
Also.

1260
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,240
So just delete those steps from there
and then you'll be good.

1261
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,560
Okay, You'll see.

1262
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:56,320
This class record is available now.

1263
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,400
Great. Enough grade.

1264
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,320
Yes. Yes. Not yet. I know.

1265
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,200
Just give me one more minute
and then maybe on from the invite.

1266
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,000
It's been three
year. They've been from like.

1267
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,080
I'm just asking.

1268
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,320
So everyone can get this thing so right.

1269
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,920
So if everyone is understanding
that it is great

1270
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,000
good is can we get guys

1271
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,440
code is available in the repository.

1272
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,520
You can go ahead in the break.

1273
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,000
We just take
the updated code in your machine.

1274
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:31,560
Once you get this code base
implementing trade to running.

1275
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,880
We definitely ran because we created
now this code in such a way

1276
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,600
that we don't need any extra
dependency straight from your machine.

1277
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,600
Everything is now related
to central repository.

1278
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,400
You just need to give digit code.

1279
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,000
Good luck.

1280
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:49,440
All right.

1281
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,640
This let's take a break now.

1282
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,200
Point

1283
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,880
is that we will make no

1284
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,040
audio recordings

1285
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,160
so far.

1286
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:29,080
Is there anyone who has
any kind of confusion in this code?

1287
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,000
No confusion.

1288
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,520
Good.

1289
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,200
Now let me go in
to this particular part. See

1290
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,280
how things work.

1291
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:43,840
Basically, let's say
you have one feature by Blake

1292
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,440
you have to feature for people
who have difficulty understanding

1293
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:53,280
this part step definition is demonstrated
and they can do this for you because

1294
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,800
you have lot of the steps definition
by correct.

1295
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:03,360
For example, this is your log in steps,
this is your employee.

1296
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,680
So two steps,

1297
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,880
maybe tomorrow you will be having
another one called the baseboards steps.

1298
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,240
So many steps.

1299
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,120
You are writing this in any given

1300
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,880
in the username password, click on log
input to verify their day's work.

1301
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:17,560
Fine.

1302
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,440
Enter username password.

1303
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,360
Click some log important
verified their dashboard

1304
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:25,520
Search the employee disasters disasters.

1305
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,880
See you implemented this step.

1306
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,720
See it now remember the package
you provide.

1307
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,760
It steps.

1308
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,920
The package you provide is steps right?

1309
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:37,600
In this particular package,

1310
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,320
it will search for all the ways

1311
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,000
for these steps.

1312
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,040
We will search
only if we find the steps unique in your

1313
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:52,200
this particular package in all the classes
it will execute.

1314
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,280
If it finds duplicate,
it will give you duplicate method

1315
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,600
exception duplicate exception

1316
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:00,360
dispute.

1317
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:13,520
So far.

1318
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:33,600
Is this part clear to everyone
what I'm explaining?

1319
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,360
So duplication works for same package
only are not any.

1320
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,040
We should have just one package
for all the steps.

1321
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,160
Just one package.

1322
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:44,160
And in this package we rated,

1323
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:46,320
unless there is a platform
we're dealing with.

1324
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:47,400
All right.

1325
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,240
For example,
if you are working with the web based

1326
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:53,720
application rate, you will be having
just one package in one project.

1327
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,920
If you're working with a project

1328
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,200
that supports your API
distinct data as distinct

1329
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:03,640
and then you'll would be having multiple
steps packages one to support API

1330
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:08,800
one is for your best buddies per database
and how these packages work.

1331
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:10,560
So I'm going to take them.

1332
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:19,520
Okay, let's see

1333
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:22,800
now what is happening here.

1334
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,080
The problem is still seen with me.

1335
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,680
Which problem?

1336
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:31,960
The way we were executing best
is this investing grade.

1337
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,160
We were executing this consistent indirect
direct distribution.

1338
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:39,720
At one time we executed one class
similarly year on.

1339
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:44,800
So if I see my feature right,
I am executing one feature at one day,

1340
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:49,000
isn't it?

1341
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,240
This is what we are doing, right?

1342
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:56,480
We can execute one picture
pilot one time in that one feature file.

1343
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,240
If I hadn't made it possible use,
I can execute all those multiples

1344
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,400
in that needs cutting.

1345
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:05,520
But if I want to execute do feature
based with the existing

1346
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,920
set of what we had in the integral
to feature

1347
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,000
once in a single shot
with the existing board, what behavior

1348
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:18,840
exam?

1349
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,840
No, this is not destined

1350
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,480
so right now we do not have anything.

1351
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,360
We do not have anything through which

1352
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,320
how indeed
we do not have the exact opposite.

1353
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,840
I let me repeat my question.

1354
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:39,040
As of now,
whatever the existing setup we have

1355
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,040
can be executed to feature
inserting one shot.

1356
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,680
The answer is no.

1357
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:47,320
Right?

1358
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,360
Parallel Sequential No.

1359
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,760
It is a sequential execution
basically even better.

1360
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:56,760
Let me repeat again, unless we have
a separate machine for that.

1361
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:57,880
Okay.

1362
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:01,320
So we'll focus on sequential execution

1363
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,520
the way we had,

1364
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:08,240
their testing did not exist in testing
when we talk about to do,

1365
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:11,160
but we have a last

1366
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,160
let me put this point first,
put information

1367
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,040
to implement

1368
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,760
in the core for

1369
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,200
steps

1370
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:50,200
and feature.

1371
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:54,360
Right now
we are going to talk about another class

1372
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,800
now as good check with someone

1373
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,480
if you got very long that

1374
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,920
class right now.

1375
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,920
What is this run of class?

1376
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,640
Remember,
this class is a configuration file

1377
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,800
which is considered as the bankable.

1378
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,080
All your execution part.

1379
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,800
Every single thing will be done

1380
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:23,160
by this particular class code
at another class.

1381
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,960
And this student

1382
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:31,320
understood this.

1383
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,240
Everyone

1384
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:44,640
months.

1385
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:49,800
So in this class we are going to check
what all are the things we have.

1386
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:53,080
Okay, so let's create one class cluster.

1387
01:23:54,360 --> 01:24:06,680
Should we go ahead and create class days?

1388
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,960
Let's create another class.

1389
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,040
So I'm going to write here like in Java,

1390
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,840
let me create a new package, right?

1391
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,280
Let me create a new package called code.

1392
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:24,080
I can be having multiple different
classes, right?

1393
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,720
Right.
I can. We have multiple classes. Remember,

1394
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:29,040
based and do

1395
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,040
not examine this move
to take similar regulation or exam.

1396
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:35,640
And similarly I can have integration,
dinner, smoke rendering and so on.

1397
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,400
How you do that for now,
just understand one thing

1398
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:43,560
all that unless we will keep
in this particular package.

1399
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,760
Okay, now

1400
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,880
let me create one class called

1401
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:58,760
in another piece.

1402
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,600
We added another class.

1403
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,440
Now look carefully what I'm doing.

1404
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:07,640
I'm not writing any code inside the class.

1405
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:12,080
Remember, I'm
not creating anything inside that class,

1406
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:17,280
but I'm going to write everything outside
the class, above the class.

1407
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,320
I'm going to make

1408
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:23,040
understood.

1409
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,360
We are going to create another class
in a class.

1410
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:29,600
I'm not going to write anything
in the mean block.

1411
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,800
I'm going to write about that class.

1412
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,400
Now, what are the things
I'm going to write above?

1413
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,600
The initial

1414
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,360
first thing,

1415
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:42,640
like I said, we are working before class.

1416
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,200
This should be before class.

1417
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:48,480
But it's important.

1418
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,040
Like I said,

1419
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:51,240
read.

1420
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:55,000
Like I said,
we are going to work to deliver.

1421
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,920
But a unique

1422
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,400
remember extended was also derived
from the unit grade.

1423
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:07,240
So here to do what we will use
with the generic key.

1424
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,600
This particular point in your mind.

1425
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,080
Okay, we are using a G unit and a student

1426
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,480
friend, so here I am going to write

1427
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:24,880
one particular part
going at the rate and one bit.

1428
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,280
So when I'm typing in that it is another
class likely to administer some feature.

1429
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,360
I know the link
between this sort of feature

1430
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:37,000
is that to go over that, another class
is basically execute all of it.

1431
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,600
We just like, okay, give me

1432
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,040
linking is already there.

1433
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,760
Right this way
we are able to execute ordinal class.

1434
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:48,560
So on the picture point, great,
because link is already done.

1435
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,800
Remember to go declaration or usage plate.

1436
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,040
So when you go to declaration
additional usage

1437
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,400
you'll see the implementation.

1438
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,880
So that is linked point.

1439
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:04,840
So now when I provide at the recommended
you see it is beginning from RG

1440
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,040
No Junior did not run this document.

1441
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,720
We can you
so we which package it is referring to.

1442
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,400
J you need one.

1443
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:14,880
Okay.

1444
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:18,120
Remember we are using to compare with unit

1445
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,840
now in this direct relevant option.

1446
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,000
I'm going to write

1447
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,040
a goomba dot class

1448
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,920
all right by because this j

1449
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,120
and it will execute make good Googlebot
based on this particular class.

1450
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:42,360
So this is the student takes time to write
in the regular with the timber dot plus.

1451
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:47,560
Understood.

1452
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:50,960
In this one line of code is that anyone

1453
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,920
who has any kind of confusion

1454
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,520
mice now now

1455
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,680
the goomba is not that smart grade
good goomba and dude it is us fine

1456
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:13,880
if we are going to execute based on
the class called Katoomba dot class.

1457
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:17,280
So what parameters
we are going to execute?

1458
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:22,240
Not just think about the test
and do not examine by that data.

1459
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:26,520
Provide occasionally class
name, group name

1460
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,160
grade parameters
whether we want to integrate in parallel,

1461
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:35,400
read every single thing listeners
we provide all these options there or not.

1462
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:38,720
So those were destiny options.

1463
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,680
Those were listed.

1464
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,880
The options current logic is steam
implementation is different.

1465
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:49,320
We are going to configure in this class.

1466
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:54,240
There we head didn't do not well,
so we were using test in the options.

1467
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:57,000
Now we have to do better than that class.

1468
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,600
So we are going to use options. Right?

1469
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,800
So here we will write, iterate

1470
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,840
over options.

1471
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:07,760
Can you
see now these options are coming from

1472
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,440
I ordered to do or J unit there time Z

1473
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,920
we are using with the names of options

1474
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,800
like let's open

1475
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,120
this could give more options,
put this better.

1476
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:23,200
This is

1477
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,600
in the sort of we want what I'm doing

1478
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,200
in what options

1479
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,800
right now, what are going to be options.

1480
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,640
We are going to define
whatever the options

1481
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:41,640
we are going to explain here
based on these options.

1482
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,520
My this class will execute
all of my scenarios

1483
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:51,880
correct.

1484
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:52,840
Let's do it.

1485
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:55,960
So what is the first thing I should look
forward to?

1486
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,240
The first thing I should look forward to
is my feature.

1487
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,120
I want to execute either one feature

1488
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,360
fine or all the feature files
in this being good.

1489
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,000
Sure, this is what my target is.

1490
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,320
This is the target I'm looking. What would

1491
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:13,040
I want to

1492
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,680
execute my all feature files
from one place.

1493
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,600
So that is my place.

1494
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,320
Know how I define feature here?

1495
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,720
See, I'm going to write features

1496
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:30,640
and in this features in double course,
it will ask for the back.

1497
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:35,400
So the bot tell me what is my feature
called Case in my project

1498
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,360
where is might be different

1499
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,080
in my project

1500
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:46,200
is should start from your to see correct

1501
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,920
in your options.

1502
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:53,600
It should start from your based on a C
and there is some C you get EST.

1503
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,000
Correct.

1504
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,560
I noticed you get resources

1505
01:30:58,640 --> 01:30:59,960
and resources.

1506
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:05,080
You get features
content under features, right?

1507
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:10,080
If you just keep if you just keep slash
and keep it right like this,

1508
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,200
it will take all the feature,
find all the feature by

1509
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,560
and it don't want to execute
all the feature.

1510
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:21,880
I just want to execute one particular,
one particular.

1511
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:26,760
So just to keep
like this log in dart feature

1512
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:30,840
or just write like this

1513
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,760
and deploy

1514
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,240
employ

1515
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:39,720
search feature

1516
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:41,400
windows tool

1517
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:54,480
industrial guys.

1518
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,320
Let me execute one by one
blade one by one.

1519
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:00,280
So first I'm going to read

1520
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,920
non import feature.

1521
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,000
Correct. Let me execute this part.

1522
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,760
Now see,
even if I'm editing all the options here

1523
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:11,320
and you see I'm
getting different option here

1524
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,240
it is it is asking for request.

1525
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:19,440
That is it
means my implementation is correct

1526
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:24,120
because what I said
I'm going to run my Google class.

1527
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:28,400
So this is meant to do more remote class,
which I am going to execute.

1528
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:31,560
So then I am going to execute
my particular class.

1529
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,840
It should give me the option
in front of the class only.

1530
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,840
So it is giving me the option here.

1531
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,840
Now, based on what options

1532
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,880
that I'm going to get here.

1533
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,120
You see,
these options could give more options.

1534
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,680
I will provide all the options.

1535
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,200
One moment
I will explain all the options. Right.

1536
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:52,160
So first let me execute on this class

1537
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:55,800
from here on
so you can execute during a is an A-plus.

1538
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:06,240
Let's execute this virtual meet.

1539
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,680
Now see

1540
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,680
now see it is giving me the options.

1541
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:16,120
It says that step user is navigating

1542
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:19,640
to autonomous application is undefined.

1543
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:20,480
Right.

1544
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:22,080
But tell me one thing.

1545
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:25,560
This is a step
and all this is this user interface.

1546
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:28,600
My user name clicks on logging button

1547
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:33,000
and the user is successfully logged
in user, close the browser.

1548
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,720
Every single thing,
every single thing is implemented

1549
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:39,200
or not any

1550
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,480
everything is implemented.

1551
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:47,280
But even when I have

1552
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:51,480
every single step implemented,
when I try to run my remote

1553
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,960
class, it itself
there is no step definition found.

1554
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,800
What is the reason?

1555
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:00,200
Because this time,

1556
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,160
see, let tell you the difference.

1557
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:06,240
For us
to let me execute this from here, right?

1558
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,280
I'm going to execute from my feature plan.

1559
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,960
It's working fine.

1560
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:12,960
It's working fine.

1561
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,960
And that means it's working
absolutely fine.

1562
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,800
IT So is there anything wrong
with my code?

1563
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,640
See, it's
just one scenario. Five is deserts.

1564
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,560
But is there anything wrong
with my coordinate?

1565
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:29,920
There is nothing wrong in my good
might with the logic.

1566
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,880
Now me explain
what is the logic behind this?

1567
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,120
This is my configuration part.

1568
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:38,960
This is my configuration file.

1569
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:39,720
Correct.

1570
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,720
And class will not execute anything

1571
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:48,560
until and unless we explain
to this particular find that hey,

1572
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:52,400
you have to execute this
particular feature, right?

1573
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:57,120
Or that particular feature applied or only
feature files from the particular part.

1574
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,560
And you have to look forward to search

1575
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,920
for the steps
implemented for this particular find.

1576
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,680
In this particular place.

1577
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,960
It made a big

1578
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,920
we have provided to our donor class

1579
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:18,600
for this particular feature
by which I'm going to execute

1580
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:23,560
you have to search for the steps
which we have implemented or deployed

1581
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:27,320
for this particular feature
by this particular place.

1582
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:28,560
All right.

1583
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:33,080
We have to turn this double basin,
do anything on its own.

1584
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:36,200
It's all about the instructions,
the command

1585
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,280
vector to convert, then only to execute.

1586
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:46,640
Sort of good understood.

1587
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:50,040
So now now how
we provide this information,

1588
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,440
how we provide this information to.

1589
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,200
Our class C, that is a word.

1590
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,160
There is a word.

1591
01:35:57,160 --> 01:36:00,520
Let me first put a comma
if we are going to provide two things.

1592
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,920
First, we have to provide cover.

1593
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:05,760
I put call my here
and I'm going to write another word.

1594
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,440
Go blue.

1595
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:09,360
What?

1596
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,520
I'm going to radio this

1597
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,600
10 minutes, whatever written in blue

1598
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:18,960
and in this blue, in this blue,
I'm going to write

1599
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:22,800
the package name of Create My Steps.

1600
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:27,720
This is the name of my package
where I have all the definitions

1601
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:31,280
now. Understood
who was asking the question?

1602
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,400
Can we have multiple steps diminished?

1603
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:34,680
Maybe not.

1604
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,640
The then is

1605
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:38,600
correct

1606
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:43,040
now understood right then is see,
I still remember.

1607
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:49,160
So now here you see
when I provided this blue part two steps.

1608
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,760
This is steps. Now make it to work.

1609
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:55,080
Options will specifically begin,
but it's not good

1610
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:59,200
practice.

1611
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,360
It is a good practice.

1612
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:02,440
It is the best practice actually,
which we are doing.

1613
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:06,680
But particular steps for one particular
big for all great.

1614
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:11,040
All the steps classes
should be available inside one package.

1615
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:15,720
Okay, just the package index.

1616
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:16,800
In just the package

1617
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:18,800
you can consider, you

1618
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:22,960
can understand this example like this
in one rule, how many were regular

1619
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,840
for your clothes

1620
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,360
too? That's great.

1621
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,920
Then you have to create
two steps back. Just

1622
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,160
one rule one How many more should we have

1623
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,360
in one rule

1624
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:42,720
one? How many better to be here?

1625
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,880
What I at

1626
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Nice. And in this area.

1627
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,920
Then you should execute everything
from feature file only and

1628
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,440
are known as.

1629
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:56,760
You don't need to use glue multiple times.

1630
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:59,000
If you do it then it will be duplicate.

1631
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,240
You know, keyword error.
You will get here.

1632
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:03,120
So I'm not getting by.

1633
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:09,360
We use group deployments.

1634
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,840
The ladies is then I think you have
more experience than me in this part.

1635
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,600
I don't have even one word of my whole

1636
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,200
Got to go to everything.

1637
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:26,560
See, that's what I'm saying.

1638
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:32,240
These are
the options are providing correct?

1639
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:32,640
Correct.

1640
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:37,360
So when we provide the options
this features, this blue are the options.

1641
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,640
Don't tell me.

1642
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:40,440
Have you ever heard this word? No.

1643
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,600
Maybe in school.

1644
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,080
I mean, colleges, glue.

1645
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:44,680
Stick something.

1646
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:46,480
Alexi.

1647
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,480
Glue means to stick
something red to be used in particular.

1648
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:52,440
Jenny Step one

1649
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:53,480
component rate.

1650
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:58,200
We use this, we use it for
want to put things together, correct?

1651
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,240
To stick something. Why? To do better.

1652
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:04,720
Take this word like a bit big this word

1653
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,160
because it glued your steps
with your definitions,

1654
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:12,240
with your picture by a rate

1655
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:18,960
already is.

1656
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,720
When does the meaning of this word

1657
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:27,240
So now when you provide this option, blue
is equal to stitch than would happen.

1658
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:30,880
What will happen after this is see

1659
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,600
in your project.

1660
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,120
Let's say you have package one.

1661
01:39:37,120 --> 01:39:40,480
You have package to your package
three, package for eight

1662
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,000
and then you have in resources
folder and the resources features folder.

1663
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,640
And under this one
if to every so many points

1664
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,480
when you run class and you provided this

1665
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:55,880
blue keyword
for let's say will be for package, great.

1666
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,200
So it will not search
for this particular part.

1667
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,480
Search will narrow down to only before
and here only it will ask

1668
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:06,560
for all the implemented steps
in this particular push.

1669
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:12,440
Correct? Yes.

1670
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,960
Great. Great.

1671
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,200
Very good months. Good job.

1672
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:21,200
No, it is not a class in business
in this blue.

1673
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:25,520
When I provide the name of the package,
I have to provide not that class,

1674
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,600
but because in one package
I can have multiple.

1675
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,000
Like I said, according to this particular
portion, we are writing everything

1676
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:35,760
in different places

1677
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:42,120
where the basketball to one feature.

1678
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,440
That's what I'm going to explain.

1679
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:45,360
I'm going to spend the newspaper.

1680
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,800
Just give me a moment.

1681
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,680
First, let clear this
and then I will come to that point.

1682
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,600
It's not completely it's
just a starting read.

1683
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:58,320
So now see, this time what I'm saying
to my two options, my class.

1684
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,440
Then go and execute this log in feature.

1685
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:05,120
Now on two classes, remote classes.

1686
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:06,360
I do find any steps

1687
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:10,560
then this it or structured
under this particular package instance.

1688
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,320
Okay. Okay.

1689
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:22,080
This made me to me

1690
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,160
first

1691
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,480
to see what

1692
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:42,360
is working now.

1693
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:45,480
Working absolutely fine but from the
the class this pen

1694
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,160
now you see here but another class

1695
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,320
logging feature Well it admin logging

1696
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:56,000
now can you then you just connected
with the test and delivers

1697
01:41:56,240 --> 01:42:00,360
sort of first class in class method.

1698
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,840
Remember this kind of output
we generally get objects making steps.

1699
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,320
Correct?

1700
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:10,680
They remember interestingly,
when we were getting the results there,

1701
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:14,640
we were seeing the suit name and then
the class name and then the method name.

1702
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:17,520
Similarly,
we are having another plus inside end

1703
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:20,920
class, the feature of feature file inside
feature file.

1704
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,120
Which scenario get exactly.

1705
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:25,920
Okay, now
now let's do a little bit more here

1706
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:32,120
instead of this, I'm going to execute
this time employ such to check

1707
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:36,280
all the scenarios of my employee search,
whether it is executing or not.

1708
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:40,800
Okay, So I'm going to execute
all the scenarios from here.

1709
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,000
Let's go ahead and do it

1710
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:47,040
now, see if

1711
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:50,160
those in any ways can you see here
in the report it took two scenario

1712
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:53,880
search by 80 and search by me
in order to see one by one.

1713
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:56,560
It will execute both of them

1714
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,880
would happen.

1715
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,320
Application is burning slowly, I think.

1716
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:34,560
Yes, everyone is executing
when I execute, don't

1717
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,400
execute.

1718
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,840
Going to be correct there.

1719
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,440
No class is the very good part.

1720
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,240
But in that class, once I'm done

1721
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,360
with that in a class,
then you'll be just blown away

1722
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:48,760
in last batch.

1723
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:51,320
Also, what people generally do is
whenever I create,

1724
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,800
whenever I

1725
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:57,120
create their is this, I prepared

1726
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:00,560
their data ready to execute something.

1727
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:03,280
Now, like you genius,
they are also genius.

1728
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,800
They are also using the same this data.

1729
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,920
When I'm explaining before execution,

1730
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:11,200
everyone executes the scheme as data.

1731
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,920
Now whoever executed first
that is writable

1732
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:18,680
for others for others
it's the copied ones are spelled this.

1733
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:21,600
It ain't my best because it's not working.

1734
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,080
I didn't even execute
they just because already failed.

1735
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,080
And they're blaming like my best guess is

1736
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:31,320
that kind of intended intelligence level.

1737
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:37,480
I have to hand that something
like when we are executing, when executing

1738
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:40,800
something, they let me execute first
so that we won't face

1739
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:44,640
this much of the application
and then I will give you time to do this

1740
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,360
once I'm done with the class.

1741
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:50,880
All platforms yours,
go ahead and play with the application.

1742
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,360
24 seven

1743
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,560
But I know this explanation
is not going to work.

1744
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,040
People will execute.

1745
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:36,600
See a month exposed,

1746
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,840
no minds first execute, then explain

1747
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:41,760
what caused it.

1748
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,280
So it's working Great. Casey.

1749
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:50,640
Proud of you boys.

1750
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,040
Nasty

1751
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,560
work, but everybody in trouble right now.

1752
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,400
They executed.

1753
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,280
This is the name of my feature, correct?

1754
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:04,040
This is my feature

1755
01:46:04,040 --> 01:46:08,280
search employed a research employee
by name boat Best because this past

1756
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:09,720
place.

1757
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,280
Can you see what it says?

1758
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:13,680
Cost cutting.

1759
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,760
It means my runner class is working
absolutely fine

1760
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,640
now. The invention

1761
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:26,520
of creating the runner
class is to execute all their test cases

1762
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,560
on the feature files in a single track.

1763
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:34,200
This has been mentioned,
general looked and

1764
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:43,600
eliminated.

1765
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:46,880
This is their intention to execute
on their best guesses

1766
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:51,360
in a single shot.

1767
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:51,960
Fine.

1768
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:55,800
Now let's do just one modification here.

1769
01:46:56,760 --> 01:46:59,160
Instead of writing this employee
search card

1770
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:01,560
feature, just to keep it blank,

1771
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,600
just keep blank.

1772
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:06,880
Now, what happens when you keep a blank

1773
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,680
here like this

1774
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:14,520
when you provided the bot inside to see

1775
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:17,960
is the resources

1776
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,720
features mesh.

1777
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:24,840
It simply means under this folder,

1778
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,040
whatever the features you have, if two,

1779
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,440
three and four
and so on, it will take all the features,

1780
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:36,400
it will take

1781
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,720
all the features and execute
all of those features.

1782
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,480
The moment you provide just this slash.

1783
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,360
Now let me show you.

1784
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:47,520
Let me show you the moment

1785
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,280
I'm going to execute
with this normal slash, just a slash.

1786
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:53,680
I'm not going to provide
any part of any picture.

1787
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,960
I see.

1788
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,880
It took the first feature is start
executing the scenario.

1789
01:47:58,880 --> 01:47:59,880
Don't execute anything.

1790
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:08,800
Guys, please.

1791
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:09,360
I'm late.

1792
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,400
I think next time I will tell you that

1793
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:14,680
I'm going to explain
and I will simply execute.

1794
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,760
Now I have to make a trap based

1795
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,840
local from the work site.

1796
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,680
No. How would you complete the look then?

1797
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:40,920
There is more important
first scenario execute.

1798
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:41,280
Right?

1799
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,680
Both scenario execute

1800
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,240
this website.

1801
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,560
What can I say about this
particular website?

1802
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:56,680
Hundreds of people execute
hundreds of scenarios every day on this

1803
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,960
and this that state
simply saying yes, exactly.

1804
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:00,880
We available

1805
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,840
will double.

1806
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:13,480
This is the next website.

1807
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:19,600
But I think my explanation

1808
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:26,640
is that find

1809
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,960
now you'll see here

1810
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:34,440
you'll see your boss Lane
explains everything.

1811
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:36,360
You're so smart

1812
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:49,560
more time the current danger

1813
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:54,360
nasty guys then I executed
first it took this part Do you see?

1814
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,360
Let me close this

1815
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:00,960
Are these two feature minds I have read
The boss name is us.

1816
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,320
One, two, three, five Employs such.

1817
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:06,000
When I open this picture point,
I have two scenarios.

1818
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:09,080
You'll see it is executed.

1819
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:11,760
This is my log in feature inside
log in picture.

1820
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,240
I have this particular one scenario.

1821
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,240
It got executed. Correct.

1822
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,160
It means

1823
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,400
I really like pregnancy.

1824
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,320
Good schooling.

1825
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:27,000
What grade.

1826
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,120
You should excellent ABC.

1827
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:31,560
I will be here.

1828
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:36,840
Let's see.

1829
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,920
All right. Can you see guys

1830
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:40,760
this part?

1831
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:41,400
Right?

1832
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,960
So now we execute

1833
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:46,640
all of our feature files from here on.

1834
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,560
Correct?

1835
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,240
Correct.

1836
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:55,800
Ready to learn something interesting.

1837
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:01,000
Now, shall we proceed further?

1838
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,280
One mini question please
ask given if you are a micro question,

1839
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:06,560
people question it. No.

1840
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,280
Question Ask.

1841
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,320
Do we need a comma?

1842
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,560
Yes, sir, we need a comma.

1843
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,680
If they don't provide comma,
it will give us the error.

1844
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:16,480
See, it gives us the error.

1845
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:21,040
Can you see?

1846
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,280
All right, sir? You're most welcome.

1847
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,400
Fine features.

1848
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,080
We are

1849
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:33,080
are the ones I should write.

1850
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,800
It gives us the extension.

1851
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,480
Steps are missing.

1852
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,360
What actually are
The steps are not missing plane.

1853
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:43,440
So like I said, in automation,
we have to tell everything to do

1854
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,320
but is not very smart. Right?

1855
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:50,280
So to ask us it, okay, if
I'm going to execute this feature, fine.

1856
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,560
Where should I find this type definition?

1857
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:57,000
So wait, you have to find
all the step definitions inside.

1858
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:02,560
This is steps and we use this where to use
implements to stick something.

1859
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:05,160
So stick something means what is detour?

1860
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:09,200
Step the Venetians with your feature
and that's what we provide in general

1861
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:14,360
plus is an auction of cucumber and so
it is going to execute and this could not

1862
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:20,440
Yes, yes.

1863
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:21,680
Correct. Correct.

1864
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:23,880
That's what
we are going to translation see

1865
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:26,920
so far

1866
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:29,880
what is happening is see so
but what is happening?

1867
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,520
Let's see.

1868
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:34,960
I'm going to implement another scenario
in my logic, Right.

1869
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:52,480
I'm going
write another thing here in my body.

1870
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,440
I'm going to create another scenario
where I should think

1871
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:59,840
if we take any scenario for error
verification.

1872
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:04,200
All right,

1873
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:09,000
or any scenario for normal user,
we have one user like this.

1874
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,600
See, where is this?

1875
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:13,720
We have one user, correct?

1876
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,120
This is my enemy user.

1877
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:17,920
We can have another normal user.

1878
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:32,520
Also, let me show you what is that user?

1879
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:36,960
So my another user name would be g
H, Johnny one,

1880
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:39,600
two, three, four, 5640.

1881
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:50,240
This is in
the password would be 6125312344.

1882
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:54,520
I will share this username password
also with invalid credentials. Well

1883
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:02,840
one, 2345600.

1884
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,040
Then it would be

1885
01:54:06,760 --> 01:54:17,400
fix for.

1886
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,960
Let me create another user.

1887
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:22,400
No issues in me

1888
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:32,840
and truly

1889
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,440
let me create user for this batch.

1890
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:40,680
So I'm going to take name is Z.

1891
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:43,960
My initial would be Zetia

1892
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:48,000
and the last is

1893
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:51,960
the one and it's exclude

1894
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,800
the mark.

1895
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,360
Fine.

1896
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:58,680
And this is the employee 80

1897
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:02,080
degree same the state employee

1898
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:05,040
state.

1899
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,840
Now we added this employee

1900
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,000
current

1901
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:21,400
where

1902
01:55:22,200 --> 01:55:24,840
the username and password I forgot to wait

1903
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:29,280
I'm going to take this as

1904
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:35,480
in order

1905
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:42,880
when he was sending.

1906
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,200
It's data.

1907
01:55:44,200 --> 01:55:49,280
11234.

1908
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,560
It's not making find issues.

1909
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:52,680
Let's do one thing first.

1910
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:57,080
Liquidate the scenario sign
with great scenario valid

1911
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,880
is this nugget.

1912
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:03,200
When I say easiest login,
it simply means a normal user.

1913
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:07,240
Okay.

1914
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:10,080
Now when as a normal user,
it means once you log in

1915
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:13,840
with your admin user,
you get all the admin bugs and everything.

1916
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,440
So next time
I want to use as a normal user.

1917
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:19,000
So there I need SS logging user. Fine.

1918
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:22,680
So I'm going to take given the user is

1919
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:29,160
user is never Chatham's application.

1920
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:31,680
My first step would be same fragrance,

1921
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:35,160
but the change would be here
on my second step.

1922
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:37,080
So I'm going great

1923
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:41,480
and user interface valid.

1924
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:46,320
E is this username and password correct

1925
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:51,880
categories.

1926
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:53,440
Is this correct?

1927
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:54,720
Students

1928
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:57,120
Fine.

1929
01:56:57,480 --> 01:56:58,320
And then simple.

1930
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,720
The user clicks on log in,

1931
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:03,280
then successfully log in
and close the browser.

1932
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:07,680
I'm not going to edify anything
so I'm just going to keep things like this

1933
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:11,040
because I know
intention is to create something else.

1934
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,880
That's one.

1935
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:16,440
Find close the browser now
see what is happening.

1936
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:19,240
When I'm when I want to create this step

1937
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:23,880
first, I have to be in the bane
of executing the complete scenario.

1938
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:27,360
So whatever that is steps are available
before

1939
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:29,920
before the step which is unimplemented.

1940
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:35,200
All these steps will execute and then only
it will give me this particular path.

1941
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:38,360
Getting.

1942
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,040
But it

1943
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,320
for example, in this feature future,

1944
01:57:43,320 --> 01:57:47,320
if I come in, if I execute this valid
as this log in, so what does that mean?

1945
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:51,800
First,
it will open the browser unnecessarily.

1946
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,360
It will launch that you wanted

1947
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,640
and then only it will give me this

1948
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:02,520
a step.

1949
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,720
It will give you the missing step point
I got.

1950
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:07,280
The missing is
I don't need this as of now.

1951
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:08,160
Right.

1952
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:11,280
I really could.

1953
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:11,960
You coming?

1954
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:14,400
What is this abbreviation
means it's a normal.

1955
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:18,200
Use it as a sprint for normal user.

1956
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:18,760
All right.

1957
01:58:18,760 --> 01:58:21,000
We call it
the user's username. It's Just a moment.

1958
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,080
That is not full formal basis, but yes,

1959
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:26,160
it is. Easiest, simple.

1960
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:26,880
Fine.

1961
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:31,800
Now, guys, see, right now I am having
just one or two lines in this scenario.

1962
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,200
Again, even

1963
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:37,960
if I have one or two lines
or just taking some time, just imagine

1964
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:41,960
the scenario where I would be having to be
in or 20 lines in the future.

1965
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:42,480
Right?

1966
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:46,960
And then on the 22nd line
I am on, it will give you the missing step

1967
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:52,040
and then it will I want to implement
the steps for would the second one

1968
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,040
then do I have that much of time
to execute 21 steps unnecessarily

1969
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:59,640
and then to get the code when 22nd step

1970
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:05,320
is? Think about the big scenario.

1971
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:06,120
We don't have that.

1972
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:10,840
Which of got it
then what is be working on for this.

1973
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:13,480
So overseas we have been working on

1974
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:22,000
based on

1975
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:26,520
the information, the code
which are going to add now,

1976
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:31,680
it will take only those steps
which are unimplemented.

1977
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:37,080
It will give you the definition only
for those steps which are unimplemented.

1978
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:40,160
Once you are going to implement
that steps,

1979
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:44,600
once you're done with the implementation
of those steps, then only it will execute

1980
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:50,040
your quite understood.

1981
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:51,560
And let's put this

1982
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:54,120
let's do it

1983
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:55,200
first.

1984
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:59,000
Go into your class, go to another plus.

1985
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:04,320
Another important point
which we are going to add here is

1986
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:08,160
is desired, is

1987
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:12,040
command going to try to

1988
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:16,680
create.

1989
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:20,320
Now see, I'm going to add one by one
all the information

1990
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:24,520
features, right?

1991
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,040
We use

1992
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,480
to provide

1993
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:31,840
the path of

1994
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:37,000
all the feature.

1995
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:42,720
Then you

1996
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:47,080
is this where we find

1997
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,240
implementations for

1998
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:54,520
all the

1999
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,320
steps.

2000
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:58,920
So here,

2001
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:01,320
here we provide

2002
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:06,280
on the

2003
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:08,680
auto package

2004
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:12,960
where be find

2005
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:16,440
on this

2006
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:21,080
device is this information helpful.

2007
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,880
What I'm getting in there in a class
so that next time

2008
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:28,320
when you devise it,
you will get this information. Okay

2009
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:31,920
now for trial.

2010
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,040
See, it is giving me two options.

2011
02:01:34,040 --> 02:01:35,640
Again, it would make it right.

2012
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:38,400
And by default it says it is false.

2013
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:42,480
And then
if I keep it false, what would happen?

2014
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:47,320
See, it is great
if I keep it true, then only it does not.

2015
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:47,920
I'm telling you.

2016
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:51,600
What is the meaning of this false
First, let's make it false.

2017
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:55,120
What is happening here

2018
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:57,360
Now? Let's see.

2019
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:59,720
Have implemented unimplemented state.

2020
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:03,200
It might be just like correct

2021
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:04,920
coordinates.

2022
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:07,520
I want unimplemented
the steps in my feature by

2023
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:10,520
I don't know in which feature file.

2024
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:15,240
I have unimplemented steps because
internet class and providing the model

2025
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:16,440
features.

2026
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:19,400
Let's say I didn't reach feature base
in every region.

2027
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:24,720
I have ten scenarios so only not
I have not use grade in hundred scenarios.

2028
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:28,080
Maybe I have 500 steps in those 500 steps.

2029
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:31,600
I really don't know which one is
implemented and which one is unemployed.

2030
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:35,520
Cutting And to be honest,
if you are working with AJ,

2031
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:39,720
you do not have that much of time
to go and check all of these things

2032
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:41,280
manually, right?

2033
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:45,480
So you have to implement your code
in such a way that your code will scan.

2034
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,520
Can you stand here? You log in, feature

2035
02:02:49,840 --> 02:02:51,960
man, it's already in

2036
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,200
data, possibly.

2037
02:02:55,200 --> 02:02:57,000
Did you check? Did

2038
02:02:57,160 --> 02:02:59,040
I just read one step?

2039
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,440
I just did one step.

2040
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:03,840
Did you take the of digit code
from my good

2041
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:06,800
digit one?

2042
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:07,880
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2043
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,720
I'm going to upgrade this code
in the good again.

2044
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:13,960
Not really.

2045
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:17,120
So here this is the one line just
I did just one make.

2046
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,960
Okay I didn't do anything else.

2047
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:22,680
So guys
see I don't have that much of time.

2048
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:25,040
Do a scan and verify the things manually.

2049
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:26,200
Correct.

2050
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:28,880
That's why

2051
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:33,400
in the middle class I am providing dry
and there is a bag called.

2052
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:35,080
Right. And what does it mean, dry it?

2053
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:40,880
And the first thing it does
when you make it to the menu

2054
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:43,040
by default, it is poised.

2055
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,120
By default, it is display false.

2056
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:48,240
But when you make it do the first thing

2057
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:51,480
it does, it is stops your actual execution

2058
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:55,320
based.

2059
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,920
Please, please don't. Right.

2060
02:03:56,920 --> 02:03:59,040
When I'm explaining something to this
damn import

2061
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:01,400
the code you can always get
from the repository.

2062
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,280
These were the by value.

2063
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,640
Keep pushing yourself
on writing the code businessman.

2064
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:07,280
It was doing right.

2065
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:09,560
If I'm explaining something,
it is important here.

2066
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:11,960
In the end, the thing which you will get.

2067
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,600
You're putting your time there. Please.

2068
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:18,520
This part
when I say client is equals to do

2069
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:22,160
it means the first thing it does it stops.

2070
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:24,600
You're actually execution.

2071
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:27,200
What does it mean, actually execution?

2072
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:30,240
If you keep executing, you're in lost

2073
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:33,360
by taking this as drive
and is equal to blue.

2074
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:36,480
It will not open your browser

2075
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:37,200
on it.

2076
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,600
It will not execute.

2077
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:46,440
It needs to actually stops by it
quickly, scans all the steps

2078
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:50,520
that you have, all the feature phones
that you have, and it will change.

2079
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:54,480
It will is again, whether all the
steps are implemented or not.

2080
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:56,920
The moment you make

2081
02:04:56,920 --> 02:04:59,840
it right, it is equals to do it again

2082
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:03,960
through all the beach it applies and check
which steps we have implemented,

2083
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:07,800
which is steps
you did completely alright based on that.

2084
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:12,320
So if one step was not implemented,
it wouldn't know.

2085
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:16,320
Even if all the steps implemented,
it will not do that.

2086
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,120
So I recorded Brian Unger.

2087
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:19,840
I will show you which we wrote.

2088
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:21,880
We the moment you made it through.

2089
02:05:22,120 --> 02:05:23,840
Like I said, it stops.

2090
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:26,120
You're actually execution now.

2091
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:28,200
There is no actual execution, right?

2092
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:31,400
It will just the of save

2093
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:34,280
every single step in your steps package

2094
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:37,560
already.

2095
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,800
That's what I'm saying.
There's what I'm explaining. Great.

2096
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:43,960
If you had 500 steps and you don't know
how many steps you have implemented

2097
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,800
and you need the body of those
steps, how would you do that?

2098
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:48,400
Do it.

2099
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:50,920
Either you do it manually or you make it.

2100
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,520
It is equal to to.

2101
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:54,560
If you make it read, it is equal to two.

2102
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:58,480
It will give you these step definitions
how I show you not see

2103
02:05:59,800 --> 02:06:02,240
I made it right and is equal to true.

2104
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:05,200
I know I have
what is the unimplemented in my log

2105
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:07,720
in feature, right?

2106
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:09,760
Correct. Correct.

2107
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:14,120
So now you see now
you see if I had run here from the note

2108
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:18,040
plus what it had what it is happening

2109
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:24,760
did it executed search employee
by eighties search employed by me

2110
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:26,720
did it executed

2111
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:29,280
it did what is it

2112
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:32,480
gives you rate is a big year

2113
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:36,720
did it execute this very log
in very long in no detail secured

2114
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:39,800
or it didn't I got this right in here

2115
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:43,680
this one I got right
as of read my because it says

2116
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:47,840
this is it is unimplemented.

2117
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,960
This step is unimplemented.

2118
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,000
So it shows us what's wrong. Got it.

2119
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:54,520
Got it.

2120
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,440
Now, let me copy this.

2121
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:57,560
Let me show you once again.

2122
02:06:57,560 --> 02:06:59,880
Let me copy this a step. Right.

2123
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:04,760
And because this is a part of my log
in, so I'm simply writing in logging

2124
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:07,520
rate, simply in logging.

2125
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,960
I'm not writing any code.

2126
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:11,600
Any code as of now, I'm not writing.

2127
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:15,200
I'm simply doing it here and that's it.

2128
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:15,640
Basically.

2129
02:07:17,080 --> 02:07:18,600
Now. Now

2130
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:22,720
all of my steps implemented,

2131
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:26,480
all of my steps implemented this to

2132
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:30,000
let me go to management last again,

2133
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,760
let me go to the classic

2134
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:33,960
environment.

2135
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:38,720
Plus here, if you see great environment
plus here, what I'm doing is

2136
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:41,160
keeping client is equals to do

2137
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:45,440
what I still do

2138
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,280
and this time if I try to run

2139
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:54,560
again,

2140
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:57,920
no actual execution, but it gives me 40

2141
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:01,320
for every single scenario
it is giving me big.

2142
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:02,920
What does it mean?

2143
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:07,840
It quickly scaled all the steps
that I be in my feature file.

2144
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:12,680
It found the steps
for every single feature funny, right?

2145
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,880
Everything is fine this way.

2146
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:19,200
It is giving me on the same rate
instead of 15 seconds.

2147
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,000
Correct.

2148
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,840
So now first thing what it does, it
quickly checks.

2149
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:29,200
Second thing, it saves your time
that you are spending unnecessary.

2150
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:30,760
You executing those.

2151
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:32,680
Let me get you
to a gentleman's application,

2152
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:36,080
launching the app providing the user.

2153
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:36,480
Right.

2154
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:39,560
So now your time sealing part.

2155
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:43,800
Understood.

2156
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:45,720
Is it best thing to implement?

2157
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:47,200
Is this thing to implement?

2158
02:08:47,200 --> 02:08:48,160
I still

2159
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:55,480
it is right

2160
02:08:57,040 --> 02:08:59,080
now. See now see this time

2161
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:02,400
let me put it here.

2162
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:05,640
Enforced the definition of this.

2163
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:09,240
If we did it to do

2164
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:14,160
it really

2165
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,240
quickly, it's game All good again.

2166
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:24,080
All good steps.

2167
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:26,440
Whether they are

2168
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:34,240
implemented or not. Why?

2169
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:36,040
We didn't start with that nozzle.

2170
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:36,680
That's why.

2171
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:39,040
Boss, delete you to the problems.

2172
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:40,440
They will give you the solutions.

2173
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:44,400
If we just give you the solutions,
you will never think of the problems.

2174
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,040
Right?

2175
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:47,680
So first show you the problem and then

2176
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:53,600
we never did the solutions and didn't

2177
02:09:53,600 --> 02:09:56,400
unless we realized the problem

2178
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:57,760
later.

2179
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,240
Global warming.

2180
02:09:59,240 --> 02:10:02,840
Now, when we are facing the problem,
we realize the actual value

2181
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:06,560
of pure oxygen or the value that

2182
02:10:07,680 --> 02:10:09,000
similarly in of course,

2183
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,600
also once we introduce you the problem
and then we give you the solution.

2184
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:17,280
So next time, if you encounter
because it will never be white or black,

2185
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:18,280
it will always be

2186
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:21,360
when you go in, you're being practical
like Bill always is problems,

2187
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:24,000
and then you should know
how to get rid of those problems.

2188
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,480
That's why intentionally we right
we create this curriculum in such a way

2189
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:39,720
that you are not only the solutions,
but also with the problems.

2190
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:40,600
Great.

2191
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:43,120
Fine case. Second point here.

2192
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:44,040
Right.

2193
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:47,680
Second point, if

2194
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:54,120
it is set to say to do it

2195
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:56,920
starts

2196
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:01,040
actual execution.

2197
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:03,680
If it is good, it stops actual execution.

2198
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:04,920
Understood.

2199
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:08,640
Now to execute my best
guess is what I have to do.

2200
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,880
I have to make it false

2201
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:14,280
right now.

2202
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:17,000
When I make it false, this time

2203
02:11:17,160 --> 02:11:21,280
it will execute because now
my actual execution will be as it's

2204
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:25,680
the moment
it true my actual execution stops later.

2205
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:26,440
I need

2206
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:52,920
Let's run.

2207
02:11:52,920 --> 02:12:00,560
See it's working point correct.

2208
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:02,480
It is today's

2209
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:10,520
all it to
because it's not executing flawlessly.

2210
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:13,680
Right. Just one command.
We need to provide.

2211
02:12:13,680 --> 02:12:15,320
It is going to execute.

2212
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:18,160
This is what we call
magic the nation right.

2213
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,360
We declared destiny to take minute.

2214
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:23,280
Now we are making it more easy in there.

2215
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:25,080
We need to include bag rate.

2216
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,520
The methods include exclude categories.

2217
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,400
So many things.

2218
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:28,800
Right?

2219
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,960
Class name became named world class name.

2220
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:32,880
There is no such kind.

2221
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:35,520
Provide the path of feature point

2222
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,800
we can call when the execution

2223
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:41,800
all and has the power
to stop indication order.

2224
02:12:42,240 --> 02:12:43,200
I mean execution.

2225
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:45,600
Yet Bryan has the power rate

2226
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:48,360
it is two is it gives me
or we can call the execution

2227
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:53,160
amount murder to be execution
rate going is in you can call it

2228
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:57,000
when you said try it on is it going to
do is what we call quick scan

2229
02:12:58,280 --> 02:12:59,120
or rate

2230
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:06,520
for request

2231
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:14,760
the any question?

2232
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:15,160
No, no, no.

2233
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:16,560
I'm your only

2234
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:21,560
call rate angelica

2235
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:24,480
record is you regarding it is

2236
02:13:24,480 --> 02:13:27,040
going to be fine

2237
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:31,080
a lot of lot of things
a lot of things are going

2238
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:39,640
a lot of things are coming on the
we don't worry about it case.

2239
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:41,160
So so far so good.

2240
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:57,360
Everyone.

2241
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:58,720
Yes. Okay.

2242
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:03,160
Now see now
see intentionally, intentionally.

2243
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:08,720
I'm going to execute
just one particular log in feature rate.

2244
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:11,160
One particular feature different

2245
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,800
Nikola by your code is not running.

2246
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:21,640
Did you take the origin code
from my repository?

2247
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:23,920
Let me just add this to code

2248
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:32,040
also first, where does getting digit
audio steps will work?

2249
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:33,400
It is a guarantee.

2250
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:35,280
That's why it is a scanning. First.

2251
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,240
It will make sure that

2252
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:40,080
every single step is implemented
and then only it will execute.

2253
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:44,560
What rate?

2254
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:45,600
So let me push on.

2255
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:47,080
So this code

2256
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:50,280
in middle of the class also, right.

2257
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:52,760
And try to fix it during way.

2258
02:14:52,760 --> 02:14:55,640
But that's when void forces by default.

2259
02:14:55,640 --> 02:14:55,840
Right.

2260
02:14:55,840 --> 02:15:00,200
If we want to actually execute on code,
then we have to make it false.

2261
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:04,240
So whenever see
what is the standard procedure first,

2262
02:15:04,520 --> 02:15:08,560
whenever it does tinetti
just to make it clear that it is equal to

2263
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:12,400
when you make this right
and is equal to true equivalence

2264
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:16,640
and gives you on this to finishes
right in case if you miss

2265
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,560
one stick definition again running
it will give you

2266
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:22,920
it gives you all the experience,
all the sticks implemented.

2267
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:26,160
It gives you an
is this a dead step implemented?

2268
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:35,280
Then make it right
it is a good is an execution.

2269
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:39,840
It works and it works well enough to do
the implementation bullshit.

2270
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,240
Right. So first

2271
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,560
what Brennan's straight.

2272
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:45,120
The moment you make it draw

2273
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:48,640
it checks this this depth
along with this particular linking.

2274
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:49,640
Right.

2275
02:15:49,640 --> 02:15:53,760
So linking of your by the steps
with your step definitions.

2276
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:56,880
Right.

2277
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,240
Got it. Got it.

2278
02:15:58,240 --> 02:16:01,560
So it works on linking all the links.

2279
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:04,560
It should check if link is available.

2280
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,040
Connect if is not available.

2281
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:11,160
Not getting paid
and not only not getting it

2282
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:14,520
link is not available if is incorrect
and also it gives you the link.

2283
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:23,320
Then go ahead and put this
particular stitch to create a link.

2284
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:26,240
Connect your linking checks.
Correct. Linking checks.

2285
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:29,240
Connect these two things
good and is linking check

2286
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:33,360
not the code which we have written
inside this obviously great.

2287
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:37,280
Not not not therefore
that we have couple of assertions

2288
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:41,480
right for that we have so many things in
we skip of feature points.

2289
02:16:41,640 --> 02:16:44,320
Yes ma'am we can
we can I'm coming to that point

2290
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:47,600
also don't put I'm
coming to that point right

2291
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:51,960
fine so far so good.

2292
02:16:51,960 --> 02:16:54,680
Let's discuss one more tag. Right.

2293
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:57,400
We discussed features so far.

2294
02:16:57,400 --> 02:17:01,760
We discussed glue so far,
we discussed thread and so far.

2295
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:05,760
All right, let's discuss one more day
and then we'll take a break

2296
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:08,840
so that you can digest this part.

2297
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:11,440
Okay? Exclaimed

2298
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:13,320
Now. Now,

2299
02:17:13,320 --> 02:17:16,120
when I actually execute this part, I see.

2300
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:18,480
When I actually execute.

2301
02:17:18,480 --> 02:17:26,400
Remember this?

2302
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,840
Obviously I show obviously

2303
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:32,920
how the locators syntax will work on
Google page.

2304
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:38,280
It's a common sense.

2305
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:43,240
So now see here, right now, right now
in this console,

2306
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,640
I am having a lot of information
available.

2307
02:17:46,640 --> 02:17:47,360
Correct.

2308
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:50,840
Some of you guys are having
more information,

2309
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,480
some unreadable
getting to right in So many things.

2310
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:56,760
So many things you will get.

2311
02:17:56,760 --> 02:17:58,960
Mine is pretty much clear, right?

2312
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:02,040
Mine is pretty much clear.

2313
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:05,280
But actually, actually,
when you actually execute it,

2314
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:10,760
you get a lot of information and majority
of that information is just irrelevant.

2315
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:15,320
That It tell me honestly,
if you get a lot of information in person,

2316
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:18,840
how many information you read,
only one or two lines.

2317
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:20,680
You don't really complete information.

2318
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:23,680
Correct. Correctly.

2319
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:27,440
You you don't really complete information.

2320
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:30,480
Right. Exactly.

2321
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:31,960
So Now,

2322
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:35,840
now you'll see
everyone here is waiting for me.

2323
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:36,600
Correct.

2324
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:38,600
So now see here what I'm going to do.

2325
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:42,480
I'm going to add
another deck called Monaco,

2326
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:46,160
and I'm setting it to two.

2327
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:50,880
Monaco is equals two to the moment.

2328
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:55,800
The moment I added
this particular Monaco is equal to blue.

2329
02:18:56,400 --> 02:19:00,480
It simply means that it will remove

2330
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:05,480
all the unreadable and irrelevant
information from the console.

2331
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:09,520
Keeps your console clean easily. It.

2332
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:14,120
So if there is any any unreadable
character or any relevant information

2333
02:19:14,360 --> 02:19:17,760
coming
while executing the code in your console,

2334
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:21,880
it will remove all that information
when you make Monaco.

2335
02:19:21,880 --> 02:19:27,560
Is it going to do it is true,

2336
02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:33,120
since my console is already clear, it's
not going to remove anything Anything.

2337
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:34,040
But let's do it.

2338
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:37,040
Let's execute
with this monochrome equals to proposed.

2339
02:19:38,840 --> 02:19:40,520
So if in your console, if it

2340
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:44,560
is having a lot of information,
a lot of information which is not good

2341
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:49,320
or which is error limit read,
we're going to use that word also.

2342
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:51,000
But it is also coming.

2343
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:54,400
There is another keyword called Pretty,
which we are going to use don't with

2344
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:59,400
another word, which
we are going to use this pretty soon.

2345
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:00,680
Soon it will come.

2346
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:01,200
All right.

2347
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:04,120
Now see, it got executed. Okay.

2348
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:08,000
Since the information
since the information is very limited.

2349
02:20:08,480 --> 02:20:09,080
Right.

2350
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:12,240
It is giving me all this being
so not any unreadable.

2351
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:14,240
Correct. That is a limited information

2352
02:20:14,240 --> 02:20:17,440
only the relevant information
it will give you here.

2353
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:23,320
All right.

2354
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:25,640
Well, replaced

2355
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:26,880
with the

2356
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:29,480
like.

2357
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:31,240
So far, so good.

2358
02:20:31,720 --> 02:20:36,120
So far, so good.

2359
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:38,760
Great, great, great.

2360
02:20:38,760 --> 02:20:41,040
Let's take a break for 15 minutes.

2361
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,200
Read again.

2362
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:46,440
It'll be a smooth transition for 15
minutes and after 15 minutes will connect.

2363
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:47,440
Right.

2364
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:50,160
And then I'll give you a break
for 5 minutes in between

2365
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:52,760
and after that revamp of the class. Okay.

2366
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:53,800
All right

2367
02:20:55,520 --> 02:21:01,200
so okay, so far.

2368
02:21:01,440 --> 02:21:08,080
Today's so far, so good.

2369
02:21:08,080 --> 02:21:15,440
Is there anyone who didn't understand
anything?

2370
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:16,360
Nice? Nice.

2371
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:19,680
So let's take a break for 15 minutes
right after we connect.

2372
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:26,160
Once again, race.

2373
02:21:26,160 --> 02:21:30,200
All right, So let's start now.

2374
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:33,320
Jimi's is asking, can you please
explain briefly

2375
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:37,960
simple language I'm using

2376
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:40,320
by default, dry is false

2377
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:43,200
when I'm saying by default, right?

2378
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:43,840
It is false.

2379
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:47,120
It means it's not going to impact on
anything

2380
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:52,520
on your normal execution
by adding a correct.

2381
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:54,600
It's not going to mean
it's not going to affect

2382
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:57,080
on your execution portion
when it is false.

2383
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:01,160
But when you make it true,

2384
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:03,280
it is your actual execution.

2385
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:07,120
Why it stops your actual execution,

2386
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:10,400
because instead of execution, your screen

2387
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:14,760
rate, instead of your executing
your actual script,

2388
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:18,600
what it does this time, it will simply

2389
02:22:19,120 --> 02:22:24,480
is take all of your steps
it will simply scan all of your steps.

2390
02:22:25,360 --> 02:22:33,920
All right.

2391
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:39,080
And it is going to pick quickly is against
or look at the steps read,

2392
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:41,680
but it quickly begins all of your steps.

2393
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:44,000
It will check
whether we just did was implemented

2394
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:45,880
which respect is not implemented.

2395
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:50,600
If any is is not implemented, it will give
you the step definition of that one.

2396
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:53,240
You can simply edit
in unit step definition, but

2397
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:57,840
if every step is implemented,
it will give you all the dream extension

2398
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:00,600
and would not

2399
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:03,280
try to invoice

2400
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:06,360
months.

2401
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,360
You're most welcome, sir.

2402
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:12,800
Now here

2403
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:16,280
here when I'm writing

2404
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:20,440
monochrome is it was to do so what it does

2405
02:23:20,440 --> 02:23:23,520
basically right it

2406
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,480
it needs

2407
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:30,080
the console to

2408
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:34,360
output for the timber

2409
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:39,560
test right is having some

2410
02:23:40,880 --> 02:23:43,200
irrelevant information

2411
02:23:45,800 --> 02:23:51,480
then we set it to go through

2412
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:54,360
it simply.

2413
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:56,600
It simply removes

2414
02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:01,200
all the information,
all the or I should read.

2415
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:08,680
It simply removes
all the irrelevant, irrelevant information

2416
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:12,200
from the console, from the console

2417
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:15,640
underscore always monochrome is equals

2418
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:16,560
to blue

2419
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:37,600
student.

2420
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:40,560
Now let's talk about
another keyword trade.

2421
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:44,720
Whether it is now actually
the Stuart is no more applicable

2422
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:49,040
and it is deprecated right but
just for the information point of view,

2423
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:52,040
I'm explaining you this keyword we call it

2424
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:55,680
is three is equal to two by default.

2425
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:57,720
This is trade said to do.

2426
02:24:58,680 --> 02:24:59,480
Okay.

2427
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:03,560
So when we say string is said to do,
what does it mean?

2428
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:09,080
See, it is simply
you can see right simply you can see

2429
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:11,400
it is alternative to your grain.

2430
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:17,880
What is it?

2431
02:25:17,880 --> 02:25:19,400
What is it case?

2432
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:23,320
It is simply sorry of people stain or suit

2433
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:27,320
for sake of this data. This

2434
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:33,720
if by September

2435
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:37,760
15, 16 hours every day.

2436
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:40,120
I can't imagine why I said
that I would be up to that

2437
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:49,160
memo.

2438
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:52,080
It's monochrome, not nano chrome.

2439
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:53,400
It's a spending mistake.

2440
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:55,160
Please check your spending.

2441
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:57,480
That's why I always said

2442
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:02,880
I got a blank 22 again.

2443
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:05,480
Yeah, I'm coming to that point.

2444
02:26:05,480 --> 02:26:06,200
I'm coming to that.

2445
02:26:06,200 --> 02:26:11,280
When I did come to point, it's Monaco.

2446
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:15,400
Renee, please take the city

2447
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:18,880
now. Now here

2448
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:21,120
is is equals.

2449
02:26:21,120 --> 02:26:24,640
Strict rule is simply an alternative

2450
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:27,400
is simply an alternative to your driver

2451
02:26:28,200 --> 02:26:31,240
word writing those random checks limit

2452
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:37,080
all of your steps are actually implemented
or not correct?

2453
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:37,440
Correct.

2454
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:42,920
This indicates the implementation
estimate of all distance trained similarly

2455
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:47,200
similarly when we talk about is trip
is equals to blue, right?

2456
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:51,320
What it does then you actually executes

2457
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:54,840
when you actually execute your best guess.

2458
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:55,840
Right.

2459
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:59,280
It checks all the skips,
which is undefined, which is different.

2460
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:03,440
That's why the main reason
for making it deprecated we already have.

2461
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:03,800
Right.

2462
02:27:03,800 --> 02:27:07,800
And that's why we don't need a strict
Is it super understood.

2463
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:11,520
That is the main reason why we don't need

2464
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:14,880
a strict is equals to true
because we already have Brian

2465
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:17,040
understood.

2466
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:19,920
I understood

2467
02:27:22,280 --> 02:27:24,760
the simple way to have

2468
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:27,720
the method is of same color
but didn't make any sense.

2469
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:29,120
Remove it.

2470
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:34,040
Fine. Now.

2471
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:36,400
Now let me do another important thing
here.

2472
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:37,480
Cutting

2473
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:41,800
so far even Brian is equal to false.

2474
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:43,120
Yes Right?

2475
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:46,280
And is equal to false now as well
because we are actually executing.

2476
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:50,040
When you want to execute your best guesses
you have to make

2477
02:27:50,040 --> 02:27:52,400
Drennan is equal to false.

2478
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:56,720
When want to check all of your steps
are implemented or not, you have to wait.

2479
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:58,680
Brennan is equal to two.

2480
02:27:58,680 --> 02:28:01,080
I made this point
it would be easier to do.

2481
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:04,640
It stops action execution train.

2482
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:08,560
So to perform actual execution,
we have to make it false.

2483
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:12,120
Okay, let me write it.

2484
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:17,120
Execute script.

2485
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:18,360
It should be

2486
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:25,840
to make hard decision.

2487
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:26,960
It's not a solution.

2488
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,560
It has nothing to do with the assertion.

2489
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:30,680
So please just check the definition.

2490
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:33,720
But yes, just for a memory purpose
if you want to.

2491
02:28:33,720 --> 02:28:37,320
Related with those such in part
you can write,

2492
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:41,520
but a is a completely different topic
that we're going to work on here.

2493
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:42,000
Okay.

2494
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:46,240
Related to the fidelity to the steps,
you can say the position,

2495
02:28:46,240 --> 02:28:49,200
but for the good
we will use separate part of positions

2496
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:58,680
already.

2497
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:09,400
All right, everyone,

2498
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:14,920
for now.

2499
02:29:14,920 --> 02:29:17,640
Now what I'm going to do is

2500
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:20,760
I'm going to more clarification Blue

2501
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:27,120
mode.

2502
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:35,400
If I am me, it is optional.

2503
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:37,960
Unable to

2504
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:50,600
answer your second question first.

2505
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:51,200
I don't know.

2506
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:55,000
Eleanor, can you please put it in
your syntax support so that they will see?

2507
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,520
I'm pretty sure this would be very added.

2508
02:29:57,520 --> 02:30:01,560
What I can see you can be stood there
and then you will see that from the

2509
02:30:13,560 --> 02:30:14,120
front.

2510
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:16,680
So now
I will answer to your first question.

2511
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:22,000
When we were actually executing our
find it from here, Peter quite straight,

2512
02:30:22,320 --> 02:30:25,480
it was taking the code,
so linking was available from here.

2513
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:26,880
Correct.

2514
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:30,480
But when you go with that, a class
so it has nothing to do,

2515
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:33,800
it has nothing to do with the linking
of your feature point, how

2516
02:30:33,800 --> 02:30:37,600
the feature file is linking
with your steps here.

2517
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:40,080
It will ask for the specific things.

2518
02:30:40,080 --> 02:30:45,120
For example, it is asking you to execute
which one particular be jumped, right?

2519
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:48,640
Similarly,
it will ask you for where to find steps

2520
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:51,480
grade to make your search narrower.

2521
02:30:51,800 --> 02:30:54,240
It is asking everything is specifically.

2522
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:56,080
These are two different things.

2523
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:59,040
So it is not optional. It is not optional.

2524
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:02,000
It is mainly predictive
to provide the blue party.

2525
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:02,760
Okay.

2526
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:04,480
If you don't provide a blue pass,

2527
02:31:04,480 --> 02:31:08,360
remember we had to stick with Venetians,
but still we were not able to execute.

2528
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:09,720
Right?

2529
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:12,600
So Blue Point is my decree
we have to keep.

2530
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:13,080
Right.

2531
02:31:13,080 --> 02:31:16,040
If you don't put this blue bar
and you showed this code

2532
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:20,160
to a technical architect, it won't work.

2533
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:24,000
Public cluster extends loading steps.

2534
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:27,120
Oh, Login is steps.

2535
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:29,680
Why you want to extend
log initiatives here and

2536
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:34,040
what log instances to do here.

2537
02:31:34,120 --> 02:31:34,800
Tell me one thing.

2538
02:31:34,800 --> 02:31:41,600
What we have been logging is steps.

2539
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:43,200
Yeah. So that's what I'm asking. Alex.

2540
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:44,600
If you're going to extend

2541
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:48,520
your log into step, remove the permission,
what kind of information?

2542
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:52,680
I saw one, like I said, my
console is already pretty clean grade,

2543
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:56,360
so that's why
it is not taking any information out.

2544
02:31:56,960 --> 02:32:01,680
If there is any in unreadable character,
irrelevant information.

2545
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:04,200
If someone has in that case it removes.

2546
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:08,040
Okay.

2547
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:09,240
No, they look all right.

2548
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:12,960
So next in me, in case grade,
when you have a benefit,

2549
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:16,840
your file and you have been classes,
what do you expect every single class

2550
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:20,520
and no.

2551
02:32:20,520 --> 02:32:22,320
Then if you provide simply package name.

2552
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:25,760
Is it a good idea or extending classes in
one class is a good idea?

2553
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:30,240
Which one is the most appropriate
approach and easy approach?

2554
02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:35,160
See guys,
we read this code to simplify right

2555
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:38,200
our execution process,

2556
02:32:38,200 --> 02:32:41,920
to make our process simplify,
to make our process very simple.

2557
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:44,720
We use all of this in one spot.

2558
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:47,320
Otherwise always have very little business
to correct.

2559
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,560
We can go with X, y, z option,
you can go with ABC option with one, two,

2560
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:52,640
three option rate.

2561
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:56,520
But again, if it is not according
to the standards, it does not mean

2562
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:00,240
it is of no use.

2563
02:33:00,240 --> 02:33:13,760
Industrial place.

2564
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:15,960
Nice. Nice.

2565
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:17,840
Now let's see,

2566
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:21,480
let's do something good theory,
something very important to show you. Not

2567
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:25,160
I'm going to write.

2568
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:28,240
I am going to add grade one employee,

2569
02:33:28,760 --> 02:33:33,600
but I'm going to do I'm going to add
one employee in the application setting.

2570
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:37,480
After that, I will tell you,
create the beauty of this cookbook.

2571
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:38,840
You will be amazed.

2572
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:41,240
See right click on feature

2573
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:45,920
and I'm to create a new feature
by calling Add

2574
02:33:46,800 --> 02:33:52,360
employee Dog feature.

2575
02:33:52,360 --> 02:33:55,240
This is like feature and employee
dog feature.

2576
02:33:55,240 --> 02:33:56,560
So here's what I'm going to write.

2577
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:59,280
I'm going to make feature is dead

2578
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,920
employees connect.

2579
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:04,320
I can add one employee to employee
three employee.

2580
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:06,120
Let's see multiple scenarios.

2581
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:09,000
We would see one scenario make one thing.

2582
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:12,560
Okay, so what is the posting I have to do

2583
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,200
scenario.

2584
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:17,760
Scenario.

2585
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:18,480
Right?

2586
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:23,040
So I'm rating maybe

2587
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:25,200
one employee from

2588
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:33,080
from each employee.

2589
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:34,200
I'll replace what I'm doing,

2590
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:38,120
adding one employee on my feature.

2591
02:34:38,120 --> 02:34:40,560
So to add one employee first, what

2592
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:44,720
I have to,
I have to internal user name password,

2593
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:48,600
click on login button right then
click on my option.

2594
02:34:49,760 --> 02:34:52,320
Let me show you the functionality

2595
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:53,240
first.

2596
02:34:53,240 --> 02:34:54,240
Log in

2597
02:34:55,800 --> 02:34:59,400
as an admin
because only admin can add new employees.

2598
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:01,600
Other employees cannot connect

2599
02:35:36,360 --> 02:35:36,680
more.

2600
02:35:36,680 --> 02:35:38,400
What you see

2601
02:35:38,400 --> 02:35:42,600
I click on and after clicking on
there is an option called an employee.

2602
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:43,320
Can you

2603
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:49,840
you see case everyone

2604
02:35:53,960 --> 02:35:56,480
So now now

2605
02:35:56,480 --> 02:35:59,520
in my log in page in my log in page.

2606
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:06,360
Can I take the two steps from here.

2607
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:10,520
Right I cannot take
this is the user navigates

2608
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:13,600
to employee list each way
because in business

2609
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:17,520
because clicking on employee
is not an employee option.

2610
02:36:17,520 --> 02:36:18,320
Correct.

2611
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:22,200
So even though if I have a team option
beat there,

2612
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:24,800
I can look at one for that, activate
another.

2613
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:28,680
Okay, so let me add this
four steps post here.

2614
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:31,320
Good visibility concept.

2615
02:36:31,320 --> 02:36:33,880
I am saving it. It would be engaged.

2616
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:38,520
Is there any time saving activity time

2617
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,120
you don't need line seven.

2618
02:36:43,120 --> 02:36:46,840
Yes we don't need lane seven but in future
we will going to add associates

2619
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:48,280
their time using VPN.

2620
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:56,040
Okay.

2621
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:59,760
Now see, I'm
going to wait here when the user

2622
02:37:01,200 --> 02:37:03,040
clicks on

2623
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:04,800
the option

2624
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:06,880
option,

2625
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:09,640
you use a

2626
02:37:10,800 --> 02:37:24,360
and is this correct?

2627
02:37:24,360 --> 02:37:26,560
Not yet. I'm writing

2628
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:29,640
user interests

2629
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,960
first name and first name and

2630
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:38,640
last name.

2631
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:40,200
Then the user

2632
02:37:43,240 --> 02:37:44,640
clicks on

2633
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:47,280
see important

2634
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:48,240
reason,

2635
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:52,280
then employ added

2636
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:58,440
success.

2637
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:01,400
Correct. And then maybe one more step
for closing the browser.

2638
02:38:01,400 --> 02:38:04,720
So then use that to close the browser.

2639
02:38:04,720 --> 02:38:05,880
Let's take this a step.

2640
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:09,240
So then user plus the browser.

2641
02:38:09,240 --> 02:38:11,120
Now tell me why is this time?

2642
02:38:11,120 --> 02:38:14,040
Do we know how we can create the steps
for this only

2643
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:19,960
without actually executing them?

2644
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:22,560
We noticed Wait, how we can do this?

2645
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:27,240
Let's go to that another plus right now.

2646
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:31,440
I'm not going to execute this log
in feature, but for the entire back page,

2647
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:36,840
for the entire package I'm going to make,
branding is equals to true.

2648
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:39,720
So now it will quickly
scan all of my steps.

2649
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:41,840
How many steps are implemented?

2650
02:38:41,840 --> 02:38:43,560
How many steps are unimplemented?

2651
02:38:43,560 --> 02:38:46,200
Everything be correct

2652
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:48,040
Categories.

2653
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:50,640
So let's go ahead and execute it to post.

2654
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:55,800
Remember, it will only work when you
exactly during middle class blamed.

2655
02:38:55,800 --> 02:39:00,680
Don't use your training, execute feature
and put everything into it won't work

2656
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:05,040
and then see three feature points
it identified

2657
02:39:06,080 --> 02:39:09,120
two feature find said
okay so it didn't get any error.

2658
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:13,440
This feature finds busy error speed,
so just take the scored

2659
02:39:14,760 --> 02:39:17,040
user clicks on team option and employee.

2660
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:19,240
We're done everything from here.

2661
02:39:19,440 --> 02:39:22,080
I'm going to copy this particular code.

2662
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:22,800
Right.

2663
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:25,800
So let me copy this. Steps in here

2664
02:39:28,320 --> 02:39:30,400
and I'm going to define the

2665
02:39:39,160 --> 02:39:39,640
So here.

2666
02:39:39,640 --> 02:39:42,360
Now I'm going to define. All right.

2667
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:45,600
One particular thing, see,

2668
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:48,600
Dragon is equal to group rate.

2669
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:53,680
Let me run this part, not run a class.

2670
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:57,480
Executed all the steps I took already.

2671
02:39:58,080 --> 02:40:01,480
Go into your go into your steps.

2672
02:40:02,320 --> 02:40:06,480
So let me add
another steps called here and

2673
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:10,120
employee steps

2674
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:13,200
correct and employee steps

2675
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:27,440
and here I'm going to paste all the steps.

2676
02:40:27,440 --> 02:40:30,240
Not any four clicks on team option,
but we have this.

2677
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:32,320
Look, this will not

2678
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:36,800
we do have short list an employee feature

2679
02:40:38,480 --> 02:40:51,240
that you go.

2680
02:40:51,240 --> 02:40:54,000
It can go. Thank you, sir.

2681
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,480
It's come to this guys

2682
02:40:57,680 --> 02:41:00,480
so far any question in this part
what we do

2683
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:06,720
so far any questions?

2684
02:41:06,720 --> 02:41:10,760
No questions.

2685
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:19,440
Shall we take the code?

2686
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:23,960
That would be the code
for employee option from here.

2687
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:26,640
Where we where do we go for promotion?
You see? There you go.

2688
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:27,640
This is the promotion.

2689
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:29,080
Let me

2690
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:32,040
take the code from here and pasted here

2691
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,800
it is giving me the error for driver.

2692
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:40,880
What should I do in this case? Yes,

2693
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,120
I have to experience

2694
02:41:44,120 --> 02:41:47,360
mine for common purpose.

2695
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:49,280
Simple.

2696
02:41:49,280 --> 02:41:51,600
Another locator I need for added employee.

2697
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:53,640
So let's go ahead.

2698
02:41:53,640 --> 02:41:55,640
Take this employee part.

2699
02:41:55,640 --> 02:41:58,640
And we caught this copy

2700
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:02,640
and then I came here

2701
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:05,440
with element ID

2702
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:08,760
and like

2703
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:10,360
sequence to try

2704
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:12,960
to find many brand photo I.D.

2705
02:42:13,720 --> 02:42:17,040
This is the idea provided it.

2706
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:19,440
We put myself here

2707
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:21,720
and then an employee

2708
02:42:21,720 --> 02:42:26,280
don't click.

2709
02:42:26,280 --> 02:42:27,000
So far.

2710
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,720
So look, everyone

2711
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:38,560
nice.

2712
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:40,360
It's quiet here

2713
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:45,240
now I need work in me.

2714
02:42:45,240 --> 02:42:48,680
I need this particular part force
name, last name.

2715
02:42:48,760 --> 02:42:51,120
Right. And click on the option.

2716
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:51,760
Fine.

2717
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:53,440
It's click.

2718
02:42:53,440 --> 02:42:55,480
Here it is giving me ideas.

2719
02:42:55,480 --> 02:42:58,520
Post me.

2720
02:42:58,520 --> 02:42:59,520
I'm writing here

2721
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:03,080
one element.

2722
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:05,720
First name is equals per driver.

2723
02:43:05,720 --> 02:43:09,440
Don't find that in bygone IED

2724
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:22,560
form.

2725
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:23,840
In here.

2726
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,360
The first name I'm going to provide.

2727
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,680
Let's see.

2728
02:43:29,080 --> 02:43:30,680
I'm lost in an employee steps.

2729
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:32,280
Man Where did you lost? Tell me.

2730
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:34,200
These are the employee steps.

2731
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:35,440
I'm not going to proceed further.

2732
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:40,400
Tell me what you spoke in.

2733
02:43:40,400 --> 02:43:42,000
What is the issue

2734
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:54,120
as well?

2735
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:58,680
What is the issue here?

2736
02:43:58,680 --> 02:44:02,040
From where did you did all the quotes

2737
02:44:05,160 --> 02:44:08,880
nasal or how would you read this to me,

2738
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:23,400
how we generated the steps.

2739
02:44:23,400 --> 02:44:26,920
That is how we generated the distance

2740
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:30,800
command.

2741
02:44:30,800 --> 02:44:34,640
A man, Aisha
medina, has seen the man, Christine Lugo

2742
02:44:46,200 --> 02:44:46,920
Right.

2743
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:50,320
So now what
we have to do when you add this

2744
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:53,320
employee feature, right, you have to go.

2745
02:44:53,320 --> 02:44:54,000
Can you run that?

2746
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:57,560
Because once you go
in, you run that last, right?

2747
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:00,600
Just to make this right,
it is equals to true.

2748
02:45:00,840 --> 02:45:05,400
When you make this right is equals to
to execute this particular class.

2749
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:10,400
When you execute in this particular class
you will get the code in your console

2750
02:45:10,400 --> 02:45:11,440
like this.

2751
02:45:11,440 --> 02:45:14,720
Once you get this code in your console,
copy this code

2752
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:18,040
from your console
and pasted in employee steps.

2753
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:21,280
That is the only thing we have to do

2754
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:24,080
right now after this.

2755
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:29,280
This beam option we already used
the already used in our employee

2756
02:45:29,280 --> 02:45:31,080
search systems.

2757
02:45:31,080 --> 02:45:34,120
This employee wouldn't be identified
just now.

2758
02:45:34,920 --> 02:45:38,920
This first name be identified
just now I'm going to exhaust.

2759
02:45:38,920 --> 02:45:41,520
And then also here similarly, right

2760
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:44,040
now, you

2761
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:50,040
know your good password.

2762
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:53,760
Great.

2763
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:56,800
You're welcome. Welcome.

2764
02:45:56,920 --> 02:45:59,240
So let me take

2765
02:46:00,600 --> 02:46:02,400
a modern Nancy.

2766
02:46:02,400 --> 02:46:03,760
No, like

2767
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:07,920
for me.

2768
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:12,000
Let me take the last name also from here.

2769
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:13,680
The last name is my ID.

2770
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:17,080
Last name.

2771
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:18,880
But anyway,

2772
02:46:19,320 --> 02:46:23,160
last name is equals to driver or

2773
02:46:24,320 --> 02:46:26,600
point element by got a

2774
02:46:31,640 --> 02:46:32,520
last name.

2775
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:35,400
Same keys. Right.

2776
02:46:35,400 --> 02:46:37,800
Never seen these names, correct?

2777
02:46:37,800 --> 02:46:41,400
Correct.

2778
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:42,720
So now

2779
02:46:43,840 --> 02:46:46,200
it would take my name.

2780
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:49,600
And this is the last thing I need

2781
02:46:58,560 --> 02:46:59,280
so far.

2782
02:46:59,280 --> 02:47:02,160
Any questions? Students

2783
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:05,040
Three steps
we have implemented one two steps.

2784
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:06,840
We copy paste those steps.

2785
02:47:06,840 --> 02:47:08,040
We execute the code.

2786
02:47:08,040 --> 02:47:11,080
We identify the code.

2787
02:47:11,080 --> 02:47:15,320
Let's proceed further.

2788
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:17,400
Now we have to click on Save button.

2789
02:47:17,880 --> 02:47:20,080
We have to click on same button.

2790
02:47:20,080 --> 02:47:22,440
So let's go here and find this.

2791
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:24,800
And also we got another article.

2792
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:27,000
We did it fine.

2793
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,720
Let's take this and put it here for

2794
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:34,240
delivering.

2795
02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:36,360
See where it is able to drive

2796
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:53,280
again.

2797
02:47:53,280 --> 02:47:54,400
I'm leaving this part.

2798
02:47:54,400 --> 02:48:00,360
As of now for associates,
I'm just rounding the employee and

2799
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:07,480
just the guys so far.

2800
02:48:07,480 --> 02:48:08,280
And this is steps.

2801
02:48:08,280 --> 02:48:10,840
Any question
or everything is going to be one, then me

2802
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:15,760
All good,

2803
02:48:16,600 --> 02:48:17,200
good, good.

2804
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:19,320
Two times. Good break.

2805
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:23,920
Let me go here see now my

2806
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:26,600
every step is implemented correctly.

2807
02:48:27,720 --> 02:48:33,400
My every single step is implemented.

2808
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:36,960
Let's try let's try to run this particular
fine now.

2809
02:48:37,320 --> 02:48:41,680
But on this particular point, I'm
intentionally executing this particular

2810
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:43,960
fight
because there is a reason behind this

2811
02:48:44,920 --> 02:48:47,520
and employee note feature.

2812
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:50,000
First, check
whether all these steps are implemented.

2813
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
So I'm making Brighton is equal to two.

2814
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:55,680
First, let's check.

2815
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:58,520
It won't take much

2816
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:02,880
it gave me thing
now means my steps are implemented.

2817
02:49:03,360 --> 02:49:04,680
Let's make it false

2818
02:49:06,360 --> 02:49:09,720
now run the actual class

2819
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:29,120
in error.

2820
02:49:29,120 --> 02:49:30,840
The employee not

2821
02:49:39,320 --> 02:49:47,960
wait.

2822
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:50,280
Got it. Cannot be intentionally edited.

2823
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:55,720
If I give you the time,
you all will execute.

2824
02:49:55,720 --> 02:49:56,960
Now you have a me.

2825
02:49:56,960 --> 02:49:59,120
Now go ahead and make this side slow.

2826
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:00,240
Go ahead.

2827
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:03,720
And actually this gives it
some explains in the million times.

2828
02:50:04,440 --> 02:50:11,280
I don't need you I think you did my
I have done from my side.

2829
02:50:11,280 --> 02:50:12,320
All right

2830
02:50:13,840 --> 02:50:14,880
Martin problem

2831
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:18,800
needs eight one solutions great so match

2832
02:50:18,800 --> 02:50:23,160
11 needs some unique ways.

2833
02:50:23,160 --> 02:50:24,120
Yes, ma'am.

2834
02:50:24,120 --> 02:50:26,520
Now I'm going to post this code.

2835
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:47,920
I'm going to commit this code first.

2836
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:49,720
Yes, it's one user only.

2837
02:50:49,720 --> 02:50:52,880
That is because we added one user on you.

2838
02:50:57,120 --> 02:50:57,560
Got it.

2839
02:50:57,560 --> 02:50:59,360
What kind of

2840
02:50:59,720 --> 02:51:05,240
now is of a liberty of days?

2841
02:51:05,240 --> 02:51:15,040
24 seconds write code is available. Yes.

2842
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:18,080
Or big to the next malicious games

2843
02:51:18,080 --> 02:51:21,480
when we will understand it completely,
it really will make life easier.

2844
02:51:21,480 --> 02:51:22,400
Said Hey, just give me

2845
02:51:23,480 --> 02:51:24,800
one, two, three, four.

2846
02:51:24,800 --> 02:51:27,120
More classes after this. Read

2847
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:31,800
hardly four classes, maybe four or five,
and then everything

2848
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:45,400
would be completely understandable.

2849
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:46,360
Yes, yes.

2850
02:51:46,360 --> 02:51:47,560
That everything is here.

2851
02:51:47,560 --> 02:51:49,480
Everything is yet I'm waiting.

2852
02:51:49,480 --> 02:51:52,040
I'm posting the slides also.
You see. Great.

2853
02:51:52,160 --> 02:51:53,360
I provided this late.

2854
02:51:53,360 --> 02:51:55,760
Let me show you In the course.

2855
02:51:55,760 --> 02:52:01,200
If I go for batch 11, you open the files

2856
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:04,680
in the files.

2857
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:06,240
Because the last one

2858
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:09,120
was properly explanation of the framework
created the basics of.

2859
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:10,400
But why?

2860
02:52:10,400 --> 02:52:13,080
So I consider the class
two as the class one.

2861
02:52:13,080 --> 02:52:15,480
That's what I

2862
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:20,160
read.

2863
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:22,320
Showing something else

2864
02:52:25,640 --> 02:52:26,640
we will create.

2865
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:34,560
We will create multiple
multiple classes to including.

2866
02:52:34,560 --> 02:52:38,640
So now you'll see on Thursday
I provided as cucumber class one Redis.

2867
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:41,680
You see this people provided.

2868
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:44,600
So it's already here
and I will continue to play

2869
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:48,640
more slides.

2870
02:52:48,640 --> 02:52:50,600
The system definition right

2871
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:53,480
to do by next update.

2872
02:52:53,480 --> 02:52:55,920
We are still learning the specs. Correct?

2873
02:52:56,920 --> 02:53:00,280
We are still learning the text.

2874
02:53:00,280 --> 02:53:05,640
See, let's let everyone complete

2875
02:53:05,640 --> 02:53:08,720
and then we proceed for

2876
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:14,080
your elements.

2877
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:19,160
So basically, like I said, right,
if there is an any unreadable

2878
02:53:19,280 --> 02:53:23,640
and in the console they don't need to be,
but otherwise it will keep your console

2879
02:53:23,640 --> 02:53:24,120
as it is.

2880
02:53:24,120 --> 02:53:27,120
If it is already the console,
you are good.

2881
02:53:27,440 --> 02:53:30,000
Okay.

2882
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:33,720
Are non-negative with me,
no quiz with me, just homework.

2883
02:53:34,160 --> 02:53:36,200
Alright. So you do homework.

2884
02:53:36,200 --> 02:53:37,560
You do practice three.

2885
02:53:37,560 --> 02:53:42,840
I have feed trade and I provide basically,
you know I'm here not to give a lot

2886
02:53:42,840 --> 02:53:46,240
so homework
when indeed grade beat something

2887
02:53:46,240 --> 02:53:47,800
efficiently

2888
02:53:54,320 --> 02:53:57,600
really when they check

2889
02:53:59,680 --> 02:54:00,960
all remains.

2890
02:54:00,960 --> 02:54:10,280
So you're happy with the more binary
now wait.

2891
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:12,320
Oh yes, yes. So that is the object.

2892
02:54:12,920 --> 02:54:16,880
I will be taking your session on Sunday
will be taking or session or Tuesday

2893
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:20,040
Wednesday and Xabi
Alonso will be taking on Thursday.

2894
02:54:20,640 --> 02:54:21,560
So important to you.

2895
02:54:21,560 --> 02:54:25,040
Once I will be available, I'm
going to need you to be working in there.

2896
02:54:26,320 --> 02:54:28,080
But if I take your to be one more name,

2897
02:54:28,080 --> 02:54:33,600
then just think Tuesday, Wednesday
already sessions, then Saturday, Sunday.

2898
02:54:33,720 --> 02:54:36,480
And if I make Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday again.

2899
02:54:36,480 --> 02:54:39,440
And then just one day paid in
then against it Davidson businesses

2900
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,080
So it's late I'm leaving with my 11

2901
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:47,400
even leave I don't think session imagine
even though it misses the chance right

2902
02:54:47,400 --> 02:54:51,240
in the middle back to the other classes
So there is no labor done.

2903
02:54:52,120 --> 02:54:54,600
It's all about where I'm wasting in you.

2904
02:54:54,600 --> 02:55:05,160
Labor, not investment.

2905
02:55:05,160 --> 02:55:22,920
Okay, So is everyone scored now working?

2906
02:55:22,920 --> 02:55:23,720
Definitely.

2907
02:55:23,720 --> 02:55:25,800
I would beg your sedation strike

2908
02:55:26,520 --> 02:55:33,360
and I will see what I can do in this case.

2909
02:55:33,360 --> 02:55:35,680
Everyone ask for Katoomba, Aisha.

2910
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:38,760
Everyone ask for Google. Believe me

2911
02:55:38,760 --> 02:55:43,760
specifically, they're asking the inability
about candidates is yes, they said okay.

2912
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:55,800
We went to an interview segment,
maybe assign someone nice.

2913
02:55:55,800 --> 02:55:57,200
Would big

2914
02:55:58,760 --> 02:55:59,920
the one that is you.

2915
02:55:59,920 --> 02:56:03,120
I mean, I know this name so long,
but it's a good name.

2916
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:06,080
Just this addition. Last number is yours.

2917
02:56:06,080 --> 02:56:07,440
Fine.

2918
02:56:07,440 --> 02:56:09,240
Now, see,

2919
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:15,040
see, another important thing here.

2920
02:56:15,040 --> 02:56:18,680
Then you take name of,

2921
02:56:18,680 --> 02:56:22,160
it's you.

2922
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:26,720
And if you find a job of managers
think a computer would be used

2923
02:56:26,720 --> 02:56:29,560
for implementation. Great. Michaeli Great.

2924
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:33,120
But to be honest, grade,
if you go in the market nowadays

2925
02:56:33,120 --> 02:56:37,600
and you ask for manual testing,
you won't even believe me.

2926
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:40,840
Even if they want you to work
as a manual to the

2927
02:56:40,840 --> 02:56:42,960
We ask questions on automation
In interview,

2928
02:56:44,840 --> 02:56:48,120
they've been asked if they are Java,
they will ask know Selenium.

2929
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:52,880
Gilbert Extend is a database
my skill database API everything.

2930
02:56:52,880 --> 02:56:55,760
And then in the end they will give you
an excel by to rate that is

2931
02:56:58,560 --> 02:56:59,080
they need

2932
02:56:59,080 --> 02:57:02,560
Superman
blade in the providing is a watchmen

2933
02:57:03,120 --> 02:57:14,480
that's what industries are doing
is this tool.

2934
02:57:15,200 --> 02:57:19,600
I mean I know this is weird even
when we hired people rate of menu testing

2935
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:23,400
because our senior management says
hey we a person who is excellent

2936
02:57:23,400 --> 02:57:27,280
with people book and sometimes I think
why do we need a person?

2937
02:57:27,720 --> 02:57:31,720
Most people framework anyway in the end
we are going to give me one example

2938
02:57:31,720 --> 02:57:34,440
by the way they're test case is right

2939
02:57:35,560 --> 02:57:37,400
but it's going on in the market.

2940
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:39,800
So that's why we have to ability
from all the perspective.

2941
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:42,960
Okay.

2942
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:44,040
And it's not going to happen.

2943
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:46,560
But most of the times, many other times
you will get a job

2944
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:49,480
and once you join rate,
there will be two scenarios.

2945
02:57:49,480 --> 02:57:51,760
Either they will give you
the good repository. Want it?

2946
02:57:52,080 --> 02:57:53,680
Go ahead, game the code.

2947
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:56,200
There will be some good decisions,
knowledge transfer decisions

2948
02:57:56,600 --> 02:57:59,880
of some of the
some of the employees of your company

2949
02:57:59,880 --> 02:58:05,360
who is working already on yet you pass the
you the way they knew how things work.

2950
02:58:05,360 --> 02:58:07,440
What is the project of the code?

2951
02:58:07,440 --> 02:58:10,400
What is that a framework.
Everything that is wants in any

2952
02:58:11,400 --> 02:58:14,280
you will understand that you will learn
that and then you will write your code.

2953
02:58:14,280 --> 02:58:15,840
In that particular

2954
02:58:16,440 --> 02:58:18,840
scenario,
do you go to the company you joined?

2955
02:58:18,840 --> 02:58:22,280
The company, closed it, you have a
meeting, second day of a meeting.

2956
02:58:22,280 --> 02:58:23,920
Today you're meeting with your manager.

2957
02:58:23,920 --> 02:58:26,280
Your manager would say, Hey,
we do not have a commission.

2958
02:58:27,200 --> 02:58:30,840
That's why we hired you.

2959
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:33,000
Knows that entity,
No said entity to the student.

2960
02:58:33,360 --> 02:58:34,240
That's why we hired you.

2961
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:36,640
Because we do not have any permission
already.

2962
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:39,200
Now we are relying on you

2963
02:58:39,720 --> 02:58:42,480
to setup your permission process.

2964
02:58:42,480 --> 02:58:45,760
So first thing that expecting from you
to create a plan for commission

2965
02:58:46,400 --> 02:58:49,320
make the framework is start
writing summer commissions

2966
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,400
provide some B or C proof of concept

2967
02:58:53,360 --> 02:58:55,680
is considered Demo invite all of us in

2968
02:58:55,680 --> 02:58:59,520
your name will send us an email
and then we'll see how things work.

2969
02:58:59,520 --> 02:59:08,880
These are the two scenarios
we'll be having in the industry.

2970
02:59:08,880 --> 02:59:10,280
What do we do then?

2971
02:59:10,280 --> 02:59:12,160
I am here to invite you here.

2972
02:59:12,160 --> 02:59:18,280
I will explain.

2973
02:59:18,280 --> 02:59:19,320
It depends on it.

2974
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:19,800
It depends.

2975
02:59:19,800 --> 02:59:21,960
If you're working for the bank,
then they will give you like

2976
02:59:22,520 --> 02:59:25,120
maybe 20 days
if you're working for a new project.

2977
02:59:25,120 --> 02:59:25,400
Right.

2978
02:59:25,400 --> 02:59:27,440
And yet they hired you
as an experienced person,

2979
02:59:27,720 --> 02:59:29,560
then they will give you more than one week
or two week.

2980
02:59:29,560 --> 02:59:32,520
But there will be by the time every day

2981
02:59:44,560 --> 02:59:45,240
gutting.

2982
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:46,640
So they're making.

2983
02:59:46,640 --> 02:59:49,040
You could be familiar
with the new project, right?

2984
02:59:49,240 --> 02:59:51,080
Could three days.

2985
02:59:51,080 --> 02:59:56,400
Getting a job is difficult
and the job is not that difficult.

2986
02:59:57,840 --> 03:00:00,600
Once You get a job then anyhow.

2987
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:03,120
Somehow you will survive in that.

2988
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:04,720
You will survive in there.

2989
03:00:04,720 --> 03:00:10,640
And even if you faced some issue
that we are a here, why do we right.

2990
03:00:11,080 --> 03:00:14,600
But to get a job credit was the bait.

2991
03:00:16,160 --> 03:00:19,160
Remember, it's always
the first is every time

2992
03:00:19,280 --> 03:00:22,840
difficult to open once
you open the box to the in that bottom

2993
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:24,040
is clear

2994
03:00:30,560 --> 03:00:31,440
cutting

2995
03:00:40,040 --> 03:00:40,880
fine.

2996
03:00:42,080 --> 03:00:43,760
Let's come to this point what I was

2997
03:00:43,760 --> 03:00:48,600
explaining See,

2998
03:00:48,600 --> 03:00:51,520
I have one feature right here.

2999
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:54,360
I have one feature right here.

3000
03:00:54,360 --> 03:00:57,120
I have one feature point here

3001
03:00:57,120 --> 03:00:59,120
only non. If I see those scenarios.

3002
03:01:00,480 --> 03:01:01,200
Two scenarios

3003
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:04,240
for one scenario, how many scenarios?

3004
03:01:04,240 --> 03:01:05,880
I have a super

3005
03:01:10,280 --> 03:01:11,440
students.

3006
03:01:12,480 --> 03:01:13,680
Five Duplass.

3007
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:17,680
Duplass what five Noble one scenario?

3008
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:19,440
An employee

3009
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:22,320
whose scenario here in employee served

3010
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:25,680
and do scenario enlarging feature.

3011
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:29,720
So two plus two is equals to four,
four plus one is equals four

3012
03:01:29,720 --> 03:01:32,880
pi and behave three feature phase

3013
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:34,640
change

3014
03:01:36,720 --> 03:01:38,120
the database.

3015
03:01:38,120 --> 03:01:40,200
This is what we call spoon feeding

3016
03:01:41,680 --> 03:01:42,960
and this would

3017
03:01:45,520 --> 03:01:47,080
this Getty.

3018
03:01:47,080 --> 03:01:48,520
So now,

3019
03:01:48,840 --> 03:01:52,200
now, now we have three feature points,
five scenarios.

3020
03:01:52,640 --> 03:01:55,400
But the problem is the problem is

3021
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,920
when I'm going to execute
with this portion,

3022
03:01:59,640 --> 03:02:02,000
with this portion, with this flash

3023
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,520
break, with this glitch,

3024
03:02:04,520 --> 03:02:07,800
it will execute all the five scenarios
in a single track,

3025
03:02:09,200 --> 03:02:11,160
all the feature points,
all the five scenarios.

3026
03:02:11,160 --> 03:02:14,280
It is when to execute.

3027
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:16,560
Now, let's think about the situation.

3028
03:02:18,520 --> 03:02:18,960
Smooth,

3029
03:02:18,960 --> 03:02:21,840
best guesses, integration, best guesses.

3030
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:24,000
Maybe are working.

3031
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:27,680
Let's see if we open this

3032
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:31,960
in your sprint one rate.

3033
03:02:31,960 --> 03:02:38,360
Currently it is going on to sprint one.

3034
03:02:38,360 --> 03:02:40,920
What is the ideal
duration of your sprint days and

3035
03:02:42,440 --> 03:02:48,000
two weeks?

3036
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,520
This is your sprint to

3037
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:51,920
three

3038
03:02:52,480 --> 03:02:57,960
sprint for sprint by six.

3039
03:02:57,960 --> 03:03:00,920
Here you need five scenarios.

3040
03:03:02,320 --> 03:03:05,320
Here you edit things, images,

3041
03:03:05,320 --> 03:03:07,480
you may get 15 scenarios for example.

3042
03:03:07,960 --> 03:03:10,880
So by the end of Force two sprint,
how many scenarios

3043
03:03:10,880 --> 03:03:13,040
you have in your framework

3044
03:03:17,160 --> 03:03:19,320
days by the end of August five,

3045
03:03:20,520 --> 03:03:23,240
but by the end of the weekend,
Sprint culminates in Adios.

3046
03:03:23,240 --> 03:03:25,880
You have to be

3047
03:03:27,400 --> 03:03:31,200
by the end of the sprint three How many
scenarios you have now in your bucket?

3048
03:03:31,720 --> 03:03:34,320
30 No.

3049
03:03:35,160 --> 03:03:37,440
Now your lead came when your lead asked

3050
03:03:38,160 --> 03:03:40,880
how many scenarios you worked
on this particular of sprint.

3051
03:03:41,160 --> 03:03:42,000
Please execute.

3052
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:45,560
I want to those only those
who completed in the spring three

3053
03:03:46,640 --> 03:03:49,080
Currently
when looking at this particular part

3054
03:03:49,560 --> 03:03:52,280
that are looking at this particular part,

3055
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:55,560
can you see is there any place through

3056
03:03:55,560 --> 03:03:58,280
which you can execute on those scenarios
and leave

3057
03:03:59,520 --> 03:04:01,600
the remaining 51

3058
03:04:02,080 --> 03:04:03,200
with this existing part?

3059
03:04:03,200 --> 03:04:09,840
Can you see anything
you think means there is no segregation?

3060
03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:14,280
There is no reason for everything
that you make another package included?

3061
03:04:14,280 --> 03:04:17,720
No. What I really would option
this give you more options

3062
03:04:17,880 --> 03:04:20,160
is find the use bag.

3063
03:04:21,360 --> 03:04:22,800
Use Dag.

3064
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:25,040
So find. Come here.

3065
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:26,840
Right. Come here and ready.

3066
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:28,880
For example, I want to execute.

3067
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:32,800
Only those scenarios
belong to my best guesses.

3068
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:38,040
Industrial only
those scenarios belong to my best guesses.

3069
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:39,360
So what I have to do?

3070
03:04:39,360 --> 03:04:41,960
I have to write your entry.

3071
03:04:41,960 --> 03:04:43,280
Spoke

3072
03:04:44,400 --> 03:04:50,400
for after eight days.

3073
03:04:50,400 --> 03:04:52,720
Here. Let's see if the red

3074
03:04:53,880 --> 03:04:58,080
application, for example.

3075
03:04:58,080 --> 03:04:59,520
It could be anything.

3076
03:04:59,520 --> 03:05:02,160
Similarly go in another class.

3077
03:05:02,160 --> 03:05:06,000
Also another feature also
give them their take an important entry.

3078
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:06,960
Let's see.

3079
03:05:06,960 --> 03:05:12,160
This is my integration.

3080
03:05:12,160 --> 03:05:15,000
You take this one also.

3081
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:19,440
This is also my painting.

3082
03:05:19,440 --> 03:05:20,320
This one also.

3083
03:05:20,320 --> 03:05:27,480
This is also what you see integration.

3084
03:05:27,480 --> 03:05:28,600
Correct? Ready?

3085
03:05:28,600 --> 03:05:30,280
Where to be ready?

3086
03:05:30,280 --> 03:05:32,720
We come here.

3087
03:05:33,720 --> 03:05:36,400
So now I grouped all of my scenarios.

3088
03:05:37,280 --> 03:05:38,280
Got it

3089
03:05:40,480 --> 03:05:41,160
raised.

3090
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:43,560
I know which scenario is going to smoke.

3091
03:05:43,720 --> 03:05:46,560
Scenario is going to regression with
scenario is going to one

3092
03:05:46,560 --> 03:05:47,920
particular battery.

3093
03:05:47,920 --> 03:05:51,000
I grouped all of this in that is on the

3094
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:57,440
every scenario is grouped here.

3095
03:05:57,440 --> 03:06:00,960
For example, if this scenario
is a part of your regression

3096
03:06:01,200 --> 03:06:04,280
and you're working on this scenario
in your current sprint,

3097
03:06:04,280 --> 03:06:09,000
it means you're supposed to add
to text for your simplicity, correct?

3098
03:06:10,640 --> 03:06:11,080
Correct.

3099
03:06:11,080 --> 03:06:11,760
Right.

3100
03:06:13,320 --> 03:06:15,120
So now here what you would do,

3101
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:18,480
simply just read another day
and play like this

3102
03:06:18,960 --> 03:06:21,240
another day and provide like this

3103
03:06:21,600 --> 03:06:24,840
another take and provide

3104
03:06:25,080 --> 03:06:28,120
something like this,
whatever that you want to add.

3105
03:06:28,120 --> 03:06:32,400
You can simply add multiple to the
in that you understood

3106
03:06:36,600 --> 03:06:37,680
industrial base,

3107
03:06:37,680 --> 03:06:41,400
you can add multiple or your one scenario

3108
03:06:41,440 --> 03:06:43,680
based on this type of extension

3109
03:06:46,480 --> 03:06:55,680
makes sense.

3110
03:06:55,680 --> 03:06:56,840
Makes sense.

3111
03:06:57,600 --> 03:06:59,120
Yeah. I'm going equally.

3112
03:06:59,120 --> 03:07:00,720
I'm going make big still.

3113
03:07:00,720 --> 03:07:04,880
I would feature but you say still
I would be able to go there.

3114
03:07:04,880 --> 03:07:07,440
Sequence doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

3115
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:11,120
Like I said, it's
all depending on the linking it.

3116
03:07:11,120 --> 03:07:14,440
Timber is worked on linking part

3117
03:07:14,440 --> 03:07:15,160
three.

3118
03:07:15,160 --> 03:07:20,400
So now for example,
I have a multiple take rate, multiple data

3119
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:22,680
everywhere.

3120
03:07:22,680 --> 03:07:25,560
Now let's go to another class.

3121
03:07:25,560 --> 03:07:26,960
We don't need to do anything.

3122
03:07:28,280 --> 03:07:29,800
We don't need to do anything.

3123
03:07:29,800 --> 03:07:35,040
Just put one more comma
and there is another take on things.

3124
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:37,760
Double quotes
the way in which you want to run.

3125
03:07:37,800 --> 03:07:40,000
Smoke point.

3126
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:41,320
I misspoke.

3127
03:07:42,040 --> 03:07:42,440
Which one?

3128
03:07:42,440 --> 03:07:42,920
You want to run?

3129
03:07:42,920 --> 03:07:45,880
Regression find to

3130
03:07:47,360 --> 03:07:48,960
and so on.

3131
03:07:49,080 --> 03:07:50,160
Understood.

3132
03:07:50,960 --> 03:07:53,240
So now see this time.

3133
03:07:53,560 --> 03:07:55,320
What about this

3134
03:07:55,680 --> 03:07:57,600
index? It is deprecated.

3135
03:07:57,600 --> 03:07:58,600
It is deprecated.

3136
03:07:58,600 --> 03:08:00,480
I already told you.

3137
03:08:01,880 --> 03:08:02,640
You see,

3138
03:08:02,640 --> 03:08:05,960
if I put it here like this is
it is equals to true.

3139
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,480
Can you see the call.

3140
03:08:08,560 --> 03:08:09,600
Same rate.

3141
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:12,600
The main which is getting this
district is equal to two and false.

3142
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:14,520
So it is deprecated.

3143
03:08:14,520 --> 03:08:16,720
No, we don't need to rate. That's
what I'm saying.

3144
03:08:16,720 --> 03:08:20,680
We don't need to.

3145
03:08:20,680 --> 03:08:24,600
So first like that idea takes will

3146
03:08:26,040 --> 03:08:29,520
identify the scenario

3147
03:08:30,600 --> 03:08:33,520
based on that you re

3148
03:08:34,880 --> 03:08:36,480
provide

3149
03:08:37,760 --> 03:08:40,800
a right to the

3150
03:08:40,800 --> 03:08:41,760
features.

3151
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:42,960
Three Just

3152
03:08:44,320 --> 03:08:46,520
how to convert duplex

3153
03:08:46,520 --> 03:08:50,800
first moment, let me complete
the one thing and I will come with it.

3154
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:53,600
Why you always ask questions
a step further.

3155
03:08:53,920 --> 03:08:57,320
It ultimately makes other students
confused.

3156
03:08:57,320 --> 03:09:04,920
Okay, so I'm just taking everybody
into consideration.

3157
03:09:04,920 --> 03:09:05,200
Yeah.

3158
03:09:05,760 --> 03:09:09,400
On the last the last point played,
the last thing which we are adding,

3159
03:09:09,400 --> 03:09:11,320
for example, featured is the mask.

3160
03:09:11,320 --> 03:09:15,240
Then we don't need to add a comma
because in the last we don't need a comma.

3161
03:09:15,240 --> 03:09:16,840
Now don't use your own statement.

3162
03:09:16,840 --> 03:09:18,240
Everyone put full stop.

3163
03:09:18,240 --> 03:09:20,440
In the end, it will not work.

3164
03:09:20,440 --> 03:09:23,360
Keep it as it is on read and might.

3165
03:09:23,400 --> 03:09:28,920
Some people will use their brain
and then say Oh well, and put full stop.

3166
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:32,520
No, I know you're good at English,
but don't do this here. No

3167
03:09:33,720 --> 03:09:35,760
features blue

3168
03:09:35,760 --> 03:09:38,920
in monochrome text

3169
03:09:44,680 --> 03:09:45,120
so far.

3170
03:09:45,120 --> 03:09:46,320
Is it okay everyone.

3171
03:09:46,320 --> 03:09:46,720
So far?

3172
03:09:46,720 --> 03:09:56,400
Is this okay?

3173
03:09:56,400 --> 03:09:57,520
Nice.

3174
03:09:58,640 --> 03:09:59,400
Should be executed.

3175
03:09:59,400 --> 03:10:02,560
Now let's see now what is this structure?

3176
03:10:02,560 --> 03:10:03,280
What sentences?

3177
03:10:03,280 --> 03:10:04,760
Sentences in the feature?

3178
03:10:04,760 --> 03:10:07,400
I'll go all the feature points.

3179
03:10:07,400 --> 03:10:10,680
Big check the steps
for all the feature points.

3180
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:13,800
Remove all the information,
which is an element

3181
03:10:13,800 --> 03:10:17,400
from consortium and execute
only those scenarios.

3182
03:10:17,400 --> 03:10:19,920
Having this is moonpig great

3183
03:10:20,720 --> 03:10:26,040

3184
03:10:26,040 --> 03:10:32,360
Let's execute.

3185
03:10:32,360 --> 03:10:51,720
Execute this.

3186
03:10:51,720 --> 03:10:52,200
How many?

3187
03:10:52,200 --> 03:10:57,920
This was Grace.

3188
03:10:57,920 --> 03:11:00,920

3189
03:11:02,760 --> 03:11:03,760
Sebastian, come on.

3190
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:06,120
This is the feature for any name.

3191
03:11:06,120 --> 03:11:12,600
No one says none.

3192
03:11:12,600 --> 03:11:14,280
Guys, let's arrange a meeting.

3193
03:11:14,280 --> 03:11:21,000
I would like to see
every one of you in person.

3194
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:25,880
I will definitely complete this,
even if I have to get all this.

3195
03:11:26,320 --> 03:11:28,280
I have to pay a hefty price
for the tickets.

3196
03:11:28,280 --> 03:11:29,640
And they need to be.

3197
03:11:29,640 --> 03:11:30,760
I want to meet everyone.

3198
03:11:30,760 --> 03:11:35,640
I mean, nice guys, nice beyond

3199
03:11:35,640 --> 03:11:52,000
imaginations, Great.

3200
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:53,920
No, no, that's fine. That's fine.

3201
03:11:53,920 --> 03:11:56,080
If same location connect.

3202
03:11:56,520 --> 03:11:57,240
No, no.

3203
03:11:57,240 --> 03:11:59,440
I asked because I didn't.

3204
03:11:59,440 --> 03:12:00,640
I didn't ask in your

3205
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:03,720
system how many times it executed.

3206
03:12:04,160 --> 03:12:08,280
I answered here only in my system
because I'm showing my system.

3207
03:12:08,280 --> 03:12:10,440
So obviously I will ask you

3208
03:12:10,440 --> 03:12:13,920
to look at my screen
and then how many executed it,

3209
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:18,120
seeing it specifically here, it overall,
it wasn't executed.

3210
03:12:18,280 --> 03:12:19,080
Right.

3211
03:12:19,200 --> 03:12:22,200
It came
and then it shows the method name also.

3212
03:12:22,320 --> 03:12:24,000
That's what I was asking.

3213
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:25,920
Someone says none.

3214
03:12:25,920 --> 03:12:28,280
And I was shocked that here
I can see the result.

3215
03:12:28,760 --> 03:12:31,400
Here is the name ME.

3216
03:12:31,400 --> 03:12:33,960
Someone says to read this one point

3217
03:12:39,160 --> 03:12:43,400

3218
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:48,320
Sure.

3219
03:12:48,320 --> 03:12:50,440

03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:57,120
Me is the best quality.

3223
03:12:58,200 --> 03:13:02,760
Excellent.

3224
03:13:02,760 --> 03:13:04,880
What he does what you did today.

3225
03:13:04,880 --> 03:13:07,720
Make another?

3226
03:13:07,720 --> 03:13:08,720
Yeah. He.

3227
03:13:08,720 --> 03:13:16,160
It's going to be nine zero. Good

3228
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:19,280
And then he didn't add it It's big

3229
03:13:23,400 --> 03:13:26,520
this fine

3230
03:13:28,640 --> 03:13:30,480
so far so look

3231
03:13:30,640 --> 03:13:31,680
everyone

3232
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:43,720
sitting

3233
03:13:47,080 --> 03:13:48,240
time to learn

3234
03:13:48,240 --> 03:14:01,440
another important stuff. No,

3235
03:14:02,680 --> 03:14:04,080
no. Come here again.

3236
03:14:04,080 --> 03:14:08,200
Going to the class.

3237
03:14:08,200 --> 03:14:10,200
I'm executing a lot of things.

3238
03:14:10,200 --> 03:14:10,920
Like,

3239
03:14:12,240 --> 03:14:18,400
where is my report?

3240
03:14:18,400 --> 03:14:21,720
I am executing the art of things,

3241
03:14:21,720 --> 03:14:40,040
but that is my report.

3242
03:14:40,040 --> 03:14:46,200
Where do you see any where the report?

3243
03:14:46,200 --> 03:14:48,000
No, not yet.

3244
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:50,440
Generated, Maybe Target?

3245
03:14:50,480 --> 03:14:54,040
No. Now see, what do campuses do?

3246
03:14:54,040 --> 03:14:56,360
What is very smart to go overseas?

3247
03:14:56,360 --> 03:14:59,520
You don't need to look anywhere
about the reports, right?

3248
03:14:59,640 --> 03:15:00,720
Anywhere about the reports.

3249
03:15:00,720 --> 03:15:03,360
First, you have to generate the report.

3250
03:15:03,360 --> 03:15:06,760
What have to do.

3251
03:15:06,760 --> 03:15:09,800
What we have to do
is we have to generate the report.

3252
03:15:10,040 --> 03:15:15,200
And when we actually generate
the report right, we will define it.

3253
03:15:15,240 --> 03:15:18,120
This place
report should be generated. Okay.

3254
03:15:18,600 --> 03:15:21,200
So for now, see what we are going to do.

3255
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:26,480
We are going to add one
plugin in the options again, comma

3256
03:15:27,440 --> 03:15:30,160
prepared me see

3257
03:15:30,160 --> 03:15:32,840
what I'm going to do and plugin right

3258
03:15:33,720 --> 03:15:38,080
then open and close this is because
we will actively people like it straight.

3259
03:15:38,160 --> 03:15:40,400
That's why I'm reading you just one thing,

3260
03:15:41,520 --> 03:15:43,200
not your favorite word.

3261
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:44,880
We are going to use the first word.

3262
03:15:44,880 --> 03:15:47,320
We are going to use as

3263
03:15:48,040 --> 03:15:50,080
what we are going to use

3264
03:15:51,160 --> 03:15:52,040
pretty

3265
03:15:52,560 --> 03:15:55,360
why we use this
pretty keyword regenerate the report.

3266
03:15:55,800 --> 03:15:56,960
All right.

3267
03:15:57,840 --> 03:16:00,080
On rainy days in logging,

3268
03:16:00,360 --> 03:16:03,600
we this word PDB now the

3269
03:16:04,880 --> 03:16:06,040
yes yeah

3270
03:16:06,720 --> 03:16:09,000
now again I'm going to use

3271
03:16:09,600 --> 03:16:13,440
and see what kind of report it will report

3272
03:16:13,600 --> 03:16:16,720
find when I say been targeted

3273
03:16:17,400 --> 03:16:22,960
by what name could go very dark.

3274
03:16:22,960 --> 03:16:25,200
I'm going to generate a report.

3275
03:16:26,040 --> 03:16:27,480
We also use ugly.

3276
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:31,520
Then you will get ugly report.

3277
03:16:31,520 --> 03:16:34,360
Don't blame me.

3278
03:16:34,360 --> 03:16:39,160
So here is the estimate report
I need in target.

3279
03:16:39,160 --> 03:16:40,200
So the legal.

3280
03:16:40,200 --> 03:16:41,760
Can you see this target folder?

3281
03:16:41,760 --> 03:16:44,120
Everyone?

3282
03:16:44,120 --> 03:16:48,520
Can you see this target folder
right inside this target folder.

3283
03:16:48,760 --> 03:16:50,240
People in particular.

3284
03:16:50,240 --> 03:16:52,320
Not a team report.

3285
03:16:52,320 --> 03:16:55,080
Okay.

3286
03:16:55,080 --> 03:16:57,840
In the use
another category. No. For one. No.

3287
03:16:58,800 --> 03:16:59,200
There is an

3288
03:16:59,200 --> 03:17:03,240
intention to do this in target
I any of that.

3289
03:17:03,240 --> 03:17:05,880
I will tell you
what is the intention of using in future

3290
03:17:07,760 --> 03:17:12,760
in other classes that I repeat.

3291
03:17:12,760 --> 03:17:14,720
Yep. Yep.

3292
03:17:14,720 --> 03:17:17,280
Yeah. Yes.

3293
03:17:17,400 --> 03:17:19,760
So now now this time

3294
03:17:19,760 --> 03:17:24,400
when I execute my good
to see this time going to execute so far

3295
03:17:24,400 --> 03:17:26,800
any any question in this plugin pervades
what I'm doing

3296
03:17:31,560 --> 03:17:34,680
for you just to basically board.

3297
03:17:34,920 --> 03:17:37,920
After that we will clear
we will generate multiple reports.

3298
03:17:37,920 --> 03:17:39,000
Very good.

3299
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:41,840
But for now, just go with this report.

3300
03:17:41,840 --> 03:17:45,360
No, see, I'm going to run

3301
03:17:54,240 --> 03:17:54,680
again.

3302
03:17:54,680 --> 03:17:57,040
Where did you get the link in 25

3303
03:18:01,520 --> 03:18:01,960
bullet.

3304
03:18:01,960 --> 03:18:03,480
I did get this target for that.

3305
03:18:03,480 --> 03:18:05,080
It is generating

3306
03:18:05,480 --> 03:18:10,920
it generating automatically.

3307
03:18:10,920 --> 03:18:11,680
Yes, yes, yes.

3308
03:18:11,680 --> 03:18:12,920
I will commit.

3309
03:18:12,920 --> 03:18:13,920
I will commit nobody.

3310
03:18:13,920 --> 03:18:16,040
I'm just showing this thing. Good.

3311
03:18:16,040 --> 03:18:20,400
So now see, it got executed
so 130 line number 25 this link.

3312
03:18:20,400 --> 03:18:22,080
There is no link.

3313
03:18:22,080 --> 03:18:22,560
No one.

3314
03:18:22,560 --> 03:18:23,480
That's what I'm seeing.

3315
03:18:23,480 --> 03:18:25,800
See, I need a stable report.

3316
03:18:26,160 --> 03:18:27,760
So I wrote a story.

3317
03:18:27,760 --> 03:18:30,120
I need a target folder.

3318
03:18:30,120 --> 03:18:33,880
So I wrote Target
and then I provide in target folder.

3319
03:18:33,880 --> 03:18:35,640
I need to do HTML report.

3320
03:18:35,640 --> 03:18:39,720
So I put slash HD with made bullet.

3321
03:18:40,400 --> 03:18:41,880
Where did you get the target folder?

3322
03:18:41,880 --> 03:18:43,280
It's generated by default.

3323
03:18:43,280 --> 03:18:45,720
It is not in your project.

3324
03:18:45,720 --> 03:18:47,800
It should be in your project was taken

3325
03:18:49,680 --> 03:18:51,600

3326
03:18:51,600 --> 03:18:53,920

03:19:46,320 --> 03:19:58,320
I have better.

3342
03:19:58,320 --> 03:20:01,480
So you're executing it
Employee feature please check in

3343
03:20:01,560 --> 03:20:02,800
employee feature with that.

3344
03:20:02,800 --> 03:20:04,560
This is not.

3345
03:20:04,560 --> 03:20:06,320
I believe you do not have this look. Did

3346
03:20:11,640 --> 03:20:12,680
you put up two features?

3347
03:20:12,680 --> 03:20:15,880
Only read the manga we made nauseous.

3348
03:20:16,480 --> 03:20:19,280
We got this good to fresh
geometric pokemon but in their target

3349
03:20:19,280 --> 03:20:23,200
folder right?

3350
03:20:23,200 --> 03:20:23,880
Right.

3351
03:20:24,160 --> 03:20:27,440
Just right click on this report.

3352
03:20:27,440 --> 03:20:29,640
Right click on the report

3353
03:20:29,640 --> 03:20:33,360
open in browser Chrome.

3354
03:20:33,840 --> 03:20:35,760
And then you did the same thing.

3355
03:20:35,760 --> 03:20:38,760
Almost your entire group, the same thing.

3356
03:20:38,760 --> 03:20:42,920
Be right click open in browser,

3357
03:20:43,280 --> 03:20:46,920
open it in Chrome.

3358
03:20:46,920 --> 03:20:48,600
Now you'll see.

3359
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:51,120
Now you'll see this part.

3360
03:20:51,120 --> 03:20:54,120
It says it is past scenario.

3361
03:20:54,200 --> 03:20:54,840
Great.

3362
03:20:55,240 --> 03:20:58,760
This is name server
operating system duration

3363
03:20:59,320 --> 03:21:02,760
could be paused one scenario
for scenario three

3364
03:21:03,040 --> 03:21:04,960
I would know. See

3365
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:07,400
which scenario is bundled.

3366
03:21:07,400 --> 03:21:11,040
So the login feature is must beg

3367
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:14,600
and then it is smoke deck light scenario.

3368
03:21:14,600 --> 03:21:16,920
Well lobby.

3369
03:21:16,920 --> 03:21:22,440
These are all the steps right?

3370
03:21:22,440 --> 03:21:25,120
It shows me the operating system.

3371
03:21:25,120 --> 03:21:25,920
Mine is an event.

3372
03:21:25,920 --> 03:21:29,400
I don't know whether it's
not of digital 11 or work Spy.

3373
03:21:30,560 --> 03:21:30,840
It is

3374
03:21:30,840 --> 03:21:34,880
60 forward processor So this point now
see every step red.

3375
03:21:34,880 --> 03:21:36,320
You see the green peak.

3376
03:21:36,320 --> 03:21:38,440
It means every step straight.

3377
03:21:38,440 --> 03:21:40,360
It is green, it's clear.

3378
03:21:40,360 --> 03:21:41,520
And you see

3379
03:21:46,480 --> 03:21:48,960
now only, isn't it
the correct report to share it

3380
03:21:48,960 --> 03:21:53,000
with your management in causing death
culminate this because as you execute it

3381
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:54,520
in this particular discipline begins

3382
03:21:54,520 --> 03:21:59,160
and please show this report
it is already to this right now.

3383
03:21:59,160 --> 03:22:01,720
Let me do it
now. Let me do it for ignition.

3384
03:22:01,760 --> 03:22:03,000
Big week.

3385
03:22:03,840 --> 03:22:06,880
It means it means the people
after small create.

3386
03:22:06,880 --> 03:22:10,720
When it was searching for smoke,
two in one it got smoke in four.

3387
03:22:10,720 --> 03:22:12,240
It didn't get the smoke.

3388
03:22:12,240 --> 03:22:14,240
So these are total fights in one.

3389
03:22:14,240 --> 03:22:15,640
One did good.

3390
03:22:15,720 --> 03:22:18,240
Now see what I'm going to do here.

3391
03:22:18,240 --> 03:22:20,720
I'm going to change this day to.

3392
03:22:20,720 --> 03:22:21,320
Integration,

3393
03:22:22,320 --> 03:22:23,560
integration, and now

3394
03:22:23,560 --> 03:22:27,600
I'm going to execute it.

3395
03:22:27,600 --> 03:22:29,240
How to open? Yeah, I'm.

3396
03:22:29,240 --> 03:22:32,040
I'm going to show you
just now I'm going to open another one.

3397
03:22:32,280 --> 03:22:33,800
Just give me a moment.

3398
03:22:33,800 --> 03:22:34,560
Make me insecure.

3399
03:22:34,560 --> 03:23:00,000
Discord first.

3400
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:01,840
What that means, according to their take,

3401
03:23:01,840 --> 03:23:05,520
it means it was searching
for all the scenarios for the smoke bag.

3402
03:23:05,760 --> 03:23:07,160
And in those scenarios

3403
03:23:07,160 --> 03:23:11,600
it got one smoke that would mean
one in the meaning for one unknown

3404
03:23:11,600 --> 03:23:17,880
because there was no input we provided
whether it is integration or work.

3405
03:23:17,880 --> 03:23:18,760
Yes, it will.

3406
03:23:18,760 --> 03:23:21,400
It will. It will.

3407
03:23:21,960 --> 03:23:24,040
What regulation in my guess is smoke
doesn't

3408
03:23:24,040 --> 03:23:26,280
because Nick, what are you need to wait
and it is because as the

3409
03:23:26,320 --> 03:23:29,960
smoke went explode is not running
or maybe you didn't provide penalty.

3410
03:23:30,320 --> 03:23:32,040
So once you put where you provided
the light.

3411
03:23:32,040 --> 03:23:35,480
No, just put you
keep your part in features slash

3412
03:23:35,520 --> 03:23:54,960
and then it will work work.

3413
03:23:54,960 --> 03:23:57,760
Yes. Yes,
we can do that. We can do this. I

3414
03:24:01,320 --> 03:24:01,880
what if we

3415
03:24:01,880 --> 03:24:04,600
rename the smoke one
and then again for the duration.

3416
03:24:05,640 --> 03:24:09,120
The decompression will reportedly

3417
03:24:09,120 --> 03:24:12,680
want know that they would want they want.

3418
03:24:12,840 --> 03:24:14,960
But we don't need to do
all of these things.

3419
03:24:15,080 --> 03:24:15,800
That's what I'm saying.

3420
03:24:15,800 --> 03:24:18,600
We don't need to do all of these things.

3421
03:24:18,600 --> 03:24:20,840
We have lot more good options
in decompression.

3422
03:24:21,240 --> 03:24:24,120
It was just I'm telling you
one options are the one thing.

3423
03:24:25,560 --> 03:24:27,120
Like I said, after a couple of time,

3424
03:24:27,120 --> 03:24:31,960
after a couple of glasses you will see
and then you will get confused.

3425
03:24:31,960 --> 03:24:34,480
Which option I showed you was
Every option is pretty nice.

3426
03:24:35,200 --> 03:25:17,760
Yes, correct. Try.

3427
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:21,840
So this time,
if we go ahead and do the project

3428
03:25:21,840 --> 03:25:22,960
from this

3429
03:25:24,920 --> 03:25:27,120
in that I'm going to open it.

3430
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:29,880
So see now Alex eight click

3431
03:25:30,840 --> 03:25:32,400
open in

3432
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:37,440
browser Chrome.

3433
03:25:37,440 --> 03:25:38,120
Now can you see

3434
03:25:38,120 --> 03:25:42,000
there is an employee feature employee
search feature logging feature

3435
03:25:43,080 --> 03:25:46,000
right now
you'll see execution somebody then menus

3436
03:25:46,440 --> 03:25:51,200
for only one unknown
because one was selected to smoke correct.

3437
03:25:51,520 --> 03:25:53,880
So it fine not infotech integration

3438
03:25:54,760 --> 03:25:56,040
and you see

3439
03:25:59,400 --> 03:26:00,840
open this,

3440
03:26:01,800 --> 03:26:04,400
open this right
it gives all the right things

3441
03:26:05,200 --> 03:26:08,320
open this one also you'll see
both those scenarios available here

3442
03:26:08,320 --> 03:26:11,480
right with regression take they open

3443
03:26:11,480 --> 03:26:14,360
this one also, it gives you the detail
of this scenario as well.

3444
03:26:14,920 --> 03:26:19,280
So now every single scenario,
along with the detail of every step

3445
03:26:19,280 --> 03:26:22,600
and with this status,
whether it is buzzword made available here

3446
03:26:22,920 --> 03:26:34,400
in this achievement report, so far,
so good.

3447
03:26:34,400 --> 03:26:35,280
Everyone

3448
03:26:46,320 --> 03:26:47,520
is that anyone

3449
03:26:47,520 --> 03:26:50,480
who has any question
in this particular code,

3450
03:26:51,360 --> 03:27:00,600
anyone who has any question
question, we're going to get it.

3451
03:27:00,720 --> 03:27:01,920
This isn't going to

3452
03:27:08,280 --> 03:27:10,240
don't don't do anything.

3453
03:27:10,240 --> 03:27:12,320
No, please, no, don't respect.

3454
03:27:12,320 --> 03:27:13,920
They're not the beginning.

3455
03:27:13,920 --> 03:27:23,600
We will be able to.

3456
03:27:23,600 --> 03:27:26,960
And I do mean that a lot to remember.

3457
03:27:27,000 --> 03:27:29,160
That's what framework is all about, right?

3458
03:27:29,160 --> 03:27:31,320
It doesn't need your intelligence.

3459
03:27:31,320 --> 03:27:33,920
It needs your focus

3460
03:27:33,920 --> 03:27:34,640
right.

3461
03:27:35,720 --> 03:27:39,680
If you know what are the things
you have to implement in the framework

3462
03:27:40,360 --> 03:27:47,040
next.

3463
03:27:47,040 --> 03:27:50,240
If I keep the meeting,
the code name names in the class, ma'am.

3464
03:27:50,280 --> 03:27:52,440
And it would be difficult, right.

3465
03:27:52,440 --> 03:27:55,640
But like we're doing
after training every single step.

3466
03:27:55,640 --> 03:27:59,520
So it means it seems like I'm
committing the code, but there's like a

3467
03:27:59,520 --> 03:28:04,560
you I'm going.

3468
03:28:04,560 --> 03:28:05,360
What happens is

3469
03:28:05,360 --> 03:28:09,600
sometimes if I come with the code
and let's say something slipped on my mind

3470
03:28:09,600 --> 03:28:12,880
and the code is incomplete,
then everyone get an incomplete code.

3471
03:28:13,800 --> 03:28:15,040
So this is also dangerous.

3472
03:28:15,040 --> 03:28:17,040
I mean, we should not do this
content on this.

3473
03:28:17,040 --> 03:28:23,160
We are done with the complete task,
but let's do it for now.

3474
03:28:23,160 --> 03:28:27,440
Fine, fine.

3475
03:28:27,440 --> 03:28:29,520
Because we do know everything is okay.

3476
03:28:30,360 --> 03:28:32,760
This should be possible for that.

3477
03:28:32,760 --> 03:28:36,400
Is it one type of report of the auditor's
report also.

3478
03:28:36,640 --> 03:28:38,760
So one, we do this one by one, right?

3479
03:28:38,760 --> 03:28:40,840
So I was about to expand this point based.

3480
03:28:41,400 --> 03:28:43,680
Right now we have only one plugin.

3481
03:28:44,320 --> 03:28:46,080
Great for the reports.

3482
03:28:46,080 --> 03:28:48,360
In future
we will add more plugins for that.

3483
03:28:48,840 --> 03:28:51,840
We will add more plugins
for different because this

3484
03:28:54,520 --> 03:28:56,000
why we make extremely poor.

3485
03:28:56,000 --> 03:28:57,120
Do we have any other option?

3486
03:28:57,120 --> 03:29:01,200
What can we make?

3487
03:29:01,200 --> 03:29:02,760
Except for the board?

3488
03:29:02,760 --> 03:29:09,600
You need to take simply.

3489
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:12,840
Oh, you learned one credit report
or something.

3490
03:29:12,840 --> 03:29:16,560
Read to me on this word. Yes. Yes.

3491
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:17,520
You remember that report?

3492
03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:21,280
Actually the final report
this that asking the question in this word

3493
03:29:21,480 --> 03:29:25,680
and excel by No, sorry, we do not have
any API to call this kind of things.

3494
03:29:25,680 --> 03:29:29,040
These are the forms supported
by good conversion rate.

3495
03:29:29,480 --> 03:29:32,280
So when we say the forward
supported by what we can do

3496
03:29:32,280 --> 03:29:34,920
only this things,
we can not create any excellent report

3497
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:37,160
automatically.

3498
03:29:37,160 --> 03:29:37,440
Right.

3499
03:29:37,440 --> 03:29:41,040
And again, unless we have an API come

3500
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:41,680
and Ms.

3501
03:29:41,680 --> 03:29:44,040
Word has nothing to do with it.

3502
03:29:44,040 --> 03:29:46,200
No might be a quite poor thing.

3503
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:48,600
And for in this word alright it is.

3504
03:29:48,600 --> 03:29:49,680
Even though it is a ms.

3505
03:29:49,680 --> 03:29:52,400
word online
and this word based top application.

3506
03:29:52,400 --> 03:29:54,960
But to get it is not integration of Ms.

3507
03:29:54,960 --> 03:29:56,880
word with your particular part.

3508
03:29:56,880 --> 03:30:00,840
That's when nowhere
but you simply can generate just one word

3509
03:30:00,960 --> 03:30:02,280
that we will generate.

3510
03:30:02,280 --> 03:30:04,640
We can generate a multiple
they get in Greek.

3511
03:30:04,960 --> 03:30:08,880
Okay, so these are more graphical
reports, right?

3512
03:30:08,920 --> 03:30:10,640
You see this information.

3513
03:30:10,640 --> 03:30:13,120
Right. It's pretty much clear information.

3514
03:30:13,120 --> 03:30:14,240
What we are seeing here,

3515
03:30:15,400 --> 03:30:18,280
this is very pretty much consolidated
information.

3516
03:30:18,280 --> 03:30:23,160
Now, if it does this is prepared for,
if you call this estimate,

3517
03:30:23,200 --> 03:30:26,280
it just put these things details
into that forward and gives you

3518
03:30:26,280 --> 03:30:32,120
this cutting, cutting.

3519
03:30:32,120 --> 03:30:35,080
So simply we have to use this
general report is of no

3520
03:30:37,760 --> 03:30:39,680
industrial so far

3521
03:30:47,040 --> 03:30:48,360
which link

3522
03:30:52,080 --> 03:30:55,680
are not it is it is
it belongs to my local.

3523
03:30:55,680 --> 03:30:57,760
You also have this link grade.

3524
03:30:57,760 --> 03:31:00,440
You also have this link in yours.

3525
03:31:00,960 --> 03:31:03,960
So we can't share this report
link to anyone, right?

3526
03:31:04,200 --> 03:31:06,600
We can take the screenshot of it
and we can put

3527
03:31:08,280 --> 03:31:10,920
any. It's going to be work on your local

3528
03:31:14,160 --> 03:31:16,520
to get the consolidated report.

3529
03:31:16,520 --> 03:31:19,160
You need to execute it
locally, Put it in one report.

3530
03:31:19,320 --> 03:31:22,800
Take this to be paid
for your global report.

3531
03:31:22,800 --> 03:31:25,880
We have another tool great for that
we don't have to was

3532
03:31:25,960 --> 03:31:26,720
we have to stop

3533
03:31:26,720 --> 03:31:30,040
executing everything on Google and
we have to institute everything on cloud.

3534
03:31:30,480 --> 03:31:31,720
That's what we have to do.

3535
03:31:31,720 --> 03:31:34,640
So for cloud version, we have separate
reporting structure there.

3536
03:31:34,680 --> 03:31:37,440
We just click on cloud
and it gets automatically

3537
03:31:37,920 --> 03:31:41,000
same to everyone, but everyone there.

3538
03:31:41,040 --> 03:31:43,480
It's a different sort of that
we already have known for.

3539
03:31:43,480 --> 03:31:45,280
They will talk about that, but also.

3540
03:31:45,280 --> 03:31:48,360
Okay, great.

3541
03:31:48,360 --> 03:31:51,040
Now basics. So focus on basics.

3542
03:31:52,040 --> 03:31:52,800
It's going to be work

3543
03:31:52,800 --> 03:31:56,360
on your local network is going to

3544
03:31:56,880 --> 03:31:58,560
find instruments.

3545
03:31:58,960 --> 03:32:08,720
Shall we proceed for that?

3546
03:32:08,720 --> 03:32:10,800
So far everything is clear,
Everything is good.

3547
03:32:10,800 --> 03:32:21,520
So now,

3548
03:32:23,160 --> 03:32:25,600
now see, now see what I'm going to

3549
03:32:27,480 --> 03:32:29,360
write to keep this up.

3550
03:32:29,360 --> 03:32:32,640
So keep this here. Also

3551
03:32:33,360 --> 03:32:39,120
from here onwards, change should work.

3552
03:32:39,680 --> 03:32:42,320
No, no, no. You shall.

3553
03:32:42,320 --> 03:32:43,560
You should. You must.

3554
03:32:43,560 --> 03:32:48,200
You will share, should, must, will.

3555
03:32:48,200 --> 03:32:51,400
All right.

3556
03:32:51,400 --> 03:32:52,720
We can share them.

3557
03:32:52,720 --> 03:32:55,680
Yes, yes, yes, we can share with.

3558
03:32:55,680 --> 03:32:58,080
We can share with everybody
all of this things.

3559
03:32:58,080 --> 03:32:59,520
How we can share the

3560
03:33:06,960 --> 03:33:07,960
current

3561
03:33:09,880 --> 03:33:11,400
with half of my brain.

3562
03:33:11,400 --> 03:33:12,960
Are you guys tired?

3563
03:33:12,960 --> 03:33:15,480
You need a break for one minute,
60 seconds

3564
03:33:16,440 --> 03:33:19,200
with our break and then we'll start.

3565
03:33:19,200 --> 03:33:20,040
Okay.

3566
03:33:20,920 --> 03:33:23,640
Let me stop the recording

3567
03:33:24,080 --> 03:33:24,480
frame.

3568
03:33:25,680 --> 03:33:26,760
Very interesting thing.

3569
03:33:26,760 --> 03:33:27,720
I would do this.

3570
03:33:27,720 --> 03:33:29,280
You see

3571
03:33:29,520 --> 03:33:33,480
any any

3572
03:33:36,800 --> 03:33:38,880
event, talk about

3573
03:33:38,880 --> 03:33:41,280
these five steps in.

3574
03:33:41,280 --> 03:33:43,680
These five steps

3575
03:33:43,800 --> 03:33:47,040
right in this length to determine

3576
03:33:47,040 --> 03:33:49,240
how many steps are gone.

3577
03:33:49,240 --> 03:33:50,160
First,

3578
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:53,920
for example, you see here, given you
that is never going

3579
03:33:54,080 --> 03:33:56,880
to a gentleman's application,

3580
03:33:57,480 --> 03:33:58,720
given you that is maybe going

3581
03:33:58,720 --> 03:34:01,040
to duplicate him as the politician getting

3582
03:34:02,160 --> 03:34:02,920
now witnesses.

3583
03:34:02,920 --> 03:34:06,200
When you letting this video
is this username and password

3584
03:34:06,800 --> 03:34:12,160
and here it is been user interface
related admin to username and password.

3585
03:34:12,160 --> 03:34:15,240
So this this step is common among

3586
03:34:16,280 --> 03:34:18,720
the initiative was not common.

3587
03:34:18,800 --> 03:34:21,240
So we have to find we have to find

3588
03:34:21,600 --> 03:34:25,320
let's see another scenario
just for consideration and see.

3589
03:34:25,320 --> 03:34:26,640
Let's take another scenario.

3590
03:34:26,640 --> 03:34:32,880
So this in any undertaking,

3591
03:34:32,880 --> 03:34:36,720
I'm taking another scenario here
that it really should find.

3592
03:34:37,280 --> 03:34:39,120
This scenario I'm thinking is

3593
03:34:40,360 --> 03:34:42,480
not just consider for a reason.

3594
03:34:43,160 --> 03:34:43,800
Right.

3595
03:34:43,920 --> 03:34:46,160
And another scenario, anyway,

3596
03:34:46,920 --> 03:34:49,040
just to explain, you

3597
03:34:53,880 --> 03:34:55,880
know, expert mobility,

3598
03:34:56,680 --> 03:34:58,520
I'm saying in employee.

3599
03:34:58,520 --> 03:35:00,960
So something this something like this.

3600
03:35:00,960 --> 03:35:08,400
See how many scenarios I have no guys home
in this scenario, scenarios I have

3601
03:35:10,200 --> 03:35:11,800
foreseen and use

3602
03:35:12,320 --> 03:35:13,680
in this all scenarios.

3603
03:35:13,680 --> 03:35:16,280
Do you see my starting a step?

3604
03:35:16,280 --> 03:35:21,240
You see my starting step is can you see
here is a step business steps.

3605
03:35:21,680 --> 03:35:25,320
And after this step,
my next state is different.

3606
03:35:25,520 --> 03:35:28,440
Enable is in any correct

3607
03:35:29,000 --> 03:35:29,720
correct.

3608
03:35:30,400 --> 03:35:33,640
So when my from the point from the point

3609
03:35:33,640 --> 03:35:38,400
where my steps is changing,
domestic is different.

3610
03:35:38,400 --> 03:35:44,240
It means from this point I will keep this
code as it used in my scenario. Why?

3611
03:35:44,600 --> 03:35:47,200
Because might be possible
when my step is changing.

3612
03:35:47,200 --> 03:35:49,760
That after
the next step will also be changed.

3613
03:35:50,520 --> 03:35:50,880
Right?

3614
03:35:51,880 --> 03:35:54,240
If the step
is standing, it means code is changing.

3615
03:35:54,640 --> 03:35:57,560
But before date, whatever the steps I see,

3616
03:35:57,880 --> 03:36:02,040
these steps are common
here, here, here also.

3617
03:36:02,200 --> 03:36:04,400
And you know these steps are common.

3618
03:36:04,840 --> 03:36:06,360
So it doesn't make sense

3619
03:36:06,360 --> 03:36:09,680
to write a step again and again
and again in every scenario.

3620
03:36:10,480 --> 03:36:15,800
Isn't it a good idea if I have just one
something where I put this particular

3621
03:36:15,880 --> 03:36:20,240
step in one place and this is step
will run for my entire feature? Why?

3622
03:36:21,240 --> 03:36:25,320
Mark my words,
I will keep this step in one place

3623
03:36:25,320 --> 03:36:28,160
that will run for my entire feature.

3624
03:36:28,440 --> 03:36:31,920
It means only applicable to this feature

3625
03:36:31,960 --> 03:36:34,680
by not for all the other feature points.

3626
03:36:35,160 --> 03:36:41,680
Make sure this point the support everyone.

3627
03:36:41,680 --> 03:36:43,080
So now

3628
03:36:43,560 --> 03:36:46,200
then about no common feature.

3629
03:36:46,200 --> 03:36:50,680
So that's the problem with you
know on just let me complete

3630
03:36:52,640 --> 03:36:53,760
so now

3631
03:36:53,760 --> 03:36:59,480
now when you realize and when you see
when you see any step

3632
03:36:59,960 --> 03:37:03,000
which is common among all the scenarios

3633
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:07,200
in particular
a feature find, you identify that step

3634
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:11,600
you have to keep that particular
step in one keyword

3635
03:37:11,600 --> 03:37:14,720
guide big.

3636
03:37:14,720 --> 03:37:19,160
What do you have to do
to keep that state in your income

3637
03:37:20,720 --> 03:37:25,840
and the industry? This

3638
03:37:27,840 --> 03:37:30,520
Now see what I'm going to do now.

3639
03:37:30,520 --> 03:37:31,520
See what I'm going to.

3640
03:37:31,520 --> 03:37:34,400
Let me delete this step from here.

3641
03:37:35,360 --> 03:37:38,680
Now, we are not going to a
we are to reduce the code.

3642
03:37:38,680 --> 03:37:42,000
We are we are moving to reduce the code,
to increase

3643
03:37:42,760 --> 03:37:47,000
remove this, remove this

3644
03:37:48,760 --> 03:37:50,040
and remove this.

3645
03:37:50,040 --> 03:37:53,960
So on the same thing you can do
for any number of scenarios.

3646
03:37:53,960 --> 03:37:55,160
Understood.

3647
03:37:55,160 --> 03:37:57,360
These two scenarios are just scenarios.

3648
03:37:57,800 --> 03:37:59,120
It has nothing to do.

3649
03:37:59,120 --> 03:38:01,680
So I'm going to delete
this in any case. Now see

3650
03:38:02,800 --> 03:38:04,960
this background part what it does,

3651
03:38:04,960 --> 03:38:08,320
this big chrome
will work for this scenario.

3652
03:38:08,800 --> 03:38:11,160
So first how it works that we should

3653
03:38:15,000 --> 03:38:20,760
if I write something in background right.

3654
03:38:20,760 --> 03:38:23,160
So if I'm writing the

3655
03:38:23,160 --> 03:38:25,120
step common

3656
03:38:27,840 --> 03:38:30,880
and then I have similar you

3657
03:38:31,320 --> 03:38:34,440
and then I understand that you

3658
03:38:34,440 --> 03:38:36,840
scenario one and scenario two.

3659
03:38:36,840 --> 03:38:38,200
So what happens?

3660
03:38:38,200 --> 03:38:41,360
First,
it will execute this background step,

3661
03:38:42,120 --> 03:38:45,440
then execute this scenario, then again

3662
03:38:45,440 --> 03:38:49,200
execute big time
and then execute this scenario.

3663
03:38:49,520 --> 03:38:53,160
It means before this finale,
you in this scenario

3664
03:38:53,440 --> 03:38:56,720
this is steps
will execute in this background

3665
03:38:56,720 --> 03:38:59,760
will applicable
for your particular feature.

3666
03:38:59,760 --> 03:39:03,440
Find this to this point

3667
03:39:05,520 --> 03:39:08,160
big ground is applicable
to particular feature.

3668
03:39:08,160 --> 03:39:12,080
Right
which will execute before every scenario

3669
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:15,560
almost like before method kind current

3670
03:39:16,720 --> 03:39:18,960
thing getting background

3671
03:39:19,080 --> 03:39:26,800
understood.

3672
03:39:26,800 --> 03:39:31,200
Now companies employ such feature that
you will see the actual essence of this

3673
03:39:31,920 --> 03:39:33,360
not in me.

3674
03:39:33,360 --> 03:39:36,000
These are steps changing
when you are implemented employ

3675
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:40,560
and when user interest will employ me
before this.

3676
03:39:40,560 --> 03:39:41,840
How many are common?

3677
03:39:43,000 --> 03:39:45,000
Five is steps are common, but not any

3678
03:39:47,880 --> 03:39:48,520
day cycle.

3679
03:39:48,520 --> 03:39:50,040
Steps are common.

3680
03:39:50,160 --> 03:39:52,800
Just remove this five steps from here

3681
03:39:53,600 --> 03:39:56,240
and put it in the

3682
03:39:56,240 --> 03:39:58,560
big task.

3683
03:39:58,600 --> 03:40:00,760
Remove this five steps from here.

3684
03:40:02,080 --> 03:40:04,080
Now see, my scenario gets shorter,

3685
03:40:04,960 --> 03:40:18,520
isn't it?

3686
03:40:18,520 --> 03:40:23,920
So that way if you have multiple
scenarios in each five and then you see

3687
03:40:23,920 --> 03:40:27,160
a lot of normal seamless steps, rate them

3688
03:40:27,160 --> 03:40:29,640
available, This is exactly what I wanted.

3689
03:40:30,720 --> 03:40:31,200
All right.

3690
03:40:31,200 --> 03:40:33,840
And now you've got it right.

3691
03:40:33,840 --> 03:40:35,920
So now what

3692
03:40:37,280 --> 03:40:39,280
if this so much cleaner

3693
03:40:39,280 --> 03:40:43,280
getting to correct?

3694
03:40:43,280 --> 03:40:44,880
And that's what I'm saying.

3695
03:40:44,880 --> 03:40:48,360
If you allow me for a couple of classes,
you will get every single

3696
03:40:48,360 --> 03:40:51,600
answer to one of your questions.

3697
03:40:51,600 --> 03:40:52,320
All right.

3698
03:40:52,320 --> 03:40:54,600
I still remember. Take a screenshot
method.

3699
03:40:55,360 --> 03:40:58,320
Strongly
believe that I will definitely implement.

3700
03:40:59,600 --> 03:41:02,720
I still
remember maven part compiler source.

3701
03:41:02,760 --> 03:41:04,440
I will explain.

3702
03:41:04,440 --> 03:41:07,560
I remember all of those points,

3703
03:41:08,400 --> 03:41:11,840
but if I extend those points as of now
it is of no use.

3704
03:41:12,760 --> 03:41:15,360
So there is a particular series of steps
that should follow.

3705
03:41:15,480 --> 03:41:18,000
Index would be one of the great

3706
03:41:18,960 --> 03:41:19,640
so far so good.

3707
03:41:19,640 --> 03:41:21,720
With this point students,

3708
03:41:21,920 --> 03:41:27,200
can we jump in slip common lines?

3709
03:41:27,200 --> 03:41:29,560
No, no. It should be in the flow.

3710
03:41:30,120 --> 03:41:34,200
See, this is the flow
and then it is coming, right?

3711
03:41:34,720 --> 03:41:37,840
This is the flow
and then it is coming straight.

3712
03:41:38,160 --> 03:41:41,080
If you jump in between,
then you're breaking the flow.

3713
03:41:41,200 --> 03:41:42,760
And if you're breaking the flow,

3714
03:41:42,760 --> 03:41:46,080
it means you're playing with
the application in an appropriate way.

3715
03:41:46,440 --> 03:41:47,880
So it's not going to work.

3716
03:41:47,880 --> 03:41:51,960
It's not going to be in there.

3717
03:41:51,960 --> 03:41:56,320
All right.

3718
03:41:56,320 --> 03:41:59,840
Then you have something for the end
line to use or close the browser.

3719
03:42:00,360 --> 03:42:02,280
We are going to go in there.

3720
03:42:02,280 --> 03:42:04,800
We are going to hold your horses. Read

3721
03:42:05,760 --> 03:42:08,040
one thing, one thing, background in

3722
03:42:09,360 --> 03:42:11,800
background,
and no point of editing background.

3723
03:42:11,800 --> 03:42:14,680
As of now, the only native drawings
because we have just one scenario

3724
03:42:15,240 --> 03:42:18,800
after something will add

3725
03:42:19,080 --> 03:42:20,240
nasty.

3726
03:42:20,240 --> 03:42:23,160
Nasty.
Let me execute this log in scenario.

3727
03:42:23,200 --> 03:42:25,640
Let's check
whether it is executing or more

3728
03:42:26,720 --> 03:42:27,600
so intentionally.

3729
03:42:27,600 --> 03:42:30,720
I'm going to write this logging
non feature

3730
03:42:31,520 --> 03:42:33,960
and here this is the regulation take.

3731
03:42:34,800 --> 03:42:37,400
If we copy this, take and put it

3732
03:42:38,800 --> 03:42:39,400
in, put it.

3733
03:42:39,400 --> 03:42:42,200
Here is the regression.

3734
03:42:42,200 --> 03:42:45,920
It also read

3735
03:42:49,080 --> 03:42:50,360
what a beautiful horse

3736
03:42:50,360 --> 03:42:56,280
the manuscript.

3737
03:42:56,280 --> 03:42:58,640
Nice look, It is small.

3738
03:42:58,680 --> 03:43:05,120
It is a killer.

3739
03:43:05,120 --> 03:43:06,600
Very cute

3740
03:43:16,480 --> 03:43:17,560
case.

3741
03:43:17,960 --> 03:43:20,760
It is equal trade for both the test plane

3742
03:43:23,520 --> 03:43:24,600
validates

3743
03:43:24,960 --> 03:43:29,120
it executed for both the test
with background keyword.

3744
03:43:29,640 --> 03:43:32,640
So background keyword is applicable.

3745
03:43:32,640 --> 03:43:35,160
Let me put this into the notes.

3746
03:43:35,160 --> 03:43:36,080
It only moves

3747
03:43:37,560 --> 03:43:37,920
in there.

3748
03:43:37,920 --> 03:43:39,720
Another class trade class.

3749
03:43:39,720 --> 03:43:42,200
I did all the things, the features

3750
03:43:43,200 --> 03:43:47,520
I extended definition is available,
the new definition is available.

3751
03:43:47,520 --> 03:43:50,720
This it in

3752
03:43:50,720 --> 03:43:53,920
both bags

3753
03:43:53,920 --> 03:43:57,120
linings is bring everything is available.

3754
03:43:57,120 --> 03:44:00,000
This reduced definition is this then

3755
03:44:01,960 --> 03:44:05,200
make it

3756
03:44:05,200 --> 03:44:07,120
applicable

3757
03:44:07,920 --> 03:44:10,400
only for

3758
03:44:11,600 --> 03:44:13,680
feature length only for

3759
03:44:15,440 --> 03:44:17,760
one feature. Find

3760
03:44:18,600 --> 03:44:21,160
your own

3761
03:44:22,840 --> 03:44:27,480
common is on all this is

3762
03:44:30,240 --> 03:44:32,400
so you can
you should log in which feature yes

3763
03:44:32,400 --> 03:44:34,760
shows of is to get you

3764
03:44:45,320 --> 03:44:46,880
now guys see

3765
03:44:47,200 --> 03:44:49,520
you will see this one
additional error here

3766
03:44:50,760 --> 03:44:53,080
can you log in picture
this are additional error.

3767
03:44:53,080 --> 03:44:56,840
No everyone

3768
03:44:56,840 --> 03:44:58,080
click on it

3769
03:44:58,880 --> 03:45:01,320
click on it and you're just given use.

3770
03:45:01,320 --> 03:45:03,440
It is navigating
to a gentleman's application.

3771
03:45:04,400 --> 03:45:09,000
See it is showing you
what this states is available

3772
03:45:09,000 --> 03:45:15,240
here, which is going to execute this one
and this one.

3773
03:45:15,240 --> 03:45:19,200
Similarly, you go here,
you will see this steps are available

3774
03:45:20,880 --> 03:45:21,840
here also.

3775
03:45:21,840 --> 03:45:24,120
This is steps are available.

3776
03:45:24,120 --> 03:45:26,160
I don't have they did
what are you here to execute

3777
03:45:27,320 --> 03:45:28,400
you get the

3778
03:45:33,240 --> 03:45:33,680
data.

3779
03:45:33,680 --> 03:45:40,880
Congratulations
then error doesn't matter. Yes.

3780
03:45:41,040 --> 03:45:42,440
Yes. Correct.

3781
03:45:42,960 --> 03:45:44,840
It is just additional info I'm giving.

3782
03:45:44,840 --> 03:45:45,440
Great.

3783
03:45:45,480 --> 03:45:48,160
But if you know
the meaning of become blank, there's

3784
03:45:48,160 --> 03:45:49,560
more than enough

3785
03:45:55,920 --> 03:45:58,320
nosey guys here.

3786
03:45:58,320 --> 03:46:00,480
Here in this is step

3787
03:46:00,480 --> 03:46:04,440
background is steps are different
but when you go in employ

3788
03:46:04,440 --> 03:46:08,040
search here you'll see background
the steps are different correct.

3789
03:46:08,560 --> 03:46:09,720
Why is it so?

3790
03:46:09,720 --> 03:46:12,520
Because your background is changing class.

3791
03:46:12,560 --> 03:46:14,680
A feature to feature

3792
03:46:14,680 --> 03:46:16,200
one feature is different.

3793
03:46:16,200 --> 03:46:18,240
In another feature it is different trait.

3794
03:46:18,240 --> 03:46:20,920
So actually in our bedroom

3795
03:46:21,160 --> 03:46:23,840
we are identifying only those steps

3796
03:46:24,120 --> 03:46:27,920
which are common among all the scenarios
in one particular picture place

3797
03:46:29,760 --> 03:46:30,960
in one particular feature.

3798
03:46:30,960 --> 03:46:35,000
Right?

3799
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:37,680
No, no. If you have just one
just because then what is the reason?

3800
03:46:37,680 --> 03:46:41,920
Good big company.

3801
03:46:41,920 --> 03:46:44,800
Like I said, among all the scenarios,

3802
03:46:45,840 --> 03:46:50,920
among all these scenarios,
if we have steps common Yeah, yeah.

3803
03:46:51,440 --> 03:46:53,880
That's
what I'm giving you the clarification.

3804
03:46:53,880 --> 03:46:57,360
So when we a common two steps in one
scenario, we can not have common states

3805
03:46:57,800 --> 03:47:00,600
minimum rules in areas
we need to have made some things

3806
03:47:00,600 --> 03:47:03,520
which are common, which are not common

3807
03:47:06,920 --> 03:47:08,000
streams.

3808
03:47:09,160 --> 03:47:10,080
So far so good.

3809
03:47:10,080 --> 03:47:10,920
Everyone

3810
03:47:23,080 --> 03:47:24,800
come with this code.

3811
03:47:24,800 --> 03:47:35,960
Also a beautiful one.

3812
03:47:36,000 --> 03:47:36,760
Massive.

3813
03:47:37,720 --> 03:47:40,720
This is what we call real will be

3814
03:47:40,720 --> 03:47:54,960
excellent.

3815
03:47:54,960 --> 03:47:56,400
Fine guys.

3816
03:47:56,680 --> 03:47:58,760
So I think I'm
then from my today's session

3817
03:47:58,760 --> 03:48:02,600
if you guys have any question
you can ask or we can have a big plus.
