1
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,400
All right.

2
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,800
All right, then.

3
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Good morning, everyone.

4
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,240
I hope you guys all excited.

5
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,640
I hope you guys all ready for the class.

6
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,240
Have your big cup of coffee, tea,
whatever.

7
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,880
Gives you the energy. Right.

8
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,360
I see people are excited.

9
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,440
All right, that's good. That's good.

10
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,440
Red Bull. Oh, wow. Ten in the morning.

11
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,960
If all of the Red Bull works for you,
then you're more than your.

12
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,240
You go have fun with the Red Bull.

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,400
Red Bull to Mohana.

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,840
If you haven't Red Bull as well,
we're on water.

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,880
All right, that's good.

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,760
What is the lemon?

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,920
Right.

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,080
All right.

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,920
Tell me.

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,720
Tell me about
how is your first week going?

21
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,640
Cardamom. Tea.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,040
I love that.

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,480
It's been great. Awesome.

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,720
With my wife.

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,960
Great. Pretty good.

26
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,560
You guys learn new things.
A lot of things with summer

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,000
Very well.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,360
Yes, Summer Zach is doing very amazing
class.

29
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,200
Usually everybody loves it.

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,360
But then Gemma class comes

31
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,760
and then people start living it
more, Right?

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,080
All right, guys.

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,040
So today's a Saturday, right? Is Saturday.

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,560
So from now on, guys,
your weekends will be with me

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,400
for the next four,
the next couple of weeks.

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,600
And here, guys,
we will be learning about our programing.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,600
Right.

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
All of you make things easy.

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,080
Of course you will make easiest
summer is amazing.

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,640
Summer is the best
motivator is the best speaker.

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,600
You guys will see him

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,200
next week.

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,080
He is going to do a quick recap with you.

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,920
And after that, you guys

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,400
not going to see him for some time,
but he will be coming here and there

46
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,680
talking to you guys, right, While

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,800
me and other instructor,
you'll be seeing a little bit more often.

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,400
Right?

49
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,200
Okay.

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,480
For those you guys don't
that don't know or maybe did not attend an

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
orientation class.

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,920
My name is so
I'll be one of you instructors guys.

53
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,120
Right.

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,360
We have multiple instructors
as we mentioned throughout this course

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,360
besides me teaching, you guys are going to
have our another great instructors guard

56
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,120
and he's been very amazing,
but stand as one to let him go.

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,200
So he's still with them yet.

58
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,800
And today we also guys have his support.

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,320
We have two instructors in there.

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,440
We have Mozambique and we have Shiva.

61
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,480
So any time, guys,

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,040
whenever we do in any practice today,
if you guys have any issues, any

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,560
questions, when you guys
are going to start in your code, hopefully

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,400
not right, You guys are going to send it
in this support channel.

65
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay.

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,560
And so I welcome you everyone.

67
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,840
Guys, I'm very excited
and I have a lot of passion to teach in

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,160
and I've been teaching Java
for some time already, guys, and

69
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,320
probably this is

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,280
my most favorite topic
of most favorite module

71
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,560
out of the our entire course,
maybe because I'm an expert in it

72
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,680
and but all the modules,
of course will be fine.

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,800
They will be different.

74
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,760
But this is the biggest module guys,
that you will be learning

75
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,800
and it's going to take us about two
and a half months, I believe,

76
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,840
to finish the concepts that require us
to become a great automation.

77
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,960
Engineers
in Java is very interesting guys.

78
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,720
Java is very, very beautiful language
and of course

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,200
you will have to put an effort still in.

80
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,440
Of course, Java will be different compared

81
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,760
to your classes that you guys
are going to have on the weekdays.

82
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,680
Java, all the classes today.

83
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,280
Maybe you guys will hear me
talking about rules.

84
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,560
No rules about things that we going to do
from where

85
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,600
to learn what my expectation
what should be your expectation?

86
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,960
But after that
it will be completely hands on.

87
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,560
Right?

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,360
So and if you guys already
have your second monitor today,

89
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,680
you guys are going to see a lot
of benefits of having the second monitor.

90
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,720
If you have not,
then you guys probably will

91
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,880
realize, Oh, shoot,
I probably need a second monitor.

92
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,400
Right.

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,400
Okay.

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,840
So welcome, all of you.

95
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,040
I'm also very, very excited.

96
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,400
Usually for a lot of students,
Java does become one of the

97
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,680
favorite topics as well. And

98
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,280
I know you guys from

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,200
our orientation class, right.

100
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,160
There's probably I know 70% of your guys
coming from the referral

101
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,080
and I'm sure a lot of your friends,
if you ask them

102
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,880
if you have not asked them, please
make sure you go ahead and do that.

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,680
So if you ask them, Hey,
what will be your best suggestion

104
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,720
for me to succeed in this course?

105
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,440
So they're probably going to tell you,
please

106
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
make sure you guys are doing Java, right.

107
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,160
So from today's class
guys, we are going to say

108
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,080
we're going to start
building our fundamentals.

109
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,200
Why exactly Java? Why? Why not JavaScript?

110
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,520
So Java is one of the most popular
language when it comes to the program.

111
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,960
And right then we will talk about today
just very quickly.

112
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,040
But also it's
one of the widely used languages

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,960
when it comes to just automation and Java.

114
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,960
Jarrod will be harder a little bit,
of course, compared to the JavaScript.

115
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,920
And once you learn Java guys, then there
any any other programing language

116
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,240
will become very easy for you, right.

117
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,720
And what's most popular.

118
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,240
And then if you guys
will fall in love in Java

119
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,400
and if you guys would like to later,
of course not, not after this bootcamp,

120
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,320
but let's see

121
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,680
a few years down the road, if you would
like to grow more technically,

122
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,080
if you are becoming the Java developer,

123
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,920
you'll be making the great amount of money
right?

124
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,320
Okay.

125
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,680
So let me quickly look into this thing.

126
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,520
So oh, I need a link.

127
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,160
One memorable link to make

128
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,640
things in with.

129
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,240
I need to make

130
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,040
1001 moment.

131
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
This is I'm. I'm looking.

132
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,960
This man here

133
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,160
for a moment is

134
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
unique.

135
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,880
A little bit of talking

136
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,720
find the things.

137
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,040
Now listen.

138
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,480
All right?

139
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,640
It's right in

140
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,080
point, all right?

141
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,280
Because we're we're quick. Things like

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm sure you guys
all can in your calendar, right?

143
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,920
Let me. Okay.

144
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,240
Sorry.

145
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
Do you guys bachelor

146
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,240
in here?

147
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,400
All right,
October 2nd, right? October 2nd.

148
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,000
So today,
you guys having your Java classes

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,600
and I'm sure you guys are all served
through your

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,120
through through the canvas already
right here.

151
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,920
You guys will see the topics.

152
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,080
So what is going to happen, guys,
for the first months, all on the weekends

153
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,160
we are going to have a Java classes
right On Tuesdays and Wednesdays

154
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,160
you are going to have non-technical
classes, so you guys will finish.

155
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,960
Just you'll see.

156
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,880
Then we'll be teaching you mental testing
and then what is going to happen

157
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,240
from next Thursday?

158
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,840
We are start
we start having review classes.

159
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,400
So this review classes
there will be about Java, right?

160
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,560
So for example, today and tomorrow,
whatever amount of information

161
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,640
you're going to learn, then you guys
are going to have additional Thursday.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
We do say it's an optional.

163
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,400
However, we do ask you to attend
because they are

164
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,880
you guys will be going over
some new examples.

165
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,400
There is a little bit
more in-depth information will be given,

166
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,840
especially for those

167
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,760
if you guys want to understand something,
but I'll make sure you guys do right.

168
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,120
This is will be just additional where a

169
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,280
way where you guys can

170
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,400
get a better

171
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,000
understanding of some of the materials
if you have not came.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So all the review classes guys
they will be technical

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,920
and then after one month
that's one more fun start.

174
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,880
That's when you get going.

175
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
You go completely,
completely full into the program.

176
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,280
Right. But for now, only weekends

177
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,400
recorded classes.

178
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,320
Of course they will be of course, guys,
everything is that's the best part, right?

179
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,200
So everything will be recorded
and will be uploaded to Google Drive.

180
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,000
So any time you guys it
or is that or just want to go back

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
and rewatch it any time
all videos will be available in there.

182
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,280
However, my suggestion

183
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,520
guys, please make sure you do
attend as GA is a great instructor.

184
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,360
He's the one who will be started
with the overview classes

185
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,000
and you guys will learn a lot from him.

186
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,920
Okay.

187
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,160
So, all right, so and as you guys know,

188
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,440
today
we are going to spend 5 hours together.

189
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,200
So I first probably sounds,
oh my God, 5 hours.

190
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,600
The class is going to so long,

191
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
I got all my coffee and cookies,
whatever I need.

192
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
All right.
But actually, time will go very fast.

193
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,560
And because as I mentioned it, classes
very hands only very practical.

194
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,520
You guys will be following me typing, and
then I'll be giving you some exercises.

195
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,800
So that time usually goes quickly.

196
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,840
But of course, the guys
we are going to have breaks

197
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,200
and the way we usually do guys,

198
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,000
no, we try to give to short breaks.

199
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,040
We are going to have a break around 1130
for 15 minutes

200
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,960
and around 115
also for another 15 minutes.

201
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,200
Right.

202
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
So whenever there's

203
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,360
a logical end of the thoughts
and whenever we complete the assignments.

204
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,600
So 1130 11, 2035,
whatever the time will be.

205
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,640
Right.
So that's when we go and to have a break.

206
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,960
So two breaks, right?

207
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,800
Very quick way to think about I hope you
guys will be that will be enough for you.

208
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,600
So once again, guys, any issues

209
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,840
you want to have today
while doing the while

210
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,280
doing the coding right today,
first day again, going to do the coding.

211
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,240
You guys going to write. Our first

212
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,240
theme is program that all programmers
do, right.

213
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Hello World.

214
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,320
And in case if there's any issues
you got going to post it in there

215
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,520
support channel. Right.

216
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,200
Okay.

217
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,320
So let me ask you guys let me ask you

218
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,040
so I'll go over some this stuff, right?

219
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,040
So this is the topics
that we got going to cover today. And

220
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,360
I'm sure, guys, you saw it go happy.

221
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,000
That's right.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,720
And I'm sure you guys saw those
this topics already in the cameras.

223
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,320
Right.

224
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,400
So there's a few things
that we're going to go over about.

225
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,640
How do you succeed? Right.

226
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,720
How do you succeed?

227
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,240
Because as I mentioned,
our classes are different than yours.

228
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,800
You'll see class, right?

229
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,680
So let me ask you guys, did any one of
you have any programing knowledge?

230
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,640
I know we ask you,
but I want to ask one more time.

231
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,120
No, no, no.

232
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,280
There my if I said it right, it's okay.

233
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,520
If you classes, I'm
going to see a happy place.

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,200
Happy face basics. Okay.

235
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,120
That's good summary.

236
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,320
I think one person.

237
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,680
One person. Guys out of all of us. Right?

238
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
Nothing.

239
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,520
And Keith Cookie thoroughly.

240
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,280
Okay. I see. Basic. Basic.

241
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,680
That's good. As good. Right?

242
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,120
So you guys see
we all starting to see some of you Sure.

243
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,920
Maybe have a little bit
some of my but majority of you are not.

244
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,640
But you guys will be very,
very amazed in you.

245
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,000
And one month down the road, guys,
you will be very amazed of how much

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,720
you are going to learn a little bit
a year ago.

247
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,400
Okay, then then the things will be easier
for you from YouTube tutorials.

248
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,520
Okay, that's great. That's good.

249
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:17,960
All right.

250
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,640
So also, you know,
coming from any background right in.

251
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,680
So how do you succeed
in the course? Great.

252
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
How do you succeed in the course?

253
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,680
As I mentioned, classes,
very practical guys.

254
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,600
And if your just attending the lecture,
let's say, and you just sitting there,

255
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,760
I don't know, get instructed for
the things probably 5% of the information.

256
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,840
That's what you want to get. Why. Because

257
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,320
we are

258
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,400
not using you guys, not using programing
in your daily life.

259
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,600
Right.

260
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,080
Something that we don't use
is stored in our short memory.

261
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,120
As soon as we going to close the laptop,
that's it.

262
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,680
That things will be gone. Right.

263
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,640
Okay.
So then what do we suggest you to do?

264
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,800
Right.
Always. Always attend the sessions, guys.

265
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,640
Every single session.

266
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
You guys going to learn something, right?

267
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,160
We want to learn something.

268
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,840
And for you guys
that don't have any background, please

269
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,080
don't be scared
or will be starting very, very, very slow.

270
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,280
And then, of course,
our piece will be increase

271
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,880
in increase in increase in increase in
the more knowledge your guys going to get

272
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,480
and the slowly
the peaceful start increased. Right.

273
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,520
So what do we do?

274
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,400
Said especially

275
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,200
because it's a technical classes,
I do suggest you to come prepare right.

276
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,840
It does not mean that I'm going
to ask you, hey, go ahead and

277
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,520
I shall go ahead and study for 2 hours
before the class.

278
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,840
No, guys, just been 20, 30 minutes.

279
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,360
Right before the class.
Right after the class. Of course.

280
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,920
You guys go going.

281
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,680
You have to spend more time.

282
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,440
But before the class, 20, 30 minutes,
if you guys have just do a little bit

283
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,400
reading, write a little,
do a little bit reading on the topics

284
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,200
and of course, do
watch some YouTube tutorials.

285
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,400
And I'm going to share with you guys
some of those that we do recommend

286
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,400
that we find a very good day
about maybe 5 to 10 minutes video.

287
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,280
And I'm sure you guys all have this right.

288
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,120
And so the rest of the rest of the part
guys will come

289
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,880
from the discussions and demonstrations.

290
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,960
So I want all of you to be active guys.

291
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,680
Okay.

292
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,640
I will.

293
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,560
Whenever I'll be giving you the tasks,
you guys will be sharing your code in

294
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,240
here.

295
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,800
I will be asking you some questions
usually from this second class.

296
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,120
We are going to do the recap
at the beginning of the class.

297
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,160
I want you to be guys all act good.

298
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:36,360
And of course this 75% of how you succeed,
especially the programing is good.

299
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,360
But practice in practice
and practice and practice, right?

300
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,680
So remember this 10 to 15 hours in a week.

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,040
That's
what we asking from all of you. Right?

302
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,880
If you want to become a great programmer,
if you want to become

303
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,360
like one of your friends, right.

304
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,480
And then ending up
in having a really good job

305
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,560
switching your career
and getting a good pay rate,

306
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,360
that's what you guys have to do
and hear the rest of the things.

307
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,880
Guys, what you will see
there will be discussions, teach others.

308
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,800
So what are you guys going
through? How we will be doing it?

309
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,520
Several projects with you guys
probably for Java.

310
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,960
We are going to have one
or once we finish our basic.

311
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,800
So you guys are going to form a group,
you guys are going to have

312
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,120
your group discussion
where you guys will be talking about Java.

313
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,240
We guys will be doing
a Java assignments together.

314
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,920
So I think it'll be a lot of fun,
I promise.

315
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,640
A lot of fun, yes.

316
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,360
So that's about how how we are succeeding.

317
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,000
Right. And as I mentioned, guys,
everything will class.

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,360
You guys will be learning
new things, right?

319
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,720
So today
we're starting from the ground, right?

320
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,200
So we all have and we always treat to
as you don't have any

321
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,120
as you don't have
any programing knowledge.

322
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,640
And then we start building our

323
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,560
our knowledge right.

324
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,320
I always give an example
aboard the building. Right.

325
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,600
So let's say you want to build,
you guys go and you have about

326
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,040
25 probably classes of Java right?

327
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,000
So let's say we tried to build a 35
storey building.

328
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,160
You cannot jump from the ground
and go to the ten floor, right?

329
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,040
You cannot jump
and go all the way to the 35th floor.

330
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:15,760
Right.

331
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,360
So we are going to start one by one
by one building those blocks.

332
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,080
But you have to make sure
that those blocks of very strong.

333
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,360
Right.

334
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,600
Your fundamentals will be very important
If your floor number two of them

335
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,280
is not strong,

336
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,520
then those not on floor number 35
probably will be a little bit shaky.

337
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,120
Right.

338
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,640
So that's
why please make sure put all your efforts.

339
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,920
And one thing is to remind some of you,
you do have a basic

340
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,280
some of you maybe steady a little bit,
but the majority of you do not.

341
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,240
Right.

342
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,360
And so the course is going
to have its own piece.

343
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:48,920
Right.

344
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,680
So we know the amount of material
that we have to give you

345
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,280
and we know the speed with which
we have to go through the course.

346
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,800
Right.

347
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,840
So if in the beginning, for some of you,
it's a little bit

348
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,640
slower, guys, I'm sorry,
I'm not going to speed it up for you.

349
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,360
All right.

350
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,360
But if some of you
the course is a little bit fast, right,

351
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,960
then make sure you get
a steady additional. Right.

352
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,200
So this way

353
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,280
we all go all together to our floor
number 35.

354
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,360
And of course, there will be different
different floors.

355
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,480
Right. Okay.

356
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,120
In one thing, guys,
about the coding, right, Because I know

357
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,800
sometimes studios are telling us
or I try to memorize, right.

358
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,600
Remember this, the coding is not about
memorization, right?

359
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,040
All the things that you will

360
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,120
be doing over and over and over,
they will become very repetitive to you.

361
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,200
But all coding is about coding
is about logic, right?

362
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,720
So we have to develop our logic
so later, right?

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,480
Because there will be
tons of the material, right?

364
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,480
So as long as we understand
the logic, things will be easier.

365
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,960
Okay,
but how we are going to develop our logic

366
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,880
by practicing in practice
and in practice in more.

367
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,480
Right.

368
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,440
And one thing what I tell everyone

369
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,640
and give me one moment
this some of you is still typing, right?

370
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,200
Some of you guys still typing.

371
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,360
Angelica Leaf Ibrahim

372
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,440
Eugenie, Can you guys please use Slack
because I'm not looking into the

373
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,040
Zoom chat?

374
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,560
Please guys use our life channels here
in case if you have any questions

375
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,560
or whatever we do in discretion,
I want you to Do you participate in here?

376
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,600
Okay.

377
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,320
Okay.

378
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Well, maybe
we will still get a little memory, guys.

379
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,520
All right,

380
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,480
So get yourself some nuts and whatever
the things that help you with the memory.

381
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,200
But once need to buy lunch thing.

382
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,680
And last thing about about.

383
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,320
I do with sexiness.

384
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,560
Okay. Actually,
with that nonetheless. Right.

385
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,240
So, as I mentioned, guys
do the prior research.

386
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,160
I do the prior research about the topics.

387
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,920
That's the reason we do specify. Right.

388
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
And I will give you
some of the things. Right.

389
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,480
But it's it's
very easy, guys. It's very easy.

390
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,320
For example,

391
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,640
if you want to find some material, right,
make sure you just go

392
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,680
and Google the topics that you guys
are going to learn.

393
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,800
For example, today,
what what of what are we learning today?

394
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,120
Guess which topics are
we learning today? Admitting

395
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,640
now about what topics of Java?

396
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,840
What is our atmosphere?

397
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,960
Do have a program in it?

398
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,200
We'll talk about was it programing?

399
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,520
Java is coming from our oracle.

400
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,320
We'll talk about Eclipse
what is programing types of data right

401
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,360
so let's see so data types

402
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,320
that are types in Java right

403
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,960
so right here once you type right So here.

404
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah what your point is very great
is very great resource geeks for geeks.

405
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,680
Another
very good one Right Oracle sometimes

406
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,920
maybe after a couple of classes,
maybe then you guys can go

407
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,880
because Oracle might be a little bit,
you know, technical, not like technical,

408
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,440
but sometimes the explanation
could be a little bit too hard.

409
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
Right? Beginners book. Very good
ones. Right.

410
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,960
So all you guys do,
you just have to go to Google And actually

411
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,200
guys, Google, it's another skill
that you guys will have to develop.

412
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,280
We can find anything in Google, anything

413
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,280
right?

414
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,080
Okay. And

415
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,320
last but not least, is

416
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,920
some of you guys will be grasping
the material very quick and stuff.

417
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,320
For some of you,
it might take some time. Right.

418
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,000
So don't expect please And I don't in

419
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,160
and I don't expect from
you want to spend 100% of the lecture.

420
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,880
Right.

421
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,960
So as long as you guys understand in

422
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,120
70 to 80% right.

423
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,200
70 to 80% was good.

424
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,240
So the rest 20% will come from

425
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,720
you doing homework or interest
because we'll give you a lot of homework.

426
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,520
And also by rewatching our videos

427
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,760
and looking into
some of the YouTube things.

428
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,240
But the most thing what I'm trying
to tell you guys, for example, right?

429
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,400
Maybe tomorrow night is going to

430
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,880
know all of this, right?

431
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,240
Maybe she study already.

432
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,000
She knows all the topics
for the next few classes.

433
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,280
And for example, Yevgeny,
you are a little bit behind,

434
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,840
but this is just an example, right?

435
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,520
So then I don't want you guys

436
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,400
compare yourself to to others, right?

437
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,160
Oh, my God, I'm slow
and the other person already got it.

438
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,040
Or maybe I'm not smart enough.

439
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,920
Or maybe this course is not for me.

440
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,880
No, that's right.

441
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,560
So what I want you to do, I want you
to compare yourself to yourself.

442
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,360
Right?

443
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,040
So tomorrow we're going to have a class.

444
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,920
And if tomorrow are you going
to think of you?

445
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,920
Okay. What do you do?

446
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,840
I know. Yesterday, all my back. Today
no more. Right?

447
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,640
And then after two weeks,
you look into it.

448
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,320
Oh, my God. I learn a lot, right?

449
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,760
That's what I want you to do.

450
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,600
As long as you yourself are making
a progress, that's what's more important.

451
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,080
Right?

452
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,280
And then the other thing, of course, guys,
I will ask you to help each other.

453
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,880
And I saw you guys already been doing
that, Right?

454
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,760
That's the best part.

455
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,960
That's how you guys can learn, right?

456
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Teach others. What do we mean in here?

457
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,480
You guys will be stuck
in some of your programs.

458
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,280
You guys will be stuck
sometimes in your homework, right?

459
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,280
Just message.

460
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,800
Message in the channels. Right.

461
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,880
Which our channel you decide to message.

462
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,840
And if you guys know the answer,
help each other right?

463
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
That's how
you guys are going to build your groups

464
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,640
and that's how you guys going to build
your relationship.

465
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,160
Because remember, guys,
we are here together

466
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,200
for the next six months and I want to see
all of you who join today.

467
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,360
I want to see you guys finish in the cause

468
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,440
and I want you to see you when I'll be
doing your interview preparation.

469
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,920
Okay? All right.

470
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,480
E Ward Greenwald. Right.

471
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,720
So now I hope you guys excited, right?

472
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,200
I hope you guys said
had nothing to be scared today.

473
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,960
Guys, things will be easy.

474
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,040
And I just hope you guys all install Java.

475
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,160
And so this way we can do it
our practice, Right?

476
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,640
Okay, so why don't we start?

477
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,120
Why don't we start? Right. So

478
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,480
we'll talk about into our program, right?

479
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,000
So can you just tell me
what is a program, Right.

480
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,720
It is your first programing class
maybe to some in the universities,

481
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,080
but let's think it is
your first programing class.

482
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,200
You should you should have done it before.

483
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,880
You should have done it before.
Today. It's fine.

484
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,920
But in case if you have any issues,
please boss it in the support channel.

485
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:40,080
But in the future, guys, we are going
to install different different softwares.

486
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,280
Please
make sure it has done before a class.

487
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,720
So this way
you don't lose attention during a class

488
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,000
program.

489
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,560
It is a process of making software
in different applications.

490
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,840
All right.

491
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,360
Coding programing is a coding, right?

492
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,800
That's that's what we all know.

493
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,960
Programmers, coders
and we always think of them.

494
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,280
Well, my God, I used to think that
all those programmers, a genius.

495
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,480
It's it's an instructions that to be good.

496
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:15,200
The programing is an instruction that we
going to be given to the computers right.

497
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,960
And then the

498
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,080
computers will be performing some task

499
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,240
attempt to computer to complete
a specific task without making a mistake.

500
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,920
They go, That's a good one, right?

501
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,360
So we will have to make sure
there are no mistakes.

502
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,240
Right?
That's why there's a testers, right.

503
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,200
To make sure that all those softwares
are perform.

504
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,160
Correct.

505
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,640
And the process of designing
and building an executable program, one

506
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,040
that's very amazing.

507
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,720
Okay.

508
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,720
In case
if you guys have any issues of first

509
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,800
the first few minutes,
we will be just talking guys.

510
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:57,000
So if you have any issues, please make
sure you take care of Java in Eclipse.

511
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,920
Making the rules of behavior
for a computer is right in rules.

512
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,160
Okay, that's good. Okay.

513
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,280
Let me ask you guys,
what are this thing about computers?

514
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,760
Are computers smart?

515
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,240
Computers are not smart.

516
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,000
But who makes them smart Guys
who make whom?

517
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,400
Oh, they making the computers themselves.

518
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,040
They're not smart, but who are making them
smart programmers, Humans, right.

519
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,120
People
who are developing all this things right

520
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,640
now, all the software that we build
and we put it inside.

521
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,120
That's what it makes it.

522
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,960
That's what makes it smart, right?

523
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,440
So as are humans are behind it, right?

524
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,240
So now when we
talking about the programing.

525
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,600
Good And then
when we talk about the programing, right.

526
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,400
The programing is a process of building
the programs, right.

527
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,640
Computer programs that. So that's
what are we doing?

528
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,920
And then if we think good, so what are we
what is a programing programing

529
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,840
is that instead of the instructions

530
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,640
that are provided to the computer, right
then the computer

531
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,080
it right,
then they process those instructions

532
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,480
step by step, by step by step
and give us some output.

533
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,200
Right?

534
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,640
No, those executable programs,
they give us some type of the outputs.

535
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:17,880
Right.

536
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,320
Then you guys talk already with summary
by the software about the hardware.

537
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
You guys know the differences, right?

538
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,240
So this software that we are building,
right,

539
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,840
they're helping us to control
the hardware, right?

540
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,080
Software is the brain of our computer.

541
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,560
Right.

542
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,400
And then the thing of the software,
there's a million, a million

543
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,880
different softwares. Right?

544
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,760
Just the software that we use in
right now.

545
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,240
Right. Select right
and then develop right.

546
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,320
It's been you use
in the programing languages, right?

547
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,480
Canvas, Google,

548
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,280
Google sheets,
Zoom, all of this programs, Right.

549
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,040
All of this program softwares,
they have been built, right?

550
00:27:59,680 --> 00:27:59,920
Yeah.

551
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,480
There's a millions and millions
and millions of them right now these days.

552
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,280
When we think of the computers, right?

553
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,760
When we think of the computers. Right.

554
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,040
Who are processing
those programs, it's not just my laptop,

555
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,280
your laptop or a computer. Right.

556
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,800
These days we have different different
of the computers, right.

557
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,640
Our phones, our cars, our refrigerators.

558
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,600
Right. All of those are computers, right?

559
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,000
There's some programs that have been built
and then installed right.

560
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,200
And those are programs

561
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,680
are running, running, running,
getting some instructions.

562
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,360
Right.

563
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,280
And then our computers
are executing our instructions right.

564
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,720
So now what do we think of it? Right.

565
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,080
When we when we start thinking, okay,
you know what?

566
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm a human, right?

567
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,920
I'm a human.

568
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,440
I doing this in instructions, right?

569
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,400
Somebody's going to tell me,
hey, you, you your for example,

570
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,120
I have to get up, I have to do this,
and then I have to teach the class.

571
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,840
After the class
I have to do this, this right.

572
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,560
I'm instruction, but I'm human, right?

573
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,840
I can write down my instruction
what I have to do

574
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,200
now, when we think of the computers,
okay, Computers are not humans, right?

575
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,080
How I am

576
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
dangerous day by day.

577
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,840
I agree.

578
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,840
This made our computers getting dangerous
and no computers.

579
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,120
Right? Computers are not a human's right.

580
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,280
Computer is You not want
to just understand the language.

581
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,560
Right?

582
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,640
Is not going to understand my language
right?

583
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,200
If I tell something to the computer right.

584
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,400
So then let me ask you

585
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,160
is how then I'm as a human,
how do I interact with this machine?

586
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,880
Right.

587
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,320
How do we interact with them?

588
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,960
You have to speak their language.

589
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,000
Right now.

590
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,040
There is a machine language
that we have, right?

591
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,200
They go,
how do we communicate with our computers?

592
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,320
Right?
How do they communicate with this machine?

593
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,520
We communicate with them
through the programing language.

594
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,800
It's right
through the programing languages.

595
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,960
So now our machines have their own
language, right?

596
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,000
They have a machine language, right?

597
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,680
All this bytecode right,
all the zeros and ones.

598
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,880
That's how our computers run.

599
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,600
But then I'm as a programmer,
how am I going to communicate?

600
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,480
Who is my computer through the help
of the programing languages.

601
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,120
Right.

602
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,440
So now I will be sending
those instructions to the computer

603
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,080
with the help of programing languages.

604
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,000
Now that is, how many programing languages
do you getting?

605
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,080
Are there?

606
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,720
There is many.

607
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,600
There's many programing languages,
nothing less.

608
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,760
Time when we check that,
I know there may be

609
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,360
five, six, 700 languages, right?

610
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,960
There's a lot of them.

611
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,680
There's tons of them,
but there will be some other than

612
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,640
what's popular and the most use there
will be the one they're less used, right?

613
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,080
So there's a tons of different
programing languages.

614
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,240
And in this course,
only from India, Malaysia,

615
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,840
and then in this course,
what we will be learning,

616
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,360
we will be learning
one of the most popular language,

617
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,560
one of the most popular language,
which is Java.

618
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,280
Right.

619
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,880
Java in which about 700 they go
they are Now,

620
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,800
you probably already went to Google right?

621
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,000
You go. You suggest that.

622
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,080
So that's the beauty of Google.

623
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,240
Right. Thanks. Thank you for

624
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
for this software.

625
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,120
Right.

626
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,040
So why don't we get all these slides
they will be available to you in

627
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,320
can was right sometimes I

628
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,800
you know I do look at them
sometimes I don't look at them.

629
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,600
So but they all will be available

630
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,800
to exact the same information
that I'm giving you all this

631
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,680
all these things will be giving it
to you. Right.

632
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,800
So programing list of the instructions
executed by a computer

633
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,440
to do what
to do to accomplish a particular task.

634
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,080
Right.

635
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,840
So then when we speak about a computer

636
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,080
is saying that the computers
have their own language, right?

637
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,360
They have their own machine language that
understands only zero and ones, right.

638
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,720
So then those combinations
of all zeros and ones

639
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,760
then means give have a
some specific meaning for the machine.

640
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,400
Right.

641
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,080
So now as a human, I cannot speak
zeros and ones right back in the days.

642
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,920
Sure. Right.

643
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,080
You have to be a super,

644
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,040
super, extremely smart
when you want to do the programing right.

645
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,240
But these days there is a programing
language, is there also

646
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,280
the programing language is the also
has changed, right.

647
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,360
The programing language
has developed. Right.

648
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,520
So now what will we talk about?

649
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,520
The programing language mostly
talk about the high programing languages

650
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,400
with one woman,
this is possible to do just

651
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,360
I was an instructor.

652
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,920
Can you on moment okay Evgeny instructions
you have to go to the course

653
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,200
announcement In the course announcement
guys there's a,

654
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,600
there's a video that we uploaded is it.

655
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,400
But sometimes you will be uploading before
the class, sometimes after the class.

656
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,000
What are we trying to do, guys?

657
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,280
We tried to make sure that we have
an all your full attention on us, right?

658
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,640
Because sometimes
when we give slides a lot bit early,

659
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,600
then students, they're like, okay,
I've seen all of this, right?

660
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,920
But we will try to give it.

661
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,840
We'll try to get because mostly, mostly
when it comes to my classes, guys,

662
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,880
I don't go read all the slides because
you guys can read it yourself, right?

663
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,560
You guys can read it yourself. Okay.

664
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,000
So now computers understand
zeros and ones.

665
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,720
Right now,

666
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,360
as a programmer, I don't speak those years
on one of those crazy combinations.

667
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,840
Right.

668
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,080
So now as a programing,
I can learn a programing language

669
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,280
and with the help
of the programing language, what I can do,

670
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,040
I can set instructions

671
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,920
and then I send
in my programing languages,

672
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,240
and then there will be
some process happening,

673
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,400
which of course you guys doing it
a little bit later.

674
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,280
Not on the first class, right?

675
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,200
There's some processes happening happening
and then the conversion

676
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,160
of my programing language
gets converted to the machine language

677
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,840
and that's how machine are executed
in those steps, right.

678
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,280
And when as I mentioned, when we talk
about the programing language, guys,

679
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,240
there's there's a hundreds and hundreds
of those programing languages.

680
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,280
And one of the most popular these days,
of course, there's a Java,

681
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,200
there's a C sharp, very popular.

682
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,000
There's the python is becoming
very popular.

683
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,280
Right. And there is a

684
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,920
there is a JavaScript is very popular.

685
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,520
But what we are focusing in here, guys,
we are focusing in Java.

686
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,400
This is the this is a language that is,

687
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,200
that is mostly used, right?

688
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,440
This is so people say it's difficult.

689
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,920
Some people say it's not difficult. Right.

690
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,600
But it's very beautiful.

691
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,040
Language is very beautiful.

692
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,480
If you are going to understand
Java. Right.

693
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,120
And in order for you to understand,
of course,

694
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,000
you guys are going
to have to practice more.

695
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,680
But you will see, guys,
Java is very beautiful.

696
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,160
And once you learn Java, guess
once you learn Java and you can learn

697
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,400
any other language, especially I'm
not going to go into details, right.

698
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,800
The things about job, it's
object oriented programing language,

699
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,640
which that particular term you guys start
learning only after one month.

700
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,880
Right. But if there is

701
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,080
another object programing language

702
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,160
such as a C-sharp, such as a python,
it will be so easy for you guys to learn.

703
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,080
We have students
for whenever they graduating right

704
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,280
with their strong knowledge of Java,
they are getting hired by the companies

705
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,800
and then then the companies
they get in train for another language

706
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,000
and the message, as am I.

707
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,120
So I'm learning Python.

708
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,440
It's so easy right now. Right?

709
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,840
So any of those programing languages
will be very, very easy

710
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,280
after that.

711
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,760
No, they're they're not.

712
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,920
I mean all the programing language guys,
they will have some similarities,

713
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,560
especially the first things that you guys
will be learning with me.

714
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,840
The basic concept guys,
they all they exist from our base is guys.

715
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,240
We will be learning the conditioning
and then we will be learning cycles.

716
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,120
How do you repeat particular tasks?

717
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,520
So all those things are pretty, pretty
common in other programing languages.

718
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,840
Okay, Is

719
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,840
it is if you learn German
then other languages really German.

720
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,240
German. German is the hardest language.

721
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,000
I actually used to used to know German,
but since I came to United States

722
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,080
I completely forgot.

723
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,680
So now I don't really know
if I can learn that.

724
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,760
What is the difference
between Java and JavaScript organs?

725
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,960
It's a two completely different languages.

726
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,840
You completely. It's like

727
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,440
when we talk about a T,
and then when we talk

728
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,960
about the mouse, right, two different,

729
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,280
two different languages.

730
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,160
Russian is hard, but I love it.

731
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,320
Maria D Let me see.

732
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,800
Miriam do you speak Russian

733
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:13,560
or only a little.

734
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,640
Okay. Okay.

735
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
Mariam You can get a lot
of a lot of practice in here.

736
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
We have a lot of Russia's biggest students

737
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,000
all. So whenever you you're

738
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,840
going to form a group,
you guys can have that

739
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:31,440
conversation a little bit.

740
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,000
JDK 17 one Step five
We are trying to use Java eight.

741
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,200
Okay,
We are going to use Java eight, but DBA.

742
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,000
Bialystok All right.

743
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,160
So right, so on also here, some diagram
when we look into

744
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,920
but so Python these days
of course is getting is gaining popularity

745
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,080
right in the python
we actually teach in in our other course

746
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,400
C sharp is gaining in popularity
JavaScript is getting popularity.

747
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,920
But Java is still one of the most popular
one of the hospital

748
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,520
high speed Java especially
if you going to speak to the developer.

749
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,760
We do have students from previous batches
or students from batch to batch three.

750
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,320
By now.

751
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,840
They, you know, they've been working
for some time in the industry industry

752
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,600
and they're telling us the best we can
to develop our development position.

753
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Are they making crazy amount of money?

754
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,000
Right. Okay.

755
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,080
So possibilities.

756
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,200
There are endless endless, Right.

757
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
Okay.

758
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,960
So programing languages, right.

759
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,160
As you guys mentioned, there is a many,
many different one of them. So

760
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,280
why we're learning Java most popular, it's
mostly being used, right?

761
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,480
Because remember, guys,

762
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,120
the goal of this course, we're not trying
to become a programmers, right?

763
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,920
But we learn a good amount of the material
that you guys will be

764
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,760
will be able to.

765
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,000
I later learned some additional stuff
and become if you would really love to.

766
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,160
But the goal in here
we're trying to become

767
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,800
automation engineers
write software automation engines

768
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,880
and in order for us to become software
automation engineers, right,

769
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,640
we have to make sure
that our programing language is strong.

770
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,840
And when it comes to the software
automation, a lot a lot

771
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,920
a lot of companies
are will are using selenium.

772
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,920
And with this selenium,
which you guys will be learning after

773
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,160
two and a half months, Selenium
and most popular

774
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,360
combination
is to use the tool selenium with our Java.

775
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:31,960
Okay.

776
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,800
So now let me ask you guys,
what did you learn about Java

777
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,160
because I'm sure you've done the research
first class, usually everybody's excited.

778
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,320
They're doing their research.

779
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:48,560
So what did you find out about Javabayes?

780
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,640
Or is it okay?

781
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,360
I just I went in,
I probably I once we will do the eclipse,

782
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,000
I learned there will be an option
where you can select and

783
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,800
I would suggest use either

784
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,480
eight or either use 11.

785
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,560
It's a language, right?

786
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,880
It's a it's
one of the programing language.

787
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,120
It's an object oriented language.

788
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,120
All right.

789
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,000
Right. Once use it everywhere.

790
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,680
That's what you guys probably heard.

791
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,040
And you guys will learn
why do we call it this?

792
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,400
We're right on the first clause.

793
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,800
We're not going to drop all this
all this material to scare you, right?

794
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,480
It's all right.

795
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,400
It's object oriented programing language.

796
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,880
It's one of the higher languages. Right?

797
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,800
Okay. It's only been since 1995.

798
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,560
And here right.

799
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,080
What else?

800
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:52,440
What else you guys learned about Java?

801
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,760
So crime and damage of coffee.

802
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:02,840
They're going to coffee lovers,
you guys, bro, You know,

803
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,880
Java is the most famous, more spread
language, right?

804
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,040
So whenever you guys were installing
Java, right.

805
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,440
You guys saw that
that that message in there.

806
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,760
Then there's a 3 billion devices
that run on Java right?

807
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,320
Yep. It was it was created by James
Gosling.

808
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,000
Right.

809
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,480
By Sun Microsystems And then later.

810
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:24,880
Right.

811
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,040
Oracle acquire it.

812
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,240
That's why. Now,
what do you guys have to do?

813
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,760
If you want to install Java,
you have to go to Oracle,

814
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,960
right?

815
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,840
Yaman

816
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,800
Java is a high programing language, right?

817
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,880
It's a programing language.

818
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,920
There's a lot of description
that we can give for Jabari.

819
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,480
Another very important thing is

820
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,680
for now, right? For now.

821
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,440
Let me ask you guys,
did you have to pay anything when you were

822
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,400
when you were downloading Java?

823
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,720
No, it's free, right?

824
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,640
Like free things, right?

825
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,600
I mean, there

826
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,480
and there's a paid features
that are coming in Java, of course.

827
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:09,960
Right.

828
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,760
So how do we cool things
when they are free.

829
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,080
Right.

830
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,560
Any software,
what we are able to download,

831
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,160
if it's free,
we call it an open source, right?

832
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,720
We call it an open source.

833
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,240
Okay.

834
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,160
So what do I mean by object oriented guys
for the first ten classes?

835
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,440
We are not going to touch this concept
of the object oriented,

836
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,240
but then you guys go going to have going
to spend about 25 classes

837
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,080
where you guys will be learning
about the beautiful concept

838
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,720
about Java being an object oriented
programing language.

839
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,240
Okay, So now the things about Joe, right?

840
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,440
One of the most popular
meal, right, is right.

841
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,920
Java is a high level
computer programing language, right?

842
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,800
So Java is free, right?

843
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,760
One free.

844
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,840
We call it an open source. Right.

845
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,000
And then there's

846
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,520
a specific mechanism that Java is using.

847
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,360
It saw a budget. Why?

848
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,480
What do you guys heard once
you run your program?

849
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,040
Right, Once your radio program,
this program be executed

850
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,120
on all different platforms,

851
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,160
on all different system systems.

852
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,280
This simple example
that I can give you, right?

853
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,560
So during my my coding guys,
I'll be using Mac right now.

854
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,320
You guys have windows, right?

855
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,240
But whatever program
that I am going to write,

856
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,600
I can execute it on my MAC system
and you guys can execute it

857
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,480
on your Windows system, right?

858
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,520
So the same thing,
those softwares that have been developed,

859
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,640
right,
the software that have been developed,

860
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,800
our slack, our zoom right,
it can run on Mac, it can have

861
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,240
you can run on windows,
it can run on your own,

862
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,280
your Android operating system,
It can run on your iOS operating system.

863
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,800
Right? Yes.

864
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,400
Yes. All those languages. Yep.

865
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,840
They are coming from the C++, Right.

866
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,960
So if some of the guys have any knowledge

867
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,960
a little bit about a C++,
this will be very, very easy for.

868
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,440
Right.

869
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,040
And remember this today we are talking
we were talking only about very,

870
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,720
very basic information because we're not
going to go and dig it into deep things.

871
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,400
Right.

872
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,480
The knowledge you guys will be
given to you proportionately.

873
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,960
Write some to me knowledge
you will not going to throw it you yet.

874
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,320
Right?

875
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:43,920
Slowly, slowly
we guys will be introducing that.

876
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,280
All right.

877
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,240
Okay.

878
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,240
So then right then here is case sensitive.

879
00:44:51,240 --> 00:45:06,360
What do we mean by case
sensitive goods, low caps and upward caps.

880
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,200
Right. So, for example. Right.

881
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,480
So today we'll be creating something,
right?

882
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,720
For example, if I'm going to write class
with the lowercase.

883
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,520
Right, and then I'm going to have a write
a class with the uppercase.

884
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,400
Right.

885
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,680
For Java,
they are two different things, right?

886
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,120
Completely two different things.

887
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,960
So Java is actually very, very strong
type language, right?

888
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:37,120
There is a certain syntax is of course
we will have to follow, but it's a case

889
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,360
sensitive language, white lowercase
operative is will make a difference.

890
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:42,880
Right.

891
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,080
But there still are things
that will be fooling that you guys

892
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,080
going to talk about it. Right.

893
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,520
Okay.
And that's where we talk about. Right.

894
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,480
So Java is a programing
language, is an independent, right?

895
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,400
So it can run on any
system. That's why there is a

896
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:57,960
there's a

897
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,720
thing you hear about Java that call it run
once, run everywhere.

898
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:01,920
Right.

899
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,400
So our Java program can be executed
on different, different

900
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,800
type of the operating system.

901
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,520
Spaces.

902
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,440
Spaces will be matter in some conditions.

903
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,560
In some conditions, no. Right.

904
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,120
And we will talk about in which
specific situations spaces will matter.

905
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,280
Okay. All right. That's right.

906
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,320
So now here you guys will see
a little slide of the history,

907
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,920
if any of you guys interested. Right.

908
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,080
So now we have this programing language,
right?

909
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,800
We have this programing language
and of course, this

910
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,560
Any language
you guys trying to learn, right?

911
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,080
Whatever language you decide to learn.

912
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,160
German, Russian, Japanese, Arabic. Right.

913
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,960
So this language has its own syntax,
right?

914
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,920
When we go going to. Right.

915
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,840
It has its own key words.

916
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,320
Right.

917
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,920
For example, I see something in Russian.

918
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,360
It will have a meaning

919
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,440
while in other languages
it is not going to have some meaning.

920
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,000
Right.

921
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,440
And there's is certain rules
that I have to follow.

922
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,960
The same thing for Java
right now is going to have its own syntax.

923
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,880
Java is going to have its own keyword,
Java is going to have its own

924
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,840
terminal logic, right?

925
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,040
So now, okay, guys,
I want to learn the language.

926
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,800
I want to learn this language.

927
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,640
So now I need to have something where

928
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,680
I will be writing this right,
where I will be writing this to now this.

929
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,400
Tell me,
where am I going to write my programs?

930
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,200
I'm I'm.

931
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,440
I'm becoming the Java programmer, right?

932
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,600
I will need to

933
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,120
write my

934
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:39,720
program somewhere.

935
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,920
Yes, we are going to write it in Eclipse.

936
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,080
But what is eclipse?

937
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,680
What is eclipse?

938
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,120
It's a tool that will help us to write

939
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,800
our program will help us to correct

940
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,960
and fix our program right
and will help us to execute right.

941
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,720
But when we talk about the eclipse
white eclipse, it's one of the tool

942
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,760
and we call this integrated development
environment.

943
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,760
Right. So

944
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,080
so what do we mean by that? Right.

945
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:14,480
So think of it goes back in the days right
Back in the days there was no eclipse.

946
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,480
There was there was no such a thing.

947
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,320
Work or program
is used to run their program days

948
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,600
where they used to write their code

949
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,040
in their notepad.

950
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,000
Right in in their notepad. Right.

951
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,040
And there's a lot of things
they have to do, right?

952
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,400
So they had to write their code.

953
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,640
Then they had to perform some operation
in order to check

954
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,760
that the code is correct, right?

955
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,560
When they check that the code is correct,
they had to save that file.

956
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,200
And whenever the they say with the correct
was saved, then they had to execute it.

957
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,880
So all this process has been done in one,
two, three, four different steps.

958
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,720
Right.

959
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,120
What is you know, guys, technology, Right.

960
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,880
Technology is not spending right.

961
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,960
Technologies is growing,
continuously growing and developing.

962
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,560
Right.

963
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,360
So now later, what has been developed

964
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,560
there is that tools have been developed,
there's a software have been developed

965
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:19,560
that will they're that helping programmers
to to write their code.

966
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,600
So now how do we call those?

967
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,800
I do we call those programs,
How do we call those tools?

968
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,080
We call them ides, right?

969
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,480
Integrated development environment.

970
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,360
So those tools, what they do

971
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,720
now, they make a life of the programmer
easier.

972
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,120
How do they make life of the programmer
easier?

973
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,720
The whenever we will be writing our code,

974
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,280
those ideas guys will help us to highlight
sometimes some

975
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,720
some of the syntax issues
that we will be having.

976
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,240
Those ideas will help us to see our code

977
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,840
and those ideas
will help us to execute our code.

978
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,320
I just click in one button.

979
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,360
Just by clicking one button,
all the process will be done

980
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,280
and our program will execute compared
to the things

981
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,080
that you had to do yourself
before in those in those areas.

982
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,600
Okay, it will tell us.

983
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,040
We will talk about which things.

984
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,800
It will tell us
which things it's not going to tell us.

985
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,040
Right.

986
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,960
So remember, this is also software, right?

987
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,320
This is something that has been developed,
smart software,

988
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:36,480
but still not completely cannot completely
do all the things as a human can do.

989
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,560
So now when we

990
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,880
talk about Visual Studio, right,
so now the Visual Studio.

991
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,360
So there's a tons
and tons of different programing languages

992
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,800
that we have this right?

993
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,520
So now every programing language guys

994
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,440
will have its own software
on which it can be executed, right?

995
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,400
So for example, when we talk about Java,

996
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,680
where can I write my Java code
to write my Java code?

997
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,240
This is the ideas that are available
for me, right?

998
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,440
There's Eclipse and there is intelligence,
which is a tool very popular.

999
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,040
And there's another one, NetBeans Right,
there's others.

1000
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,520
But this is the one that are most popular.

1001
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,600
And by the way, guys, in this course
you will be learning both of them.

1002
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,160
We are starting off with the eclipse
and then probably

1003
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,920
after you guys learn it, maybe about

1004
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,480
six weeks, then you guys will be five,
six weeks.

1005
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,560
Then you guys will be switching
to the intelligent.

1006
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,680
So we to give you

1007
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,040
different different tools
to practice with.

1008
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,480
Well,
there's other programing language, right?

1009
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,120
For example, if you want to learn C-sharp.

1010
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:45,880
Right.

1011
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,240
So now C-sharp is a different language.

1012
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,840
In order
for you to work with different language,

1013
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,080
you will have to have a different IDE,
right?

1014
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,640
You will have to use a Visual Studio,
like, for example,

1015
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,280
if you will have to learn the python
by a completely different language.

1016
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:09,120
So then you will need to find an idea
that works with that language.

1017
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,080
And for Python, that thing is quite term.

1018
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,080
That's the software that is used, right?

1019
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,280
So every programing language
will have its own ides

1020
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,560
where you guys
will be able to write your code.

1021
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,480
And when it comes to Java guys,
when it comes to Java, this is the

1022
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,760
I never worked on JavaScript guys, so I,

1023
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,720
I don't know JavaScript,
but I used to use student scripts,

1024
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,760
which is your course on the Visual Studio
and the Python I know

1025
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,520
works on the term,
but if you guys say in JavaScript,

1026
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,200
now what I do stands for it's intelligent,
it's intelligent, it's

1027
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:52,880
another application that you guys will be
using later to write your Java right?

1028
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,520
But this is the of course

1029
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,360
there are more, of course,

1030
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,800
because there's more, but
this is the one that the most popular ones

1031
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,600
and they always have a similarities
about to use them

1032
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,040
or because they will be slight differences
between them. But

1033
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,480
for us, what we have to look at is right,

1034
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,240
what are we what do we have to look?

1035
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,120
So if I know Java right, if I know Java,

1036
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,080
long as I

1037
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,600
know this language, you guys,
you can give me any idea.

1038
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,400
I can and I can write my code right.

1039
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,560
So this these tools,
they will be very easy.

1040
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,720
Maybe it will take you one day to
to learning to practice with them.

1041
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,320
But what that plays a big, big role
in knowledge of our programing language.

1042
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,560
And that's
where we are going to put our focus.

1043
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,040
Okay.

1044
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,920
So now as I mentioned, first five,
six weeks, you guys will be working

1045
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,640
on Eclipse and later
we will be switching on the intelligence.

1046
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,760
So that's 11:00.

1047
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,760
Okay.
So what are we going to do right now?

1048
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,000
I hope you guys all install if some of you
through the process of the installation

1049
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,560
with me. Look, just support channel.

1050
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,400
We have more zone.

1051
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,080
We have a garden there.

1052
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:09,400
Okay.

1053
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,840
So you guys are still installing.

1054
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,400
Oh, that's fine.

1055
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,360
And we are still solid.

1056
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,720
That's fine in what
we are going to have guys in about.

1057
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,000
Let me walk you through

1058
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,800
a little bit through Eclipse
and then we are going to have our break.

1059
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,960
So this way
you guys will be able to catch up.

1060
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,480
Okay.

1061
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,080
So now also in this course, guys,
in this course,

1062
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,080
I know some of you,
when you look probably when you went to

1063
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,120
Oracle, you guys are different,
different versions of Java, right?

1064
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,800
So why we are using Java eight, right?

1065
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:52,240
Java eight is the most stable and the most
popular version that have been used.

1066
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,040
Right.

1067
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,200
So even though after eight
there's a tons of the difference.

1068
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,120
One come out, there's eight
that is the one that is popular

1069
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,360
or people are switching to the Java 11.

1070
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,440
But this is the two most popular versions
that being used, not others.

1071
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,640
If you did install if you did install

1072
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,680
different version,
it is okay, guess it is okay.

1073
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,560
But we do prefer to work on Java
eight or Java 11.

1074
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,880
Okay.

1075
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,920
Now what can you please can you please
message in the support channel

1076
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,600
if you need

1077
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,360
to, if you have any issues
with the installation?

1078
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,200
Sometimes what our instructors will do,
they will ask you to jump off

1079
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,280
from this meeting.
They will send you the link.

1080
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,080
So this way
they will be able to help you out.

1081
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,960
Okay.

1082
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:44,480
All right.

1083
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,840
Yeah. Usually if you.

1084
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,600
If you have any windows now, please
make sure you watch the our

1085
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,920
YouTube tutorial or it will be
it's actually on windows it's it's

1086
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,960
very easy process of the installation Mac
sometimes can give a different issue

1087
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,440
security issues
but for Windows is usually easy it

1088
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,760
yep so as long as it stays 1.8
then whatever the numbers after that guys

1089
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,480
don't worry about it so 1.8 that's
what means is Java version eight.

1090
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,000
Okay. So the rest of the part, it's it's,

1091
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,400
it's not that important.

1092
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,000
Okay, so what are we going to do, guys?

1093
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,840
We are going to open our eclipse.

1094
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,520
Okay, We're going to open our eclipse.

1095
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,640
And I'll walk you through a little bit
about Eclipse

1096
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,680
and probably some of you,
you guys already start

1097
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,480
practicing right?

1098
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:35,800
Okay.

1099
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,080
Let me see.

1100
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,600
So this is probably if you're go ahead,
guys, and open your eclipse.

1101
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,040
So if this does will be the very,
very first time.

1102
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,200
Right.
If you have not done, then you practice.

1103
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,240
If it will be there.

1104
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,200
First time
that you opening up with closed.

1105
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,680
That's what you guys
probably going to see, right?

1106
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,160
You guys going to see a welcome page?

1107
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,560
If you guys don't see the welcome page,
you guys probably

1108
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,200
see something like this, right?

1109
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,920
You guys probably see something like this.

1110
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,800
But I'm going to go back to my complete

1111
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,040
my welcome

1112
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:24,920
page right.

1113
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,480
Okay.

1114
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,200
My welcome page. Right.

1115
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,600
So this is the page
that just welcomes you, right?

1116
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,840
So here
you guys can look into some tutorial here.

1117
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,160
You guys can do different things.

1118
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,360
You can start your program in from here.

1119
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,440
But usually this page is not really needed
to us.

1120
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,000
Right.

1121
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,200
So here this on the very bottom,

1122
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,920
right on the very bottom
there will be a checkbox box

1123
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,520
and you guys will see something is always
sure welcome at the start up.

1124
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:58,560
So it means every time
you guys are going to open you equipped

1125
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,040
if you want to see this window,
you can click this checkbox.

1126
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,880
If you don't want to see, I'm
going to unclip it

1127
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,640
and which one? Click it.

1128
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,280
And in here on the right, guys on the top,
right right now I don't have it,

1129
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,200
but on the top, top right
you guys are going to see workbench.

1130
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,840
That's what you're going to see
guys in the workbench.

1131
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,360
Just please
make sure you go ahead and click on it.

1132
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,960
Actually, go ahead and click on it.

1133
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,560
So or if you don't see the workbench,

1134
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,920
but if you see the X button,
what do you guys can do?

1135
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,040
You guys can click on this X button.

1136
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,560
So and once you've come out from this
wooden or you guys can go hide too.

1137
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,360
You guys can do hide. Okay?

1138
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:49,920
So once you click on hide
or once you click on the closed button

1139
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,400
or once you if you see the workbench,
if you if your click on the workbench,

1140
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,040
this is where you guys
are going to end that up.

1141
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:03,000
And if it looks different right now,
it is okay, guys, it is totally okay.

1142
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,720
I'll show you different things.

1143
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,200
What can happen in here

1144
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,240
now? You definitely so you guys, you guys.

1145
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,160
So we'll see.

1146
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,560
You guys will see the benefits now, right?

1147
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,000
Your is you'll see classes
you guys, we're just sitting

1148
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,360
and watching so this is very that's
when you guys will need it.

1149
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:19,800
Okay.

1150
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,840
Okay.

1151
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,520
So if you guys see like window like me,
that's good.

1152
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,080
If you're not seeing window like me, it's
also good.

1153
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,640
That's fine. It's okay.

1154
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,080
That's fine.

1155
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,360
I'll walk you through about things.

1156
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,880
I'll let me close all this things.

1157
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,640
For example,
what if I don't see any of this?

1158
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:38,880
Right?

1159
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,520
If I don't see anything unusual?

1160
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,200
Okay, One thing is the left side.

1161
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,760
I can look, make it bigger.

1162
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,320
I can bring my company

1163
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:53,200
forward.

1164
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,480
Okay? Yep. That's good.

1165
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:00,160
And that's what we need to see.

1166
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,920
Marieme, just click.

1167
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:02,760
Just click.

1168
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,840
Exit that donation.

1169
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,880
Just click on that X button.

1170
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,760
Okay?

1171
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,120
Yeah.

1172
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,080
Any windows, let's say any unnecessary
windows that you would see.

1173
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,320
Right.

1174
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,680
For example, Mariam, what you saw, you saw

1175
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,640
I don't think if you see this right,
you guys will have this X button in here.

1176
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,680
I just closed any windows
that you see different than mine.

1177
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,240
What you guys can do,
just click on this X right?

1178
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,120
When you have or with your mouse,
it will tell you to close or go ahead

1179
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,080
and close. Right.

1180
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:33,560
Okay.

1181
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,120
So if it looks a little bit different,
that's fine guys.

1182
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:36,880
I'll show you.

1183
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,320
I'll show you that you guys can control
what you would like to see,

1184
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,040
what you would like to see by
you already of you guys

1185
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,480
What are you seeing right now

1186
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,080
of you?

1187
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,000
What do you have seen?

1188
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,360
You've probably seen this on your left
side, right?

1189
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,840
That's what you guys
probably seen on your left side.

1190
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,640
Right.

1191
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,640
So in here, some of you guys probably see

1192
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,680
something that sees package export

1193
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,000
or some of you might see something
that this project explore.

1194
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,760
But eventually you guys

1195
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,560
are going to see three, maybe some of you
a little bit more options.

1196
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:15,840
Right?

1197
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,960
But at least one of them we will option
we'll see create a Java project

1198
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,360
or just create a project, right?

1199
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,720
So now, for example,

1200
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,840
what happens if you don't see this, right?

1201
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,400
What happens if you don't see everything?

1202
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,240
Everything.

1203
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:37,000
Now, please,
guys is in here is adjustable.

1204
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,160
If there's something that you're missing,
you can easily bring them.

1205
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,560
If there is some things
that you don't like, how you how

1206
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,880
they look, you can shuffle them.

1207
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:51,040
But this window we need
so this window we need

1208
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,520
and we are going to open a project
Explorer.

1209
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,280
Okay.

1210
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,080
So throughout this cause,

1211
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,640
what we'll be creating is
will be creating the different projects.

1212
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:05,200
So for example, y learning
the Java will create one project.

1213
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,200
Then when you guys are going to have
a review classes, you guys going

1214
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,880
to have a different project.

1215
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,080
And then when we're going to have
a different modules, you guys are going to

1216
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,080
create a different project.

1217
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,640
So what is the package?

1218
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:23,280
Explorer or Project Explorer is,
is going to show you is going to show you

1219
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,280
the lives of the projects
that you created on your eclipse.

1220
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:28,800
Okay.

1221
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,080
So for example, let's see, Package
Explorer, right?

1222
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,680
Package Explorer here.

1223
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,840
Once we start grading all the projects,
you want to see them on your list.

1224
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:43,520
For example, what happens if you open up
and you don't see what happened?

1225
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,080
If you open up, you don't see.

1226
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,400
Okay, so don't panic, guys. Don't panic.

1227
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,120
Everything is

1228
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,280
fixable in here.

1229
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,480
So how do we call this window?

1230
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,640
Maybe that's one thing
that you will have to remember.

1231
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,760
And the window that.

1232
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,880
Where are you going
to see the list of project.

1233
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,880
You can find it by looking for

1234
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,000
Project Explorer or Package Explorer.

1235
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,880
Now, to bring that view you
to bring that window up,

1236
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,720
I have to go and click on window.

1237
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,000
Okay.

1238
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,400
And I'll have to click on Show View.

1239
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,640
Going to see
I click on a window show view.

1240
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,440
Hey would you view I would like to see

1241
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,400
I would like to see a project Explorer.

1242
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:31,360
I would like to explore
what kind of products I want my eclipse.

1243
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:31,920
Right.

1244
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,680
So just, just going to click a project
Explorer and this window comes up.

1245
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,640
This window comes up.

1246
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,080
Okay, So once again, how do I find it?

1247
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,880
Let's see if I open my eclipse and oh,
my God, everything has gone right.

1248
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,200
So what do you do? You go on window.

1249
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,840
You go and show view
and you select Project

1250
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,680
Explorer object,
you click on it, it comes back.

1251
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,720
And when it

1252
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,440
comes to Ides, when it comes to you
in programing guys,

1253
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:06,760
there's more than one way
you can accomplish the same task, right?

1254
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,560
For example,
if you work again, if you don't have it,

1255
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,440
there's another way
how you can bring this window.

1256
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,960
You guys will see a little search.

1257
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,360
You guys will see a little search button
on the top

1258
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:24,160
right corner of your eclipse.

1259
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,080
Why not the package explorer?

1260
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,240
It's there is similar
because once we start

1261
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,480
adding packages, once we learn
what is a package, right,

1262
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,760
then it will show you a package
view of the project.

1263
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,760
We will talk about projects
and then we will talk about the packages.

1264
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,000
Okay.

1265
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,360
But for now my suggestion
is try use the project Explorer.

1266
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,920
But even if you want to select
package export,

1267
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,040
the view will be very, very similar.

1268
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,000
Then you will become a little different.

1269
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,360
Once you have a lot of programs,
a lot of projects

1270
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,240
that that's
when you guys going to see the difference.

1271
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,400
But as of now, you know, going
to see that much of the difference.

1272
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,840
So once again, if you if you lost

1273
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:12,800
and if you don't want to go to window
show view and project Explorer,

1274
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,320
there's a little search button on your top
right corner of your eclipse gate.

1275
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,960
So what you can do, you click
you can click on this search right?

1276
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,560
And now what I'm trying to search I'm
trying to search for a specific window,

1277
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,440
which window
I'm trying to select for Project

1278
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,840
Explorer.

1279
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,520
And you just click in here.

1280
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,760
Well, it shows up.

1281
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,040
Okay, So don't be scared.

1282
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,960
There is that. Next time,
if you open, you eclipse open day.

1283
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,200
Try the program.

1284
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,200
Maybe your eclipse shuts down.

1285
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,520
And if you don't see it now,
you guys know two ways how to break.

1286
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,760
Another thing

1287
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,840
from my and does
it shows on the left side right

1288
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,040
but also this window
don't have to be on the left side.

1289
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:01,880
This this window can be on the top.

1290
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:05,320
This window can be again on the left side.

1291
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,640
This window can be here.

1292
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,840
This window can be on the bottom.

1293
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,720
So what I'm trying to say, this window

1294
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,760
that you guys have,
Project Explorer, this it's

1295
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,480
movable.

1296
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,080
You can drag it to any direction you like.

1297
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:24,440
You can make it bigger or smaller, Right?

1298
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,520
How do you drag this?

1299
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,640
So once you hover over your mouse, right.

1300
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:34,640
Once you have over your mouse on
the project Explorer, then with your left.

1301
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,520
With your left mouse
or with the left button,

1302
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,160
hold the left button
and you guys can move it.

1303
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,600
You can see it's moving.

1304
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,160
It's asking me where I want to place,
where I want to place it.

1305
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,160
All this is movable,
so for my preferences,

1306
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,280
I usually like to have it on the left
side.

1307
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,720
I like to have it on the left side.

1308
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,080
I don't like to have it
just strictly strictly on the top

1309
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,440
a minute.

1310
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,440
Please
make sure your fix your connection of now.

1311
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,720
You did not miss much of the things. Okay,

1312
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,280
so project Explorer, we know this project

1313
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:16,680
now lets you view this for

1314
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,520
a project Explorer.

1315
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:28,160
So once again it's a window where you go
in to see leads of all projects.

1316
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,440
Okay I three or

1317
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,560
I'll Kazim my suggestion please
make sure you change it.

1318
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,880
Please make sure you change it.

1319
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,840
We need our requirements
at least I five Yep.

1320
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,240
At minimum ie five And of course
if you have a seven that will be better.

1321
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,440
But you will need at minimum five.

1322
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,440
Okay, so now this is where we're going

1323
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,360
to see the list of all the projects

1324
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,320
in all the Java programs
that we will be developing.

1325
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,920
We are going to see them in order.

1326
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,840
We're going to organize them

1327
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,320
now remember, guys,
when we talk about programing, right?

1328
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,240
We go in. When we talk about programing.

1329
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:03,720
So what is it?

1330
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,600
Programing insisted on instructions
that we given.

1331
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,320
Right.

1332
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,440
And those
then those instruction is a process

1333
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,720
and then those instructions provided
some output.

1334
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,080
Right? Provided the output.

1335
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,160
I mean, I'm going to show you all.

1336
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,840
So now where I'm going

1337
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:27,640
to see the output of my program today,
we're going to write very simple programs.

1338
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,160
Hello world. Hello.

1339
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,920
Hello, Tahmina. Hello, Rahul.

1340
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,720
All right, so we're going to see
the output of that program.

1341
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,440
So now what do we have to bring?

1342
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,560
We have to bring another window.

1343
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,280
And this window,
we call it console window. Right?

1344
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,120
So this same thing,
what will do will go on window show view.

1345
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,800
Hey, what kind of window?

1346
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,720
And I need my console. Right.

1347
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,840
So this is what I need.

1348
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:52,640
I need my console maker here,

1349
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:58,400
my console Kim And the same thing
as you can make it bigger, smaller

1350
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,600
you can move it from here to here,

1351
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,760
from here to here, from here to here.

1352
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,440
Right?

1353
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,200
So this window is movable, this small.

1354
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,680
So go see. I switch them right now. Right.

1355
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,200
So my most preferable way,
I'll like to have a project

1356
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:21,320
Explorer on top,
and I like to have a console in here.

1357
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,280
So in this
window, that's for you guys going to have.

1358
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,560
So your project Explorer
usually here is your project Explorer.

1359
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,920
My console will be here any output.

1360
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,480
So any output of my program
will come in here

1361
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,320
and once me create our first program
guide here.

1362
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,600
We will be doing out
here, we'll be doing so.

1363
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,520
This is my preferable way for you.

1364
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:52,200
Maybe you will like to have a console
on the right corner.

1365
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,040
Maybe you guys will like it.
You have on the top.

1366
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,440
You guys are more than welcome to do it
the way you like it, right?

1367
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,360
The your I likes it and feels comfortable.

1368
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:01,920
Right.

1369
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,560
So once again,
let's say I'm going to close.

1370
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,200
Oh my God, I need my console.
Where's my console?

1371
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,600
I need to see the output.

1372
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:13,600
So my problem, once again,
you go to window show you console, right

1373
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,560
or shorter way.

1374
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,440
I don't know how much shorter
you go on this search.

1375
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,720
Right on your top right corner,
you click on search.

1376
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:23,440
Okay.

1377
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,760
What I'm searching for, I am searching.

1378
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,440
I lost my console.

1379
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,960
I'm looking for my console.

1380
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,920
You type with eagle, which you need unique
console.

1381
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,040
You click on it and it comes the thinking.

1382
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,200
You can put it all the way up.

1383
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,960
You can put it all the way down. Right.

1384
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:40,800
We'll leave it in here.

1385
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,840
So it depend on the output. Our program.

1386
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:45,560
If I put this program, sure,
you guys can keep it this way.

1387
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,080
When?

1388
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:50,600
Whenever we will be interacting
with our program console,

1389
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,440
maybe you guys will need to make it
bigger.

1390
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,960
You will just make it be great once again.

1391
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:55,920
Just try.

1392
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,480
Try it. Don't be scared. This
things will not go away.

1393
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,320
But I really want you to try to move
your windows different directions.

1394
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:16,400
Please try to do it.

1395
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:21,360
Console shop Mohammed Once again
let's see if it's not showing up.

1396
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,640
Click Go.

1397
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,800
In this search and type console once
you start typing see or and that's right

1398
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,600
and then it's will are complete
and you just click on it

1399
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,400
or another way if you don't have it
go on Windows

1400
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,320
show new console

1401
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,800
what is the outline?

1402
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,080
There's many other Windows
guys There's a many other windows

1403
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,800
if you're going to look we know
show you there, you guys,

1404
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,440
if you for example, whenever

1405
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,720
we'll be doing more of the coding,
if you want to see the problems,

1406
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:59,560
the slick problems, there will be
whenever we start doing more testing,

1407
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,960
there will be error logs, there will be
a lot, a lot of different stuff.

1408
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,320
So for now, guys, let's not select
any other ones.

1409
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,800
Let's not look for any other ones.

1410
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,040
Outline, outline.

1411
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:13,040
We will bring it
maybe a little bit later once we start.

1412
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,800
I think
once we start the debugging for now

1413
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:20,520
to have your project, your console,
that's what you need.

1414
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,560
That's okay, that's what you need.

1415
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,760
So I can put it one

1416
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,960
way or that I like it

1417
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,280
so you figure out, okay, but

1418
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,880
so are you guys all able
to move this windows left,

1419
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,600
right up and down.

1420
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,520
Okay now what happened?

1421
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,240
Why are you waking all the triggers?

1422
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,960
Because I don't want you to be scared,
okay?

1423
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,360
I don't want you to be scared.

1424
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,160
I you to try the things you wouldn't
if they.

1425
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,040
If it doesn't happen from the first time.

1426
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,160
Try, try, try again until you

1427
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,760
had to bring those down here, Mike.

1428
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,680
So what do you do?

1429
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,920
All right, You go for a top, right?

1430
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,960
And then hold your mouse with the

1431
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,840
with the left key.

1432
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,040
And then while you're holding it,
you have to hold your mouse.

1433
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,280
Then you can drag them anywhere.

1434
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:18,280
Okay,
hold it with the mouse and then drag it

1435
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,120
just.

1436
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:34,160
All right, So.

1437
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:38,920
So now, once we figure out which
which windows we need.

1438
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:39,840
So what?

1439
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,240
We will start doing this for the

1440
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:47,120
all Java classes, for the entire
Java classes that we will be doing.

1441
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,560
Guys, we will be creating one Java project

1442
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,720
that will be creating one job project
or review classes

1443
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,360
in the center will be a code.

1444
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:04,560
Okay, Once we start one, once we create a
Java, then this will be the window.

1445
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,000
This will be the window.

1446
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,920
We will be typing our code.

1447
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,920
Okay, So we know to see

1448
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,560
our the list of our programs

1449
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,680
here, the window to do

1450
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,400
it, programing using,
using our java and window

1451
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,640
to see the output of the program
that we have created.

1452
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:26,040
Okay, so what do we need to do right now?

1453
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,960
Is we going to create the Java project?

1454
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,760
Okay, so once again, in the IDE,
there is a two different ways

1455
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,800
here at minimum, three different ways
how you can create a job project.

1456
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:41,160
I'm sure you guys, all of you have this
option create a Java project right?

1457
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,160
If you guys don't have it,

1458
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,640
if you guys don't have this option, create
a Java project.

1459
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:52,960
You guys can select, file, and select new
and then select Java Project.

1460
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,720
Okay.

1461
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:54,840
So if you guys don't

1462
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,680
have this option on the left
created Java project, then go file

1463
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,600
new Java project.

1464
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,240
So either from here, right,
either from here

1465
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:11,040
or either from here,
you can select this option.

1466
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,080
So I'll click on Create a Java project.

1467
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,880
So once you create, click on the Create
Java Project's there,

1468
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,520
this window will pop up.

1469
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,600
This window right, this window.

1470
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,120
So there's a few things
that we have to specify.

1471
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,280
There's a few things we have to specify.

1472
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,280
What I have to do.

1473
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,880
If I have to give a name of my project,
right to has to give a name,

1474
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:35,760
and we will go a little bit later
after we do a couple of the programs,

1475
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,880
guys, about
what is the most preferable way

1476
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:45,000
to give names to certain things in Java
and other things we'll discuss.

1477
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,560
But for now,
I want to give a name for my project.

1478
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,320
I Want to give a name for my project
right.

1479
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,840
It's like going the new Year.

1480
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,400
It's me. It's

1481
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,360
okay.

1482
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,000
So let me ask you this.

1483
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,320
Let me ask you right.

1484
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,400
So what I would like to name,

1485
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:11,840
I would like to name my program
I want to name my program Java Basics,

1486
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:15,760
because for the first thing classes,
that's what we guys going to learn.

1487
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,480
We are going to learn the basics
of Java program language, right?

1488
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,000
So now let's say I want to type Java

1489
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,640
and yeah, basics, right?

1490
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,280
So we all can read, right?

1491
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,200
It's very easy,
really easy, readable, right?

1492
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:34,480
But now what happens, guys?

1493
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,560
What happens whenever Will will be created
a project in Java.

1494
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,480
Right? One more time. Sure.

1495
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,600
So what we'll do goes here, let me make.

1496
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,400
I'll make it bigger.

1497
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,960
Right from your left option
right from your project Explorer.

1498
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:55,360
Or even if you guys are going to have
a package Explorer.

1499
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:55,840
Right.

1500
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,520
So what do you do?

1501
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:59,480
You just click on Create a Java project.

1502
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,560
Just click on Create a project.

1503
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,960
And once you click on it,
this window will show up.

1504
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:05,680
Okay.

1505
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,680
So unfortunately, guys,
I cannot make this one bigger,

1506
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,640
but the actual actual coding wants
will start to

1507
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,240
as of course I'll make it big right?

1508
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,440
So now what do we have to do?

1509
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,280
We have to give a name.

1510
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,840
Okay. Yeah.

1511
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,680
And by the way, guys, this is just Ed
that I'm using

1512
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,000
where I'm going to type a notes
sometimes, right?

1513
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,840
So I want to give a name for my project.

1514
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,840
I want to give a ninja of these.

1515
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,400
Why do we have one issue list?

1516
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,320
We have one
is whenever will be given the name here,

1517
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,160
whenever we'll be given
the name to anything in Java.

1518
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:38,720
Right.

1519
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,720
We cannot

1520
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:45,760
write, we cannot have space
since there is no spaces allowed.

1521
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,520
So it means now what I will have to go
will have to combine two words together.

1522
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,640
So now if I'm going to combine tools
together.

1523
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,360
Right.

1524
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,360
So can I still read it?

1525
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:58,200
Of course I can still read it.

1526
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:02,560
I still can read it right my now
because two words I have but think good.

1527
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,320
What is some word
You have more than two words, right?

1528
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,360
I'm going to have Java basics from

1529
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,920
right now.

1530
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:15,760
It becomes a little bit harder
read right now think guys what

1531
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:21,520
if all type of like this yellow pages
And then if I want to add

1532
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,600
something like this,
which way is easier, easier to read

1533
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,400
first way or second way.

1534
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:31,800
Second way right second way.

1535
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,360
It's more easier to read.

1536
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:39,080
Okay, so this is how we are going
to name our projects

1537
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:41,880
and this is how we are going to name

1538
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:44,720
our classes in our classes.

1539
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,960
So this type of this way of typing this,

1540
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,400
what we call it,
we call it a camel case in right now.

1541
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,520
You guys know the animal.

1542
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,440
Camel, right?

1543
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:58,280
It has those humps, two humps.

1544
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,560
I mean, it can have one, but
we going to talk about two humps, right?

1545
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:06,240
So goes
up, down, up and down right towards right.

1546
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:10,080
So what I'm doing here, I have

1547
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,760
Java basics for myself.

1548
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,480
I have first word, second word,
third world, fourth word, right.

1549
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:21,720
So now whenever I'm creating the project,
I cannot have spaces.

1550
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,160
I cannot have spaces.

1551
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,280
I will have to remove the spaces.

1552
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:30,000
So now when I'm combining two
or more words,

1553
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,920
so we are going to follow a camel case
and every new word

1554
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:39,840
will be starting with
the upper thing will be the opposite.

1555
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,600
So why are we doing it?
Do I have to do it?

1556
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,960
No, I don't have to do it.

1557
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:43,680
I don't have to do it.

1558
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:49,400
But why I'm doing it,
I am doing it to improve readability.

1559
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,400
Right? Readability.

1560
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,600
We are not going to call it for my style.

1561
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,120
What this probably going to mean.

1562
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,600
We're going to name it Java Basics, right

1563
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:01,560
there, like my project

1564
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,560
or like later.

1565
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:02,920
We will.

1566
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,760
I guess later
we will see what other things we can do.

1567
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:10,960
We will go over some rules
and we go over some naming conventions.

1568
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,000
Like what? I'm going to type.

1569
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,280
I'm going to type Java

1570
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,280
one for one.

1571
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,360
So you.

1572
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,160
Right, create a general project.

1573
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:32,200
So what are what is the name I have given?

1574
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,400
What is it?

1575
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,480
What is the reason we can use this
basis for now, let's think about Java.

1576
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,520
This is not actually
the Java behind this scene.

1577
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,600
We are developing a

1578
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,520
we are developing a folder. Okay.

1579
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,680
But thinking right now
there is no space is a lot of space for of

1580
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:53,160
things.

1581
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:57,280
So would you in the project name Java
So here guys

1582
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,240
we don't have to do anything
except one thing, except one thing.

1583
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:05,600
So right now by default,
you guys will see this option

1584
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,120
that says use an execution environment
jury.

1585
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,640
Later you guys will learn what is jury.

1586
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,360
There's JDK,
there's there's different things in there.

1587
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,760
And you guys will see this dropdown.

1588
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:21,600
So what I want you to do, please
click on that dropdown displays, click

1589
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:26,800
on that dropdown and what are we going
to select from this dropdown?

1590
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,600
I'm going to select Java 1.83.

1591
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:34,440
I'm going to select Java 1.8.

1592
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,040
Okay.

1593
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,880
So now we can magnify

1594
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:44,760
some good things.

1595
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:49,560
We have done this in the project name
and for the execution

1596
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:52,520
environment, please select Java 1.8

1597
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,560
and once you do those two things,

1598
01:21:55,560 --> 01:22:00,000
you guys will see the option finish.

1599
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,400
You guys will see that

1600
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,480
you guys will see the button finish

1601
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:14,040
to week.

1602
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:17,360
I'll click on, finish and finish.

1603
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,640
So now what's going to happen
under your project Explorer?

1604
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,800
You guys are going to see

1605
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,320
your first project
that's going to see a first project.

1606
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:32,200
And if I click on this right,
if I click to extend,

1607
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:37,720
if I click on Extend, this is
what are you guys going to see right?

1608
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,840
So what we created, we created one project

1609
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,200
and what kind of project get is
it is a Java project.

1610
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,160
You guys see it has a little G later guys.

1611
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,240
Once you will learn more and more stuff,
our project will have a little different

1612
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:54,440
name, a little different later,
but for now you guys see it since.

1613
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:58,320
G So what we created,
we created a project where I

1614
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:03,080
m able to see this structure,
this structure from my project, right?

1615
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,680
So available on the Project Explorer view.

1616
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,600
So now you guys going to click on this
triangle, right?

1617
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,800
If you want to click on the triangle
to expand,

1618
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,840
there is a two options
that you guys will see that will tell you,

1619
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:19,920
the library will tell you the library
and it will tell you something as r.

1620
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,840
C Okay, so now what is our suspense for

1621
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:27,080
This are suspense for story source.

1622
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:30,800
Okay, so now this is a program is case.

1623
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,640
What we will be writing?

1624
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,840
We will be writing a force court, right?

1625
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:40,120
We'll write the source code
using our programing languages.

1626
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:45,320
There is a process is will be
will be happening behind

1627
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,960
which we were able to see.

1628
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,760
But there's a lot of things
that will be happening guys in behind

1629
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:56,040
and then our source code will be converted

1630
01:23:56,040 --> 01:24:00,240
and the conversion
the code will be executed by our

1631
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,680
by our

1632
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,280
Java machines
and then we going to see the output.

1633
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,800
Okay,
it will be guys in a matter of seconds.

1634
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,400
We are not going to see this,

1635
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:13,480
but the main thing to take are from here
us is the programmers.

1636
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,560
We are writing a source code.

1637
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,280
Okay.

1638
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:19,520
And besides the source code guys here,
you guys going to see the library?

1639
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,800
It's the Java library, right?
Where are we going?

1640
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:22,960
Where are we going?

1641
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:28,840
To see a lot of a lot of useful things
we will be using for our programing later.

1642
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,000
Maybe we will go a little bit inside
to show you the things, but not today.

1643
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,920
There's a crazy amount of things
that they in there.

1644
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,320
Okay, good things
that we're you guys going to see now?

1645
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,160
What are we going to do this

1646
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:43,200
Whenever we are

1647
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,040
doing the programing,
whenever we do doing the programing, guys,

1648
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:50,400
from the day one,
we try to become very, very organized.

1649
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,200
Okay?

1650
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,520
We like things
that are being organized, right?

1651
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,800
Think of this
when you would go to the library,

1652
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,960
When you go to the library,
you want to look for a specific book.

1653
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,360
Will you guys know where to go?

1654
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,600
Let's see if you look into the directory,

1655
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,120
if you if you search for the will,
you guys know where to go to find this?

1656
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:12,440
Let's say I want to
I want to learn Java programing.

1657
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:13,080
Right.

1658
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,880
And I can find it in the library. Right.

1659
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,600
Or for example,
I want to look into the history. Right.

1660
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,920
I will be able to find it.

1661
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,600
But how am I able to find this?

1662
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:34,520
How am I able to find it?

1663
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,920
Because it's organized, right?

1664
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:40,800
It's organized in different sections
right here.

1665
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,960
So ecology, science, history,

1666
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,160
whatever the things you want to do,
you want to find, right?

1667
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,560
And then it will be also
in alphabetical order, right?

1668
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,240
What the main thing is
here, it's organized, right?

1669
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,640
So the same thing.
What are we trying to do, guys?

1670
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:59,920
Because we will be writing many, many,
many different codes, right?

1671
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,000
Many,
many different programs in our class.

1672
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,680
So what we will try to do,
we will try to organize our code.

1673
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,920
So our code will be organized
a specific way.

1674
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:18,080
So now to organize our code in Java,
we have something that code packages.

1675
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:22,960
Okay, we we have something
the code packages packages is just a full

1676
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:27,960
there's guys and what we'll be doing,
we will be giving names to those folders.

1677
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:28,640
Right.

1678
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:32,520
So for example, hey, today is a class one.

1679
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,880
I want to find out what I have learned
in the class one.

1680
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,320
I'll go to this specific.

1681
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,760
Hey, I want to find out what I learn
in the class.

1682
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,520
Number two,
I'll go to that specific package.

1683
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,120
Right.

1684
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,640
So now, in order
for us to create the package

1685
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,640
now, the package has to be inside
the source code.

1686
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,440
Okay, So I will highlight
my source package, right?

1687
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,480
That will just click on it.

1688
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,960
And you see this once
you click on any highlights. Okay.

1689
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,320
Yeah, it is empty.

1690
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:00,800
Good for me.

1691
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,200
It's also if you want to click on it,
it is empty because we have not read

1692
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,360
written any Korean. Right? It is empty.

1693
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:11,520
So now highlight your source
and now do the right click.

1694
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,600
Once you do the right
click with your mind,

1695
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,400
this is the options
that will be given to you.

1696
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,400
So what we will select, we will select new

1697
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:23,640
and then we will select
what I'm trying to create.

1698
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,840
I'm trying to create a package.

1699
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,400
Why do I need the package?

1700
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,600
Because I want to organize my code.

1701
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,560
I want to organize my call.

1702
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,920
And we're going to take a break
soon, guys.

1703
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,920
I know it's already 1132,
but let's create a package plus

1704
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:41,000
and then probably we will take a break.

1705
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:41,600
Okay.

1706
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,200
When the name right name,

1707
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,840
same thing is can give anything.

1708
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,800
I can give any name that I want.

1709
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,520
One standard way, right?

1710
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,680
One more time. Sure.

1711
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,160
You select one source.

1712
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:59,080
You do right click with your mouse.

1713
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:02,360
Right
click, select new and you select package.

1714
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,200
Okay, Right click.

1715
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,880
New package.

1716
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,840
And then this window for the package
will come up.

1717
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,440
What it's for.

1718
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,160
The package will come. All right.

1719
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:18,840
So now we have to give a name
while I can give any name.

1720
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,360
While I can give any name.

1721
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,880
So the standard wiggle is the standard way

1722
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,560
that is being used on the industry.

1723
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:31,200
What we will be using,
we will be using that reverse

1724
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:36,840
way of the euro right.

1725
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,280
You can click it, I assure

1726
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,480
you. All right.

1727
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,560
You should be able if you must.

1728
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,720
That doesn't work from your system. Okay.

1729
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,680
If you cannot,
let's see what you can click on file.

1730
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:51,280
You can click on new and select package.

1731
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:51,960
Okay.

1732
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,920
But make sure you select your stores,
highlighted you stores click on file,

1733
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,720
click on new and select.

1734
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,240
So package.

1735
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,600
It's not like you are clicking it,
you just highlight it is highlighted.

1736
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,120
So the reverse way of the euro, right?

1737
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:12,680
For example this for example, right.

1738
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,840
So let's see, I am going to hire

1739
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:18,840
right I'm going to have

1740
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:19,920
so what is the euro?

1741
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,600
This for example for Google, right.

1742
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,400
We have w w w we're going to skip that.

1743
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:30,040
But our URL for Google will be Google dot
com, right?

1744
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:32,240
That will be Google dot com.

1745
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:36,760
So now if I want to do the reverse,
what are we going to have?

1746
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,800
We are going to have pull that Google
right.

1747
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:44,680
That's what
we want to have contact Google right.

1748
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:49,480
For example syntax
that come right syntax that comes right

1749
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,040
our is almost syntax right.

1750
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,760
So now what are we going to type.

1751
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,040
We going to type.

1752
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:59,280
Cool that syntax. Right. Com that syntax.

1753
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:03,440
So what it is, it's a
your reverse way right now

1754
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,320
when you think of it's also going to be
a very unique Right.

1755
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:11,760
Every single company
they have their URLs in those URLs

1756
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:17,360
a very unique right
so we are uniquely naming our

1757
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,520
our packages

1758
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:23,840
when university
we don't have to guess We don't have to.

1759
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:29,880
But this is this this is a practices
that has been used in the industry.

1760
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,520
Okay.

1761
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,160
But we don't have this.

1762
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:36,760
Is there something there is something
that called rule where you have to do it,

1763
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:40,800
but there's something called convention
naming conventions.

1764
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,520
Right.

1765
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,040
And by the convention, by

1766
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:48,240
what has been used in the industry,
that's how people like to go.

1767
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:48,760
Right.

1768
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,240
And why are we using
the reverse way of euro?

1769
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:55,040
Because think of this,
every single URL is unique, right?

1770
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,880
When every single company you are
there is not going to find

1771
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,520
duplicate euros, right?

1772
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,920
You're not going to type

1773
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,280
Google dot com and then all of the sudden
you will be taken to the ABC company.

1774
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:06,840
Right?

1775
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,280
You are going to directly navigate it.

1776
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,160
Google so in the library. Right.

1777
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:16,400
All those
the name of those sections are unique.

1778
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:17,520
That's what we tried to do.

1779
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:23,480
We tried to give a unique names
to our packages.

1780
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,160
All right.

1781
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:28,320
So, so what are we going to type
on that syntax?

1782
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:28,960
Right.

1783
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,040
And now, because there's a different way
how we can our code, right.

1784
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,520
There's a different way
and all the different way.

1785
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,640
But for now,
the way I want to organize my core,

1786
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,720
I want to organize it for classes right?

1787
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,640
I want to organize stored
there all my little Java programs

1788
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:51,640
that I'm going to develop in the class
one package and then class two package.

1789
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,240
And then class three, packaging,
then class four.

1790
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:54,800
So what?

1791
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,440
I'm going to top class zero one.

1792
01:31:58,680 --> 01:31:59,120
Okay.

1793
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,640
So any problems
that we will be developing,

1794
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:07,680
they will be living inside this package
tomorrow, will be creating the new package

1795
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:12,160
and all the programs that we will be
creating in the package home.

1796
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:17,200
That syntax, that Class zero
two will be stored in different package.

1797
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,120
So this way, ten classes down the road.

1798
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,120
Hey, you know what they are?

1799
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:26,120
We did some nice exercise
and in the had a struggle a little bit

1800
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,600
you know what that exercise

1801
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,200
was done in the class number two
let me go back and look into it.

1802
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:35,640
You can easily find it How You can easily
find it because we organize it.

1803
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,800
How do we organize it?

1804
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,560
We organize it
in the form of packages, right?

1805
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,640
So what I type my type com that's Internet
class zero one

1806
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:46,440
and we click on finished right.

1807
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,480
So now package package is

1808
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,920
just a folder
that's now inside the folder.

1809
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:54,360
Right inside the folder.

1810
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,960
Even if you take a physical folder. Right.

1811
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,160
I can have many, many different files
inside.

1812
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,600
Right. I have many, many different files.

1813
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:07,040
So now inside this package,
what we'll be creating,

1814
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:10,320
we will be creating
many, many Java programs.

1815
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,960
Now, in
order for us to create a Java program,

1816
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,840
what we will be creating, we will be
creating something that called class.

1817
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:23,800
So now where I would like that
class to be stored

1818
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,560
because this program is belong
to my class.

1819
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,400
Number one,
I want to store inside this package.

1820
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:34,440
So the same thing you guys just click on
and highlighted and the right click new.

1821
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,320
And now this time, what are we creating?

1822
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,720
By creating a class

1823
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:42,240
inside this package, we are creating

1824
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,280
a new class.

1825
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:51,680
You can.

1826
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,520
So now this window will show up.

1827
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,560
This window will show once again

1828
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,160
directly new class, right?

1829
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:04,560
If the right click doesn't work,
I let it file new and from here select

1830
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,920
the class column that syntax
and I type class zero one

1831
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,240
com that injects that

1832
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,760
last one.

1833
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:17,480
That's what I did.

1834
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:17,920
That's

1835
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,280
what now I want to create a class

1836
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:28,920
new was in once this window shows it again
I have to give a name right

1837
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,640
and you guys probably
when you went to different

1838
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,840
tutorials
the very first thing was program.

1839
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:37,080
What is the name that for?

1840
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:38,760
What is the first program.

1841
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:42,400
And that's usually everybody does this

1842
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,800
Hello World, right?

1843
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,640
So Hello World, We will set a name
Hello World.

1844
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,480
Now you guys are going to have your order
first.

1845
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,080
Hello World program. Right?

1846
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,320
So now the same thing for a name, right?

1847
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:59,760
I cannot have a space, right?
I cannot have a space.

1848
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:03,920
So if I'm going to add this space,
this button becomes enabled, right?

1849
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,520
You guys see, I'm
not able to click on finish.

1850
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,520
So here for Java,
we don't allow to have space.

1851
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,880
Okay. It's a rule, right? Like

1852
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,080
in whatever language you want to learn.

1853
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,680
Right. That does doesn't have to be
a programing language you want to learn.

1854
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,640
I know as I mentioned,
Turkish Arabic, Spanish,

1855
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,680
whatever language
you want to learn. Right.

1856
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:26,040
It has a strict rules.

1857
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:29,680
So here the same thing Rule
Java says, Hey, don't give me your spaces.

1858
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,200
I don't need your spaces. Right?

1859
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,320
And then another thing, what are we going
to observe the rule there.

1860
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:38,280
I want you guys to do something.

1861
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:42,160
I want to click this checkbox.

1862
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,960
So this is how your class looks like,
right?

1863
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,760
You guys see, there's a one checkbox
that I want you to select

1864
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:52,000
next to public Void Main.

1865
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:59,480
Okay, just click on this checkbox in here
and then click on Finish.

1866
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:03,800
What I'm selecting this public static
would me and I'm clicking on finish.

1867
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:08,240
All right so now that's

1868
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,880
where my record shows up.

1869
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:16,800
That's where
I'm actually will be doing my Java coding.

1870
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,280
Okay, So Now if your window looks
too small, if your window looks

1871
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,280
too big now we can control against okay,
we can control it.

1872
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:28,440
So if you're Mac user,
if you're Mac user like me,

1873
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:33,120
click on the command and select
plus so I can increase it.

1874
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,400
Now I can make it
whichever size I want it.

1875
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:41,680
If it's too big,
you'll do command and minus right.

1876
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,000
Can the project package name be modified?

1877
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:44,840
Yes we can.

1878
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,360
We can modify this
and I'll show you how to modify.

1879
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,920
Let's say if you misspell something,
you want to change it.

1880
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,880
Of course you can. This one image.

1881
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:55,480
Everything is changeable,
everything is movable.

1882
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,120
We can do a lot of things, right?

1883
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,040
Yes. I'll show you this.

1884
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,840
I'll show and if your windows user,

1885
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:05,640
if you a Windows user to increase the font
right

1886
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,480
you in Greece

1887
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:12,160
font in eclipse.

1888
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:15,440
Right. So for Mac
what do you guys will use.

1889
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,400
You will use guys command

1890
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,000
a month and plus write

1891
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,040
all windows
what are you guys going to use.

1892
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:29,800
You guys won't use control
and plus what you will control or for

1893
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:33,280
this will command
and you just click on plot

1894
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:37,040
once again.

1895
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,600
Right. Let me delete it

1896
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,000
if we pretend like nothing happened.

1897
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:42,760
Right.

1898
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:46,720
So once again, now inside the package,
I will be creating my

1899
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,840
grade in my Java classes.

1900
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:50,440
Right?

1901
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:53,000
So I'll do right click, I'll select new,

1902
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:56,760
I'll select class

1903
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,800
to you, even name

1904
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:04,200
my program
Hello World and I have to select main.

1905
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:08,520
Let me write public static would mean
there will be a checkbox.

1906
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,920
Just click on this channel
box and click on Vanish.

1907
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,400
And here our

1908
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:18,640
program showed up in the which I have

1909
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,880
to put my instruction

1910
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:22,120
control.

1911
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,240
That control class doesn't work on

1912
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,320
Windows.

1913
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:29,960
Can you guys double check works for you

1914
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,760
worked

1915
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,280
SharePoint make sure you will hold you

1916
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:44,640
you need to hold control.

1917
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,760
Yeah and you have to select
this particular window.

1918
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:51,000
For example, if you in Project Explorer,
it's not going to do anything. Yep.

1919
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:54,360
Just make sure you are actually
inside this code.

1920
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:54,600
Right.

1921
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,080
Put your cursor in here
and do our control. Plus

1922
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:03,000
we'll control and duplex

1923
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,720
until it gets big.

1924
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:08,400
Michael Chromebook.

1925
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,960
Well Chromebook.
Well I hope it works for now.

1926
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,120
I just hope your Chromebook will be fine

1927
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:17,880
for our later
or later things when it will be learning

1928
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:22,560
because there's a lot of progress
that will be installing.

1929
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:22,840
Okay.

1930
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:29,440
All right.

1931
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:33,480
So we are I'm going to explain you
all the details here in there,

1932
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,320
but I just want to

1933
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,880
make sure your first program runs as
and we're going to take a break.

1934
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:41,640
But of course, there's I'm going
to explain you where you have to type.

1935
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,640
What happens if you don't see all of that.

1936
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:43,920
Right.

1937
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,840
I will explain you all the things.

1938
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:49,240
Okay. So

1939
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:53,920
now, once you are inside this,
once you are inside,

1940
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:59,760
I want you to be inside
this made inside this means.

1941
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,600
So what are you going to see?

1942
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,720
My class. Right?

1943
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:05,960
Public class for now
probably doesn't make sense.

1944
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:11,560
A lot of t, but e will make perfect,
perfect sense based on the class number

1945
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,600
17. You guys will know every single thing
what it means.

1946
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,200
Right?

1947
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:19,080
But for now,
just remember two things, guys.

1948
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:24,040
So if class that you created, right,
we name it.

1949
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:24,960
How did we name it?

1950
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,200
We name it. Hello World. Right?

1951
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:32,600
When we created the class,
our class has its own rating.

1952
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:36,840
Okay, guys, we are going to have a many,
many different braces,

1953
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:40,760
square brackets, parentheses
There are many things that we will have.

1954
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,760
Right?

1955
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:47,200
So here
our class is going to have its own braces.

1956
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,360
And this raises curly braces.

1957
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:54,160
That is going to open
and it's going to close when you open.

1958
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,160
Going to close. Right.

1959
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,240
And then inside.

1960
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,400
Right inside.

1961
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,920
What do we have for now?

1962
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:03,600
It also looks a lot of crazy words.

1963
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:06,480
We seen public static would mean okay.

1964
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:11,480
And here also is going to have its
curly braces that it's opening.

1965
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:12,960
That is closing.

1966
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,280
So think.

1967
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:17,920
Okay, guys, that's
your class is a building.

1968
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,800
It's a building. Okay.

1969
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:24,760
So every building has an entrance
and exit, right?

1970
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,520
You cannot have an entrance
without the exit.

1971
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,880
You cannot have exit without the entrance.

1972
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:35,560
So there's a two pair, all your curly
braces, all the parentheses.

1973
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,680
They always will come with the peer.

1974
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:42,000
Okay, There's notice single bracket
in Java against everything has a peer.

1975
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,680
Okay? Everything has a peer.

1976
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:47,200
So our building, our class has a peer.

1977
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,840
It has an opening

1978
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,400
has an opening peer and it has a closing,

1979
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,760
opening, closing.

1980
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:59,120
Now, inside our building, this

1981
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,360
we did not type when you finished this,
we did not that when you think so

1982
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:07,760
Now inside the building, guys,
how many doors can I have this?

1983
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,400
How many doors can I have inside?

1984
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:14,760
One building?

1985
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:15,840
Many.

1986
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,440
It can be many, right?

1987
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:23,200
For example, we build in our 35 storey
building in on the 35 still floors.

1988
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,760
Oh, my God, that could be crazy.

1989
01:42:24,760 --> 01:42:26,320
Crazy amount of offices.

1990
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,600
They're going to have a lot of doors.

1991
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:32,880
But let me ask you guys, in order
for you to enter the building,

1992
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:39,000
are there
going to be one main entrance or not?

1993
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,240
They are going to be one main entrance.

1994
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:42,960
Okay.

1995
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:46,160
So now I want you to think of these

1996
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:50,640
big combination or words that says Mingus.

1997
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,760
Our main is the main entrance
to our Java program.

1998
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:00,040
Without having this entrance, we cannot

1999
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:04,200
we cannot run,
we can write, but we cannot run.

2000
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:06,040
We cannot execute our program.

2001
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:10,120
It's like without you entering
through the main door.

2002
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:10,960
I'm sorry.

2003
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,800
You can never reach the floor
number two or three, right?

2004
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,480
You have to pass through the main door.

2005
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,800
And that's all.

2006
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:21,560
That's
what our main means in our Java program.

2007
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:24,800
So anything is
anything that we will be writing

2008
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,440
have to stay inside that main door.

2009
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,160
In our main door,

2010
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:32,640
we're going to open the main door
and we're going to close it right?

2011
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,680
Without opening, you cannot close.

2012
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:38,160
So the same thing comes in the peer.

2013
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:40,800
So this is where your main door opens.

2014
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:43,080
And if you guys go to I

2015
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,440
highlighted with your mouse,

2016
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:50,080
if your main door opening,
you guys have to make sure it's close.

2017
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,120
You open your program,

2018
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:56,760
program has to close, you open your door.

2019
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:00,000
A door has to close. Okay.

2020
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,440
If you have to do it, it's okay.

2021
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,760
We will go over that wall.

2022
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:05,800
Those two double slashes means for now,
you guys can just delete them

2023
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:09,000
or you can type with under under this
to do

2024
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:13,720
so. Once again, there's all the code

2025
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:19,560
that we will be typing today
must stay within your main door

2026
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:23,400
and the main door lease
within your building.

2027
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,480
Okay, so you open in doors

2028
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:30,080
to closing Doors to closing doors.

2029
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,880
The now inside the door.

2030
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:33,200
Right.

2031
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:38,960
If you guys going to double click your
mouse after the after the curly braces.

2032
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,640
So this is this space, guys.

2033
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:44,880
This is the space that is highlighted.

2034
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,040
So this is the space we're in.

2035
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,600
Inside, all in only inside this space

2036
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:54,600
we are going to type our program
because that's where we allowed

2037
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,760
we allow it to type our program
only once we enter the main door.

2038
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,920
You cannot type
your code outside of the main door

2039
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,960
or before you enter it,
you have to enter only we type in it.

2040
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,720
Okay, so now and in here, guys,

2041
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:12,960
for the first time,
probably there will be a lot of typing.

2042
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,560
But and one thing is I know you're
learning somewhere, so no shortcuts.

2043
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,320
First class we are not using.

2044
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,960
There's a lot of shortcuts.

2045
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,920
That's the benefit of using Eclipse
or any other ides, right?

2046
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:28,440
They are friend of the programmer.

2047
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:31,000
They will help you identify
a lot of things.

2048
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:35,040
They will give us a lot of shortcuts
for whenever we the program.

2049
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:36,840
But for today, no shortcuts.

2050
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:40,400
Okay, so what I'm going to type
I'm going to type system, right.

2051
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,160
And remember this, when we say

2052
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:45,840
Java is a case sensitive, right?

2053
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,320
Typing is the operating system.

2054
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,480
Typing is the lower key system.

2055
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:52,200
Two completely words for Java.

2056
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:55,080
So you have to make sure
it's up with these kids.

2057
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,440
So we'll type system with that.

2058
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:00,680
We type then that, then we type out

2059
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:05,920
and then we type print
and then and then to parentheses

2060
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:13,560
take different of this,
which will sometimes use sometimes yes.

2061
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:16,240
But there is a process. Guys,
we also do help you out.

2062
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:21,120
Okay, So system uppercase that out.

2063
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:22,440
That print line

2064
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:25,520
there is everything is lower cases,
but we have a nuts in here, right?

2065
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,240
Then you have parentheses.

2066
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,400
And right now let's say hello right

2067
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:33,520
or whatever, whatever sentence
you want to put right.

2068
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:38,160
For example, I'm going to say hello
and I'm going to say hello.

2069
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,000
I right.

2070
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,920
So now,

2071
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:43,680
now what do you guys see?

2072
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,400
What do you guys see?

2073
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,760
You guys see a little X, right?

2074
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,840
You guys little X?

2075
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,720
I said beauty of ideas, out
ideas is telling you

2076
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,560
that there's some issues
I have in my put in my code.

2077
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,120
Right.

2078
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:05,280
So now when we talk about Java
Java is very strongly type language

2079
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:09,360
so now think good what we are right now,
we wrote the sentence.

2080
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,640
Now we have to finish it.

2081
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,120
We have to finish it.

2082
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:16,640
So now this sentence right in

2083
01:47:16,840 --> 01:47:19,800
in, in the language,
right in our speaking language,

2084
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:25,080
we call it the sentence here in Java,
we call it a statement, Right?

2085
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:26,520
We call it the statement.

2086
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,960
So now I wrote my first statement

2087
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,600
now to identify
that I finish with my statement.

2088
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:36,440
We have two other semi call.

2089
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:39,480
Now, once we have a semicolon,
there's no errors.

2090
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,480
There's no errors.

2091
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:44,080
He is based here. Yes.

2092
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:47,160
You guys can have a space in here or here.

2093
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:47,760
Don't matter.

2094
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,640
We will talk about spaces.

2095
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:51,200
We'll talk about this space.

2096
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:55,680
What are you guys going
to have more space in here or before that?

2097
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,080
You guys can have a space
that don't really matter.

2098
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:02,120
We will talk about
which spaces will matter.

2099
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:07,280
Maybe not on today's floors, but overall,
of course, this will help the no does it?

2100
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:11,160
What I have
I have written my first statement.

2101
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:15,240
What is my statement is my statement
says, Hey, I want to print.

2102
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:17,960
I want to print. Hello?

2103
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:20,320
I shot right out of print. Correct. Right.

2104
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,360
So now what I would to do,
I would like to execute.

2105
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:27,240
We will go over this.
We will go over all those things. Why?

2106
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:29,880
There need to be quotation one
There is no quotations.

2107
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:32,160
One I would just please type to it.

2108
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:36,400
Think we need a quotation,
any type we want to type word.

2109
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,000
Right? Hello is a world right?

2110
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,920
Aisha is a name. It's also a word right?

2111
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,960
So anytime you want to type
of what you have to put a quotation.

2112
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:44,320
Okay,

2113
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:47,400
so now what I would like to do.

2114
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,640
I wrote a statement.

2115
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,240
Now I want the statement to execute.

2116
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:55,160
Okay, So now if I want to execute it,
I'll do it right click.

2117
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:59,240
I'll do right
click with my mouse and then I click run.

2118
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:02,440
So now, okay, there's one moment.

2119
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:03,920
Let let me click on Run.

2120
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:08,960
So we'll let people who don't have
any issues, we'll let them take a break.

2121
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:13,080
And then whenever guys have any issues,
right, let me finish this.

2122
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:17,200
And if you still have an issue,
please send it in the support channel.

2123
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:21,960
But one thing is when you're sending in,
please take a screenshot so our our

2124
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,800
support instruct this can have a look
and they will be able to help

2125
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:28,960
because we need visually to see
what is your issue.

2126
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,640
So once again,
in order for you to execute the program,

2127
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:35,480
we will do right click, we will click run.

2128
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,760
And what are we running
our Java program, right?

2129
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,240
You just click on run

2130
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:44,200
and as an output here, guys,

2131
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:48,320
where's the output of my program comes
it comes in my console.

2132
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:52,280
So here
what I'm seeing I'm seeing Hello Aisha.

2133
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,120
You guys can write whatever name you want.

2134
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:57,720
Hello? Ready? Right.

2135
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:01,320
Then I'm going to run my program.

2136
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:02,760
Execute it.

2137
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:03,360
All right.

2138
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,160
And I will go over about the details.

2139
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:09,160
But for now, guys, I hope to work.

2140
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:10,000
Right.

2141
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,600
That's. That's it. About our programing.

2142
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,040
Guys, Thank you.

2143
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:17,640
Is finished.

2144
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,760
You guys did it right. Our first program.

2145
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,760
I said you guys are programmers.

2146
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:24,520
Okay, guys.

2147
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:29,240
So now we'll go over details,
but it's a little bit over time, right?

2148
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,440
So it's 1155.

2149
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:33,080
So let's take a break.

2150
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,320
This 15 minutes break.

2151
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:38,520
I want you to be back.

2152
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:40,880
I want you to be back. Break till

2153
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:44,400
1155, 12, ten.

2154
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:45,280
Okay.

2155
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:48,360
Please be back by 12:10 p.m..

2156
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:49,080
Okay.

2157
01:50:49,080 --> 01:50:53,280
So for those of you guys
who is having an issue with the code,

2158
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:58,120
please make sure you take a screenshot
and place it in the support channel.

2159
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,160
But I see you guys already
helping. Mariam.

2160
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:02,240
That's that's amazing.

01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:06,120
Guys.

2162
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:09,680
Brant.

2163
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,160
Mariam

2164
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:12,120
Yeah.

2165
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:17,600
Mariam Here you don't it's not I it's not
I it's l Atlan

2166
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,960
print line

2167
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,920
Yep print line.

2168
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:25,840
How do we get it?

2169
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:28,200
Zalmai You have to, you have to run it.

2170
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,080
You have to run it. I'll show you.

2171
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,320
Let me show you again.

2172
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:34,120
So once your program is ready,
you're ready to.

2173
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:34,920
What do you do?

2174
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:35,520
Do right.

2175
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:38,120
Click with your mouse and click on Run.

2176
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:39,600
There's a shorter way.

2177
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,640
Also,
there's a second way how you can read.

2178
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:45,280
But first time I want you to run it
this run it job application.

2179
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,400
Once you click on it, your program,

2180
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:49,440
if you

2181
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:53,200
guys have this button, just click
on, okay, You guys can just click.

2182
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:53,880
Okay.

2183
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:57,480
And then once
the execution of your program,

2184
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:03,040
the output of the program
will be shown on the console.

2185
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,400
All right.

2186
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:09,840
Okay, guys, with me plus the recording.

2187
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,360
All right, We are back.

2188
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,400
We are back. Real life.

2189
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:20,360
Let's look into the things
that we have done right now

2190
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:24,720
and we have the okay.

2191
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,000
So once again. Right.

2192
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
So what do we need first, Right?

2193
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,400
What do we did first? Right.

2194
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,440
We created the project.

2195
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:35,200
Now inside our project,
we have a package, right?

2196
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:37,640
Because that's do we have to have it?

2197
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,160
Do we have to create it out or.

2198
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:40,720
No, we don't have to.

2199
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,960
What if we want to create our core one?

2200
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:43,720
We organize.

2201
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:47,400
So we decided to create a package
to organize a recording.

2202
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:49,920
How did we name
It's in that class zero one

2203
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,920
Now, inside the package.

2204
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,120
What is it? Package. Package.

2205
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:55,160
It's simply a folder.

2206
01:52:55,160 --> 01:53:00,680
Guest Now, inside this package,
what we created, we created a Java class.

2207
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,360
Okay, so what is a Java class?

2208
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:08,960
This Java class is an actual Java program.

2209
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:12,080
Okay, so when we say created, I

2210
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:16,880
the Java program,
I created a Java class, right?

2211
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:20,720
So now Java program, guys,
what is a Java program?

2212
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,240
It's simpler when you look for my guys.

2213
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:26,400
Well, then you look in here, it's
simpler file, right?

2214
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:31,480
They build a file
that leaves inside our package.

2215
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:34,560
Right now, and as are their files. Right?

2216
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,640
When you think of Excel files.

2217
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:38,120
Right. Excel files.

2218
01:53:38,120 --> 01:53:51,800
What kind of extension our Excel files
have, Guys, Excel is six these days.

2219
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:52,960
It's Excel is six, right?

2220
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:55,640
Because we use in the New Year
version, Right.

2221
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:58,200
Our text. Right.

2222
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:02,440
They also have an extension,
our PowerPoints.

2223
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:05,160
We also have an extension, our text files.

2224
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:07,200
They also have an extension right.

2225
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:10,800
And now our job program is also file.

2226
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:16,040
This will go a little bit later, maybe in,
of course, on the class one everything.

2227
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:17,480
But later I'll show you guys.

2228
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:22,480
So a Java program
or Java class is what is an actual

2229
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:26,920
well it's a file that have a
that Java extension

2230
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:32,120
and what do we did
we stored that now inside of folder right.

2231
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:36,640
Or from our eclipse
it looks like it's a package right.

2232
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:39,160
And the name it's in text
that class zero one.

2233
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:43,040
So a Java class and Java

2234
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:47,040
class is actual
it is our actual Java program, right.

2235
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:50,280
So now our Java program,
whenever we'll be doing

2236
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:53,320
programing there,
we will be using the lot of parentheses,

2237
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:59,600
a lot of a lot of braces,
curly braces, braces, square brackets.

2238
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:00,120
Right.

2239
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:03,480
So we have to make sure
we don't get confused

2240
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:07,480
by the one thing
always remember gets any type of brackets.

2241
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:09,720
We will be using any type of brackets.

2242
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,400
They will come and pair.

2243
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:15,720
There is no single thing that there's
no single bracket that lives in Java.

2244
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:18,400
All of them has a pair, right?

2245
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:20,800
So when you think of the class, class

2246
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:24,280
has its own
opening and closed door, right?

2247
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:28,080
So if you would like to where your class
starting class

2248
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:31,320
is, there's right after your curly braces.

2249
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:34,320
Guess once you put your cursor in here
with your mouse,

2250
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:38,520
you don't have to put the here,
but with your mouse just double click.

2251
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:43,440
So now what it shows you, Hey,
what do I have inside my class?

2252
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:46,000
What do I have inside my building?

2253
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:47,600
Inside my building?

2254
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:52,080
I can have the main entrance
and there will be other many, many,

2255
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,400
many doors that we going to have,
but which going to learn later, like.

2256
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:56,880
Right.

2257
01:55:57,040 --> 01:56:01,920
But for now we have to have
the main entrance to our class.

2258
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:06,680
So now inside our class
we have a main equal

2259
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:11,400
method look like for now,
just call it meet me right.

2260
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:17,840
Main all main method is the main door
to our program.

2261
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:19,680
Right to our program.

2262
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:23,440
Anything you have to type,
it must leave inside

2263
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:27,040
you open door and your closing door.

2264
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:30,640
So when you think from outside this
for now it's only one line.

2265
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,240
Why the one?
We want to have many, many lines.

2266
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:34,800
What do you have to make sure?

2267
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,560
You have to make sure, guys, that you're

2268
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:40,200
always have to close in parentheses
at the end.

2269
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:40,880
Okay.

2270
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:43,160
Just always make sure that. Right.

2271
01:56:43,160 --> 01:56:45,600
So now what are we writing in here?

2272
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:47,520
We wrote a statement.

2273
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:48,720
What kind of statement?

2274
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:51,640
You wrote a statement to print right here.

2275
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:52,200
It's easy.

2276
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:55,960
Hey, system can print out something.

2277
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:57,280
Can you print out?

2278
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:00,880
Print out this line which line you want.

2279
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,320
We print out and here,
whatever sentence you want.

2280
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,440
Any time we have the sentences

2281
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:10,440
or words,
we will be placing them inside them.

2282
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:12,640
Inside the

2283
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:15,000
double quotes right inside a double doors.

2284
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,720
So one thing, always remember this, right?

2285
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:23,360
So for example, now these days we use in
ideas and ideas will be very helpful.

2286
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:23,640
Right?

2287
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:25,200
They're helpful to us. Right.

2288
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,520
So you forgot that in here.

2289
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:29,880
You forgot the semi column, right?

2290
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:34,160
You forgot the semi column here
because of our idea.

2291
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:38,280
It shows that it shows
that you have some syntax error.

2292
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,000
Write this.

2293
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,600
The Java follows a very strict syntax
and now

2294
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:46,120
because you did a mistake in the syntax.

2295
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:49,280
Now that's
why your idea shows you the issue.

2296
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:53,320
If you guys will be typing this code in
the notepad, Notepad is not going to show

2297
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,920
that code that issue.

2298
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:58,840
We will find out only, only in the later
process that you would have to do.

2299
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:02,040
But now that's a benefit
of using the IDs, right?

2300
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:03,400
So now what are we missing?

2301
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,400
Missing the segment call, Right.

2302
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:08,160
Or for example, let's say

2303
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:12,120
let me take out this code
and let's say what if you forgot, right?

2304
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:15,280
If you forgot and, then by mistake,
you place

2305
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:18,840
your code outside, you place your code
outside of the entire class.

2306
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:22,120
You see, guys,
you will be getting some errors, right?

2307
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:23,880
You will begin in some injects.

2308
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:26,080
Erroneous injects is not correct. Right.

2309
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:29,680
Or for example
now you place it outside of the class I

2310
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:34,000
or for example, you will place it
still inside the class, right?

2311
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,000
You are still inside.

2312
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,160
Of course, this is where your Hello world
program starts.

2313
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:39,960
This is where it ends.

2314
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:44,360
But now what you did, you
did you print statement

2315
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:48,440
outside of the main door right now, again,

2316
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:52,200
you have been shown
that you have some error.

2317
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:52,880
Okay.

2318
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:56,880
So you have to make sure this any code
that we're going to write today

2319
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,960
and for the next

2320
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,480
1011 classes,

2321
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:05,480
it has to be inside our main entrance.

2322
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:07,920
Get inside our main entrance.

2323
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,000
Now, let me ask you guys,

2324
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,320
how many statements do this thing
I can write inside my program?

2325
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:14,400
How many statements?

2326
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:15,480
Well, now we just don't.

2327
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:19,560
One print statement.

2328
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:21,040
I can write many, Right.

2329
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:25,240
So if I want to have
another print statement right now,

2330
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:29,200
I can say system that out
if I want to print something on this,

2331
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:31,520
my instruction to let out

2332
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:35,160
that print line, right?

2333
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:35,560
Yeah.

2334
01:59:35,560 --> 01:59:38,840
What I want to say,
I want to say Hello students.

2335
01:59:38,840 --> 01:59:39,360
Right.

2336
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:42,120
Let's say hello Michael.

2337
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:44,160
Right. Hello, Michael.

2338
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:46,240
Or I want to say another one.

2339
01:59:46,240 --> 01:59:49,000
I want to say system

2340
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:50,520
that out

2341
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:54,360
that print line

2342
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:58,200
and I'm going to say

2343
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:00,480
hello,

2344
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:02,760
students. Right,

2345
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,280
Right.

2346
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:08,000
So if I'm white, you run right
now, I'm going to do my right

2347
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:11,640
and I'm going to click on Run
my Java program.

2348
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:20,080
How many outputs
I am I going to see my pencil?

2349
02:00:20,080 --> 02:00:22,280
I want do

2350
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:24,560
you write y three? Because remember this.

2351
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,560
What do you do in your program?

2352
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:31,440
You'd say, Hey, I want to see print out
statement, I want to see one.

2353
02:00:31,640 --> 02:00:33,000
I want to see two.

2354
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,240
I want to see
this is the third one, right?

2355
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:39,800
And whenever we going to run
these statements, we're going to see.

2356
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:40,640
Right?

2357
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,360
I'm right.

2358
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:44,680
That's what we instructed to do, right?

2359
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:47,400
Awesome. Because I want you
to pay attention to the.

2360
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:48,960
All right?

2361
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:51,160
I want you to pay attention to the order.

2362
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:55,440
Now, whenever we doing the programing
this whenever we're doing the programing,

2363
02:00:55,800 --> 02:00:59,800
I'll program always always executes

2364
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:02,960
that to the bottom.

2365
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:07,560
So always executes
top to the bottom left to the right.

2366
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:08,360
Okay.

2367
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:10,680
That's why first,
this is my first statement.

2368
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:12,240
Right? My first statement.

2369
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:13,800
And that's why you seen it first.

2370
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:16,520
And here this is my second statement.

2371
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:18,680
The second, my second output.

2372
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:20,400
This is my third statement.

2373
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:25,400
This is my third output.

2374
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:26,760
So if you have a

2375
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:29,880
syntax issue,

2376
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,800
if you
going to have any mistakes in your syntax.

2377
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:36,880
Yes our idea is going to help
by layering guys

2378
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:40,840
what we might have in my house,
they're having some logical mistakes.

2379
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:44,240
The logical arrows your

2380
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:47,400
your ideas won't be able to capture.

2381
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,560
Okay. So logical errors.

2382
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:53,160
It's only us as a humans,
we'll be able to identify.

2383
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:55,360
Okay. But besides, they can check.

2384
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:56,920
Just simple simple.

2385
02:01:56,920 --> 02:02:00,160
Any US index errors

2386
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:03,880
in the odd rows you get a can you specify?

2387
02:02:03,880 --> 02:02:09,960
What do you mean by rows?

2388
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:12,960
Oh, you mean
you mean in here to add more lines,

2389
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:17,800
you just continue to enter in the
in the enter? Yep.

2390
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:19,880
And then if you don't need it,
you just delete it.

2391
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:27,760
Right.

2392
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:29,880
So let me see. This is

2393
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:34,000
the thing I want that

2394
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
you didn't do something like missing it.

2395
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,560
Let's see,
what do we have in our slides right now?

2396
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:43,560
We created our first program, Hello World.

2397
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:44,360
Right.

2398
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:49,200
This is our main
method is the execution point print line.

2399
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:53,280
We instructed to print something, right
to print something.

2400
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:56,480
And the output is shown in our console.

2401
02:02:56,760 --> 02:02:58,920
Here we're talking about brackets, right?

2402
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,400
As I mentioned, there will be different
brackets run brackets,

2403
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:06,680
square brackets, curly brackets,
and then English brackets.

2404
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:07,320
Okay.

2405
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:11,680
Well, now when we type in, we are ourself
type in the curly braces,

2406
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:13,880
but there will be more than that.

2407
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:17,840
There will be more than that.

2408
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:18,440
All right.

2409
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:20,440
Let me see this. And

2410
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:24,600
the things.

2411
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:28,200
Okay, so now how do we deliver the code
we enter?

2412
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:31,080
When I was working on Project
for Negative, we're using

2413
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:36,240
if you want to delete the

2414
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:40,160
entire line, yes,
you can do control Z, Control

2415
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:43,000
the command Z for a mac right,

2416
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:45,840
but you can just delete it this way too.

2417
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,400
You just have to
you can use in your backspace.

2418
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:50,680
You also can delete it

2419
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:56,680
and no problem in there.

2420
02:03:56,680 --> 02:04:01,400
And now one thing is whenever
you were created a program, right?

2421
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:04,280
Whenever you created the program,

2422
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:06,720
what happened at first line?

2423
02:04:06,720 --> 02:04:07,320
What do you get?

2424
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:11,040
So there was something specified using

2425
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:17,040
two forward slashes
and it was saying something to do, right?

2426
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:20,400
It was with the uppercase, something to do
and whatever, whatever, whatever,

2427
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:21,880
whatever the things were in there.

2428
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:24,160
Right, whatever. Something was there.

2429
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:27,720
So now what is this?

2430
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:29,200
Two slashes.

2431
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:30,040
Right. Two slashes.

2432
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:32,320
And let me actually try to write the code.

2433
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:35,760
Run. I'm going to run the code.

2434
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:37,000
I'm going to run the code.

2435
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:39,720
And. Okay, I need just.

2436
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:44,040
David, do you going to see this output
do this you to do whatever

2437
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:47,760
in my output in the console.

2438
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:52,160
No no I don't see in the console
I don't see this out with all my program.

2439
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:52,560
Right.

2440
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:57,480
So now what is this
we specify using two forward slashes

2441
02:04:57,800 --> 02:05:02,680
using two forward slash
you guys, we're adding comments, right?

2442
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:04,320
We are adding comments.

2443
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:08,520
For example, right now
we will add a little bit later comments.

2444
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:10,160
But why?

2445
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:12,440
Those comments are very, very useful.

2446
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:14,480
Remember when the programmers

2447
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:17,680
and when asked first is
we will be writing code right?

2448
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:21,120
We will be writing
definitely more than one line

2449
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:23,800
and more than three lines of code,
right? Yep.

2450
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:28,760
So what we will be doing sometimes, you
know what I want to add some notes, right?

2451
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,000
I want to add some notes.

2452
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,320
I want to add some comments. Right.

2453
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:33,960
Or for example, right.

2454
02:05:33,960 --> 02:05:38,680
Sometimes you guys will be given a task
that might take you to three days, Right.

2455
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:41,880
For example,
when the task is two, three days.

2456
02:05:41,880 --> 02:05:45,920
And right now,
let's say it's 5:00 or 450, right?

2457
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:49,680
Your your working day finishes at five,
you have to go home.

2458
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:50,160
Right.

2459
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:52,240
So what do you can do? Hey, you know what?

2460
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:54,040
I can add the common right?

2461
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:55,760
I cannot be coming in here.

2462
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,320
How can I add comment?

2463
02:05:57,320 --> 02:05:59,240
I can use it to forward slashes in.

2464
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:01,560
For example,
you are the common I don't know.

2465
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:06,080
To be continued tomorrow.

2466
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:06,600
Right.

2467
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:08,600
So this new forward smashes.

2468
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:10,440
They are common. They are being

2469
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:14,320
not executed by your program.

2470
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:19,400
So whenever a java is trying to run
your code is not looking at your common

2471
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:20,880
or all in look in it.

2472
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:24,120
Look all we onto this thing right.

2473
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:26,560
So now

2474
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:31,640
not not not there,

2475
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:34,520
not the other way, this way, this way, not

2476
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:39,240
how used not forward slashes back slashes

2477
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:42,360
is there to shortcut.

2478
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:43,600
So there is a shorter way.

2479
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:45,720
How how can you run the program? Right.

2480
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:47,240
There's a shorter way.

2481
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:48,000
How can we run?

2482
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,080
But let me go back to one thing. Okay?

2483
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:54,600
So sometimes in our code, as we will have
to get a lot of comments, right?

2484
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:59,240
So if your comment is short,
that can fade under one line.

2485
02:06:59,480 --> 02:07:02,360
You can just use two forward
slashes. Right.

2486
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:06,600
But let's say if there is a multiple line

2487
02:07:07,240 --> 02:07:09,600
you want to add, then what

2488
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:13,920
we can do, we can pull the one forward
slash and on the star,

2489
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:16,680
the star

2490
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:20,320
and then hit enter comments no comes in
look sensitive

2491
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:25,160
java whenever it's executing your program
Java is not reading your comments

2492
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:26,000
Java don't care

2493
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:30,080
much comments or comments can be read
in whichever way you want it guys.

2494
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:34,480
Right Whichever way you want it.

2495
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:39,880
Worry all Mariam,
you're missing the parentheses, right?

2496
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:42,640
So remember when I talk about the braces,
write

2497
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:46,680
your class as one opening curly braces.

2498
02:07:46,680 --> 02:07:49,520
It has a closing your main door.

2499
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:52,560
Once you open it, you have to close it.

2500
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:56,720
If you're not going to close,
it will be cold hat in the house, Right?

2501
02:07:56,720 --> 02:07:57,600
So that's what you miss.

2502
02:07:57,600 --> 02:08:02,600
And right now.

2503
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:05,320
So now when it comes to

2504
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:08,400
my English, which gets me

2505
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,360
my connection should be good base

2506
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:17,400
connection should be good.

2507
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:17,760
Okay.

2508
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:20,680
If your if your console
is on the right corner, no problem.

2509
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:24,480
Remember, as I mentioned this windows
there druggable removable.

2510
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,360
You can have them on the left.

2511
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:30,040
You can have them on the right,
you can have them on the bottom.

2512
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:33,840
So you put it in whichever
view it's convenient for you.

2513
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:36,040
Okay. All right.

2514
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:41,080
So now when it comes when it comes
the commons, this balance can be anywhere

2515
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:46,800
y they can be anywhere because
the comments are being ignored by Java.

2516
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:50,120
So you want to do the common
before you start your program?

2517
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:52,920
Sure, you can add the common
before you start the program.

2518
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:53,520
Okay.

2519
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,840
So they are ignored so there won't any

2520
02:08:56,640 --> 02:09:00,720
so syntax or any logical
things are not checked in there.

2521
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:03,800
Okay, let's check through there. Okay.

2522
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:05,000
So now this is a comment.

2523
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:10,200
So to be continue and let me put it,
this is I'm going to name single line

2524
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:12,720
common and

2525
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:16,680
whenever want to add multiple lines
of comments.

2526
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:16,920
Right.

2527
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:20,440
What I'm going to do,
I can pull the forward slash star

2528
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:23,880
and this is

2529
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:26,600
multi

2530
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:30,160
multi line

2531
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:32,520
from multi-line

2532
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:36,680
multi line or whatever it is if y

2533
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:43,920
or you know

2534
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,480
one thing as you you will
you will notice that whenever

2535
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:50,720
I'm typing in probably my pronunciation
sometimes

2536
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:55,320
I will be having some grammar mistake,
I will have some pronunciation mistakes.

2537
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:57,320
So apologize in advance.

2538
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,400
Okay. And

2539
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:02,880
here we'll go.

2540
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,680
And that's how I type.

2541
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:03,960
I don't know.

2542
02:10:03,960 --> 02:10:05,840
We do not like it, but that's fine.

2543
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:08,720
Okay, so let's.

2544
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:09,360
All right.

2545
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:09,720
Right.

2546
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:12,360
So single life
comments, multi-line commas.

2547
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,840
Does it mean that
we always have to have that?

2548
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:17,960
No. Guys, we know
always going to add the common word

2549
02:10:19,200 --> 02:10:20,400
it's given to us, Right?

2550
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:24,720
Hey, if you want to add any comments,
whenever you're needed,

2551
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:29,080
whenever you feel like,
then this is the way how you can add it.

2552
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:37,200
And those comments are being ignored
by the Java program.

2553
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:37,440
Okay.

2554
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:40,600
This I mean, this is if you don't know
what I don't know why it's

2555
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:44,600
why it's giving me was giving me the issue
but it's fine.

2556
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:45,120
Yeah.

2557
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:49,440
They ignore right now
once again to execute my program.

2558
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:53,880
Right to execute my program
will click on right click and select run.

2559
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:57,320
This is the first week
this is the first way how to run

2560
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:00,200
my program right This the first

2561
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:02,880
this difference first week

2562
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:07,080
now this second way how to run my program.

2563
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:10,760
You guys will see
there is an option right there

2564
02:11:10,840 --> 02:11:15,960
an option on our top right corner.

2565
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:18,840
So our top right
corner goes gives us this menu.

2566
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:21,000
Right? It uses the menu.

2567
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,840
So in here, what do you guys will say?

2568
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:25,800
You guys will see the run button in here.

2569
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:30,120
If you guys are going to hover over,
you will see it and it says

2570
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,040
run, right?

2571
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:36,280
So now instead of doing right
click and run what you can

2572
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:38,440
do, you can just click run from here.

2573
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,160
I click on right

2574
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:47,040
and right there it's running right?

2575
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:47,280
Yeah.

2576
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:49,760
Think the line is just to add
the common to other.

2577
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:53,960
Is there any shortcuts for Windows users?

2578
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:57,240
You Guys will have a you are having a

2579
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:01,680
very very short short clock
you guys can look in here right

2580
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:05,360
so when I'm clicking on
I can click on run from here.

2581
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:07,120
So when I click on Run here,

2582
02:12:07,120 --> 02:12:10,080
it shows me the shortcut,
but it shows the shortcuts on my Mac.

2583
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:13,560
So when you guys want
if you want to find out the shortcut

2584
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:17,760
for your for your windows,
just go to the your menu,

2585
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:21,400
go to option
before we went to the windows.

2586
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:23,880
Now you have to go to the option run.

2587
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:28,280
And when you click on run, you see for us
the shortcut to have to do the upper

2588
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:30,040
keys. And I have to do that. Come on.

2589
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,760
And then I can press F11.

2590
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:34,120
That will be my shortcut for Windows.

2591
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:36,200
It will be a little bit
different shortcut.

2592
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:40,160
But to be honest with you guys, for me,
the shorter we probably will be.

2593
02:12:40,160 --> 02:12:42,720
Just to click on
the run button in here, get

2594
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:48,920
in. Okay, great.

2595
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:52,360
But whichever things
will be more comfortable for it.

2596
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:56,080
So comments can be

2597
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:57,200
comments.

2598
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:03,960
And B, when you were in your program

2599
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:09,800
comments can be anywhere.

2600
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:13,520
They can be inside the parentheses,
outside the front.

2601
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:18,520
It is inside the class
but outside the mean that that right

2602
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:21,560
way because this simply Java

2603
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:25,400
does not look into commas
when it's trying to execute you.

2604
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:28,600
Put some of this trick
before for programmers.

2605
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:32,840
Okay.

2606
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:36,600
Why do we need comments
whenever our code becomes big, right.

2607
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:38,280
Whenever our code becomes big.

2608
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:40,320
This is a name.
This when you guys are working.

2609
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:43,880
Because sometimes what will happen, guys,
it won't be just

2610
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:48,000
you are the only one who will be working
on accomplishing some task.

2611
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,120
What's the automation task right?

2612
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:53,160
So you guys all
will be writing the code now.

2613
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:54,840
Now all

2614
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:57,600
day you will be working,
let's say these live together.

2615
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:00,800
Now, Elise wrote some code, right?

2616
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,240
And then you write some code.

2617
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:05,480
So now for you to easier to understand
and write what

2618
02:14:05,480 --> 02:14:09,000
the live has done what she will actually
get at a little comments in there.

2619
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:13,200
So this way without you
looking at 100 lines of the code,

2620
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:17,880
you know,
what was the purpose of this piece of code

2621
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:21,560
that Emily has written
and the same thing you when you write,

2622
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:24,760
let's say, 50 lines of code
and then you will only common

2623
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,880
this code will perform
such a such an action.

2624
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:28,440
Right.

2625
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:31,880
So this way is understandable
for other people.

2626
02:14:32,080 --> 02:14:34,920
And this way
also, let's say you wrote a code and then,

2627
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:38,520
I don't know, in one year
you go back and you look at that code.

2628
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:41,320
So you know what
actually you have done in there, Right.

2629
02:14:41,480 --> 02:14:43,760
This is comments are used. Just for

2630
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,760
instance.

2631
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:48,960
So this is the comments.

2632
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:51,680
And what we did are we did just that all
Hello world.

2633
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:55,440
We did this system system out
and what we learned

2634
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:58,160
our program executes from to the bottom,

2635
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:01,000
from left to the right.

2636
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:03,840
Left. Okay.

2637
02:15:04,400 --> 02:15:06,720
So now what
I'll give you I'll give you a quick test.

2638
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,120
I'll give you a quick test.

2639
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:10,680
Give you a quick task, and

2640
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:13,760
let me write it in here.

2641
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:15,360
Actually, I have it in here. Really?

2642
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,200
So let me write it.

2643
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:18,880
So what I want you to do
and I'll explain it for you this

2644
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:26,760
this is the task for you.

2645
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:29,480
Windows
Task will be given to you all the time.

2646
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:32,320
So task this.
But please really carefully write

2647
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:35,520
and remember this new rational
so you think task.

2648
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:38,320
So you have to create a Java program,
right?

2649
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:41,000
So remember this
when I see a Java program.

2650
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:44,080
A Java program is an actual class.

2651
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:48,480
When we say create a Java program,
we create in an actual Java class.

2652
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:49,920
What is the name?

2653
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:52,720
I want you
to give the name of your program.

2654
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:55,960
All your class should be the programmer,
right?

2655
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:57,240
The programmer.

2656
02:15:57,240 --> 02:16:01,360
Now, inside the class, I want you to write
the comment inside a class.

2657
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:03,080
I want you to write the comments.

2658
02:16:03,080 --> 02:16:04,280
I want you to write a comment.

2659
02:16:04,280 --> 02:16:06,720
This is my second Java program.

2660
02:16:06,720 --> 02:16:12,000
And your program,
your class should give me a print out

2661
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,360
when I'm able to execute your class.

2662
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:18,520
When I'm able to execute a program,
I want to see the output

2663
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:22,080
in a console scene.
I am a Java programmer.

2664
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:25,240
Okay,
So can you guys please go ahead and do it

2665
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:29,360
and whenever you guys doing it,
so what you guys can do,

2666
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:33,160
you can take a screenshot
and you can share it in the channel.

2667
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:33,760
Right?

2668
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:37,520
But this is just, you know, we know that

2669
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:40,920
you actually doing the things,
but also for your classmates,

2670
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:44,920
the first things maybe wouldn't
be that difficult, but later ones.

2671
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:48,080
The task for getting more difficult
well is make sure you guys

2672
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:51,120
just don't
copy what your classmates did right.

2673
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:54,680
Do it yourselves.

2674
02:16:54,680 --> 02:16:55,160
Yes, guys.

2675
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:58,480
So all the classes remember now what you
you have.

2676
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:00,840
You need to create a second class, right?

2677
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,000
Second.

2678
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,440
But because it has to be organized,

2679
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:08,280
it's second Java class, not second
Java program.

2680
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:09,840
Right. Let's call a job program.

2681
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,280
But because it's still our first class.

2682
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:17,000
So your second Java program also will be
created inside this package, right?

2683
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:21,600
So you'll be right click
new and you'll select the class right.

2684
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:23,760
And for this entire

2685
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:28,880
next one month, guys,
we will be working under one project.

2686
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:31,680
You're in our Java classes,
you'll be working on the project.

2687
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:35,120
But what we're going to have
we're going to have many, many packages.

2688
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:39,200
And inside the packages you guys are going
to have many, many classes

2689
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,800
actually is a task this

2690
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:26,120
plus a now you should this is a

2691
02:18:27,040 --> 02:19:17,000
Java program isn't class,
so we can't get it

2692
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:44,560
to see you guys doing it.

2693
02:19:44,560 --> 02:19:46,960
So if you guys using

2694
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:49,720
if you guys using windows,
remember you guys can

2695
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:52,840
you guys can use the snipping tool

2696
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:55,000
right to take screenshots

2697
02:19:56,240 --> 02:20:00,360
or if you use in Mac
you guys can use use control shift

2698
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:03,920
three or control shift
for to take pictures right

2699
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:05,520
function

2700
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:57,320
much fine.

2701
02:20:57,320 --> 02:20:59,840
I hope you
I hope you guys are having fun. Thank

2702
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,480
if you ready right in your second program

2703
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:24,120
alexius.

2704
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:27,960
We will go over we will go over
every class we will be talking about

2705
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:32,080
packages and then once you guys

2706
02:21:32,080 --> 02:21:37,680
start learning the go after the basics,
you guys will be talking about classes

2707
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:41,840
many, many, many times.

2708
02:21:41,840 --> 02:22:01,200
Then step by step, step by step,

2709
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:04,520
Java is actually pretty, pretty fun.

2710
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:05,280
Can you copy?

2711
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:07,480
Of course you guys can copy
by first classes.

2712
02:22:07,480 --> 02:22:09,680
I always ask that. Please.
No, don't. Don't copy.

2713
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:12,920
I want you to get used to into the typing

2714
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:17,760
and looking into
what kind of errors you guys can, Right.

2715
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:20,920
So we can start learning those errors
because the more and more

2716
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:24,120
we will be going into different topics,
there's a more and more different errors.

2717
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:25,200
We're still coming.

2718
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:28,200
So at least for now, whatever errors
making is, I want to make sure

2719
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:30,800
you understand what they
they enable to fix.

2720
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:34,840
Okay.

2721
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:37,920
Oh, I want you to allow you
how you have the entire you have a super

2722
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:57,840
big screen.

2723
02:22:57,840 --> 02:22:58,920
Mustafa

2724
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:03,920
Okay, click, click on.

2725
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:04,440
Okay.

2726
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:07,400
And once you click on okay,
you just have to

2727
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:12,640
send a screenshot in the support channel
probably to

2728
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:16,440
you will have to connect with you.

2729
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:19,000
They will have to check your

2730
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:24,320
properties about your, about your Java.

2731
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:36,640
Okay, So ask them to help you out,
I believe.

2732
02:23:36,720 --> 02:23:38,760
And you can
you can do it a little bit later.

2733
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:40,920
You just will have to go
to the preferences

2734
02:23:41,920 --> 02:23:44,640
now. You'll have to go to go
to the preferences.

2735
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:47,640
There you can select are dark background

2736
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:50,160
or you can select a light background.

2737
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,840
So let's look into the let's
look at the task is right.

2738
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:55,720
The task was

2739
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:58,360
the task was to create a Java program.

2740
02:23:58,360 --> 02:24:01,680
Right.
What what do we mean by job program?

2741
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:05,160
Our program is in actual class, right now

2742
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:07,840
because we decided that all the classes

2743
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:12,040
will be organized and stored
in this particular package, right?

2744
02:24:12,040 --> 02:24:14,600
So now the classes
will be created in here.

2745
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:17,000
So you'll do right click,
you create new class

2746
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:21,720
and you type the name
the programmer, right?

2747
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,840
The programing key.

2748
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:28,920
So guys, now because you have a space
right behind you, because you have a space

2749
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:34,200
now, you guys will see a little thing
and we will all being on top, right?

2750
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:38,160
It tells you
type name is not valid, right?

2751
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:40,760
Because Java has a very strict rule.

2752
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:45,480
Hey, your new space is
when you trying to name my class.

2753
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:46,080
Okay.

2754
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:49,640
So what we have to do
we will have to rename that space, right.

2755
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,200
To rename the space.

2756
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:55,520
And even when you have a space guys,
your finish button is disabled, right?

2757
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:57,800
So once we remove it,

2758
02:24:57,800 --> 02:25:02,640
we select on our main right
because it's a very long sentence.

2759
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:05,760
Don't want to type it for now, but later
you guys will be typing.

2760
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:09,440
So for now we'll just click this checkbox
and click on that right

2761
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:12,960
and click on finish.

2762
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:16,320
Now the first part of the task was, Hey,

2763
02:25:16,680 --> 02:25:19,960
inside the class,
we want to write the comment, right?

2764
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:24,840
And if you come and sits on the one line
right on the one line,

2765
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:30,440
so we can add this single line common
but using to double it,

2766
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:35,200
you hold Sasha's and here
this is my this is my coming right

2767
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:41,760
now. My second one was what I need to do.

2768
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:45,800
My program should display the output is a

2769
02:25:47,360 --> 02:25:48,680
Java programmer.

2770
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:50,760
I'm a programmer Now.

2771
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:53,280
How do my system prints out?

2772
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:55,320
I need to specify this statement. Right.

2773
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:57,560
I need to write them.

2774
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:59,720
Let's give them

2775
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:01,680
that out.

2776
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:05,280
That's trend line, right?

2777
02:26:05,720 --> 02:26:08,080
Should them a column.

2778
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,960
And here this is my sentence right here.

2779
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,360
Just my sentence. Now

2780
02:26:16,680 --> 02:26:19,400
or main would be

2781
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:22,720
can you make this selection of main
when by default?

2782
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:25,240
No. You will have to select it every time.

2783
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:27,680
I think you have to select every time.

2784
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:31,440
But on the class number three
or four guys, we will learn the shortcut

2785
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:32,320
on the class.

2786
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:35,160
Number two, we will try to type
all this thing our self.

2787
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:35,520
Okay,

2788
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:38,240
so this is my comment, right?

2789
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:39,000
This is my comment.

2790
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,040
It still is inside my class.

2791
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:43,160
It was inside my class, right?

2792
02:26:43,160 --> 02:26:48,520
And now you can see here
I was able to pass this sentence.

2793
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:49,320
Right.

2794
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:51,080
There was no issue why?

2795
02:26:51,080 --> 02:26:53,400
There was no issue because it's a comment.

2796
02:26:53,400 --> 02:26:57,000
Java is not looking into the comments
by now in here.

2797
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,400
This is actually a Java coding. Right.

2798
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:01,760
This is actual Java code would be writing.

2799
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:05,520
So now here that's where we have an issue.

2800
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:05,920
Right.

2801
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:10,120
And if you guys going to hover
over what we see and it says, hey,

2802
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:14,360
that there is some syntax error, we have.

2803
02:27:14,360 --> 02:27:17,880
So now any time any time this

2804
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:21,000
if you want to print out a word

2805
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:25,520
or a sentence,
you have place it inside a double core.

2806
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:29,520
This right in quotation also has a peer.

2807
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:33,360
This whatever you start,
you have to finish whatever.

2808
02:27:33,360 --> 02:27:35,360
We open, we have to calls. Right?

2809
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:39,480
For example,
hey, if I want you print number system

2810
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:43,800
that out that print line.

2811
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:44,600
Right.

2812
02:27:44,600 --> 02:27:44,880
Okay.

2813
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:47,400
What I want you print
I want you bring number.

2814
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:48,400
I want you print number.

2815
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:50,520
I want you print 2021. Right.

2816
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:56,840
So if I want you print numbers, of course
I don't need any quotations for numbers.

2817
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:58,560
I don't need any quotations.

2818
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:03,160
But for the words and sentences,
I do need quotation.

2819
02:28:03,360 --> 02:28:08,000
Okay, no quotation.

2820
02:28:08,280 --> 02:28:11,720
But for the worded sentences,
we need a quotation right

2821
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:13,640
now. Let.

2822
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:15,320
Let me try to run it.

2823
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:17,760
Now. What? I'm going to run here. Right?

2824
02:28:18,120 --> 02:28:19,200
I have an output.

2825
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:22,440
I'm a Java programmer and here I added

2826
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:26,120
my snip and print statement 2021.

2827
02:28:26,120 --> 02:28:26,760
Right.

2828
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:29,120
And as we seen

2829
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:33,520
so even if even if it's combination

2830
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:38,040
of letters and numbers,
you still have to put it in the quotation.

2831
02:28:38,360 --> 02:28:39,520
You still have to put.

2832
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:41,280
But later we will be learning

2833
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:44,040
even on tomorrow clouds
because we will be learning how to.

2834
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:46,760
If you don't want to put the numbers

2835
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:49,960
in the quotation,
how are we going to attach them?

2836
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:52,160
We're going to look into that

2837
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:54,240
of right.

2838
02:28:54,240 --> 02:28:57,600
And also program is executed
at top to the bottom.

2839
02:28:57,880 --> 02:29:03,040
First line number nine was executed,
then line ten executed and then executed.

2840
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:05,280
Left to the right. Right.

2841
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:08,360
Use different statements

2842
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:09,640
in there on it.

2843
02:29:09,640 --> 02:29:11,080
You just do the right click,

2844
02:29:11,080 --> 02:29:14,360
you click select,
then run right, do right, select, run.

2845
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:18,720
Or the shorter
we write, the shorter way, how we can run,

2846
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:21,840
the shorter way, how we can run.

2847
02:29:21,840 --> 02:29:24,240
We can just run from this option, right?

2848
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:27,320
If you hover over this green button,

2849
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:31,160
it says Run it, Run
which program you want to run.

2850
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:32,800
I want to run the program,

2851
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:36,520
the program and write that seven tells me
which program you want to run.

2852
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:38,560
And I'm running.

2853
02:29:38,560 --> 02:29:42,760
So one thing that what's going to happen
if this window was showing up,

2854
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:44,360
if this window was showing up.

2855
02:29:44,360 --> 02:29:47,240
So before we execute any

2856
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:50,160
Java program, before we actually run it,

2857
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:55,280
the entire source right there,
the entire code that we are writing in,

2858
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:59,480
the code that we as a program is writing,
we call it a source code, right?

2859
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:03,040
The source code has to be saved right?

2860
02:30:03,040 --> 02:30:05,160
So it's going to have to be saved.

2861
02:30:05,560 --> 02:30:08,080
And if you want to make sure. Right.

2862
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:10,560
If you don't want to every time,
keep clicking. Okay?

2863
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:14,600
And then you runs if you want to make sure
that your code runs

2864
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:19,400
every time before you click on run,
what do you this can do?

2865
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:21,480
You can select this checkbox.

2866
02:30:21,480 --> 02:30:26,920
So it's always resources before lunch
and you program right before luncheon.

2867
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:28,600
So select this checkbox.

2868
02:30:28,600 --> 02:30:33,120
So this window is never going to
show up and you click on Key

2869
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:34,800
Eagle.

2870
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:35,760
That's my program.

2871
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:39,960
Execute implemented.

2872
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:42,400
Looks great.

2873
02:30:43,080 --> 02:30:44,120
Any questions, guys?

2874
02:30:44,120 --> 02:30:58,880
Any questions so far?

2875
02:30:58,880 --> 02:30:59,160
So No.

2876
02:30:59,160 --> 02:31:02,400
Mohammed if you did not select
automatically because

2877
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,920
right now
I don't think it's ever going to show up

2878
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:09,120
a lunch.

2879
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:09,680
Okay.

2880
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:12,400
So if you making any changes
in the code. Right.

2881
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:13,880
If you make any changes because

2882
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:16,760
even if you was going to add this space,
it is a change.

2883
02:31:17,160 --> 02:31:22,040
If you're going to add this, please
extra line, it is the change right now

2884
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:27,040
before running, before I selected
that option, when I was clicking on Run,

2885
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:30,160
that window was showing up
and we know was showing up

2886
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:34,640
and was warning me, Hey,
you made some changes.

2887
02:31:34,640 --> 02:31:37,160
You did not save them.
Do you want to save them?

2888
02:31:37,160 --> 02:31:39,200
Before launching the program?
And I said yes.

2889
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:40,360
So now this window

2890
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:45,040
is not going to show up to me
because I check the I select the checkbox.

2891
02:31:45,160 --> 02:31:45,400
Okay.

2892
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:47,760
Well, if you

2893
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:51,040
have a problem please,
please send it to the support channel. Get

2894
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:55,800
inputs like actual actual
coding problem in there.

2895
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:59,040
If you just have a questions
for the topics

2896
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:01,760
that we cover, any you guys are more than
welcome to talk with in here

2897
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:06,840
you just because it's menu you write
if e files by looking into all your

2898
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:10,440
all your screenshots

2899
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:13,000
output cam will take one
you probably like.

2900
02:32:13,960 --> 02:32:17,520
Okay that's right so for now
we just known how to write the program

2901
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:21,480
and so now we just learn
how to add the comments right?

2902
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:24,840
So now let's look into one more thing.

2903
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:27,440
So what I would like to do

2904
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:30,120
for the 21,

2905
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:34,880
okay, if you guys are a quotation,
it's still work, right?

2906
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:35,880
It's still work.

2907
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:37,640
It's still work.

2908
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:40,160
But for numbers,
you don't need to use a quotation.

2909
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:45,280
You don't need to use a quotation
because here you are using and numbers

2910
02:32:45,800 --> 02:32:50,480
you use in the sentences
this would be a different data

2911
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:54,320
sets which we will touch in the
in the in the class today as well.

2912
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:56,760
So for numbers you don't need quotations

2913
02:32:57,320 --> 02:33:00,160
numbers,

2914
02:33:00,160 --> 02:33:03,680
but even if you add it, it's still work
but you don't need it.

2915
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:04,360
Okay,

2916
02:33:05,560 --> 02:33:09,000
so let me create another program
because going to create another program

2917
02:33:10,080 --> 02:33:11,400
because there is

2918
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:15,480
multiple ways
how you can not multiple ways.

2919
02:33:15,480 --> 02:33:18,720
There's another way how we can

2920
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:23,040
show the print out on our console
this get in.

2921
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:26,520
I want to show you
what is the other statement we can use.

2922
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:28,840
So I'm going to have a clause.

2923
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,440
I'm going to name it.

2924
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:35,640
So this option print

2925
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:39,080
or limit, print or print,

2926
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:43,200
and that's how I want you to name
the class.

2927
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:44,120
Right.

2928
02:33:44,200 --> 02:33:46,880
So you guys can
they read whatever where you want?

2929
02:33:46,880 --> 02:33:50,520
But I need me print or print it.

2930
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:53,040
Okay. So far we've been using print. Len.

2931
02:33:53,400 --> 02:33:56,880
But there is another option
that we have print in now

2932
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,240
combining three words together.

2933
02:33:59,240 --> 02:34:01,920
I'm removing the spaces are in all

2934
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:05,320
uppercase is to follow the camel case.

2935
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:07,640
Right.

2936
02:34:07,640 --> 02:34:09,600
And I'll select my main method.

2937
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:11,040
Select my main method.

2938
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:14,640
Then I click on finish right

2939
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:19,680
and let me type.

2940
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:22,200
Let me write a few print statements,

2941
02:34:22,280 --> 02:34:25,040
but I'm going to make them a little bit
different.

2942
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:29,640
Okay, So for example,
I'm going to see carpet bullets, right?

2943
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:32,720
Because you are
in the case sensitive system

2944
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:37,080
that out that print line.

2945
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:38,280
Right.

2946
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:40,640
And let's say

2947
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:43,720
I'm going to say it's

2948
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:47,280
print, it's

2949
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:57,080
not out

2950
02:34:58,440 --> 02:35:02,480
screen line right on her line.

2951
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:05,680
And I'm going to say

2952
02:35:06,440 --> 02:35:07,440
this is

2953
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:12,200
a line

2954
02:35:12,200 --> 02:35:15,240
that we are moving

2955
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:28,800
out of frame

2956
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,400
or just being like, okay,

2957
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:37,400
me being here, I don't mind.

2958
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:38,920
Sorry, because I wanted to show you.

2959
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:41,320
So first one will be print, print line.

2960
02:35:41,320 --> 02:35:43,360
That's fine. Or print that's fine.

2961
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:49,200
This one should be just print this
print line and this is will be another.

2962
02:35:49,360 --> 02:35:49,920
Let's make it.

2963
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:52,480
Just make it three lines.

2964
02:35:53,760 --> 02:36:00,760
Oh, right

2965
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:05,960
now. Now let's see

2966
02:36:07,360 --> 02:36:09,960
how come there is an

2967
02:36:11,720 --> 02:36:13,720
because Muhammad, you misspelled that.

2968
02:36:13,720 --> 02:36:15,600
It's print, right? It's print.

2969
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:17,040
You were misspell it.

2970
02:36:17,040 --> 02:36:19,400
You are missing t

2971
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:23,440
So now both of these
both of these commands,

2972
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:28,520
print and here print line, right,
is just a shorter way of line.

2973
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:34,080
You just type in most of them,
they will print something in our console.

2974
02:36:34,200 --> 02:36:36,240
They will do give us an output.

2975
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:39,560
But now let's see, what is the difference?

2976
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:41,160
What is the right?

2977
02:36:41,160 --> 02:36:43,040
Now I'm going to click one run, right?

2978
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:44,120
What I'm trying to run.

2979
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:46,120
It tells me the program
that I'm going to run.

2980
02:36:46,400 --> 02:36:48,920
Hey, do you want to run the program?

2981
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:50,840
Print or print line?

2982
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:52,440
Yes, this is the program.

2983
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:54,440
I want to run images. Click on

2984
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:57,840
labels.

2985
02:36:57,840 --> 02:36:59,120
So what do you see?

2986
02:36:59,120 --> 02:37:12,160
What do you see right now, guys?

2987
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:17,400
They didn't issue
didn't start a new line right there.

2988
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:19,320
Right.

2989
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:22,040
So there's something
something about line, Right.

2990
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:23,760
So what happens, guys?

2991
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:27,960
What is the difference
between print and print line?

2992
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:32,880
So what it does, because
this is the output of my print, right?

2993
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:37,440
So what a print does it strictly prints.

2994
02:37:37,440 --> 02:37:39,000
It Strictly prints, Right.

2995
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:44,880
So it printed this sentence and it left
the it left the cursor in here.

2996
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:48,000
It left the cursor in here, right there.

2997
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:51,360
Like, okay, I did my job, I just print it.

2998
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:52,200
Right.

2999
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:54,960
So what is the print line?

3000
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:58,240
Does print line reads

3001
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:02,520
any and moves your cursor to the new line?

3002
02:38:02,960 --> 02:38:05,160
It creates a new line

3003
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:10,800
for the next out for a next print
that you want to have.

3004
02:38:11,080 --> 02:38:13,600
So print just prints, leaves your cursor,

3005
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:17,320
but print line what it does this cursor.

3006
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:20,040
It moves to the next,
it moves to the next.

3007
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:23,720
So this way, when the next print comes,

3008
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:27,600
it's able to start from the new line.

3009
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,200
Okay, once again, print.

3010
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:31,800
Just prints. Print.

3011
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:34,320
I like. Okay, you want me to print?
I don't care. I just print.

3012
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:36,240
I printed the statement.

3013
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:38,760
This is the command and I'm done. Right.

3014
02:38:38,760 --> 02:38:42,120
My job is done.
The job was the print line.

3015
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:47,320
Besides print in your need,
you create a new line.

3016
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:48,800
That's what it does.

3017
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:52,480
It prints and moves your cursor
to the new line.

3018
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:55,320
Right.
So now let's. Let's change them around

3019
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:57,520
the. Now

3020
02:38:57,520 --> 02:39:01,360
let me change that spacing.

3021
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:02,520
Change the order. Right.

3022
02:39:02,520 --> 02:39:06,080
Because remember, that program executes
back to the bottom, right?

3023
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:08,760
So now what?
This thing will be the output.

3024
02:39:08,760 --> 02:39:18,960
Now how about what is going to look like?

3025
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:20,280
Is it going to be the same?

3026
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:23,480
I switch them a little, look into,
the lines,

3027
02:39:23,480 --> 02:39:31,000
guys.

3028
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:32,880
There will be two lines
right there. Right.

3029
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:34,160
So now.

3030
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:34,680
Sure.

3031
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:39,120
You see three print statements,
but this three print state

3032
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:41,200
is going to give me only two lines. Right?

3033
02:39:41,640 --> 02:39:45,960
So this statement is going to be printed
right?

3034
02:39:45,960 --> 02:39:47,440
It prints, right?

3035
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:50,960
It prints
and then it prints in here first.

3036
02:39:51,160 --> 02:39:53,280
And then we will create
a new line for you.

3037
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:57,160
Then this be printed on the second line.

3038
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:57,560
Right?

3039
02:39:57,560 --> 02:40:02,880
This will be printed on the second line,
but the cursor will be left in here.

3040
02:40:02,880 --> 02:40:04,920
The cursor will be left in here.

3041
02:40:04,920 --> 02:40:10,880
So then when you Hello comes your hello
is not able to start from the new line.

3042
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:14,960
Your hello will continue
where you print left

3043
02:40:15,320 --> 02:40:19,160
right where you print.

3044
02:40:19,160 --> 02:40:20,560
Right, right.

3045
02:40:20,560 --> 02:40:23,120
This is the print line
Come on take our print.

3046
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:24,800
Line it, print it.

3047
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:27,000
You move the cursor
to the new line. Right?

3048
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:29,480
Your cursor is waiting in here.

3049
02:40:29,480 --> 02:40:32,320
So now next output. This is the print.

3050
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:34,800
Come on it. Print that and.

3051
02:40:34,840 --> 02:40:38,080
Okay, I'm done. My job is over. Right?

3052
02:40:38,080 --> 02:40:40,560
And it just leaves the cursor here
gradient. Right.

3053
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:43,120
That's where you will see it
highlighted. Hello.

3054
02:40:43,360 --> 02:40:47,280
And then when the next line
comes, you're like, Oh my God.

3055
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:48,800
Okay I am printing.

3056
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:53,400
But where I'm printing, I have to continue
where you guys live the course, right?

3057
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:56,480
But if I'm going to add another one system

3058
02:40:57,840 --> 02:40:59,320
and that out,

3059
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:00,520
that's

3060
02:41:02,280 --> 02:41:03,200
okay. Let me see.

3061
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:06,000
Even if I'm going to do that print,

3062
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:08,400
even if I'm going to print
and I'm going to say bye

3063
02:41:09,520 --> 02:41:11,840
bye, where's my buy is going to be print.

3064
02:41:11,840 --> 02:41:14,880
And this will
my body will be printed in here or

3065
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:25,440
my body will be printed in the new line.

3066
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:27,960
So here,
this is where your hello ended, right.

3067
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:29,800
This is your hello.

3068
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:30,360
Right.

3069
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:34,800
Because your hello printed
and then created your new line

3070
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,200
so by come coming here.

3071
02:41:37,400 --> 02:41:41,280
All right bye will come in here
but because it's just simple print

3072
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:45,680
you will leave your cursor in here so next
print out

3073
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:51,080
statement will be continued from here,
not from the new line.

3074
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:53,760
Right.

3075
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:56,680
I'm going to run it right.

3076
02:41:56,680 --> 02:41:57,600
Hello.

3077
02:41:57,600 --> 02:42:00,000
Has printed created new line

3078
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:07,920
now by comes in here right?

3079
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:11,920
This is the difference print and print
line and let me add the comment in here.

3080
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:14,040
This line means new line. Yep.

3081
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:17,440
It's new line for you
in print and creates new line.

3082
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:18,960
So let me add the comment

3083
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:23,520
line.

3084
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:27,560
What it does print

3085
02:42:27,560 --> 02:42:28,280
statement. Right.

3086
02:42:28,280 --> 02:42:30,680
This statement

3087
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:33,600
and creates new line

3088
02:42:34,600 --> 02:42:38,880
right where we talk about print,
what a print does.

3089
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:42,040
It's just

3090
02:42:42,440 --> 02:42:43,520
prints.

3091
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:49,560
Just print a statement, statement

3092
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:52,040
statement

3093
02:42:56,800 --> 02:42:59,000
and makes

3094
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:03,960
sure the same one.

3095
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:07,440
And here I'll add

3096
02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:09,360
one half of the year.

3097
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:10,600
No new lines.

3098
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:24,480
And you.

3099
02:43:24,480 --> 02:43:25,800
Yeah, there's no quotation.

3100
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:27,000
Yep, there's no quotation.

3101
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:31,080
This why this is a different
we're going to

3102
02:43:31,440 --> 02:43:34,520
there's a different viruses
that is being used.

3103
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:36,240
There's different data.

3104
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:39,680
But yes,
your quotation is are not going to print.

3105
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:42,600
They won't be printed

3106
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:49,200
the trick of a good.

3107
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:50,840
Okay, remember this this is

3108
02:43:50,840 --> 02:43:53,960
I have multiple lines
that I want comment around.

3109
02:43:53,960 --> 02:43:57,840
That's why I use the
I use the forward slash with the star.

3110
02:43:58,160 --> 02:44:02,480
But if I want to add the single comment,
I'll just use two for special

3111
02:44:03,520 --> 02:44:07,360
thanks to the end of the program.

3112
02:44:07,360 --> 02:44:11,280
The end of my

3113
02:44:19,400 --> 02:44:19,760
card.

3114
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:22,280
You haven't got to be the quotation marks.

3115
02:44:23,640 --> 02:44:23,960
Okay.

3116
02:44:23,960 --> 02:44:25,640
Is will

3117
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:29,760
there is there's a
you will have to add more stuff.

3118
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:34,120
We will we will in our
we can look into it on the second class

3119
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:39,640
once we start looking into what
we actually place inside a quotation.

3120
02:44:39,640 --> 02:44:41,760
Once we understand what we place
in the quotation,

3121
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,960
then we can see how we can add
the actual quotations.

3122
02:44:45,320 --> 02:44:47,680
Okay. All right.

3123
02:44:47,840 --> 02:45:00,400
Any questions
for the print and print line?

3124
02:45:00,400 --> 02:45:03,760
Not so far. Okay. All right.

3125
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:06,600
Let me give you another
another quick test. Right.

3126
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:09,720
Another quick test.

3127
02:45:09,720 --> 02:45:12,960
That success.

3128
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:15,160
You got this. Of course,
you guys, you've got this right?

3129
02:45:15,160 --> 02:45:19,080
Of course you get this, too. You

3130
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:23,120
another task.

3131
02:45:23,120 --> 02:45:23,480
Okay.

3132
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:26,520
So your task is you have to create

3133
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:30,120
a Java program, right?

3134
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:34,320
And go to make it to you
before you write your Java program.

3135
02:45:34,320 --> 02:45:36,360
Name will be syntax programmer. Right?

3136
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:40,280
You already know
general program Syntax class, right.

3137
02:45:40,280 --> 02:45:41,640
The output. Right.

3138
02:45:41,640 --> 02:45:44,640
The output of your program
should look like that.

3139
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:48,280
I want to see one statement.

3140
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:51,960
Two statement
three statement, four statements.

3141
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:56,520
So your program should consist
of four print statements,

3142
02:45:57,040 --> 02:46:01,360
but because it has to be printed
in this order,

3143
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:03,240
you guys will need to figure out

3144
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:06,600
which one will use print,
which one will use the print line.

3145
02:46:06,600 --> 02:46:07,320
Right.

3146
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:10,880
So two statements
I want to see on the same line

3147
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:15,240
and two other statements
that I want to see on separate lines.

3148
02:46:15,360 --> 02:46:17,640
Okay. So please go ahead and

3149
02:46:18,680 --> 02:46:20,720
do this step

3150
02:47:53,640 --> 02:47:55,120
the billionaire class, right.

3151
02:47:55,120 --> 02:47:55,920
Class

3152
02:47:56,680 --> 02:47:59,760
Java programing class, Java program.

3153
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:00,480
That is.

3154
02:48:00,480 --> 02:48:01,960
Let me project.

3155
02:48:01,960 --> 02:48:07,920
Okay.

3156
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:11,480
So let me see.

3157
02:48:11,480 --> 02:48:11,880
Okay.

3158
02:48:14,320 --> 02:48:18,240
I don't
I don't even know your name is Kazarian.

3159
02:48:18,360 --> 02:48:21,960
Could you could you could you please
tell us your so we can call you by name?

3160
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:23,880
Can you copy and paste?

3161
02:48:23,880 --> 02:48:27,120
Of course you guys can copy paste,
but please try to type it.

3162
02:48:27,320 --> 02:48:30,120
I know it's a lot of retyping,
but I want you to type it.

3163
02:48:30,120 --> 02:48:32,120
I want you get in the habit of typing

3164
02:48:33,200 --> 02:48:34,680
once you guys become a pro.

3165
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:37,400
All right,
then you guys can copy and paste

3166
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:39,680
at your work.

3167
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:41,840
There will be a lot of copy and paste in.

3168
02:48:41,880 --> 02:48:44,400
But for now, for learning
purposes, this please.

3169
02:48:44,400 --> 02:48:45,320
No copy paste,

3170
02:48:46,480 --> 02:48:47,800
especially the code from

3171
02:48:47,800 --> 02:50:17,160
your colleagues, from

3172
02:50:36,680 --> 02:51:01,840
a Erick

3173
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:05,160
while you're typing,
I'll also do it right.

3174
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:08,520
My job program actual my Java class.

3175
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:11,600
I needed to name my class

3176
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:14,480
and text program right

3177
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:18,080
syntax programmer to not have spaces.

3178
02:51:18,720 --> 02:51:22,640
And that's my main method,
which I think is

3179
02:51:26,440 --> 02:51:30,160
so have to have statements.

3180
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:32,160
Right? And I have to have four statements.

3181
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:35,920
One statement, second, third and fourth.

3182
02:51:35,920 --> 02:51:37,600
Right. Okay.

3183
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:40,440
Even if you do mistake
at first it is okay.

3184
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:41,040
Right.

3185
02:51:41,400 --> 02:51:45,320
Once you were on your program,
then are able to decide, Oh sure.

3186
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:46,400
I had some

3187
02:51:48,480 --> 02:51:51,040
and now that's

3188
02:51:51,360 --> 02:51:54,560
fine.

3189
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:55,120
Write

3190
02:51:56,080 --> 02:51:59,400
my first statement
and I'm going to copy this.

3191
02:51:59,400 --> 02:52:00,440
I hope you don't talk to me.

3192
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:04,920
Okay.

3193
02:52:04,920 --> 02:52:05,400
Right.

3194
02:52:06,360 --> 02:52:09,240
Then I should have a steady increase

3195
02:52:13,320 --> 02:52:16,080
and then this should have our last one

3196
02:52:20,160 --> 02:52:26,240
and and then I want to

3197
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:31,840
have three exclamation marks.

3198
02:52:31,840 --> 02:52:34,960
Okay. So here I needed to have

3199
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:38,640
each sentence
should be in this separate statement.

3200
02:52:38,640 --> 02:52:40,320
Right. So how many sentences.

3201
02:52:40,320 --> 02:52:43,440
I have one, two, three, four.

3202
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:44,240
Right.

3203
02:52:44,400 --> 02:52:46,920
So let's say it first. Right.

3204
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:48,320
Can you rename it.

3205
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:49,440
Yes, you can rename. Actually.

3206
02:52:49,440 --> 02:52:52,560
Let me show you after this. Good thing.

3207
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:54,520
What was that word for statements.

3208
02:52:54,520 --> 02:52:57,080
Now I want to run it on to run it.

3209
02:52:57,840 --> 02:52:58,680
Okay.

3210
02:52:58,680 --> 02:53:00,720
So this is how I'm looking on scene.

3211
02:53:00,720 --> 02:53:02,160
I'm Java programmer.

3212
02:53:02,160 --> 02:53:03,640
I studied syntax.

3213
02:53:03,640 --> 02:53:06,200
I love Java and three exclamation marks.

3214
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:06,680
Right.

3215
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:11,040
But when I look at a test,
this is the output we try to achieve,

3216
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:11,800
right?

3217
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:15,320
So it means the second statement
must be on

3218
02:53:15,320 --> 02:53:18,920
the same, must be on the same output.

3219
02:53:18,920 --> 02:53:20,840
Right. Okay. How do I make that

3220
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:24,480
all I have to do instead of the print
length?

3221
02:53:24,800 --> 02:53:26,280
I'll just type

3222
02:53:28,520 --> 02:53:29,760
one. I'm going to run.

3223
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:33,960
This is the output I was searching for.

3224
02:53:35,400 --> 02:53:36,440
Oops.

3225
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:39,120
So now one thing is actually few things,
right?

3226
02:53:39,120 --> 02:53:43,360
I see some of you have written
a little bit like that.

3227
02:53:43,800 --> 02:53:45,840
And then maybe we can eliminate

3228
02:53:46,720 --> 02:53:49,440
and maybe like that and

3229
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:52,160
maybe like. Right.

3230
02:53:52,160 --> 02:53:54,760
Which is fine, cause it's fine.

3231
02:53:54,760 --> 02:53:55,720
What are we trying to do?

3232
02:53:55,720 --> 02:53:58,560
Guess or like, one?

3233
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:00,800
My code is nice and neat, right?

3234
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:04,720
It's not just by being nice and neat,

3235
02:54:04,760 --> 02:54:08,400
but it's also your alignment is important.

3236
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:12,800
This alignment is important because for
now we just have print out statements.

3237
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:13,720
Later guys.

3238
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:17,880
We will be writing different blocks,
whole different of good.

3239
02:54:18,280 --> 02:54:23,720
So you want to see where this block of
could start,

3240
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,040
where this block of code ends?

3241
02:54:26,120 --> 02:54:28,240
Okay, so what do we need to know, guys?

3242
02:54:28,240 --> 02:54:32,880
We need to learn how to format our code,
how to format Oracle.

3243
02:54:33,280 --> 02:54:35,560
So in order to format our code,

3244
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:38,520
thank you to our ideas, right?

3245
02:54:38,520 --> 02:54:42,520
In our case, Eclipse,
there's a shortcut to format.

3246
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:45,480
So now the shortcut to format right

3247
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:49,640
let me I'm my in here

3248
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:58,200
I got to format your post

3249
02:54:58,480 --> 02:55:02,280
right so Mac users Mac users

3250
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:04,880
you are going to use command

3251
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:10,240
from one plus shift

3252
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:12,480
plus F

3253
02:55:13,720 --> 02:55:15,400
windows.

3254
02:55:15,960 --> 02:55:18,000
You guys are going to use control.

3255
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:21,440
Just control select

3256
02:55:21,440 --> 02:55:23,560
class. Okay.

3257
02:55:23,560 --> 02:55:26,400
So once you do hold them,

3258
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:30,240
write command shift s
So what it does, you guys see

3259
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:34,040
now my code is formatted,
now alignment is straight, right?

3260
02:55:34,400 --> 02:55:37,240
So this way it's easier for you to look.

3261
02:55:37,240 --> 02:55:41,000
Your code looks a little bit cleaner,
so will be clean in

3262
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,080
you will see even formatted as far as well

3263
02:55:44,800 --> 02:55:46,680
formatted my comments

3264
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:49,800
right
So this way when you really look sluggish

3265
02:55:49,800 --> 02:55:53,160
when you really look
look you're your class, right?

3266
02:55:53,640 --> 02:55:56,760
Your class starts from here

3267
02:55:57,400 --> 02:56:01,520
and why you guys see the closing
parentheses right in here as well.

3268
02:56:02,240 --> 02:56:07,800
The align public class with the closing
are you with the closing parentheses align

3269
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:11,640
your main method when it starts.

3270
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:15,400
It's also our line,
which is all closing parentheses.

3271
02:56:15,400 --> 02:56:16,000
Right?

3272
02:56:16,200 --> 02:56:19,480
So with the help of break of break
is right.

3273
02:56:19,480 --> 02:56:21,800
With the help of this curly braces,

3274
02:56:22,080 --> 02:56:25,600
we are going to find that
there's a block of code.

3275
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:28,960
Hey, I have written block of code

3276
02:56:29,280 --> 02:56:32,040
inside my main method.

3277
02:56:32,040 --> 02:56:34,080
This is where my main method starts.

3278
02:56:34,240 --> 02:56:36,960
This is why my main it's right

3279
02:56:37,240 --> 02:56:41,040
and where this block of spot goes,
it goes from here to here.

3280
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:41,880
Right.

3281
02:56:42,200 --> 02:56:45,160
Larry,
we will be writing many other blocks.

3282
02:56:45,160 --> 02:56:47,600
We'll be writing blocks condition.

3283
02:56:47,880 --> 02:56:50,960
We will be writing blocks for cycles.

3284
02:56:51,280 --> 02:56:54,840
So we want to make sure
just visually that we see

3285
02:56:54,840 --> 02:56:57,600
that we put out the of code

3286
02:56:58,320 --> 02:57:00,360
inside vertical block.

3287
02:57:00,960 --> 02:57:03,520
So that's visual. It's important stuff.

3288
02:57:03,720 --> 02:57:05,640
Always try to format your coworkers

3289
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:08,160
in the last one.

3290
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:11,240
B print formulas when we print write Y
because

3291
02:57:11,240 --> 02:57:14,280
here it is
already new line will be created off.

3292
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:15,880
There's not going to be print in here.

3293
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:18,280
Yes it can be print in. That's right.

3294
02:57:18,280 --> 02:57:22,160
Because the the statements are unknown.

3295
02:57:22,320 --> 02:57:22,760
Right.

3296
02:57:22,760 --> 02:57:25,680
And I can assume
this is the end of the program.

3297
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:26,280
Right.

3298
02:57:26,280 --> 02:57:29,240
This can be the end.

3299
02:57:29,240 --> 02:57:31,440
But sure, you can use it print off here.

3300
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:33,440
We're not going to see the difference
right now.

3301
02:57:33,440 --> 02:57:34,840
I'm going to see the different.

3302
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:39,280
But a cursor was left in here,
not on the new line.

3303
02:57:39,280 --> 02:57:40,680
It was left in here.

3304
02:57:40,680 --> 02:57:44,560
Okay. Yes.

3305
02:57:44,560 --> 02:57:46,480
If anything later you want to idea.

3306
02:57:46,480 --> 02:57:48,480
Of course, it will continue in here.

3307
02:57:48,480 --> 02:57:49,920
It will continue in here.

3308
02:57:49,920 --> 02:57:54,240
But just to get the output that we're
looking for, it can be the break.

3309
02:57:54,240 --> 02:57:56,160
We can be either print, right.

3310
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:59,120
But whenever
the future conditions will be added, then

3311
02:57:59,120 --> 02:58:03,080
we can go back and modify, if you like.

3312
02:58:03,080 --> 02:58:03,720
Okay.

3313
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:09,800
Or are you guys all able to format
the code,

3314
02:58:09,800 --> 02:58:13,040
adjust the spacing between the four?

3315
02:58:13,040 --> 02:58:15,720
Now you can just
either spacing here space,

3316
02:58:16,800 --> 02:58:17,520
that's where you get

3317
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:20,480
can I just add this space inside
a double quotes?

3318
02:58:20,760 --> 02:58:24,360
Don't have the space in here,
but inside a double course,

3319
02:58:25,080 --> 02:58:27,600
inside a double classroom.

3320
02:58:27,600 --> 02:58:29,920
Okay, so now where?

3321
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:34,000
So first, when we talk about that,
Java is a key sensitive, right?

3322
02:58:34,440 --> 02:58:38,120
So here, if I'm going to the lower keys

3323
02:58:38,200 --> 02:58:41,200
right so now

3324
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:43,240
capital as system

3325
02:58:43,600 --> 02:58:47,560
lowercase system
completely two different things for Java.

3326
02:58:47,840 --> 02:58:51,600
Now Java does not understand this system
with the lowercase means.

3327
02:58:51,600 --> 02:58:55,960
That's why we say
Java is the case sensitive right here.

3328
02:58:55,960 --> 02:59:00,600
Instead of the small P, you want to write
big P right there, right.

3329
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:02,280
So you have in the issue.

3330
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:05,040
So Java is a case sensitive.

3331
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:09,000
So make sure there's sometimes
if you think that everything is right,

3332
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:10,840
just double check your

3333
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:14,040
low caps and upper caps.

3334
02:59:14,040 --> 02:59:17,080
Write another thing. Always, always.

3335
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:19,200
Because we just start into typing.

3336
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:22,320
That's why guys I'm asking you
not to copy and paste a lot

3337
02:59:22,680 --> 02:59:25,760
because we will be doing some misspelling
right?

3338
02:59:25,760 --> 02:59:29,360
Misspelling that this is where we got
some misspelling from the students.

3339
02:59:29,360 --> 02:59:29,920
Right.

3340
02:59:29,920 --> 02:59:33,160
So that's why I try to type
as as many as many times.

3341
02:59:33,160 --> 02:59:36,360
I know it's repetitive system
that our system that our system there are.

3342
02:59:36,600 --> 02:59:39,000
But eventually
you guys will need to know this line.

3343
02:59:39,080 --> 02:59:39,600
Okay.

3344
02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:43,680
So misspelling, of course, right here.

3345
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:47,320
Another issue is this index
statement has to be finished, Right?

3346
02:59:47,800 --> 02:59:51,640
So now when it comes to this space,
is this when it comes to the space,

3347
02:59:52,600 --> 02:59:56,480
if you want to add a space in here, it's
no problem, right?

3348
02:59:56,480 --> 02:59:57,840
It's no problem.

3349
02:59:57,840 --> 02:59:59,880
So here, what do we call this?

3350
02:59:59,880 --> 03:00:03,000
The spaces
that you are going to have in here,

3351
03:00:03,320 --> 03:00:08,160
we call them a whitespace
white spaces in here, right?

3352
03:00:08,160 --> 03:00:09,720
I can have as many spaces in.

3353
03:00:09,720 --> 03:00:11,560
You don't really matter.

3354
03:00:11,560 --> 03:00:13,560
Java ignores those white spaces, right?

3355
03:00:13,800 --> 03:00:20,280
If I'm going to execute my program,
it does not mean that between statement

3356
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:25,040
that going to print from line 17 July 26
that there will be this big

3357
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:28,240
no no, as we call it, white spaces.

3358
03:00:28,240 --> 03:00:29,760
You guys see they're ignored.

3359
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:31,880
They ignore it
whenever I'm doing the execution.

3360
03:00:32,400 --> 03:00:35,320
But with spaces will be matter.

3361
03:00:35,320 --> 03:00:39,360
Spaces will be marked
inside our double quotes.

3362
03:00:39,800 --> 03:00:41,840
If I'm going to add spaces in here.

3363
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:44,280
See, I went inside my double quotes

3364
03:00:44,280 --> 03:00:47,840
and now let me add spaces, spaces, spaces,
faces, spaces, spaces.

3365
03:00:47,840 --> 03:00:52,360
In here I added many spaces right now
if I'm going to run

3366
03:00:53,280 --> 03:00:55,480
now, these spaces are shown.

3367
03:00:55,920 --> 03:00:56,880
This space is a show.

3368
03:00:56,880 --> 03:00:59,720
Mark Why this space is a matter?

3369
03:00:59,960 --> 03:01:01,960
Because this space, right?

3370
03:01:02,040 --> 03:01:05,920
This space
I place inside my double quotation.

3371
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:11,280
That's where the space will be matter.

3372
03:01:11,280 --> 03:01:13,400
There is not like such an industry.

3373
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:16,520
But look, guys,
whenever I'm going to do control shift

3374
03:01:16,520 --> 03:01:19,560
f this white spaces will be removed.

3375
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:21,480
Okay?

3376
03:01:21,480 --> 03:01:25,240
So that's why it's always,
always good practice to move

3377
03:01:26,120 --> 03:01:28,280
to a format you could work for.

3378
03:01:28,280 --> 03:01:31,200
Certainly
we we not trying to have any white spaces

3379
03:01:33,200 --> 03:01:35,320
on the right

3380
03:01:37,600 --> 03:01:38,000
right

3381
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:42,240
so white space speech matter
inside the quotation

3382
03:01:42,480 --> 03:01:48,120
space don't matter outside space
but when you for much

3383
03:01:48,240 --> 03:01:52,200
what your code will be formatted
in will give you the nice.

3384
03:01:52,600 --> 03:01:55,560
The nice.

3385
03:01:55,560 --> 03:01:58,160
And some of you were asking
if you want to add single space.

3386
03:01:58,320 --> 03:02:02,520
Single space, you want to add more space,
double space, triple space.

3387
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:06,680
But where it's located,
it's located the ready.

3388
03:02:06,840 --> 03:02:11,000
Right now what you have,
you have one space, you have second space,

3389
03:02:11,280 --> 03:02:14,280
you have space

3390
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:16,520
at it again,
the same as you had it in here.

3391
03:02:16,640 --> 03:02:18,800
One to the

3392
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:24,560
right,

3393
03:02:25,640 --> 03:02:30,200
it's one 2122 or 22.

3394
03:02:30,200 --> 03:02:33,760
So we are about to start our native text
case.

3395
03:02:33,760 --> 03:02:37,120
Okay, so let's do this
this let's take a break before we start

3396
03:02:37,120 --> 03:02:40,480
our actual, actual main topic today.

3397
03:02:40,840 --> 03:02:42,400
Right. Data types.

3398
03:02:42,400 --> 03:02:47,280
That's the beginning of basic stuff,
programing language as you guys go.

3399
03:02:47,560 --> 03:02:50,520
So let's take a
break. Is 15 minutes, right?

3400
03:02:50,520 --> 03:02:51,960
So then after the break,

3401
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:55,320
we will start and we will continue
until the end of the class.

3402
03:02:55,880 --> 03:03:01,560
That's good.

3403
03:03:01,560 --> 03:03:02,160
All right.

3404
03:03:02,160 --> 03:03:03,520
So now you can go

3405
03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:06,600
ahead and grab your food,
coffee, water with things you need.

3406
03:03:06,600 --> 03:03:07,320
Right.

3407
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:09,920
But if you really look, guys, it's 123.

3408
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:11,400
Did that time go quickly?

3409
03:03:11,400 --> 03:03:18,120
We just went quickly for you guys.

3410
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:19,720
It is right very quick.

3411
03:03:19,720 --> 03:03:23,280
And remember, guys, at first
I did a little talking and all this.

3412
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:27,320
So when our class will be full of coding,
the 5 hours will go like that.

3413
03:03:28,160 --> 03:03:30,240
But I mean, okay, guys,
not going to hold you.

3414
03:03:30,240 --> 03:03:32,560
Let's take 125. Let's be back by

3415
03:03:33,880 --> 03:03:36,280
let's be back by

3416
03:03:36,320 --> 03:03:39,760
140. Okay.

3417
03:03:39,760 --> 03:03:47,040
So 1.4 right.

3418
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:50,280
Thanks for making your many of you
and why adding We will

3419
03:03:50,280 --> 03:03:56,960
all come out.

3420
03:03:56,960 --> 03:03:58,960
I guess I'll be back at 140.

3421
03:04:01,640 --> 03:04:01,960
All right.

3422
03:04:01,960 --> 03:04:06,800
This So I hope
all those things that we talk are clear

3423
03:04:07,480 --> 03:04:10,600
and now we are actually moving

3424
03:04:10,600 --> 03:04:16,440
into our Java programing, right
when we talk about our program.

3425
03:04:16,440 --> 03:04:18,720
So remember this at first.

3426
03:04:18,720 --> 03:04:20,640
Thank you, guys and friends.

3427
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:22,920
When we say we
when they said about programing, right.

3428
03:04:22,920 --> 03:04:25,200
So we said, hey, what is a programing?

3429
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:27,360
Programing is a

3430
03:04:27,800 --> 03:04:30,520
set of instructions
that we give into a computer

3431
03:04:30,560 --> 03:04:34,640
in a computer processing program
and right to the programing.

3432
03:04:34,640 --> 03:04:38,480
We're building different software
and applications, right?

3433
03:04:38,480 --> 03:04:43,240
So all the things that you guys see right,
this is something has been developed.

3434
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:48,720
So no, whenever you think of
any application, right, any application

3435
03:04:48,720 --> 03:04:51,840
that you think of in that application

3436
03:04:52,200 --> 03:04:55,840
we are using different sets of data.

3437
03:04:55,840 --> 03:04:56,120
Right.

3438
03:04:56,120 --> 03:05:00,040
For example,
let me just go and let's see, for example.

3439
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:00,280
Right.

3440
03:05:01,280 --> 03:05:04,440
And go
the Facebook right and go to the Facebook.

3441
03:05:04,440 --> 03:05:05,000
Right.

3442
03:05:05,040 --> 03:05:08,960
So right now, let's say
if I want to create in an account, right.

3443
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,160
If I want to create an account. Right.

3444
03:05:11,160 --> 03:05:13,920
So right now, this

3445
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:17,040
application has two different
sets of data, right?

3446
03:05:17,280 --> 03:05:19,200
It has to collect my first name.

3447
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:21,480
It has to like my mobile number.

3448
03:05:21,480 --> 03:05:26,640
It has to go like my date of birth, my
gender, right, and all other things right.

3449
03:05:26,880 --> 03:05:27,720
So now.

3450
03:05:27,720 --> 03:05:30,000
But not just for collecting data, right?

3451
03:05:30,440 --> 03:05:33,920
Anything you seen in here, guys,
this is the data

3452
03:05:33,920 --> 03:05:37,160
that has been actually stored, right?

3453
03:05:37,560 --> 03:05:40,800
So now we have a different

3454
03:05:40,800 --> 03:05:43,000
we have a different sets of data. Right.

3455
03:05:43,160 --> 03:05:46,320
So in here we have a name, right?

3456
03:05:46,320 --> 03:05:47,280
What is a name?

3457
03:05:47,280 --> 03:05:51,920
Name will be a collection
of combination of letters

3458
03:05:52,080 --> 03:05:54,960
right here, a number right on mobile.

3459
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
Mobile. It's a numbers. Right.

3460
03:05:57,240 --> 03:06:02,320
So here you have a date of birth,
right here you have a guy here, of course

3461
03:06:02,360 --> 03:06:05,480
you have a letters,
but it can be a numbers two right here.

3462
03:06:05,680 --> 03:06:07,760
Whenever you select, it will be a number.

3463
03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:11,520
The years in numbers two now different,
different types of data.

3464
03:06:11,520 --> 03:06:18,120
So now through our programing, we have to
make sure that we are equal, right?

3465
03:06:18,120 --> 03:06:21,880
That we are able to work
with different of data.

3466
03:06:22,520 --> 03:06:27,960
Now, in order for us to work
with different sets of data in Java,

3467
03:06:27,960 --> 03:06:31,040
we have different data types

3468
03:06:31,280 --> 03:06:34,160
that will be representing
that data, right?

3469
03:06:34,400 --> 03:06:38,800
For example, hey, right,
you want to represent a year.

3470
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:43,440
Year is a numeric value
to represent the numeric value.

3471
03:06:43,720 --> 03:06:47,440
Java Pro can provide us
different datasets.

3472
03:06:47,440 --> 03:06:48,120
Right?

3473
03:06:48,120 --> 03:06:52,680
So now here, first name, last name, right
password, right.

3474
03:06:52,680 --> 03:06:56,520
It can be combination of letters,
it can be combination of letters

3475
03:06:56,520 --> 03:06:57,480
and the characters.

3476
03:06:57,480 --> 03:07:01,640
Hey, to represent
a combination of letters, hey,

3477
03:07:01,640 --> 03:07:04,360
Java has a different dataset, right?

3478
03:07:04,920 --> 03:07:08,440
And then for example
here, for example for gender,

3479
03:07:08,760 --> 03:07:13,120
if there will be just a single,
there will be a single character.

3480
03:07:13,120 --> 03:07:14,800
F M Right.

3481
03:07:14,800 --> 03:07:17,760
So then that's
a completely different data sets.

3482
03:07:18,120 --> 03:07:22,000
So now Java has a variety of different

3483
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:26,520
data types
that is given to us, to programmers,

3484
03:07:26,880 --> 03:07:32,360
so we can work and process
different type of the information, right?

3485
03:07:32,360 --> 03:07:36,760
So now when we talk about Java,
when we talk about Java,

3486
03:07:37,120 --> 03:07:39,840
Java has a different data types,

3487
03:07:40,120 --> 03:07:43,680
data types, data types in Java.

3488
03:07:43,960 --> 03:07:44,560
Okay.

3489
03:07:44,920 --> 03:07:47,280
So if some of you guys already

3490
03:07:47,280 --> 03:07:51,240
look at some you,
how many data types in Java

3491
03:07:51,240 --> 03:07:55,560
we have because there's different
information, different data sets we have.

3492
03:07:55,560 --> 03:07:57,600
So how many data times Java provides is

3493
03:07:59,640 --> 03:08:02,120
852. Okay, I understand

3494
03:08:02,520 --> 03:08:08,000
two, I understand eight.

3495
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:09,000
Many could be many.

3496
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:10,360
And then a little bit different way.

3497
03:08:10,360 --> 03:08:17,280
Yes, could be many.

3498
03:08:17,280 --> 03:08:20,840
Okay. Right. So data types. Right.

3499
03:08:20,840 --> 03:08:24,880
So we'll start probably from cores
and then we will summarize.

3500
03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:26,640
So data types.

3501
03:08:26,640 --> 03:08:30,600
So as I mentioned, for example,
on the example of Facebook, you guys, so

3502
03:08:30,600 --> 03:08:36,760
right here, what we need, we need to have
some characters here can be some order.

3503
03:08:36,760 --> 03:08:39,440
No special characters,
including in the password.

3504
03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:42,240
Here can be some numeric values, right?

3505
03:08:42,240 --> 03:08:47,680
So now that's what we going to look So for
with the memory data,

3506
03:08:47,800 --> 03:08:50,520
write numeric values and then we can have

3507
03:08:50,760 --> 03:08:52,800
non numeric.

3508
03:08:53,560 --> 03:08:54,160
Then the

3509
03:08:55,240 --> 03:08:58,200
like the now
when we have a numeric values.

3510
03:08:58,200 --> 03:08:58,760
Right.

3511
03:08:59,480 --> 03:09:02,960
So now guys, let me ask you,
let me ask you this, numeric values.

3512
03:09:02,960 --> 03:09:05,760
So in here I have to enter the year.

3513
03:09:06,200 --> 03:09:08,800
Year can be 2021 are

3514
03:09:08,840 --> 03:09:13,680
1935, 1965, 20, 20, 22, whatever the year.

3515
03:09:13,680 --> 03:09:17,720
Right So when you look at it,
it's a whole number, right?

3516
03:09:17,720 --> 03:09:19,840
My data came from first day 31st.

3517
03:09:19,880 --> 03:09:21,240
It's a whole number.

3518
03:09:21,240 --> 03:09:22,080
Now think of it.

3519
03:09:22,080 --> 03:09:26,160
If you're going to work, let's say
I know on the Amazon when we look

3520
03:09:26,160 --> 03:09:34,480
at different items and prices,
so now our prices can be 599, 699, 1099.

3521
03:09:34,480 --> 03:09:34,720
Right.

3522
03:09:34,720 --> 03:09:45,480
So what kind of numbers are we talking
about?

3523
03:09:45,480 --> 03:09:47,840
We're talking about decimals, right?

3524
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:50,160
We're talking about
the numbers, these decimals.

3525
03:09:50,160 --> 03:09:52,320
So they are also different, right?

3526
03:09:52,320 --> 03:09:53,680
So no jealousy. Okay.

3527
03:09:53,680 --> 03:09:54,120
You Know what?

3528
03:09:54,120 --> 03:09:56,800
When you work with the numeric values,
you're numeric.

3529
03:09:56,800 --> 03:10:01,640
That list can be a whole numbers
and they can be decimals, right?

3530
03:10:01,880 --> 03:10:04,440
Decimals. Okay.

3531
03:10:04,840 --> 03:10:08,240
So now that's where we are going to start.

3532
03:10:08,560 --> 03:10:12,440
So now Java says, hey,
whenever you want to work

3533
03:10:12,440 --> 03:10:15,880
with the numbers, whenever
you want to work with the numbers,

3534
03:10:16,240 --> 03:10:20,160
I'll give you we're righty of different
types, right?

3535
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:21,920
Java does not give us a go.

3536
03:10:21,920 --> 03:10:23,160
This is just only one time.

3537
03:10:23,160 --> 03:10:24,480
Go and work with it.

3538
03:10:24,480 --> 03:10:26,880
Java uses a different variety.

3539
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:32,920
Okay,
so now to represent and numeric value

3540
03:10:32,920 --> 03:10:35,840
as a whole number is a whole number

3541
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:39,600
Java users or different data types.

3542
03:10:39,880 --> 03:10:46,440
It gives us by years short,
it gives us integer and it gives as well.

3543
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:49,680
And we going to type all of them.

3544
03:10:49,680 --> 03:10:52,200
We're going to see
what is the difference between them.

3545
03:10:52,200 --> 03:10:58,320
Okay, So no doubt this okay, I understand
that there can be a decimals, right?

3546
03:10:58,320 --> 03:10:59,680
They can be decimal numbers.

3547
03:10:59,680 --> 03:11:04,160
So now if you have to work with decimals,

3548
03:11:04,360 --> 03:11:08,080
I'm giving you good different others
due to different other kinds.

3549
03:11:08,400 --> 03:11:12,000
So to work with the decimals
we have Java's Java says, hey

3550
03:11:12,040 --> 03:11:15,600
you can use my slot
and you can use my double

3551
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:22,760
and use my double.

3552
03:11:22,760 --> 03:11:23,600
All right.

3553
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:27,440
So now I think that's pretty much
about numbers right there.

3554
03:11:27,440 --> 03:11:29,680
Got the whole number, decimals, numbers,

3555
03:11:29,680 --> 03:11:32,880
the different representation
of those numbers.

3556
03:11:32,880 --> 03:11:36,360
Well,
they can be non numeric values, right?

3557
03:11:36,520 --> 03:11:40,720
So whenever we work with the application,
there can be no numeric values, right?

3558
03:11:41,200 --> 03:11:42,480
So we can have

3559
03:11:43,560 --> 03:11:44,880
a values that

3560
03:11:44,880 --> 03:11:48,720
can be represented as a single character.

3561
03:11:48,720 --> 03:11:49,760
Right.

3562
03:11:49,920 --> 03:11:52,680
It can be a single letter

3563
03:11:52,680 --> 03:11:55,480
or it can be a special character.

3564
03:11:55,480 --> 03:11:56,000
Right.

3565
03:11:56,000 --> 03:12:00,320
Special characters
such as a dollar sign, exclamation

3566
03:12:00,320 --> 03:12:04,360
mark, question, a percentage sign, Right.

3567
03:12:04,360 --> 03:12:09,000
Any of those special characters,
how do you represent them to represent

3568
03:12:09,240 --> 03:12:14,160
those characters in Java
have something called chart, right?

3569
03:12:14,400 --> 03:12:17,040
So what a chart does it represents

3570
03:12:18,960 --> 03:12:22,240
one character

3571
03:12:22,240 --> 03:12:24,320
and it can be it either can be

3572
03:12:25,320 --> 03:12:27,840
one letter characters write

3573
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:31,160
one letter can be
when the number one letter,

3574
03:12:32,360 --> 03:12:33,960
one number

3575
03:12:35,360 --> 03:12:36,600
one special character.

3576
03:12:36,600 --> 03:12:40,560
As long as it's one.

3577
03:12:40,560 --> 03:12:41,400
As long as it's one.

3578
03:12:41,400 --> 03:12:43,480
Yep, just one plus one.

3579
03:12:43,480 --> 03:12:45,000
Right. We are not going into

3580
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:50,280
sequence of characters
such as first name, last name, email.

3581
03:12:50,320 --> 03:12:52,280
Now we're talking about single character,
right?

3582
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:56,000
For example,
your have to represent your gender, right?

3583
03:12:56,160 --> 03:12:57,480
F Right.

3584
03:12:57,480 --> 03:13:02,440
Or are you have to represent
a single character dollar sign, right?

3585
03:13:02,760 --> 03:13:05,840
So how it will be represented,
you will be putting it inside

3586
03:13:05,840 --> 03:13:10,280
a single point, just one one character
What is your character?

3587
03:13:10,640 --> 03:13:12,320
S What is your character?

3588
03:13:12,320 --> 03:13:14,960
A dollar sign right here
we have a letter. Character years.

3589
03:13:14,960 --> 03:13:16,960
We have a dollar sign.

3590
03:13:17,240 --> 03:13:18,640
How we will be represented there.

3591
03:13:18,640 --> 03:13:21,680
We will be representing them
in the single quotation.

3592
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:25,240
Okay, so now what else can Come on.

3593
03:13:25,240 --> 03:13:27,480
There are non numeric values. Okay.

3594
03:13:27,480 --> 03:13:31,520
Under non numeric values
there's some data type

3595
03:13:31,720 --> 03:13:35,080
the chart
or I heard there's one data type there.

3596
03:13:35,080 --> 03:13:37,120
We call it balling.

3597
03:13:37,400 --> 03:13:37,840
Okay.

3598
03:13:37,840 --> 03:13:43,080
Now you guys heard of the bully.

3599
03:13:43,080 --> 03:13:43,880
Okay.

3600
03:13:44,120 --> 03:13:46,280
Because you guys did some homework, right?

3601
03:13:47,080 --> 03:13:50,800
If you say no, then next time please
make sure you are okay.

3602
03:13:50,800 --> 03:13:57,560
So boolean is a data type that represents
yes or no answer.

3603
03:13:57,560 --> 03:13:58,400
Right?

3604
03:13:58,760 --> 03:14:00,840
Do I like the class? Yes.

3605
03:14:00,840 --> 03:14:03,880
And my hungry? Yes. Is it cold outside?

3606
03:14:04,080 --> 03:14:05,480
No. Right.

3607
03:14:05,480 --> 03:14:08,960
So to represent yes or no?

3608
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:11,080
Right in Java.

3609
03:14:11,080 --> 03:14:12,320
What do we have?

3610
03:14:12,320 --> 03:14:16,080
We have something
that called true or false.

3611
03:14:17,400 --> 03:14:19,440
So false, right.

3612
03:14:19,440 --> 03:14:22,080
If you want, just say, Hey, I am hungry.

3613
03:14:22,080 --> 03:14:24,200
If you are hungry, wouldn't you say true.

3614
03:14:24,200 --> 03:14:26,880
If you're not hungry,
you going to say false, right?

3615
03:14:26,880 --> 03:14:29,080
Bingo. Joe, we say yes or no.
What do we say?

3616
03:14:29,080 --> 03:14:31,200
We say true or false, right?

3617
03:14:31,200 --> 03:14:34,600
So, for example,
where you true or false will be in here.

3618
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:37,880
Hey, is this checkboxes clicked?

3619
03:14:37,880 --> 03:14:39,560
Yes, if it will be.

3620
03:14:39,560 --> 03:14:43,120
If your if you
if your radio button is clicked,

3621
03:14:43,440 --> 03:14:45,280
then it will be the radio button click.

3622
03:14:45,280 --> 03:14:46,640
Yes, it will be story.

3623
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:49,960
Any form of
if the radio button is not clicked,

3624
03:14:50,240 --> 03:14:52,720
you will be stored in the form of false.

3625
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:56,040
It's very cold outside in the buffalo.

3626
03:14:56,360 --> 03:14:57,120
Oh wow. Okay.

3627
03:14:57,120 --> 03:15:01,080
People people
probably in Las Vegas or California,

3628
03:15:01,080 --> 03:15:05,240
they're like, okay, thanks,
but we're not there right?

3629
03:15:05,240 --> 03:15:12,720
How cold it is.

3630
03:15:12,720 --> 03:15:15,720
Not that cold. Not yet. Right? Not yet.

3631
03:15:17,160 --> 03:15:19,040
Going to get pretty cold.

3632
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:22,640
It has 58 in San Francisco, actually.

3633
03:15:22,640 --> 03:15:23,680
Is not that hard either.

3634
03:15:23,680 --> 03:15:25,000
Right, Farhad?

3635
03:15:25,320 --> 03:15:27,840
I've been in San Francisco
a couple of ago.

3636
03:15:27,960 --> 03:15:32,120
It gets very chilly, but it's great.

3637
03:15:32,160 --> 03:15:35,320
California, 84 degrees

3638
03:15:36,240 --> 03:15:40,000
in Chicago, 79 right now.

3639
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:41,200
Right now

3640
03:15:43,400 --> 03:15:44,440
somewhere.

3641
03:15:45,080 --> 03:15:47,880
Well, that's that's a beauty right
now, guys.

3642
03:15:47,880 --> 03:15:48,200
Right.

3643
03:15:48,200 --> 03:15:51,240
So let's say your I don't know, maybe

3644
03:15:51,240 --> 03:15:54,600
you wanted to go to live in some state
for some time.

3645
03:15:54,600 --> 03:15:58,200
Right. But.
But you had no reasons to move.

3646
03:15:58,200 --> 03:16:01,080
Maybe after finishing our boot camp.

3647
03:16:01,080 --> 03:16:04,840
Maybe your job would be somewhere
in California.

3648
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:06,840
Right?
Then it will be good paying job, right?

3649
03:16:06,840 --> 03:16:08,280
So why not?

3650
03:16:08,280 --> 03:16:09,680
Or the best part of you.

3651
03:16:09,680 --> 03:16:13,480
Let's say you guys want to go live
somewhere outside of the country, right?

3652
03:16:13,880 --> 03:16:16,680
Because the majority of the jobs
are remote right now.

3653
03:16:16,680 --> 03:16:20,040
So we'll see, of course, what's going
to be happening with the COVID situation.

3654
03:16:20,040 --> 03:16:21,640
But let's say you can work remote,

3655
03:16:21,640 --> 03:16:26,560
you can be in any country and work
remotely and best part, right?

3656
03:16:28,200 --> 03:16:33,680
It Washington Seattle

3657
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:37,440
or yeah you get the US have a lot of rain

3658
03:16:37,520 --> 03:16:39,840
you'll love it here that's good again

3659
03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:41,040
All right

3660
03:16:45,600 --> 03:16:47,320
so now what are we looking at?

3661
03:16:47,320 --> 03:16:47,840
Business.

3662
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:49,880
Okay so now when
we looking at this, right?

3663
03:16:49,880 --> 03:16:54,440
So once again, whenever we work
with different type of the information,

3664
03:16:54,440 --> 03:16:57,840
we have to make sure
we are able to process it right?

3665
03:16:57,840 --> 03:16:59,520
We are able to process it.

3666
03:16:59,520 --> 03:17:03,440
So now Java says, hey, whenever you work
it means the whole numbers

3667
03:17:03,640 --> 03:17:05,760
to represent the whole numbers.

3668
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:09,040
I'm giving you four different data
types, right?

3669
03:17:09,040 --> 03:17:13,720
If you have to store one, two, three,
1001, 10 million, whatever your number,

3670
03:17:13,720 --> 03:17:18,720
you when you have legal, I'm
giving you the variety of this data types.

3671
03:17:19,320 --> 03:17:24,920
Hey, if you have to work
with the decimals 199 to 99 1099,

3672
03:17:25,160 --> 03:17:29,400
whatever the number with those decimals
you have legal,

3673
03:17:29,400 --> 03:17:33,960
you can use them in store inside the lot
or you can use a double.

3674
03:17:34,280 --> 03:17:35,960
You can use a double.

3675
03:17:35,960 --> 03:17:36,320
Okay.

3676
03:17:36,320 --> 03:17:39,040
Besides the having the numbers,
because having the numbers,

3677
03:17:39,040 --> 03:17:41,760
there can be a different data
types, right?

3678
03:17:42,080 --> 03:17:44,400
Hey, I can have a single character, right?

3679
03:17:44,400 --> 03:17:45,680
I can have a single character.

3680
03:17:45,680 --> 03:17:50,360
It's not numeric, so that's why it falls
under non numeric category, right? E

3681
03:17:51,360 --> 03:17:53,840
To represent a single character,
we have char

3682
03:17:54,720 --> 03:17:57,800
and this is a very special one
data type, right?

3683
03:17:57,800 --> 03:18:03,040
So whenever we want to say yes,
no, whenever we want to say yes or no,

3684
03:18:03,400 --> 03:18:06,800
okay, then we want to say yes
or no like this checkbox.

3685
03:18:06,800 --> 03:18:08,040
When we click

3686
03:18:09,320 --> 03:18:12,840
this checkbox, we click right, do

3687
03:18:14,400 --> 03:18:16,440
this checkbox when we click right.

3688
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:21,720
If I'm going to click
is going to be stored as a true.

3689
03:18:22,240 --> 03:18:25,800
If I'm not going to click,
it will be stored as a false right

3690
03:18:26,080 --> 03:18:28,640
in my selecting It is am I clicking on it?

3691
03:18:28,920 --> 03:18:32,440
If it's unselected it it's no, it's not

3692
03:18:33,920 --> 03:18:34,800
okay. Right.

3693
03:18:34,800 --> 03:18:37,680
So now when we look at it, what we have,

3694
03:18:38,280 --> 03:18:41,360
Char, is one boolean is two,

3695
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:47,040
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

3696
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:47,880
Okay.

3697
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:51,000
So now what we have we have a

3698
03:18:51,360 --> 03:18:55,520
any eight data types, but all is eight.

3699
03:18:55,520 --> 03:18:58,800
There are times guys they are B
they are bearing

3700
03:18:59,200 --> 03:19:04,080
being a part of something
that we call S primitive types,

3701
03:19:05,480 --> 03:19:09,840
primitive data types.

3702
03:19:09,840 --> 03:19:13,680
So primitive data
types of the primitive data types.

3703
03:19:13,680 --> 03:19:16,760
We have eight we have to think, okay,

3704
03:19:17,360 --> 03:19:20,880
and there's one thing that in Java

3705
03:19:20,880 --> 03:19:26,160
we going to have that
we going to call non primitive.

3706
03:19:26,400 --> 03:19:30,240
Okay, We're going to call non
primitive, non

3707
03:19:31,120 --> 03:19:33,480
primitive data types

3708
03:19:33,480 --> 03:19:39,120
and there will be unlimited
of primitive data types.

3709
03:19:39,360 --> 03:19:41,200
And what of the example.

3710
03:19:41,200 --> 03:19:45,040
One of the example in there will be many,
many more that we will be

3711
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:49,400
learning is one of the example of non
primitive data types.

3712
03:19:49,640 --> 03:19:53,680
For example, any time I want you to go
the name, any time I want

3713
03:19:53,680 --> 03:19:57,880
you store the email,
any time I want to store the password.

3714
03:19:57,880 --> 03:20:01,040
So now what I do is right name.

3715
03:20:01,480 --> 03:20:05,600
It's a combination
of multiple characters, right?

3716
03:20:06,760 --> 03:20:06,960
Yeah.

3717
03:20:06,960 --> 03:20:08,760
Those notes will be available to this.

3718
03:20:08,760 --> 03:20:09,760
What is a name?

3719
03:20:09,760 --> 03:20:12,240
Name is a combination
of multiple characters.

3720
03:20:12,520 --> 03:20:14,160
What is an email? Right.

3721
03:20:14,160 --> 03:20:18,120
Let's say my email cell edge syntax
text that com.

3722
03:20:18,120 --> 03:20:18,400
Right.

3723
03:20:18,400 --> 03:20:24,280
So now my email is combination of what is
layers in the special characters, right?

3724
03:20:24,520 --> 03:20:27,360
It's not one, but is it?

3725
03:20:27,360 --> 03:20:29,080
What is my password?

3726
03:20:29,080 --> 03:20:30,600
I sell 1 to 3.

3727
03:20:30,600 --> 03:20:34,680
Now I have a combination of letters
and then numbers.

3728
03:20:34,680 --> 03:20:35,280
Right.

3729
03:20:35,320 --> 03:20:39,560
So any time we have to use
the combination of

3730
03:20:41,120 --> 03:20:43,320
letters in special characters, letters

3731
03:20:43,360 --> 03:20:46,840
or a numbers
or just a collection of letters.

3732
03:20:47,160 --> 03:20:52,200
This falls under non primitive types,
which we guys will be looking tomorrow.

3733
03:20:52,200 --> 03:20:55,280
But one of the examples it can be a
we call it

3734
03:20:55,280 --> 03:20:57,800
x string, it will be interesting.

3735
03:20:58,680 --> 03:21:01,600
So now when we look this, when we look

3736
03:21:02,160 --> 03:21:05,840
how many data types in Java we have, we

3737
03:21:06,240 --> 03:21:09,720
two data types,
we have only two data types.

3738
03:21:09,720 --> 03:21:13,680
In Java, we have primitive data type

3739
03:21:14,560 --> 03:21:17,520
and we have non primitive data type.

3740
03:21:17,880 --> 03:21:20,960
So now students
that say that there's eight,

3741
03:21:21,280 --> 03:21:24,080
there's eight data types

3742
03:21:24,360 --> 03:21:28,080
that can a primitive values

3743
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:31,360
and there is unlimited

3744
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:35,680
non primitive
data types that will be represent in

3745
03:21:36,920 --> 03:21:38,120
many other things, right?

3746
03:21:38,120 --> 03:21:40,000
They'll just call it
many other things for now.

3747
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:41,400
So not to

3748
03:21:41,720 --> 03:21:45,000
bore you with that with the

3749
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:46,200
we call it

3750
03:21:46,800 --> 03:21:48,200
criminology.

3751
03:21:48,680 --> 03:21:49,560
Right. Okay.

3752
03:21:49,560 --> 03:21:55,960
So our focus today, guys, will be
our focus today will be strictly strictly.

3753
03:21:55,960 --> 03:21:59,160
We will be focusing on eight primitive

3754
03:21:59,160 --> 03:22:01,440
beta types, eight primitive theorems.

3755
03:22:02,400 --> 03:22:03,080
Okay.

3756
03:22:03,360 --> 03:22:08,040
And of course, we will look what, is it
difference why Java gives us for different

3757
03:22:08,400 --> 03:22:11,080
for different data types
to represent whole numbers?

3758
03:22:11,080 --> 03:22:15,000
Why does it use as two different data
attached to represented decimals?

3759
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:17,880
While here I uses only one chart. Right?

3760
03:22:18,160 --> 03:22:21,840
And for the moving images
when you have true or false.

3761
03:22:22,040 --> 03:22:22,680
Okay.

3762
03:22:22,920 --> 03:22:24,520
So no.

3763
03:22:24,520 --> 03:22:27,880
Let me go to my eclipse. Right?

3764
03:22:28,160 --> 03:22:29,840
Let me go to my kids.

3765
03:22:29,840 --> 03:22:32,520
I'll create a new program.
I'll call it new.

3766
03:22:32,800 --> 03:22:34,760
I'll call it.

3767
03:22:34,760 --> 03:22:41,520
Maybe I'm going to call it data text.

3768
03:22:41,520 --> 03:22:43,920
String will be a combination, right?

3769
03:22:43,920 --> 03:22:46,320
The string will be a combination of

3770
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:50,280
combination of multiple characters.

3771
03:22:50,280 --> 03:22:52,440
Right. For example, name. Right.

3772
03:22:52,440 --> 03:22:53,360
For example, name.

3773
03:22:53,360 --> 03:22:55,400
Your name is Catalina. Right.

3774
03:22:56,040 --> 03:22:57,800
So now

3775
03:22:57,960 --> 03:22:59,640
it's a single character.

3776
03:22:59,640 --> 03:23:01,440
It's multiple characters, right?

3777
03:23:01,440 --> 03:23:03,120
It's multiple characters.

3778
03:23:03,120 --> 03:23:03,960
Email, Right.

3779
03:23:03,960 --> 03:23:10,080
For example, your email will be, let's say
Catalina, a Gmail that can write Gmail.

3780
03:23:10,080 --> 03:23:12,320
That's right.

3781
03:23:12,600 --> 03:23:17,480
So now you have a combination of letters
and the special characters, right?

3782
03:23:17,640 --> 03:23:18,520
You password.

3783
03:23:18,520 --> 03:23:20,960
Let's say your password will be Catalina.

3784
03:23:20,960 --> 03:23:21,920
One, two, three.

3785
03:23:21,920 --> 03:23:26,360
Now you have a combination of letters
in the numbers, right?

3786
03:23:26,640 --> 03:23:30,120
So this type of data, this type of data

3787
03:23:30,120 --> 03:23:33,120
can be represented in the form of string

3788
03:23:34,240 --> 03:23:37,800
presented in the form,
and we're going to look at strings.

3789
03:23:37,800 --> 03:23:40,000
And there's a lot of things
that we will be looking at

3790
03:23:40,520 --> 03:23:44,160
about the strings just on gifts,
different classes throughout the course.

3791
03:23:45,960 --> 03:23:46,760
For now,

3792
03:23:46,760 --> 03:23:50,240
we are focusing on primitive data types.

3793
03:23:51,400 --> 03:23:54,440
The know
what do we have guys Java gives us?

3794
03:23:54,480 --> 03:23:56,520
Okay, you want to work with numbers?

3795
03:23:56,520 --> 03:23:58,440
Here is you set of data types.

3796
03:23:58,440 --> 03:23:59,760
You want to work with non

3797
03:23:59,760 --> 03:24:03,520
numeric values here
as you said, of different direct types.

3798
03:24:03,520 --> 03:24:05,280
Right. So okay.

3799
03:24:05,280 --> 03:24:10,040
Or missing my main let me type my main
let me bring my main level quickly.

3800
03:24:10,320 --> 03:24:11,920
It's oblique. I feel good.

3801
03:24:11,920 --> 03:24:13,960
So this is what happens when you feel that

3802
03:24:14,760 --> 03:24:19,600
you would need to

3803
03:24:23,560 --> 03:24:27,960
an indoor or indoor.

3804
03:24:27,960 --> 03:24:30,000
Okay. Right. So let's do this.

3805
03:24:30,480 --> 03:24:32,640
So what I have right now
have a data, right.

3806
03:24:32,680 --> 03:24:33,080
Okay.

3807
03:24:33,080 --> 03:24:35,280
You know what I want to represent, right?

3808
03:24:35,280 --> 03:24:38,000
So let's go to our Facebook, right?
My year.

3809
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:41,960
My year is or let's say my, my, my,

3810
03:24:43,320 --> 03:24:44,040
my day of work.

3811
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:46,680
Let's say I was born on October
2nd, right?

3812
03:24:46,680 --> 03:24:49,680
For example,
what is the day there is second, right?

3813
03:24:49,680 --> 03:24:55,560
So now what I want to do,
I want to have to write to know my

3814
03:24:55,800 --> 03:24:58,760
my job is complaining right
that even if I had the same column,

3815
03:24:58,760 --> 03:25:02,160
I cannot just have a tool in my program
right here.

3816
03:25:02,160 --> 03:25:04,440
I'm representing to right.

3817
03:25:04,440 --> 03:25:07,920
So now what do we have actually write to?

3818
03:25:07,920 --> 03:25:09,440
It's a whole number, right?

3819
03:25:09,440 --> 03:25:11,680
Two is a whole number.

3820
03:25:11,680 --> 03:25:16,680
Now what it tells us, hey,
if you want to represent a whole number,

3821
03:25:16,680 --> 03:25:20,720
you can have y you can have
should you have integer,

3822
03:25:20,880 --> 03:25:24,600
you can have long
okay, not let me say byte, right.

3823
03:25:24,840 --> 03:25:29,720
So the valid you I'm represented
in the form of byte right now.

3824
03:25:29,720 --> 03:25:31,840
I still are happy that I still are happy.

3825
03:25:31,920 --> 03:25:33,880
Now let's see what happens in here.

3826
03:25:35,120 --> 03:25:38,800
Now, whenever
are processing the information this right,

3827
03:25:38,800 --> 03:25:43,600
Whenever we processing the information
in here, what I'm going to store right,

3828
03:25:43,800 --> 03:25:47,880
right now, I want to store my first name
right then I want to store my last name.

3829
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:56,880
Now, this information is being poured
and it's actually saved.

3830
03:25:56,880 --> 03:25:58,560
Right? Is being saved.

3831
03:25:58,560 --> 03:26:03,360
How come next time I can enter my email
and I can enter my password,

3832
03:26:03,360 --> 03:26:09,040
am able to log in y because My information
has been stored now.

3833
03:26:09,200 --> 03:26:12,120
Now this information is being stored.
Guys.

3834
03:26:12,560 --> 03:26:16,480
These values have been stored in

3835
03:26:16,480 --> 03:26:21,240
some special containers, is being stored
in some special containers.

3836
03:26:21,720 --> 03:26:24,600
And how do we call this
containers in Java?

3837
03:26:24,800 --> 03:26:28,360
We call them a variables
at first variables.

3838
03:26:28,360 --> 03:26:30,160
And then of course,
they go to the database. Right.

3839
03:26:30,160 --> 03:26:31,120
Which you guys also will be

3840
03:26:31,120 --> 03:26:34,240
learning about it
for this store in the form of variables.

3841
03:26:34,240 --> 03:26:35,280
Right. Let's go, Alex.

3842
03:26:35,280 --> 03:26:38,040
Let's go
that yes, information is stored in there.

3843
03:26:38,040 --> 03:26:40,840
But this for the
the grub is stored, right.

3844
03:26:41,480 --> 03:26:43,320
And they grab and store in the variables.

3845
03:26:43,320 --> 03:26:48,000
So now any data
we have gets any data that we have,

3846
03:26:48,360 --> 03:26:52,000
we will be storing it in our program
right now.

3847
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:52,440
Program.

3848
03:26:52,440 --> 03:26:56,240
We need to store it inside
the variables think to it.

3849
03:26:56,280 --> 03:26:57,600
What is the variable?

3850
03:26:57,600 --> 03:27:00,000
Variable is just a simply container.

3851
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:02,840
This variable is simply continue. Right?

3852
03:27:03,080 --> 03:27:07,760
So now I have my for right,
I have my numeric value.

3853
03:27:08,040 --> 03:27:11,800
Now what I have to do,
I need to store it inside a container.

3854
03:27:12,120 --> 03:27:15,560
I need to store it inside the box
right here.

3855
03:27:15,560 --> 03:27:17,480
So now I have a different value.

3856
03:27:17,480 --> 03:27:18,600
Valid is decimals.

3857
03:27:18,600 --> 03:27:23,400
I'll be storing also inside a container
right here I have a single character

3858
03:27:23,400 --> 03:27:26,280
and if there's a mistake,
it should be single.

3859
03:27:26,280 --> 03:27:28,440
I'm stored in different box. Right?

3860
03:27:28,760 --> 03:27:34,360
So now whatever data I will be storing,
right, whatever the data will be working

3861
03:27:34,360 --> 03:27:37,800
with, I have to store it inside
my continuous right.

3862
03:27:38,040 --> 03:27:40,480
So think of it when you have water, right?

3863
03:27:40,800 --> 03:27:45,080
In order for you to use water
in order for you to drink water,

3864
03:27:45,280 --> 03:27:49,000
what you have to do first,
you have to put it inside a G+, right?

3865
03:27:49,320 --> 03:27:51,160
Or you want to drink your coffee.

3866
03:27:51,160 --> 03:27:55,680
So first what you have to do,
you have to put it inside your cup

3867
03:27:55,880 --> 03:27:59,040
and only
then you are able to use it, right?

3868
03:27:59,760 --> 03:28:01,920
So now this exact the same thing

3869
03:28:02,160 --> 03:28:05,080
we will be doing is our data, right?

3870
03:28:05,360 --> 03:28:10,680
So now our data needs to be stored
inside these variables.

3871
03:28:10,760 --> 03:28:11,040
Okay?

3872
03:28:11,040 --> 03:28:16,680
Inside this boxes,
those boxes is a temporary placeholder.

3873
03:28:16,680 --> 03:28:17,760
Right. Coffee.

3874
03:28:17,760 --> 03:28:21,640
While I have a coffee,
it will be inside my cup right then.

3875
03:28:21,640 --> 03:28:24,120
If I.
If I'm done, I can throw away the cup.

3876
03:28:24,120 --> 03:28:27,000
But while I want to have this coffee,

3877
03:28:27,160 --> 03:28:29,400
my coffee will be inside this.

3878
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:34,960
Right now they don't need to be stored
inside the boxes.

3879
03:28:35,360 --> 03:28:37,520
How do I create this box?

3880
03:28:37,560 --> 03:28:39,960
Okay, how do I create this box?

3881
03:28:39,960 --> 03:28:44,640
So now what I need to specify
in order for me to create box, right?

3882
03:28:46,040 --> 03:28:48,000
And for different

3883
03:28:48,000 --> 03:28:51,480
data types,
there will be a different boxes.

3884
03:28:51,600 --> 03:28:53,840
Okay, so now what need to do?

3885
03:28:53,840 --> 03:28:56,240
I need to create a variable, right?

3886
03:28:56,520 --> 03:29:00,760
So to create a variable
Java is very, very strict guys.

3887
03:29:00,840 --> 03:29:02,200
Java is very strict.

3888
03:29:02,200 --> 03:29:06,960
Java says, okay,
you need a variable to store the data.

3889
03:29:07,600 --> 03:29:09,360
I'll give you the variable.

3890
03:29:09,360 --> 03:29:10,840
Why do you need to tell me?

3891
03:29:10,840 --> 03:29:12,920
What are you planning to store in there?

3892
03:29:13,200 --> 03:29:17,200
Okay So now a process of creating
the variable

3893
03:29:17,280 --> 03:29:19,800
is has done in two steps.

3894
03:29:20,480 --> 03:29:21,600
First, what do we need to do?

3895
03:29:21,600 --> 03:29:25,800
We need to specify, Hey,
what type of values you planning to store?

3896
03:29:26,080 --> 03:29:29,200
I am planning to store

3897
03:29:29,200 --> 03:29:31,040
byte type of values.

3898
03:29:31,040 --> 03:29:31,760
Right.

3899
03:29:31,800 --> 03:29:34,880
So now what
will the name of your container?

3900
03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:37,680
The name of my container, let me call it.

3901
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:38,760
I don't know, I'll just pull it.

3902
03:29:38,760 --> 03:29:41,400
Box one right now.

3903
03:29:41,400 --> 03:29:44,960
What I would like to do in inside
this box one

3904
03:29:45,280 --> 03:29:48,000
I want to store the value to.

3905
03:29:48,360 --> 03:29:51,320
To store the value inside the box.

3906
03:29:51,440 --> 03:29:53,880
We will just place equal sign.

3907
03:29:54,360 --> 03:29:55,720
So now what happens?

3908
03:29:55,720 --> 03:29:58,520
This now is exactly

3909
03:29:59,640 --> 03:30:00,600
this part.

3910
03:30:00,600 --> 03:30:05,000
That's what exactly you see in the picture
So now you took the value for

3911
03:30:05,680 --> 03:30:08,240
and now what you did,
you store it in the box.

3912
03:30:08,760 --> 03:30:11,320
How did we name this box right here?

3913
03:30:11,320 --> 03:30:12,240
Different names.

3914
03:30:12,240 --> 03:30:14,840
And how did anemic, anemic box one. Right.

3915
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:19,320
So now I can give any name
to my variable, right?

3916
03:30:19,320 --> 03:30:21,560
I can give it any name to think I this.

3917
03:30:21,600 --> 03:30:23,960
It's you have in the box right.

3918
03:30:23,960 --> 03:30:25,480
Let's say you movie right?

3919
03:30:25,480 --> 03:30:29,880
You moving from one city to another city
and now you want to store

3920
03:30:29,880 --> 03:30:31,120
certain things, right?

3921
03:30:31,120 --> 03:30:33,880
So what you will doing you'll store your
I don't know

3922
03:30:33,880 --> 03:30:37,440
you store your dishes in one box
and then you will add the label, right?

3923
03:30:37,680 --> 03:30:39,800
Then you store your clothes
in another box.

3924
03:30:39,800 --> 03:30:42,360
You will add the label right?
Then add some.

3925
03:30:42,960 --> 03:30:44,080
I don't know, food.

3926
03:30:44,080 --> 03:30:46,960
You're going to store only food in there
and you want to add the label.

3927
03:30:47,240 --> 03:30:48,960
That's exactly what we're doing right now.

3928
03:30:48,960 --> 03:30:53,520
So what I have.

3929
03:30:53,520 --> 03:30:55,560
Yeah, this name can be anything, right?

3930
03:30:55,560 --> 03:30:59,600
So tomorrow you move in, maybe I'm
going to name it the My box is a food.

3931
03:30:59,600 --> 03:31:02,400
Maybe you want it,
you name it something different, right?

3932
03:31:02,760 --> 03:31:04,560
Name can be anything.

3933
03:31:04,560 --> 03:31:06,240
Name can be anything.

3934
03:31:06,240 --> 03:31:09,000
As long as you know where to find it
later.

3935
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:09,920
Right. Remember this.

3936
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:12,600
Now you move a different city.

3937
03:31:12,600 --> 03:31:14,000
We will talk about what in space.

3938
03:31:14,000 --> 03:31:16,360
We'll talk about ways
when you move to different cities.

3939
03:31:16,400 --> 03:31:20,080
Now you have hundreds of boxes right now.

3940
03:31:20,080 --> 03:31:24,320
If you give a proper name to your box,
you can fast to find it, right?

3941
03:31:24,320 --> 03:31:25,320
You can fast find it.

3942
03:31:25,320 --> 03:31:29,160
So we will be also very careful
in naming our boxes to

3943
03:31:31,800 --> 03:31:34,240
box in letters because we are going
step by step.

3944
03:31:34,240 --> 03:31:35,400
Right? We are going step by step.

3945
03:31:35,400 --> 03:31:37,680
So first, first, what are we doing This?

3946
03:31:37,680 --> 03:31:41,160
We will be talking about
storing numeric values.

3947
03:31:41,360 --> 03:31:45,720
And I want to store I want to try
all these different data types.

3948
03:31:45,720 --> 03:31:48,120
All the different data. Right.

3949
03:31:48,120 --> 03:31:48,800
Okay.

3950
03:31:48,800 --> 03:31:49,680
So first we took.

3951
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:52,400
But now let's look short. Okay? Not.

3952
03:31:52,760 --> 03:31:55,120
Hey, Java, give me a box.

3953
03:31:55,560 --> 03:31:56,640
Give me a box. Java.

3954
03:31:56,640 --> 03:31:58,320
Give me a variable. Okay.

3955
03:31:58,320 --> 03:31:59,640
So what is this variable?

3956
03:31:59,640 --> 03:32:02,280
This is basically what are we doing?

3957
03:32:02,280 --> 03:32:04,240
We are taking a memory, right?

3958
03:32:04,240 --> 03:32:06,440
We are taking the memory from Java. Right?

3959
03:32:06,440 --> 03:32:09,760
And that's where we storing our values.

3960
03:32:09,760 --> 03:32:10,960
So byte. Right.

3961
03:32:10,960 --> 03:32:12,520
The next

3962
03:32:13,440 --> 03:32:16,360
thing, one moment,
this would be representing

3963
03:32:17,760 --> 03:32:18,720
storing

3964
03:32:19,320 --> 03:32:21,720
all numbers, right?

3965
03:32:21,960 --> 03:32:24,960
I just I just say,
hey what is the whole numbers?

3966
03:32:24,960 --> 03:32:29,040
I'm giving you four different data types
in and we are going to do different guys.

3967
03:32:29,040 --> 03:32:32,040
Let's first type them and then of course,
we look into difference.

3968
03:32:32,240 --> 03:32:34,480
We will see why Java uses so many, right?

3969
03:32:35,240 --> 03:32:37,960
So storing whole numbers,
Java says, I have four different ones.

3970
03:32:38,120 --> 03:32:39,040
Okay, cool.

3971
03:32:39,040 --> 03:32:43,120
So now first one, we have byte, next one
we have short right next one

3972
03:32:43,120 --> 03:32:43,920
we have short.

3973
03:32:43,920 --> 03:32:47,960
I want to store short
type of values inside the variable.

3974
03:32:48,160 --> 03:32:48,520
Okay.

3975
03:32:48,520 --> 03:32:49,520
So now what I need

3976
03:32:49,520 --> 03:32:53,720
I need to given my variable right
lets me name in box for example.

3977
03:32:53,720 --> 03:32:55,200
Right. Box two.

3978
03:32:55,200 --> 03:32:56,920
And it's still a whole number. Right.

3979
03:32:56,920 --> 03:33:00,000
Let me let me put it,
I don't know big one number right now.

3980
03:33:00,000 --> 03:33:03,200
I'll put it, I don't know, 1000.

3981
03:33:03,200 --> 03:33:05,640
Right. 1000. Okay. Right.

3982
03:33:06,480 --> 03:33:09,800
Storing a small number inside the white,
storing a little bit bigger

3983
03:33:09,800 --> 03:33:14,440
number inside a short now
and brother in the family we have integer.

3984
03:33:14,480 --> 03:33:16,280
Right? You have an integer.

3985
03:33:16,280 --> 03:33:20,600
So then I need to specify the name box
three equals.

3986
03:33:20,960 --> 03:33:22,960
And let's take a bigger number.

3987
03:33:22,960 --> 03:33:24,840
Right.
Let's take a bigger number of stores.

3988
03:33:24,840 --> 03:33:27,520
Something like this. Okay. All right.

3989
03:33:28,360 --> 03:33:32,960
And next one in the family,
we have four box four, right?

3990
03:33:33,240 --> 03:33:37,320
And the same thing does because
it's a name, no spacing, no spacing.

3991
03:33:37,560 --> 03:33:39,040
Everything has to be combined.

3992
03:33:39,040 --> 03:33:42,920
I'm combining it now later with my number.

3993
03:33:42,920 --> 03:33:46,080
Right. Okay. Box four, right. Equals

3994
03:33:47,520 --> 03:33:48,080
11 leave.

3995
03:33:48,080 --> 03:33:51,840
Were there then there, there
longer number.

3996
03:33:51,840 --> 03:33:52,520
Okay.

3997
03:33:52,800 --> 03:33:58,200
So now with the help of my byte, short
integer and long,

3998
03:33:58,440 --> 03:34:00,920
what I'm representing, I'm representing

3999
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:03,640
numeric values.

4000
03:34:03,640 --> 03:34:06,960
Write different numeric values.

4001
03:34:06,960 --> 03:34:12,600
So now why G-A-Y gives us
this many variations in here?

4002
03:34:12,600 --> 03:34:16,680
And what is the difference
between white short integer and low?

4003
03:34:16,840 --> 03:34:21,920
Okay, so different is a body sizing
by the size of gift.

4004
03:34:22,200 --> 03:34:24,960
So remember this Java was developed

4005
03:34:24,960 --> 03:34:28,840
in 1995, right, In 1995.

4006
03:34:29,200 --> 03:34:33,600
So remember this back the days 1995,
there was an issue is a memory.

4007
03:34:33,600 --> 03:34:36,520
You guys you guys did
went with Soumaya, right?

4008
03:34:36,520 --> 03:34:39,240
You guys look at that.
We used to have those.

4009
03:34:39,240 --> 03:34:43,080
You see eyes and there was a small
there was really big.

4010
03:34:43,080 --> 03:34:46,160
And then, you know, there was when we used
to have you as beasts

4011
03:34:46,160 --> 03:34:50,200
or now you can have the smallest
you as big that can store big amount of.

4012
03:34:50,200 --> 03:34:50,800
Right.

4013
03:34:50,880 --> 03:34:55,760
So the same thing in the computers
right before the issue was a problem.

4014
03:34:55,920 --> 03:34:57,840
Right. Issue was a problem.

4015
03:34:57,840 --> 03:35:03,320
So before programmers you have to be very,
very careful in terms of what type of

4016
03:35:04,440 --> 03:35:05,720
data type you are using.

4017
03:35:05,720 --> 03:35:06,280
Right.

4018
03:35:06,280 --> 03:35:09,360
So now why is being

4019
03:35:09,360 --> 03:35:12,520
as small as small as data type

4020
03:35:12,840 --> 03:35:16,080
that can represent a whole number?

4021
03:35:16,320 --> 03:35:21,240
This data, the data type
was using one bite of the memory.

4022
03:35:21,240 --> 03:35:22,960
Guess I think one byte.

4023
03:35:22,960 --> 03:35:24,480
Yep. Eight bits, one byte.

4024
03:35:24,480 --> 03:35:26,200
That's what it was using. Okay.

4025
03:35:26,200 --> 03:35:30,720
So then, sure,
it's a little bit bigger data type, right?

4026
03:35:30,960 --> 03:35:34,720
So now you have a bigger box
thinking you have a bigger box.

4027
03:35:35,040 --> 03:35:39,680
So now instead of bigger box,
you can store bigger numbers.

4028
03:35:39,680 --> 03:35:44,520
And then integer was the
and not next one in the family

4029
03:35:44,520 --> 03:35:50,160
and it's bigger box in the long is
the biggest box is a big buzz.

4030
03:35:50,600 --> 03:35:54,120
So now what do we mean in here so now why

4031
03:35:54,320 --> 03:35:58,640
why being a smallest data type
byte is being the smallest

4032
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:04,120
the right type so it can store,
you know, smaller range of numbers.

4033
03:36:04,120 --> 03:36:04,640
Right.

4034
03:36:04,640 --> 03:36:06,320
For example, what is their range?

4035
03:36:06,320 --> 03:36:07,000
Can they still.

4036
03:36:07,000 --> 03:36:08,760
127 number?

4037
03:36:08,760 --> 03:36:11,120
Yes, they can store 127.

4038
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:14,920
But as soon as I'm going to store 128

4039
03:36:15,320 --> 03:36:18,880
you guys,
my program record shows the issue.

4040
03:36:19,200 --> 03:36:21,280
It shows me the issue. Why?

4041
03:36:21,640 --> 03:36:25,120
Because right now, 128 it's

4042
03:36:25,120 --> 03:36:30,120
too big of a value
that you try you place inside a small box.

4043
03:36:31,160 --> 03:36:34,760
So now
Java says, hey, if you have a number

4044
03:36:34,760 --> 03:36:39,480
that is bigger than 127,
please sure, go use short.

4045
03:36:39,760 --> 03:36:40,320
Okay.

4046
03:36:40,440 --> 03:36:45,640
So why has a range inside of wide
you can store range

4047
03:36:46,560 --> 03:36:49,480
of from -128

4048
03:36:50,440 --> 03:36:52,880
feel 127

4049
03:36:52,880 --> 03:36:56,520
from -122 2127.

4050
03:36:56,600 --> 03:36:59,040
Right. Yeah. Wow. Okay.

4051
03:36:59,400 --> 03:37:04,680
If I cannot fit 128 inside of by,
let me go to the next brother Short.

4052
03:37:04,680 --> 03:37:05,360
Right.

4053
03:37:05,360 --> 03:37:08,520
But this is we talk in the lab back
the days right because memory was

4054
03:37:08,520 --> 03:37:10,920
an issue. Memory was very expensive Right.

4055
03:37:11,720 --> 03:37:14,160
So now the next one is a short inside.

4056
03:37:14,160 --> 03:37:15,040
A short?

4057
03:37:15,040 --> 03:37:18,480
I can store any values from

4058
03:37:18,720 --> 03:37:21,960
until I don't remember
which direction you guys want.

4059
03:37:21,960 --> 03:37:24,160
Need to remember this range. Trust me.

4060
03:37:24,160 --> 03:37:27,200
So let me see.

4061
03:37:27,200 --> 03:37:31,920
Is our short stars
show goes all the way from here, right?

4062
03:37:32,320 --> 03:37:35,680
So inside a short you can store

4063
03:37:35,680 --> 03:37:40,560
values from -32,768

4064
03:37:40,920 --> 03:37:44,720
or negative all the way to positive

4065
03:37:44,720 --> 03:37:47,960
30,030 2767.

4066
03:37:47,960 --> 03:37:48,400
Right.

4067
03:37:48,480 --> 03:37:52,400
As soon as your number Right now,
what if you work in these numbers

4068
03:37:52,400 --> 03:37:55,480
right now,
as soon as your number becomes larger.

4069
03:37:55,920 --> 03:37:59,240
Now this box is becoming too small.

4070
03:37:59,880 --> 03:38:05,680
The value that you're trying to store,
32,769 inside this box, it's too much.

4071
03:38:06,000 --> 03:38:07,880
There's not space for it.

4072
03:38:07,880 --> 03:38:09,800
So now that's why Java gives us.

4073
03:38:09,800 --> 03:38:10,560
Okay, you know what?

4074
03:38:10,560 --> 03:38:13,760
If the short is too small for you,
go to the integer.

4075
03:38:13,760 --> 03:38:15,080
Right. Go to the integer.

4076
03:38:15,080 --> 03:38:17,880
So this is goes from to here.

4077
03:38:17,880 --> 03:38:21,840
And one thing is,
do you have to remember this ranges?

4078
03:38:21,840 --> 03:38:23,880
No, you don't have to remember
the ranges. Right.

4079
03:38:24,120 --> 03:38:26,360
So why you don't have
to remember their ranges?

4080
03:38:26,640 --> 03:38:28,920
Because right
now, guys, memory is not an issue.

4081
03:38:28,960 --> 03:38:31,960
Look, we have an iPhone that is coming out
is what

4082
03:38:31,960 --> 03:38:35,640
with one terabyte or 500 megabytes,
something like that.

4083
03:38:35,640 --> 03:38:38,360
Right. So memory is not an issue anymore.

4084
03:38:38,640 --> 03:38:42,120
So, of course,
and we will talk about who is with them,

4085
03:38:42,280 --> 03:38:45,360
what is the most popular data type
that will be used.

4086
03:38:45,360 --> 03:38:49,800
But this is for you guys to know, okay,
This is for you to know.

4087
03:38:50,160 --> 03:38:51,800
So now integer, right?

4088
03:38:51,800 --> 03:38:56,200
Hey, if you have a value that is bigger
than this, go to the next brother

4089
03:38:57,720 --> 03:38:58,760
integer.

4090
03:38:58,760 --> 03:39:01,840
So integer will be the one
that is most popular.

4091
03:39:01,840 --> 03:39:04,560
This one's popular

4092
03:39:04,720 --> 03:39:06,240
and data type

4093
03:39:08,120 --> 03:39:09,440
to use

4094
03:39:09,720 --> 03:39:11,840
or all numbers and

4095
03:39:13,360 --> 03:39:15,480
keeping can be useful when you're sick.

4096
03:39:15,880 --> 03:39:18,800
But then we're also going to do something
called long, right?

4097
03:39:18,840 --> 03:39:22,120
Remember guys,
our numbers can be long for example right

4098
03:39:22,440 --> 03:39:25,000
think our guys your

4099
03:39:25,440 --> 03:39:27,600
our phone numbers right ten digit

4100
03:39:28,360 --> 03:39:31,160
it's a very low number or for example

4101
03:39:31,160 --> 03:39:35,960
when think of all
the financial applications this whenever

4102
03:39:36,240 --> 03:39:40,680
if some of you have a mortgage
some of you have a loans right or

4103
03:39:42,360 --> 03:39:44,000
whenever you get in your mortgage. Right.

4104
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:47,920
It gives you a long transaction
ID, right one, two, three, four, five,

4105
03:39:47,920 --> 03:39:48,840
whatever, whatever.

4106
03:39:48,840 --> 03:39:52,880
So now to store these
those big of a numbers down,

4107
03:39:52,880 --> 03:39:55,960
which is, hey,
whenever you have a very big numbers

4108
03:39:56,040 --> 03:39:59,240
they want be able to fit inside integer
where you can store them

4109
03:39:59,440 --> 03:40:02,400
you can store them inside the loan
account numbers right there.

4110
03:40:02,400 --> 03:40:04,800
Right transaction that is account numbers.

4111
03:40:05,560 --> 03:40:08,080
So there's a lot of a lot of numbers,

4112
03:40:08,080 --> 03:40:11,120
guys, that you can store
and use inside the loan.

4113
03:40:11,160 --> 03:40:13,400
Okay. Social Security right there, Right.

4114
03:40:13,400 --> 03:40:13,760
How many?

4115
03:40:13,760 --> 03:40:17,440
Not nine in there, right.

4116
03:40:17,440 --> 03:40:19,000
Can you use loan every way?

4117
03:40:19,000 --> 03:40:20,720
Yes, You can use long everywhere.

4118
03:40:20,720 --> 03:40:23,680
But remember, the loan is memory.

4119
03:40:23,680 --> 03:40:28,520
It's not that you should,
but along is taking the more space right

4120
03:40:28,560 --> 03:40:32,960
is still taking the more space
and sometimes what do you guys

4121
03:40:34,720 --> 03:40:37,200
what do you get minute whenever
maybe you are typing right.

4122
03:40:37,640 --> 03:40:39,800
If your number becomes too long Right.

4123
03:40:39,800 --> 03:40:43,360
A still not too big
if your numbers becomes too long.

4124
03:40:43,360 --> 03:40:43,560
Right.

4125
03:40:43,560 --> 03:40:46,200
For example,
this is your transaction, I think,

4126
03:40:47,360 --> 03:40:49,440
and you will get a little error, right?

4127
03:40:49,480 --> 03:40:50,640
You will get an error.

4128
03:40:50,640 --> 03:40:53,480
So sometimes if you want to specify

4129
03:40:53,480 --> 03:40:57,600
that you're
if program will give you this error,

4130
03:40:57,840 --> 03:41:01,680
you want to specify that you use
in the long number.

4131
03:41:01,800 --> 03:41:05,760
What we will have to and
we will have to add in the error letter.

4132
03:41:05,760 --> 03:41:08,800
L Okay, it can be a small L

4133
03:41:09,680 --> 03:41:13,200
or it can be a big L can be a little.

4134
03:41:13,280 --> 03:41:16,040
Maybe this going to be

4135
03:41:18,840 --> 03:41:19,800
light ways

4136
03:41:19,800 --> 03:41:24,200
of looking with you change this, right?

4137
03:41:25,560 --> 03:41:26,040
So they

4138
03:41:27,880 --> 03:41:28,400
ready.

4139
03:41:28,400 --> 03:41:29,040
Right.

4140
03:41:29,160 --> 03:41:31,920
So a small L or big L?

4141
03:41:32,120 --> 03:41:32,640
Okay.

4142
03:41:33,400 --> 03:41:35,640
Make out what your full name integer.

4143
03:41:35,640 --> 03:41:38,520
Yes. It's this one digit $0.90 for integer

4144
03:41:40,680 --> 03:41:44,640
again
to represent whole numbers in our program.

4145
03:41:44,640 --> 03:41:48,120
And right
Java gives us four different data charges

4146
03:41:48,120 --> 03:41:52,560
that can represent a long number
by short integer loop.

4147
03:41:52,680 --> 03:41:54,200
What is the difference between them?

4148
03:41:54,200 --> 03:41:59,480
Difference between them is in size in
how much size they are.

4149
03:41:59,480 --> 03:42:02,080
Quite in your memory, in your room.

4150
03:42:02,120 --> 03:42:02,840
Right.

4151
03:42:03,720 --> 03:42:07,400
And since the memory
is not the issue anymore, this days

4152
03:42:07,920 --> 03:42:11,280
what's popular,
we just use an integer okay, I don't know.

4153
03:42:11,280 --> 03:42:14,560
Maybe I'm working on
the let's say I'll be able

4154
03:42:14,560 --> 03:42:16,600
and then I'm working on the Friday
Mac right.

4155
03:42:16,800 --> 03:42:19,920
I don't want to think about
hey maybe my long will be

4156
03:42:20,400 --> 03:42:23,640
20,000
or maybe my mortgage will be 5 million.

4157
03:42:23,640 --> 03:42:25,760
Write that.
I know how the calculation, right?

4158
03:42:25,960 --> 03:42:28,720
I know this in the future.
You know what? Instead of

4159
03:42:29,920 --> 03:42:30,320
there

4160
03:42:30,480 --> 03:42:34,040
guessing what a should I use BART
or by byte or integer,

4161
03:42:34,160 --> 03:42:38,200
we just want to use integer
in out of this entire family.

4162
03:42:38,200 --> 03:42:42,720
Guys, short is the less less
popular family member.

4163
03:42:42,760 --> 03:42:44,640
Okay. What do you mean by this?

4164
03:42:44,640 --> 03:42:46,560
These guys mostly people don't use byte.

4165
03:42:46,560 --> 03:42:49,680
In short,
the most one we will be using most

4166
03:42:49,680 --> 03:42:53,080
when we will be using integers
and lots case

4167
03:42:55,760 --> 03:42:56,640
to one

4168
03:42:56,640 --> 03:43:04,080
moment.

4169
03:43:04,080 --> 03:43:06,240
Okay. Those are not the errors. Those are

4170
03:43:07,800 --> 03:43:08,960
those are warnings.

4171
03:43:08,960 --> 03:43:10,560
Then we will talk about warnings.

4172
03:43:10,560 --> 03:43:11,120
Okay.

4173
03:43:11,320 --> 03:43:13,320
So now let's look at all data types first.

4174
03:43:13,320 --> 03:43:13,960
Okay.

4175
03:43:14,400 --> 03:43:19,560
Now what I want to store,
I want you store representing right.

4176
03:43:19,560 --> 03:43:23,280
I will see representing where
we're thinking

4177
03:43:23,280 --> 03:43:27,680
and storing.

4178
03:43:27,680 --> 03:43:34,720
And here
we will be representing and storing type

4179
03:43:37,440 --> 03:43:39,720
of. And now I

4180
03:43:39,960 --> 03:43:42,920
think, you know what,
you have to work with decimals, right?

4181
03:43:42,920 --> 03:43:46,200
If you have to work with decimals,
I'll give you two data types, Right.

4182
03:43:46,200 --> 03:43:47,480
I'll give you two data types.

4183
03:43:47,480 --> 03:43:49,640
I give you what?

4184
03:43:49,640 --> 03:43:51,840
And I'll give you double, right?

4185
03:43:52,120 --> 03:43:53,040
Okay, Sure.

4186
03:43:53,040 --> 03:43:54,600
So what kind of values?

4187
03:43:54,600 --> 03:43:56,880
Decimals, Right. 199 Right.

4188
03:43:57,160 --> 03:44:02,520
So now I have the value 199
I would like to store it.

4189
03:44:02,520 --> 03:44:04,480
I cannot just leave it like that.
What I'm doing,

4190
03:44:04,480 --> 03:44:08,600
I'm storing How do we store the values
using the equals sign?

4191
03:44:08,600 --> 03:44:11,200
So now where am I storing it?

4192
03:44:11,200 --> 03:44:13,600
I need to store it inside the box. Right?

4193
03:44:13,960 --> 03:44:18,600
Whenever I'm using the box,
I have to give a name right.

4194
03:44:18,600 --> 03:44:19,440
And again, the end.

4195
03:44:19,440 --> 03:44:22,320
You mean good again? Any name?

4196
03:44:22,320 --> 03:44:24,480
Why are we using L at the end?

4197
03:44:24,480 --> 03:44:26,800
This? We have to. We have to

4198
03:44:28,600 --> 03:44:32,120
specify that this number is a long number.

4199
03:44:32,120 --> 03:44:35,880
This once we learn a little bit
about the costing guys.

4200
03:44:35,880 --> 03:44:36,200
Okay.

4201
03:44:36,200 --> 03:44:37,360
Once we learn them a little bit

4202
03:44:37,360 --> 03:44:40,720
by on in the few clauses,
then that will explain key

4203
03:44:41,080 --> 03:44:44,360
because by default
Java treats it as an integer.

4204
03:44:44,600 --> 03:44:48,880
And we we want to specify
that I'm using the low number.

4205
03:44:49,040 --> 03:44:53,040
Okay so that's why we specify them now

4206
03:44:53,040 --> 03:44:58,200
representing represent in decimal numbers
right here my decimal value.

4207
03:44:58,600 --> 03:45:02,800
Now what I'm doing,
I am storing it, I'm storing it right.

4208
03:45:03,040 --> 03:45:04,680
So now what? I would like to store it.

4209
03:45:04,680 --> 03:45:09,240
I want to store it inside the box right
and I can name it whatever I want.

4210
03:45:09,560 --> 03:45:09,760
Right?

4211
03:45:09,760 --> 03:45:10,960
I get them in whatever I want.

4212
03:45:10,960 --> 03:45:13,200
So how do you want to name your baskets?

4213
03:45:13,800 --> 03:45:16,760
It can be anything. It can be ABC, it can

4214
03:45:18,000 --> 03:45:21,080
whatever name you want to give

4215
03:45:23,400 --> 03:45:24,680
a. Okay, fine.

4216
03:45:24,680 --> 03:45:25,040
We'll do it.

4217
03:45:25,040 --> 03:45:26,320
We will do it right.

4218
03:45:26,320 --> 03:45:31,320
We'll do it right now, just do compliance,
compliance and jealousies.

4219
03:45:31,320 --> 03:45:32,400
Hey, you know what?

4220
03:45:32,400 --> 03:45:36,240
Whenever you want to use the box,
you will never.

4221
03:45:36,240 --> 03:45:37,560
You want to use the box.

4222
03:45:37,560 --> 03:45:39,320
Now I say you have to tell me.

4223
03:45:39,320 --> 03:45:41,400
What are you planning to store? Okay.

4224
03:45:41,400 --> 03:45:42,600
What are you planning to store?

4225
03:45:42,600 --> 03:45:45,280
I'm planning to store a decimal. Those.

4226
03:45:45,600 --> 03:45:47,880
Now you can represent your decimal values.

4227
03:45:48,120 --> 03:45:50,920
We have loads

4228
03:45:50,920 --> 03:45:53,240
on. We'll use double.

4229
03:45:53,240 --> 03:45:56,320
So now whenever you specify a float.

4230
03:45:56,320 --> 03:45:58,360
Right. And you're trying to store

4231
03:46:00,040 --> 03:46:01,520
this symbol value

4232
03:46:01,520 --> 03:46:03,800
program
also will give you an error, right?

4233
03:46:04,480 --> 03:46:06,320
Or also will give you an error.

4234
03:46:06,320 --> 03:46:10,440
So now what we have to do,
we have to specify

4235
03:46:10,760 --> 03:46:15,040
that I'm using a float to the
that I'm using a float.

4236
03:46:15,040 --> 03:46:16,000
I have to add

4237
03:46:16,960 --> 03:46:19,720
f and then lowercase f or uppercase.

4238
03:46:19,960 --> 03:46:24,360
Oops, uppercase x exact
the same thing as we use in with the log.

4239
03:46:24,360 --> 03:46:24,960
Right.

4240
03:46:24,960 --> 03:46:28,600
It can be a lower l
or it can be a big out.

4241
03:46:28,920 --> 03:46:32,720
You specify that this number is
a log here.

4242
03:46:32,720 --> 03:46:35,840
You specify that my number is a float.

4243
03:46:36,840 --> 03:46:39,320
So now let's do another one for example.

4244
03:46:39,320 --> 03:46:41,760
Now I have don't know,

4245
03:46:41,760 --> 03:46:43,160
1999, right?

4246
03:46:43,160 --> 03:46:45,000
1999,

4247
03:46:46,240 --> 03:46:48,000
1999 value.

4248
03:46:48,000 --> 03:46:50,400
I want to represent.

4249
03:46:50,400 --> 03:46:52,880
So now there's 19, 19, 1999.

4250
03:46:52,880 --> 03:46:55,720
Well, I want to store inside a box.
I don't want to name one box.

4251
03:46:55,720 --> 03:46:56,760
I want to name the boxes.

4252
03:46:56,760 --> 03:46:59,480
And now I complains jealousies.

4253
03:46:59,480 --> 03:47:02,640
Okay I see that you want the box.

4254
03:47:02,640 --> 03:47:04,080
You want a variable.

4255
03:47:04,080 --> 03:47:06,240
I see that you want to store the value.

4256
03:47:06,800 --> 03:47:08,080
But I'm very strict.

4257
03:47:08,080 --> 03:47:10,360
You got to tell me ahead.

4258
03:47:10,520 --> 03:47:13,120
What are you planning to
story? I'm planning to store.

4259
03:47:14,360 --> 03:47:16,600
I'm planning to store this.

4260
03:47:16,600 --> 03:47:17,280
Okay.

4261
03:47:17,280 --> 03:47:21,000
And this fabric value can be represented
in the form of float

4262
03:47:21,320 --> 03:47:24,120
or double in the form of split for double.

4263
03:47:25,200 --> 03:47:27,680
I want to please
make sure you use lower D, okay.

4264
03:47:27,680 --> 03:47:29,200
There's no upward load.

4265
03:47:29,200 --> 03:47:33,120
You okay?

4266
03:47:33,360 --> 03:47:36,240
So two family members in here.

4267
03:47:36,320 --> 03:47:40,000
Two family members
that can store decimal numbers.

4268
03:47:40,000 --> 03:47:42,720
Okay, so now

4269
03:47:42,720 --> 03:47:44,680
the difference, okay,

4270
03:47:44,680 --> 03:47:48,000
the difference between slow and a double.

4271
03:47:48,680 --> 03:47:52,160
It's ability to hold

4272
03:47:53,320 --> 03:47:55,840
those floating
points, those decimal points.

4273
03:47:56,440 --> 03:48:00,680
So when we talk about slot float is able

4274
03:48:01,720 --> 03:48:04,920
or is able to hold up to

4275
03:48:06,080 --> 03:48:09,160
up to 5 to 6 decimal places.

4276
03:48:09,160 --> 03:48:10,000
Right.

4277
03:48:10,040 --> 03:48:14,120
And when we talk about double
double is a bigger

4278
03:48:14,120 --> 03:48:19,680
okay, double is a bigger box
that can hold about 14 to 15 of

4279
03:48:20,880 --> 03:48:21,480
decimals.

4280
03:48:21,480 --> 03:48:22,080
Okay.

4281
03:48:22,080 --> 03:48:26,280
So these I will be able to show you guys
tomorrow from now.

4282
03:48:26,400 --> 03:48:29,400
From now, you won't be able to

4283
03:48:29,400 --> 03:48:33,240
to see but especially whenever we guys
will be doing the division

4284
03:48:33,480 --> 03:48:37,680
you guys will see the difference when we
go into store result inside the float

4285
03:48:37,960 --> 03:48:41,520
or when we want to start the value
inside the double.

4286
03:48:41,640 --> 03:48:42,160
Okay,

4287
03:48:43,120 --> 03:48:45,600
Now that will know that will is

4288
03:48:45,600 --> 03:48:49,360
the out of here does
double will be the most popular data type.

4289
03:48:49,680 --> 03:48:54,320
Okay let's

4290
03:48:56,480 --> 03:48:57,840
put in double.

4291
03:48:57,840 --> 03:49:02,280
Yeah you don't need to specify
this is by default of it by default.

4292
03:49:02,280 --> 03:49:05,600
Any time you use decimals java treats
it as a double

4293
03:49:06,000 --> 03:49:10,200
by default when you use in number
java treated as an integer.

4294
03:49:10,280 --> 03:49:10,480
Okay.

4295
03:49:10,480 --> 03:49:13,480
But some processes
that are happening inside which we will

4296
03:49:14,560 --> 03:49:17,400
in the later things now

4297
03:49:18,320 --> 03:49:21,360
we will work with the numeric values.

4298
03:49:21,360 --> 03:49:27,240
So now what we would like to do
I want you represent and store

4299
03:49:28,600 --> 03:49:30,360
single characters

4300
03:49:33,800 --> 03:49:36,120
who can who, who, who hasn't?

4301
03:49:36,360 --> 03:49:38,640
Who can I represent
the single characters? This

4302
03:49:41,760 --> 03:49:42,520
but that will you do

4303
03:49:42,520 --> 03:49:46,200
needed by default any time you we
we use a dash

4304
03:49:46,280 --> 03:49:50,000
a number of decimals by default
Java treats it as a double value.

4305
03:49:51,720 --> 03:49:53,600
And here we have char all lowercase.

4306
03:49:53,600 --> 03:49:56,760
Remember they have to be like char
and that same thing.

4307
03:49:56,760 --> 03:50:00,520
Hey, this is the data type
I'm planning to store.

4308
03:50:00,520 --> 03:50:02,840
Right?
Okay. Where are you planning to store?

4309
03:50:03,080 --> 03:50:04,760
Tell me the name of your container.

4310
03:50:04,760 --> 03:50:06,360
Tell me the name of your box.

4311
03:50:06,360 --> 03:50:08,360
Tell me the name of your variable.

4312
03:50:08,360 --> 03:50:10,160
Okay. I can name it whatever I want.

4313
03:50:10,160 --> 03:50:14,560
I can just make a variable right?

4314
03:50:14,560 --> 03:50:16,720
Or I can give a name, right. The

4315
03:50:18,000 --> 03:50:21,360
let's say I'm in one letter, right?

4316
03:50:21,360 --> 03:50:23,400
That's going one letter.

4317
03:50:24,400 --> 03:50:25,520
So one letter,

4318
03:50:25,520 --> 03:50:30,000
let's say, I don't know, hashtag right now
want to store has to echo

4319
03:50:30,320 --> 03:50:36,480
to represent as all
let me see all name of character right.

4320
03:50:36,480 --> 03:50:41,840
Or I can have let's say char
and let me name it later.

4321
03:50:42,040 --> 03:50:42,720
Right.

4322
03:50:43,240 --> 03:50:47,360
I can store whatever singular I want.

4323
03:50:47,360 --> 03:50:50,040
For example, this is an example.

4324
03:50:50,040 --> 03:50:52,760
And to make them get

4325
03:50:53,320 --> 03:50:55,840
to represent a single character,
whether it's a

4326
03:50:57,000 --> 03:50:59,640
one alpha character,

4327
03:50:59,640 --> 03:51:02,160
whether it's one special character,

4328
03:51:02,160 --> 03:51:05,160
it's hash tag in here.

4329
03:51:05,400 --> 03:51:08,440
Let's you we are all getting warnings
and I'll go over those.

4330
03:51:09,000 --> 03:51:09,400
Okay.

4331
03:51:09,880 --> 03:51:14,040
So now one thing, this Java is very,
very strict.

4332
03:51:14,040 --> 03:51:16,480
Right. Whenever we are trying,

4333
03:51:17,680 --> 03:51:20,280
whenever we trying to

4334
03:51:20,280 --> 03:51:22,800
use the variables right in here,

4335
03:51:22,800 --> 03:51:27,760
our Java is asking hey,
what would you like to store right here?

4336
03:51:27,840 --> 03:51:29,400
What would you like to store?

4337
03:51:29,400 --> 03:51:33,880
I want to store a single character
in what we do in a store.

4338
03:51:33,880 --> 03:51:35,920
In a single character right here.

4339
03:51:35,960 --> 03:51:37,280
What I would like to store.

4340
03:51:37,280 --> 03:51:39,600
I would like to store decimals. Right.

4341
03:51:39,840 --> 03:51:42,800
So Java looks okay
they're planning to store.

4342
03:51:42,800 --> 03:51:44,360
Who represent the decimals?

4343
03:51:44,360 --> 03:51:46,160
My double, my double.

4344
03:51:46,160 --> 03:51:49,800
Okay, so what they need
they took a container right?

4345
03:51:49,800 --> 03:51:53,480
This is what happens based
I took a container B

4346
03:51:53,640 --> 03:51:56,720
right
this is that you could contain in by box.

4347
03:51:57,000 --> 03:51:58,600
What is the name I have given?

4348
03:51:58,600 --> 03:52:01,200
I have the name given the name B.

4349
03:52:01,200 --> 03:52:05,520
Now what I did,
I took the value 1999, right.

4350
03:52:05,520 --> 03:52:08,840
1999 and place it inside

4351
03:52:09,120 --> 03:52:12,000
right now in 1999.

4352
03:52:12,000 --> 03:52:15,120
It's a value that lets it decimals.

4353
03:52:15,120 --> 03:52:15,840
Right?

4354
03:52:15,880 --> 03:52:18,520
So now who can represent the decimals?

4355
03:52:18,600 --> 03:52:22,920
I said, hey, I want to use double right
because it's a double whammy

4356
03:52:23,160 --> 03:52:28,640
temple type of right, double right.

4357
03:52:31,080 --> 03:52:34,200
And as I mentioned, Java is very strict

4358
03:52:34,720 --> 03:52:37,680
now you said to Java, hey,

4359
03:52:37,920 --> 03:52:41,520
inside this box,
be right inside the box B,

4360
03:52:41,680 --> 03:52:44,440
I'm going to store double type of values.

4361
03:52:44,720 --> 03:52:47,440
Then you to make sure.

4362
03:52:47,440 --> 03:52:51,040
Then you have to make sure that you
storing only double type of values.

4363
03:52:51,840 --> 03:52:53,440
If I'm going to

4364
03:52:53,800 --> 03:52:55,280
actually be

4365
03:52:56,320 --> 03:52:58,160
you going to store different type, right?

4366
03:52:58,160 --> 03:53:03,200
For example, let's say let's think in here
what are the numbers 1000 right

4367
03:53:03,600 --> 03:53:09,520
now if inside I want just the 1099 now,
it will complete.

4368
03:53:09,880 --> 03:53:12,240
Okay. Java will complete. Why?

4369
03:53:12,560 --> 03:53:16,280
Because 199, it's not a whole number one.

4370
03:53:16,280 --> 03:53:19,120
99 is not a whole number 199.

4371
03:53:19,120 --> 03:53:21,840
It's a number that has decimals. Right.

4372
03:53:22,120 --> 03:53:27,520
So now Java says, hey, you told me
you're planning to store integer values.

4373
03:53:27,880 --> 03:53:31,080
Why didn't you spawn
a double type of values?

4374
03:53:31,320 --> 03:53:33,600
Don't trick me, right? Don't trick me.

4375
03:53:33,800 --> 03:53:36,280
If you told me you want to store integer,

4376
03:53:36,600 --> 03:53:39,600
please
make sure you have only integers in here.

4377
03:53:39,880 --> 03:53:43,000
Okay.

4378
03:53:43,000 --> 03:53:45,520
All right. In our last one.

4379
03:53:45,840 --> 03:53:48,360
Last one to represent and store.

4380
03:53:48,360 --> 03:53:50,440
Right to represent and store

4381
03:53:52,640 --> 03:53:55,360
storing ruling values.

4382
03:53:55,920 --> 03:53:57,440
What do you mean by rule?

4383
03:53:57,440 --> 03:54:01,040
We talk about yes or no, right?

4384
03:54:01,200 --> 03:54:03,440
For example,
when we talk about characters,

4385
03:54:05,280 --> 03:54:07,080
What, 1999.

4386
03:54:07,080 --> 03:54:08,000
Yeah. Here. One thing.

4387
03:54:08,000 --> 03:54:11,800
Then you know who can represent one 1090
Java says, Hey,

4388
03:54:11,800 --> 03:54:14,080
if you want to work
with the value in 1999,

4389
03:54:14,080 --> 03:54:17,760
make sure you store it inside a double
or you in inside a float.

4390
03:54:18,320 --> 03:54:19,560
Okay? Okay.

4391
03:54:19,560 --> 03:54:21,480
I want to work with the whole numbers.
Okay.

4392
03:54:21,480 --> 03:54:22,040
Whole numbers.

4393
03:54:22,040 --> 03:54:23,600
I give you a variety.

4394
03:54:23,600 --> 03:54:25,640
Go use either my buy will use it.

4395
03:54:25,640 --> 03:54:27,200
The my shorter will use it.

4396
03:54:27,200 --> 03:54:28,800
They're my interior or my low

4397
03:54:28,800 --> 03:54:32,400
right and majority of the time
we will be using our integer.

4398
03:54:32,600 --> 03:54:34,960
Okay.

4399
03:54:34,960 --> 03:54:37,080
Of course this does not have to be.

4400
03:54:37,080 --> 03:54:38,600
It can be more decimals. Right?

4401
03:54:38,600 --> 03:54:41,240
This is just me
typing in an example of the.

4402
03:54:41,600 --> 03:54:42,600
It can be anyone.

4403
03:54:42,600 --> 03:54:44,760
Yeah, it can be any number of

4404
03:54:50,040 --> 03:54:50,520
you want to.

4405
03:54:50,520 --> 03:54:55,600
You want to write B no do it will give
you either give the error D No, no, no.

4406
03:54:55,600 --> 03:54:58,920
This for for you works,
but you don't really need it.

4407
03:54:59,080 --> 03:55:00,400
You don't need it

4408
03:55:01,200 --> 03:55:04,120
then are needed because by default
Java knows

4409
03:55:04,160 --> 03:55:06,960
anytime you type A you type a decimal.

4410
03:55:07,200 --> 03:55:10,840
Java knows that using and double
this process will be more clear.

4411
03:55:10,880 --> 03:55:14,440
Guys, once we talk about the casting game,
once we talk about custom

4412
03:55:15,960 --> 03:55:17,880
items that represented

4413
03:55:17,880 --> 03:55:24,280
a Boolean values once
represent in the bowling values right?

4414
03:55:24,280 --> 03:55:29,040
Look, it's
it's either capital F or lower F, okay?

4415
03:55:29,440 --> 03:55:31,320
It does not matter.

4416
03:55:31,320 --> 03:55:32,400
Same thing is in here.

4417
03:55:32,400 --> 03:55:34,960
If you want to enforce, right.

4418
03:55:34,960 --> 03:55:39,360
If you want, you specify in your program
and hey, I'm using the big number.

4419
03:55:39,360 --> 03:55:42,040
It's not an integer
and I'm I'm using the big number. Right.

4420
03:55:42,240 --> 03:55:44,880
You have to add either capital L

4421
03:55:45,160 --> 03:55:48,600
or small L at the end.

4422
03:55:48,600 --> 03:55:53,160
Then thing in here, if you're not going
to ask, your Java program will comply.

4423
03:55:53,320 --> 03:55:55,120
Okay, you have to specify.

4424
03:55:55,120 --> 03:55:59,040
Hey, 199 I want to represent as a one

4425
03:55:59,280 --> 03:56:03,640
that we spoke about, No one.

4426
03:56:03,640 --> 03:56:05,240
You really think like this, right?

4427
03:56:05,240 --> 03:56:08,520
How many decimal values we can have?

4428
03:56:08,600 --> 03:56:09,960
It can be many, right?

4429
03:56:09,960 --> 03:56:10,680
It can be many.

4430
03:56:10,680 --> 03:56:13,800
I can have 199, one 9197, 100.

4431
03:56:13,800 --> 03:56:14,320
Right there is.

4432
03:56:14,320 --> 03:56:20,080
It can be a numbers of values
that can be stored inside a float

4433
03:56:20,320 --> 03:56:24,400
or can be stored inside a double
the same thing with the characters here.

4434
03:56:24,400 --> 03:56:26,160
Of course, we have the end, right?

4435
03:56:26,160 --> 03:56:31,080
It can be all characters from eight
through Z, uppercase, lowercase,

4436
03:56:31,080 --> 03:56:33,920
all the special characters, right,
But still a lot.

4437
03:56:34,480 --> 03:56:39,640
Now, when we talk about the Boolean
guys, Boolean has only two values.

4438
03:56:39,880 --> 03:56:42,000
One has only two values.

4439
03:56:42,000 --> 03:56:44,160
It has a value. True.

4440
03:56:44,160 --> 03:56:46,880
And it has a values. So that's it.

4441
03:56:47,280 --> 03:56:50,120
Nothing else
you can store inside a bully, right?

4442
03:56:50,120 --> 03:56:51,080
Let me limit bullying.

4443
03:56:51,080 --> 03:56:53,760
Bu equals you can store to

4444
03:56:54,920 --> 03:56:57,760
all of the boolean

4445
03:56:57,760 --> 03:57:02,160
one equals two false at the else.

4446
03:57:02,160 --> 03:57:06,400
There's no other values
that boolean can have, right?

4447
03:57:06,760 --> 03:57:09,480
Hey, are you hungry? Yes. Right.

4448
03:57:09,480 --> 03:57:14,240
What we will say or let's say
let say not let's say hungry.

4449
03:57:14,280 --> 03:57:15,080
Right?

4450
03:57:15,240 --> 03:57:16,480
I am hungry. Right.

4451
03:57:16,480 --> 03:57:17,400
I'm hungry.

4452
03:57:17,400 --> 03:57:21,080
Bull in spirit.

4453
03:57:21,080 --> 03:57:22,840
No, I'm not. Right.

4454
03:57:22,840 --> 03:57:25,720
So simply here,
when we say we are saying yes

4455
03:57:26,080 --> 03:57:28,840
or we stay right,

4456
03:57:28,840 --> 03:57:31,680
go, I don't have an option for me

4457
03:57:31,680 --> 03:57:35,600
saying the difference between the fluid
and the double.

4458
03:57:36,000 --> 03:57:42,440
It's so first of all, float
is a smaller data type to a double gate.

4459
03:57:42,440 --> 03:57:44,680
It's a smaller data
type compared to a double.

4460
03:57:45,040 --> 03:57:48,680
So now double can store the numbers

4461
03:57:48,920 --> 03:57:53,480
that go up to 1516 decimal

4462
03:57:54,600 --> 03:57:57,120
where the float can store,

4463
03:57:57,120 --> 03:58:00,240
can can store and represent the accuracy

4464
03:58:00,720 --> 03:58:04,200
only of values up to six and seven.

4465
03:58:04,360 --> 03:58:06,760
Okay. Up to six and seven decimals

4466
03:58:07,960 --> 03:58:09,120
as a different good.

4467
03:58:09,120 --> 03:58:10,440
This is a smaller data type.

4468
03:58:10,440 --> 03:58:14,640
This is the bigger
this can store more decimal point.

4469
03:58:14,640 --> 03:58:16,840
This can store two

4470
03:58:32,320 --> 03:58:37,960
or three points in the same thing as Java.

4471
03:58:37,960 --> 03:58:39,840
Very, very

4472
03:58:41,160 --> 03:58:43,680
minimal variables,

4473
03:58:43,680 --> 03:58:44,640
key sensitive.

4474
03:58:44,640 --> 03:58:47,280
So what will be important
is what will be important. Right?

4475
03:58:47,280 --> 03:58:50,760
If your have a box,
if you're going to write

4476
03:58:50,760 --> 03:58:54,320
something on the box
when you ask someone, right.

4477
03:58:54,320 --> 03:58:59,760
So let's say would you send your son
Hasan, Can you find the box right now

4478
03:58:59,760 --> 03:59:04,320
if you are going misspell something
or for example, if you're going to write

4479
03:59:04,320 --> 03:59:08,800
uppercase in lowercase, right,
maybe you are not able to find it.

4480
03:59:08,800 --> 03:59:11,720
So here's the
what do we mean by Q Sensitive.

4481
03:59:11,960 --> 03:59:15,760
Now, when we saw some value,
what do we will be doing us?

4482
03:59:15,760 --> 03:59:17,760
We will be accessing that value.

4483
03:59:18,120 --> 03:59:21,400
And whenever want to access that value,
we have to make sure

4484
03:59:21,400 --> 03:59:25,080
we typed exact the same box name, key

4485
03:59:26,320 --> 03:59:27,440
and maximum.

4486
03:59:27,440 --> 03:59:29,800
But once one let me summarize again.

4487
03:59:29,840 --> 03:59:33,960
Okay, let me summarize is
so whenever we work with different

4488
03:59:35,040 --> 03:59:37,440
information,
write in different data, right?

4489
03:59:37,920 --> 03:59:42,960
Whenever we develop in our program, right,
whenever we develop any software.

4490
03:59:42,960 --> 03:59:48,000
So there's a different data that we have
to work with to, work with different data.

4491
03:59:48,240 --> 03:59:51,440
Java exist, different beta types, right?

4492
03:59:51,880 --> 03:59:55,800
So whole numbers gives this four
or now four

4493
03:59:55,800 --> 04:00:00,080
decimals, it gives this two to represent
the one single character.

4494
04:00:00,080 --> 04:00:03,360
It gives us one chart
and you represent yes

4495
04:00:03,360 --> 04:00:06,440
or no values use as a bowling right.

4496
04:00:06,440 --> 04:00:09,600
So now to work with those values,

4497
04:00:09,600 --> 04:00:12,840
they have to be stored
inside the variables, right?

4498
04:00:13,200 --> 04:00:16,280
So our variables are contained or

4499
04:00:16,800 --> 04:00:21,280
our variables are boxes
that temporarily hold this value.

4500
04:00:21,280 --> 04:00:23,640
Right? The temperature right now
put the water in my glass.

4501
04:00:23,640 --> 04:00:25,040
No, I have a water. Right.

4502
04:00:25,040 --> 04:00:27,640
They have this container holds my water.

4503
04:00:27,760 --> 04:00:31,080
Okay, so now that was very strict Java.

4504
04:00:31,080 --> 04:00:35,840
Say, hey, if you told me that
you planning to store bowling

4505
04:00:36,800 --> 04:00:39,040
inside this box now, when

4506
04:00:39,040 --> 04:00:43,080
you going to try to store a numeric value,
you will complain, right?

4507
04:00:43,320 --> 04:00:48,000
It's for example, if I have a plastic cup
right where I'm going to add the water

4508
04:00:48,360 --> 04:00:52,760
next time I decide to pour a coffee,
I'm not going to work.

4509
04:00:52,760 --> 04:00:53,080
Right.

4510
04:00:53,080 --> 04:00:58,400
So the same thing in here, Java says, Hey,
don't trick me, don't add anything.

4511
04:00:58,520 --> 04:01:02,480
If you told me you want to store bowling,
make sure you have only bowling.

4512
04:01:02,800 --> 04:01:06,080
Otherwise,
all your program is going to have that.

4513
04:01:06,520 --> 04:01:06,920
Okay.

4514
04:01:06,920 --> 04:01:10,360
Very, very strict.

4515
04:01:10,360 --> 04:01:10,920
Okay.

4516
04:01:11,960 --> 04:01:12,720
All right.

4517
04:01:12,720 --> 04:01:18,680
So now why are we getting
all these warnings in here?

4518
04:01:18,840 --> 04:01:20,840
Why are getting this warnings in here?

4519
04:01:20,960 --> 04:01:21,480
Right.

4520
04:01:22,440 --> 04:01:24,480
I don't think this

4521
04:01:26,280 --> 04:01:28,520
the purpose of storing this.

4522
04:01:28,520 --> 04:01:28,880
Okay.

4523
04:01:28,880 --> 04:01:32,240
So the purpose of taking the value

4524
04:01:32,920 --> 04:01:35,920
and store it inside the variable.

4525
04:01:35,920 --> 04:01:40,120
So later what we can do,
we can use those values, right?

4526
04:01:40,360 --> 04:01:43,880
If I'm going to pour a cup of coffee
in, if I'm going to put

4527
04:01:43,880 --> 04:01:46,920
a coffee in the cup right,
what was the purpose?

4528
04:01:46,920 --> 04:01:49,120
The purpose because after that
I want to drink it, right?

4529
04:01:49,120 --> 04:01:52,680
It's not like I'm just going to put
and then just leave it in there right then

4530
04:01:52,680 --> 04:01:56,880
if I'm just going to leave it in there,
it be unused, right?

4531
04:01:56,880 --> 04:01:59,080
It will be unused. It will be wasted.

4532
04:01:59,520 --> 04:02:03,600
So now why do you want to put it if you're
not going to use it in the future?

4533
04:02:03,920 --> 04:02:07,440
So now we are getting the warning
why we get in the water

4534
04:02:07,440 --> 04:02:12,160
because it says, hey, you took that,
you took the value,

4535
04:02:12,520 --> 04:02:15,840
you store it inside the variable,
but you have not used it.

4536
04:02:15,840 --> 04:02:18,080
You see the warning is is not used.

4537
04:02:18,080 --> 04:02:19,520
Then what is the purpose?

4538
04:02:19,520 --> 04:02:24,120
Why did you take this variable
if you're not planning to use it, why or?

4539
04:02:24,120 --> 04:02:25,160
What do we did right now?

4540
04:02:25,160 --> 04:02:30,120
We created one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11 boxes.

4541
04:02:30,120 --> 04:02:32,120
We created 11 boxes.

4542
04:02:33,240 --> 04:02:36,240
So now
has been occupied in our memory, right?

4543
04:02:36,480 --> 04:02:38,880
So the purpose of a variable is
what are we doing?

4544
04:02:39,120 --> 04:02:41,760
We are taking the value we story.

4545
04:02:42,120 --> 04:02:46,280
So then in this future
we can use it, right?

4546
04:02:46,560 --> 04:02:50,640
Think of it guys, when you using the
calculator, When you using the calculator.

4547
04:02:50,640 --> 04:02:50,840
Right.

4548
04:02:50,840 --> 04:02:53,680
You want to perform some additions, right?

4549
04:02:53,680 --> 04:02:57,960
So first you enter one number,
then number that you enter.

4550
04:02:57,960 --> 04:03:01,680
For example, ten is getting stored
inside this variable.

4551
04:03:02,040 --> 04:03:06,800
Second number that store 20 is guaranteed
store another variable.

4552
04:03:07,080 --> 04:03:10,080
And then once you store them
into variables, now

4553
04:03:10,080 --> 04:03:14,840
what we can perform, we can perform
addition or multiplication division,

4554
04:03:14,840 --> 04:03:18,800
whatever portion you have to perform
on your on your calculator.

4555
04:03:18,800 --> 04:03:20,520
Right. So the same thing in here.

4556
04:03:20,520 --> 04:03:24,800
Hey, you stored the value
you store the value inside the variable.

4557
04:03:25,040 --> 04:03:27,160
Now please make sure you use it.

4558
04:03:27,160 --> 04:03:29,680
If you don't have a plan
to use these variables, then

4559
04:03:29,680 --> 04:03:31,200
just simply don't use them.

4560
04:03:31,200 --> 04:03:33,000
And for now we going to use them.

4561
04:03:33,000 --> 04:03:35,440
For now
we just simply going to bring them.

4562
04:03:35,680 --> 04:03:38,880
We just simply going to access
those values.

4563
04:03:39,200 --> 04:03:41,560
For example, this if I want to print right

4564
04:03:42,960 --> 04:03:43,680
and if

4565
04:03:43,680 --> 04:03:46,440
I want to print them that out,

4566
04:03:47,520 --> 04:03:50,200
that's straight line, right?

4567
04:03:50,200 --> 04:03:52,360
I want you print.

4568
04:03:52,360 --> 04:03:55,560
I want you print.

4569
04:03:55,560 --> 04:03:56,840
I don't know. Let me see.

4570
04:03:56,840 --> 04:03:58,840
I want you print 127 days.

4571
04:03:59,160 --> 04:04:00,840
How can I print 127?

4572
04:04:00,840 --> 04:04:06,160
Tell me if

4573
04:04:17,560 --> 04:04:19,520
so, if I want you print right.

4574
04:04:19,520 --> 04:04:21,840
If I want to print 127 Now what?

4575
04:04:21,840 --> 04:04:22,600
You look.

4576
04:04:22,600 --> 04:04:26,200
Hey, I took the value 120
when you restored.

4577
04:04:26,400 --> 04:04:28,480
I store the inside this variable. Right?

4578
04:04:28,760 --> 04:04:33,040
So now this variable holds
that value, right?

4579
04:04:33,040 --> 04:04:37,880
So now what we have to do
need to cool this variable.

4580
04:04:37,880 --> 04:04:38,520
Right?

4581
04:04:38,520 --> 04:04:44,120
So where did I store 127
I stored in the variable box, right.

4582
04:04:44,200 --> 04:04:46,160
Or we it box one right.

4583
04:04:46,160 --> 04:04:47,840
Store inside the box one.

4584
04:04:47,840 --> 04:04:49,200
So now what happens?

4585
04:04:49,200 --> 04:04:50,920
You program knows, right?

4586
04:04:50,920 --> 04:04:52,680
Your program knows before

4587
04:04:53,640 --> 04:04:55,840
what you did right before what we did

4588
04:04:57,480 --> 04:05:09,840
there, what would we need right here?

4589
04:05:09,840 --> 04:05:14,680
Remember, the program executes path
to the bottom right steps to the bottom.

4590
04:05:14,680 --> 04:05:17,880
Gallegos goes, goes
and now on the line eight.

4591
04:05:17,880 --> 04:05:20,760
What we created, we created a box, right?

4592
04:05:20,760 --> 04:05:22,440
We created the box.

4593
04:05:22,440 --> 04:05:24,880
We gave it the name Box one.

4594
04:05:25,440 --> 04:05:30,120
We said, Hey inside this book, Box one,
I'll be storing by top of that list.

4595
04:05:30,480 --> 04:05:32,360
And I did store right what I stole.

4596
04:05:32,360 --> 04:05:36,040
I store 127 inside, right.

4597
04:05:36,040 --> 04:05:38,720
And toward the program
we created many boxes here.

4598
04:05:38,720 --> 04:05:42,800
Box was created
here, Box was created right here.

4599
04:05:42,800 --> 04:05:44,160
Box was created.

4600
04:05:44,160 --> 04:05:46,080
All these boxes.

4601
04:05:46,080 --> 04:05:50,000
My remember guys, all those boxes, what
they have, they will have a need, right?

4602
04:05:50,400 --> 04:05:52,360
That's how I can differentiate.

4603
04:05:52,360 --> 04:05:54,120
I can have hundreds of boxes.

4604
04:05:54,120 --> 04:05:56,680
I can have hundreds of variables.
But how can I differentiate?

4605
04:05:56,840 --> 04:05:59,720
I can differentiate by name.
Right by name.

4606
04:06:00,120 --> 04:06:01,920
Now on the line 20.

4607
04:06:01,920 --> 04:06:03,720
Right. All these.

4608
04:06:03,720 --> 04:06:04,840
So here, what are we doing?

4609
04:06:04,840 --> 04:06:06,240
We the boxes, Right.

4610
04:06:06,240 --> 04:06:08,560
Boxes, boxes, boxes in here.

4611
04:06:08,560 --> 04:06:11,240
Now, on the line 28, I'm saying, Hey,

4612
04:06:11,920 --> 04:06:16,280
Java, please print me,
please print me a box one.

4613
04:06:16,880 --> 04:06:22,040
So now when we call in the variable, okay,
when we tried to access the variable

4614
04:06:22,040 --> 04:06:25,680
this inside the variable,
what do we have values?

4615
04:06:26,040 --> 04:06:28,600
Any time you work with variables,

4616
04:06:28,880 --> 04:06:32,040
we work with the values
that we placed inside.

4617
04:06:32,400 --> 04:06:36,040
So now when you going to print right now
box, what you're going

4618
04:06:36,200 --> 04:06:37,920
to see in the output.

4619
04:06:37,920 --> 04:06:41,360
127 126

4620
04:06:41,760 --> 04:06:45,120
And now what
you guys will notice the warning.

4621
04:06:45,480 --> 04:06:47,800
The warning from this line has gone.

4622
04:06:48,600 --> 04:06:50,960
The warning from this line has gone. Why?

4623
04:06:51,240 --> 04:06:55,240
Because now your program sees, okay,
they took

4624
04:06:55,440 --> 04:06:58,960
they took the variable,
they put the value inside.

4625
04:06:59,280 --> 04:07:04,640
But now on the line 28, the access in it
the access.

4626
04:07:04,640 --> 04:07:08,000
And so the actually using this variable

4627
04:07:08,280 --> 04:07:13,440
while in here we just stored the value
and we are not using it.

4628
04:07:13,440 --> 04:07:19,080
That's right in here you get in the warning that your variable has not been used

4629
04:07:21,920 --> 04:07:24,400
and now we want to frame box one one.

4630
04:07:24,720 --> 04:07:25,160
Okay.

4631
04:07:25,640 --> 04:07:28,120
What you have, you have 127,

4632
04:07:29,920 --> 04:07:33,000
you know, one value inside one box.

4633
04:07:33,360 --> 04:07:35,600
Okay. One value inside one box.

4634
04:07:36,280 --> 04:07:36,480
Yeah.

4635
04:07:36,480 --> 04:07:41,080
You cannot store you inside the 127
and then nine and then zero.

4636
04:07:41,280 --> 04:07:44,120
No, that cannot do one value per one box.

4637
04:07:44,480 --> 04:07:47,520
You like here
I can, I can, I can store only water.

4638
04:07:47,520 --> 04:07:48,000
Right.

4639
04:07:48,000 --> 04:07:50,400
If I'm going to mix something that's No.

4640
04:07:50,400 --> 04:07:52,760
One to the code. Right.

4641
04:07:53,000 --> 04:07:54,440
Why you cannot see you again.

4642
04:07:54,440 --> 04:07:57,440
Can you please
make sure you save, You save.

4643
04:07:57,440 --> 04:07:57,880
And then.

4644
04:07:57,880 --> 04:08:02,840
And then you probably will get it.

4645
04:08:02,840 --> 04:08:04,440
So that's that's the difference, guys.

4646
04:08:04,440 --> 04:08:06,720
So now let me see
what will be the difference.

4647
04:08:06,720 --> 04:08:07,880
Now, let's see, guys.

4648
04:08:07,880 --> 04:08:10,800
What if I'm going
to put it like this? This and

4649
04:08:12,440 --> 04:08:13,800
that out

4650
04:08:14,400 --> 04:08:17,520
that print line right in line.

4651
04:08:17,960 --> 04:08:22,440
So now I want to say box,
but what I'm going to do

4652
04:08:22,440 --> 04:08:25,360
is I'm going to put it inside
the double quotes.

4653
04:08:26,040 --> 04:08:36,960
What are this thing will be the output.

4654
04:08:36,960 --> 04:08:38,840
It will be output.

4655
04:08:38,840 --> 04:08:41,440
This this one,
that's what I'm going to get, right?

4656
04:08:41,440 --> 04:08:43,240
That's what I'm going to get.

4657
04:08:43,240 --> 04:08:43,800
I'm here.

4658
04:08:43,800 --> 04:08:47,520
I'm seeing 127
that is output from the line 20.

4659
04:08:47,720 --> 04:08:50,760
But in here I'm seeing
the output is a line 29.

4660
04:08:50,920 --> 04:08:52,600
But in power in time, what.

4661
04:08:52,600 --> 04:08:56,040
Okay so when we trying to access
the variable days

4662
04:08:56,240 --> 04:08:58,920
when we try to assess the variables,
there's no double quotation.

4663
04:08:59,160 --> 04:09:01,600
Okay. There's no double quotation.

4664
04:09:01,600 --> 04:09:05,720
But wherever you going to put inside
double quotes,

4665
04:09:05,960 --> 04:09:08,400
that's what you guys going to get.
Okay. That's when you guys.

4666
04:09:09,600 --> 04:09:09,960
All right.

4667
04:09:09,960 --> 04:09:11,320
Let me ask you this, guys.

4668
04:09:11,320 --> 04:09:15,320
What if what
if I'm putting like this in a system

4669
04:09:16,640 --> 04:09:18,080
that out

4670
04:09:18,440 --> 04:09:22,640
that spring line and I'm going to say

4671
04:09:23,720 --> 04:09:25,680
was, okay,

4672
04:09:25,680 --> 04:09:28,960
so why am I
program was not a happy why, why, why?

4673
04:09:28,960 --> 04:09:31,320
There is some error I'm getting

4674
04:09:49,200 --> 04:09:53,280
because I don't have this
I don't have this variable, right.

4675
04:09:53,280 --> 04:09:55,080
I don't have this box.

4676
04:09:55,080 --> 04:09:58,320
It's for example guys let's see the name
that we don't have in a year.

4677
04:09:59,000 --> 04:10:01,000
Let's
say I'm going to go somewhere, right?

4678
04:10:01,000 --> 04:10:01,760
I'm going to start.

4679
04:10:01,760 --> 04:10:04,200
Hey, Summer, can you can you you help us?

4680
04:10:04,200 --> 04:10:05,320
Can you do it this right?

4681
04:10:05,320 --> 04:10:08,040
Can you
can you type somewhere is not there.

4682
04:10:08,400 --> 04:10:10,320
He's never going to answer. Right.

4683
04:10:10,320 --> 04:10:13,440
So the same thing I cannot have some

4684
04:10:13,720 --> 04:10:16,520
I cannot call something
if I don't have it in there.

4685
04:10:16,560 --> 04:10:19,320
Right. I did not created this box.

4686
04:10:19,760 --> 04:10:23,720
How can I use something
if I did not created it right.

4687
04:10:23,720 --> 04:10:26,760
So throughout these all these variables

4688
04:10:26,760 --> 04:10:30,760
they being created
and this for inside the memory, right.

4689
04:10:30,760 --> 04:10:32,000
This store. Inside the memory.

4690
04:10:32,000 --> 04:10:35,280
Now what do I have such a box
when I have such a box?

4691
04:10:35,280 --> 04:10:36,840
And that's why my program was confused.

4692
04:10:36,840 --> 04:10:40,360
Hey, you want to access this?

4693
04:10:40,680 --> 04:10:42,160
You want to access this variable.

4694
04:10:42,160 --> 04:10:42,880
But I'm sorry.

4695
04:10:42,880 --> 04:10:45,120
This variable is not exist, right?

4696
04:10:45,160 --> 04:10:46,960
This variable, it doesn't exist.

4697
04:10:46,960 --> 04:10:49,080
So make sure you guys to call

4698
04:10:50,720 --> 04:10:51,960
this only

4699
04:10:51,960 --> 04:10:56,160
variables, variables that

4700
04:10:57,960 --> 04:10:59,160
that you

4701
04:10:59,880 --> 04:11:01,560
need. Okay.

4702
04:11:01,560 --> 04:11:04,840
It's like if you if you did not
build something, how can you access it?

4703
04:11:04,840 --> 04:11:05,440
Right?

4704
04:11:05,880 --> 04:11:08,160
If there's a house
has not been been built,

4705
04:11:08,200 --> 04:11:10,680
you can live in there,
you can put people in there.

4706
04:11:10,680 --> 04:11:11,160
Right.

4707
04:11:11,160 --> 04:11:13,280
But all in all, if it has been built,

4708
04:11:13,440 --> 04:11:17,200
only then people can live there
and then you can specify the address.

4709
04:11:17,400 --> 04:11:17,880
Okay.

4710
04:11:18,040 --> 04:11:21,960
Then you can specify that.

4711
04:11:21,960 --> 04:11:28,320
Okay.

4712
04:11:28,320 --> 04:11:31,320
And I know, guys,
you have a lot of questions.

4713
04:11:31,320 --> 04:11:34,680
Probably some things
we will go over all the details.

4714
04:11:34,680 --> 04:11:36,920
We will go over all the details.

4715
04:11:36,920 --> 04:11:40,840
You will understand why why
this is also being read, Why?

4716
04:11:40,840 --> 04:11:44,240
Why there is a certain thing
to be able to store

4717
04:11:44,240 --> 04:11:47,400
where certain things
I'm not able to store what I have.

4718
04:11:47,400 --> 04:11:49,640
And why do I have to specify if why?

4719
04:11:49,680 --> 04:11:51,800
I don't have to specify anything.
The year.

4720
04:11:51,800 --> 04:11:54,600
We will learn
all of that in details. Okay. Just

4721
04:11:55,880 --> 04:11:57,920
as I say, guys, hold your horses.

4722
04:11:57,920 --> 04:11:59,000
Everything.

4723
04:11:59,000 --> 04:12:00,680
Everything will be given to you, right?

4724
04:12:00,680 --> 04:12:03,640
Just in a proportional proportion. Right?

4725
04:12:03,680 --> 04:12:07,200
We don't want to do all the things
that you and the first class otherwise.

4726
04:12:07,200 --> 04:12:09,800
Guys,
I'm going to have an empty class tomorrow.

4727
04:12:11,480 --> 04:12:12,560
Okay?

4728
04:12:12,560 --> 04:12:14,840
Which I don't want to have. Right.

4729
04:12:14,840 --> 04:12:16,520
Okay, so now what?

4730
04:12:16,520 --> 04:12:17,520
I want you to do this.

4731
04:12:17,520 --> 04:12:20,280
Can you please print actual?

4732
04:12:20,280 --> 04:12:21,600
I think I have a task.

4733
04:12:21,600 --> 04:12:23,520
Any questions for data types?

4734
04:12:23,520 --> 04:12:25,120
Just any questions for data types.

4735
04:12:25,120 --> 04:12:26,720
How many do we have?

4736
04:12:26,720 --> 04:12:29,680
Why do we have this many and why?

4737
04:12:29,680 --> 04:12:31,080
Why do I have wide?

4738
04:12:31,080 --> 04:12:33,960
Why do I have low in any questions?

4739
04:12:33,960 --> 04:12:35,680
Do the data types

4740
04:12:41,400 --> 04:12:44,680
okay, okay.

4741
04:12:44,840 --> 04:12:45,840
It's 50.

4742
04:12:45,840 --> 04:12:48,080
Let's see
what let's see what we have on the slides.

4743
04:12:48,080 --> 04:12:48,800
This is

4744
04:12:51,840 --> 04:12:55,920
I think Java has two data types, right?

4745
04:12:56,840 --> 04:12:58,800
I like that, guys. I like that.

4746
04:12:58,800 --> 04:13:00,680
You guys all should be excited.

4747
04:13:00,680 --> 04:13:03,280
New knowledge is coming
in, and I hope so. Why?

4748
04:13:03,360 --> 04:13:06,760
It has not been that difficult, right?

4749
04:13:06,760 --> 04:13:08,640
Non primitive. There will be a lot.

4750
04:13:08,640 --> 04:13:11,880
There's actually countless number
of the non primitives

4751
04:13:12,320 --> 04:13:15,120
and once we finish learning basics then

4752
04:13:15,120 --> 04:13:18,520
we will be strictly strict
with focusing on the non primitive types.

4753
04:13:18,800 --> 04:13:21,000
String is just one example.

4754
04:13:21,000 --> 04:13:23,280
String is just one example.

4755
04:13:23,280 --> 04:13:24,480
Okay. Data attached.

4756
04:13:24,480 --> 04:13:27,120
Right. Primitive. Non. Primitive.

4757
04:13:28,120 --> 04:13:32,200
What kind of primitive data times
we can have primitive data task can be

4758
04:13:32,840 --> 04:13:37,240
some the representation
of the numeric values and non numeric

4759
04:13:37,240 --> 04:13:42,080
right out of the numeric you can have
full numbers features in here.

4760
04:13:42,080 --> 04:13:44,360
Right. Decimals, floating points. Right.

4761
04:13:44,680 --> 04:13:47,800
There's a few data types
that can represent integer values.

4762
04:13:48,040 --> 04:13:52,520
There's a two data types that can
represent floating and two data types.

4763
04:13:52,520 --> 04:13:54,320
They can represent non numeric.

4764
04:13:54,320 --> 04:13:58,120
But all of this this all of this is a part

4765
04:13:58,120 --> 04:14:01,320
of non primitive types, right here of the

4766
04:14:02,280 --> 04:14:05,200
most primitive story.

4767
04:14:05,760 --> 04:14:08,600
We're eight of them right here.

4768
04:14:08,640 --> 04:14:10,440
So eight of them

4769
04:14:10,840 --> 04:14:13,360
that represented my primitive types.

4770
04:14:13,800 --> 04:14:18,840
And when it comes to non primitive guys,
there will be unlimited here.

4771
04:14:18,840 --> 04:14:24,000
Think of it it's unlimited.

4772
04:14:24,000 --> 04:14:24,480
Okay.

4773
04:14:27,600 --> 04:14:30,200
What is the difference between those

4774
04:14:32,120 --> 04:14:34,320
then use once we look into this string.

4775
04:14:34,440 --> 04:14:34,760
Okay.

4776
04:14:34,760 --> 04:14:40,080
Once we look into the string,
the f and f here will look the same.

4777
04:14:40,080 --> 04:14:43,320
But if if you want to store them
differently,

4778
04:14:43,520 --> 04:14:47,120
they will be treated as a different data
types, right?

4779
04:14:47,120 --> 04:14:48,400
They will be treated as a different.

4780
04:14:48,400 --> 04:14:51,520
David Okay, so for example.

4781
04:14:51,520 --> 04:14:52,280
That's right.

4782
04:14:52,280 --> 04:14:55,200
For example, I have a numbers, right?

4783
04:14:55,200 --> 04:14:57,040
I have a numbers right.

4784
04:14:57,040 --> 04:15:02,040
I cannot store boolean in here,
I cannot store boolean in here.

4785
04:15:02,240 --> 04:15:03,960
Why cannot story boolean?

4786
04:15:03,960 --> 04:15:08,200
Because what is the purpose
of storing those values?

4787
04:15:08,200 --> 04:15:10,880
Because in the future
I'm going to them, right?

4788
04:15:11,400 --> 04:15:13,920
So whenever we are working these numbers,

4789
04:15:14,360 --> 04:15:18,040
there are some isometric operations
we will be performing right?

4790
04:15:18,360 --> 04:15:21,160
Why do I want to store inside a boolean?

4791
04:15:21,480 --> 04:15:26,480
Because I will be very fine
where this some things are marked as. Yes.

4792
04:15:26,480 --> 04:15:28,680
Whether some things are marked
is no right.

4793
04:15:29,200 --> 04:15:31,840
Every Different data type has a purpose.

4794
04:15:31,840 --> 04:15:34,800
Right? And later
when we'll be doing the strings right.

4795
04:15:34,800 --> 04:15:36,520
When when we'll be learning that strings.

4796
04:15:36,520 --> 04:15:40,400
When we learn
how to store a sequence characters.

4797
04:15:40,400 --> 04:15:42,520
Because right now
how much single character. Right.

4798
04:15:42,840 --> 04:15:44,480
Will be storing the form of strings. Why?

4799
04:15:44,480 --> 04:15:47,640
Because these this strings,
you can do different things, right?

4800
04:15:47,840 --> 04:15:50,520
I can write my name. A cell uppercase.

4801
04:15:51,120 --> 04:15:52,840
I can write it as a lowercase.

4802
04:15:52,840 --> 04:15:56,480
I can do conversion, uppercase, lowercase,
all uppercase.

4803
04:15:56,480 --> 04:15:59,080
Right.
There's a lot of different manipulations.

4804
04:15:59,080 --> 04:16:05,400
You can do
based on the different data type.

4805
04:16:05,400 --> 04:16:08,160
So in here, guys, when you talk about

4806
04:16:09,360 --> 04:16:12,800
a smaller
F and bigger F, it doesn't really matter.

4807
04:16:12,960 --> 04:16:14,920
Okay, here is does not really matter.

4808
04:16:14,920 --> 04:16:17,760
So this whichever one you want to use,

4809
04:16:17,760 --> 04:16:19,640
the same thing is l small.

4810
04:16:19,640 --> 04:16:20,120
Well,

4811
04:16:21,040 --> 04:16:23,080
it doesn't really matter

4812
04:16:23,200 --> 04:16:26,200
if. Right?

4813
04:16:26,520 --> 04:16:31,080
So non primitive guys we will be focusing
starting class 11 and 12.

4814
04:16:31,080 --> 04:16:35,400
That's when string strictly prove
focus will on our non primitive types.

4815
04:16:36,440 --> 04:16:39,560
And here you guys will see
I go to represent numeric values.

4816
04:16:39,560 --> 04:16:40,160
Right?

4817
04:16:40,200 --> 04:16:44,160
This is for different family members
to represent decimal values.

4818
04:16:44,160 --> 04:16:48,400
You have followed double single character
char to represent false.

4819
04:16:48,680 --> 04:16:51,280
True or false.
We use bowling, right? Yeah.

4820
04:16:51,320 --> 04:16:52,840
You guys will see the range.

4821
04:16:52,840 --> 04:16:54,680
That byte can hold.

4822
04:16:54,680 --> 04:16:57,800
Sure can hold integer
can hold in a for as long.

4823
04:16:58,200 --> 04:17:00,560
So you don't need to remember that range.

4824
04:17:00,560 --> 04:17:03,480
But this is just for your own knowledge,
right?

4825
04:17:03,720 --> 04:17:07,320
What is being the smallest data type
and then increasing from

4826
04:17:07,320 --> 04:17:09,920
might be good to short
integer long business thoughts.

4827
04:17:11,280 --> 04:17:14,880
This is byte occupies one bite of memory.

4828
04:17:14,880 --> 04:17:18,320
This is a bias towards of memory four
and then eight bytes of memory.

4829
04:17:19,560 --> 04:17:22,200
And the same thing
with the float in the double key.

4830
04:17:22,440 --> 04:17:25,120
So that is being
the bigger than the float.

4831
04:17:26,440 --> 04:17:28,320
And whenever you work with the

4832
04:17:28,320 --> 04:17:31,480
whenever we work with those values
now what do you do?

4833
04:17:31,480 --> 04:17:34,040
You cannot just have a value by itself.

4834
04:17:34,360 --> 04:17:38,280
Those values have to be stored
inside of containers.

4835
04:17:38,560 --> 04:17:40,680
And how do we call those containers?

4836
04:17:40,680 --> 04:17:43,040
We call variables.

4837
04:17:43,560 --> 04:17:48,680
We call them variables in order for us
to use the variable, right?

4838
04:17:49,120 --> 04:17:51,600
So we need to give a name.

4839
04:17:51,600 --> 04:17:56,600
But besides, given the name,
we will have to specify a data type.

4840
04:17:56,600 --> 04:17:59,960
Right here I have a box with the name E.

4841
04:18:00,360 --> 04:18:02,280
What I'm planning to storing there?

4842
04:18:02,280 --> 04:18:05,560
I'm planning to store load type of values.

4843
04:18:05,560 --> 04:18:06,120
Right.

4844
04:18:06,120 --> 04:18:11,160
If I'm trying to store different type
of values, that's when my program.

4845
04:18:11,160 --> 04:18:11,960
Right?

4846
04:18:11,960 --> 04:18:14,960
I'm planning
to store boolean type of values.

4847
04:18:14,960 --> 04:18:18,880
If I'm going to store a number
my Java is going to complete.

4848
04:18:18,960 --> 04:18:19,520
Right?

4849
04:18:19,520 --> 04:18:20,760
So now what?

4850
04:18:20,760 --> 04:18:23,480
In here I created a variable.

4851
04:18:23,480 --> 04:18:27,200
I give it a name is hungry right now.

4852
04:18:27,200 --> 04:18:29,760
This variable is of which type?

4853
04:18:29,760 --> 04:18:32,520
This variable of the boolean direct type.

4854
04:18:32,520 --> 04:18:35,760
It means this variable can hold only

4855
04:18:35,960 --> 04:18:39,960
boolean type of values, full

4856
04:18:41,600 --> 04:18:43,800
sentences,
paragraphs that will be strings y

4857
04:18:43,800 --> 04:18:47,080
because a sentence is a combination

4858
04:18:47,080 --> 04:18:52,680
of layers, right numbers, spaces do.

4859
04:18:52,800 --> 04:18:54,720
Those are special characters, right?

4860
04:18:54,720 --> 04:18:56,320
In all other things.

4861
04:18:56,320 --> 04:18:58,920
When you have a
when do you have a mix of everything?

4862
04:18:58,920 --> 04:19:02,080
It will a string get

4863
04:19:05,120 --> 04:19:06,920
well, let's see.

4864
04:19:06,920 --> 04:19:07,760
Okay.

4865
04:19:08,640 --> 04:19:09,160
Okay.

4866
04:19:09,160 --> 04:19:11,040
I will leave you those.

4867
04:19:11,040 --> 04:19:13,000
This slides will leave you this light.

4868
04:19:13,000 --> 04:19:15,120
And of course we will go over tomorrow.

4869
04:19:15,120 --> 04:19:17,960
But please make sure you look into them.

4870
04:19:17,960 --> 04:19:18,240
Right.

4871
04:19:18,240 --> 04:19:20,920
Make sure you look into them
and they'll give you the task.

4872
04:19:21,040 --> 04:19:24,680
Okay,
so this will be your little homework task.

4873
04:19:24,960 --> 04:19:26,280
And this is this thing.

4874
04:19:26,280 --> 04:19:28,600
This is just for practice and right.

4875
04:19:28,600 --> 04:19:29,440
Because

4876
04:19:30,040 --> 04:19:32,880
right now
I was just able to create the variables

4877
04:19:33,080 --> 04:19:35,480
and here I was able to access only one.

4878
04:19:35,720 --> 04:19:39,400
So your homework list,
I want you to create a program.

4879
04:19:39,760 --> 04:19:43,720
Now let's write practice variables,
and then I want you

4880
04:19:43,720 --> 04:19:48,160
to create the variables
to spawn different primitive types.

4881
04:19:48,160 --> 04:19:51,080
Right?
You have eight primitive types, right?

4882
04:19:51,080 --> 04:19:53,720
And what do I mean? To store their range?
Right.

4883
04:19:53,720 --> 04:19:57,920
For example, I want you to try to store
the way I did it in here.

4884
04:19:57,920 --> 04:19:58,520
Right?

4885
04:19:58,520 --> 04:19:59,280
Try to store.

4886
04:19:59,280 --> 04:20:02,160
Maybe try to create variables of byte

4887
04:20:02,760 --> 04:20:06,840
because the lowest one will be -1.8.

4888
04:20:07,000 --> 04:20:07,800
Right?

4889
04:20:07,800 --> 04:20:10,960
As soon as you try and you go mine, -129.

4890
04:20:11,880 --> 04:20:14,160
That is too big for this small box, right?

4891
04:20:14,400 --> 04:20:17,200
So that's what
that's what we mean by testing the range.

4892
04:20:17,520 --> 04:20:20,760
That's what do you mean
by just in the right store, Max.

4893
04:20:20,760 --> 04:20:24,280
Minimum value of that of that variable.

4894
04:20:24,280 --> 04:20:25,680
Okay. Of that variable.

4895
04:20:25,680 --> 04:20:35,520
And then what
we want you to do, I can remove that.

4896
04:20:36,600 --> 04:20:37,360
Do you have any

4897
04:20:37,360 --> 04:20:40,360
other colors in your program?

4898
04:20:40,360 --> 04:20:40,720
Okay.

4899
04:20:40,720 --> 04:20:46,120
Amazon will help you.

4900
04:20:46,120 --> 04:20:46,520
Okay.

4901
04:20:47,760 --> 04:20:50,080
In. Okay.

4902
04:20:50,280 --> 04:20:52,360
And then what
you guys will have to do you have

4903
04:20:52,440 --> 04:20:56,360
I want you to frame the value
of each variable.

4904
04:20:56,360 --> 04:20:57,160
Okay.

4905
04:20:57,160 --> 04:21:02,480
So for example, the way we did it in here,
I'm not going to print 127, right.

4906
04:21:02,480 --> 04:21:03,640
I'm not going to print one.

4907
04:21:03,640 --> 04:21:05,880
Can they print 127 years?

4908
04:21:05,880 --> 04:21:07,280
But then what was the purpose?

4909
04:21:07,280 --> 04:21:10,600
Distorted 127 And here
what was the purpose?

4910
04:21:10,840 --> 04:21:15,280
So we store values inside the boxes,
inside the variables.

4911
04:21:15,600 --> 04:21:18,360
So then later we can use

4912
04:21:20,040 --> 04:21:21,640
what am I going to

4913
04:21:21,640 --> 04:21:24,640
at that point 27, going to type one.

4914
04:21:25,320 --> 04:21:27,320
So this will be
your homework is the homework.

4915
04:21:27,320 --> 04:21:28,800
I will send it

4916
04:21:29,200 --> 04:21:29,880
the homework.

4917
04:21:29,880 --> 04:21:32,000
I will send it in the course announcement.

4918
04:21:32,000 --> 04:21:33,040
Please do it.

4919
04:21:33,040 --> 04:21:36,520
So this homework, whenever you guys done
you can just

4920
04:21:37,040 --> 04:21:39,560
shear in your syntax students channel.

4921
04:21:39,760 --> 04:21:42,000
This is just a little of homework
I'm giving you.

4922
04:21:42,240 --> 04:21:46,480
But tomorrow guys, I will give
your official official homework.

4923
04:21:46,480 --> 04:21:50,040
I think now will be about 17
or 16 questions

4924
04:21:50,040 --> 04:21:52,680
that you guys will be doing on different
platform.

4925
04:21:52,880 --> 04:21:55,840
Okay. Any questions raised?

4926
04:21:55,880 --> 04:22:13,760
Any questions?

4927
04:22:13,760 --> 04:22:15,960
I hope I was clear.

4928
04:22:15,960 --> 04:22:18,720
If it was not, it was 90% clear.

4929
04:22:18,720 --> 04:22:21,720
That's what's good, right?
So please make sure you guys practice

4930
04:22:23,680 --> 04:22:24,960
with make sure you guys practice.

4931
04:22:24,960 --> 04:22:29,240
Please make sure you do homework
and I'm going to see you tomorrow.

4932
04:22:29,240 --> 04:22:33,240
It's 10:00
and we will go more over by details.

4933
04:22:33,240 --> 04:22:37,280
But here, I'll I'll leave you the slides
with make sure you look at them all.

4934
04:22:37,600 --> 04:22:40,120
We will go overboard naming convention.

4935
04:22:40,120 --> 04:22:41,880
How should we name all variables?

4936
04:22:41,880 --> 04:22:43,640
How should we know more classes?

4937
04:22:43,640 --> 04:22:45,720
What is allowed, what is not allowed?

4938
04:22:45,720 --> 04:22:47,520
What do we can do with those variables?

4939
04:22:47,520 --> 04:22:53,760
Okay, so there will be a lot of things
that we will be going.

4940
04:22:53,760 --> 04:22:59,840
Michael, I'm sure you can do this homework
very, very quickly.

4941
04:22:59,840 --> 04:23:02,320
You have any questions? False, right?

4942
04:23:03,480 --> 04:23:04,280
Slides years ago.

4943
04:23:04,280 --> 04:23:06,440
Slides will be slides will be on canvas.

4944
04:23:06,440 --> 04:23:09,120
Guys,
I'll upload my notes and canvas as well.

4945
04:23:09,360 --> 04:23:14,040
And then programs every single program
that we created today.

4946
04:23:14,040 --> 04:23:17,560
It's also will be available in canvas
for now.

4947
04:23:17,560 --> 04:23:20,760
Everything be there
until you guys will learn one

4948
04:23:20,760 --> 04:23:25,000
pretty cool tool in which
you won't need to go to canvas after that.

4949
04:23:25,000 --> 04:23:25,320
Okay.

4950
04:23:25,320 --> 04:23:31,040
But until then, everything is on canvas
except the video.

4951
04:23:31,040 --> 04:23:31,760
Okay.

4952
04:23:32,000 --> 04:23:33,240
All right, good.

4953
04:23:33,240 --> 04:23:34,280
Thank you.

4954
04:23:34,280 --> 04:23:35,360
Please practice.

4955
04:23:35,360 --> 04:23:39,160
