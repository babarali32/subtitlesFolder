1
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,160
Protesters.

2
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,520
Can you hear me

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,240
as goes on this honeymoon?

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,480
That's right.

5
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,000
Sup, guys?

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,320
How are you?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
Yes, you. It's

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,240
to test us.

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,600
Guys, thanks for waiting.
I had some issues

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,760
setting up.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,800
Let's see.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,040
First of all, is this Jenkins class at my.

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,640
In the right class.

14
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,360
Okay, cool.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,760
So, what's up, guys?

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,240
How are you?

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,360
What's going on?

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,120
How's everyone?

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,320
So, who is here today?

20
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,160
Ekaterina or Mont

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,400
and Lenny? 100.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,160
Some dominate I.

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,800
That's right.

24
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,360
I think I don't know where asker is.

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,560
Maybe he's on his honeymoon.

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,960
I know he got married.

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,400
Omran Mohammed Zuma lna.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,640
Guys,

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,760
this is

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,560
your last classes.

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
That's it.

32
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,720
This is the right thing.

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,040
Was, like, four months ago.

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,520
I kind of told you
that syntax was going to have to.

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,560
What was it, five months ago?

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,720
I told you that sentence
was going to be really intense,

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,800
but try to tell you not to quit.

38
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,520
The time was going to fly by so quick.

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,040
And now we are. That's it.
This is the end.

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,800
We are at the finish line.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,920
We are at the finish line.

42
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,080
That's it.

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,520
This is it.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,960
So how about this?

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,240
We have a topic to discuss,
which is Jenkins.

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,600
Okay.

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,160
Can you guys see my screen?

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,320
Really?

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,840
I was just writing some notes down here

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,560
for you guys.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,640
Just.

52
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,760
And I'll send all this information to you.

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,080
Okay, sir.

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,240
Hey, how are you?

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,680
Nikolai. Elena.

56
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,040
Amar.

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,120
It's really good to see you
on your last day.

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,160
Yeah, well, tomorrow.

59
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,520
But tomorrow is going to be easy.

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,720
Last.

61
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,320
This is a short.

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,960
Congratulations.

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,480
You are just two weeks away
from discovering your true potential.

64
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
Who's excited?

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,440
I was excited for the market.

66
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,080
I was excited for the market.

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,240
Was. Was motivated.

68
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:10,120
And who needs motivation?

69
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,520
Who's who's motivated
and who needs motivation?

70
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,840
Both.

71
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,560
I don't know your personal reasons, but

72
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,160
try to remember
why you started this whole thing.

73
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,840
All right.

74
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,840
If that's not enough motivation, then

75
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,400
all I can tell you is that

76
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,440
that the I.T.

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
field is a wonderful, beautiful

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,240
field,
big field with endless opportunities.

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,160
And these type of opportunities,
you don't find them in many places.

80
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,720
You know.

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,400
Consider yourself
lucky to be in the industry.

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,280
Got endless opportunities.

83
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,000
Always room for growth.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You know, you can make a name for yourself
and be who you want, you know, And.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,920
And you go from there.

86
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,240
And that should already be motivating.

87
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,640
You know, that that's not it.

88
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,760
And I hope the money motivates
you at least,

89
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,640
you know, to go this year.

90
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,280
How are you?

91
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,600
It's been a it's been a while, but
it's good to see you at the finish line.

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,480
All right.

93
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,720
So first of all, you know,
your interviews are coming up, right?

94
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,160
It's you know, it's time to study.

95
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,600
It's time to really, really study.

96
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,560
You'll find your own creative
ways to study.

97
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,240
You'll start with

98
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,480
I recommend a lot of reading,

99
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,520
you know, flashcards,
index cards, work on being able to,

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,680
you know, to properly
answer some questions

101
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,800
because I feel like a lot of you guys
do know the material,

102
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,920
but you guys probably don't know
how to answer some questions, right?

103
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,520
So that part is going to take time.

104
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
It takes time.

105
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:04,680
Right.

106
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,960
For example, if I asked you right now
in an interview, we're sitting right

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,040
across from each other and ask you in your
own words, what is in a room?

108
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,760
Can you answer that or not?

109
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,080
Right.

110
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,240
And if you can't, well,
you know what an array is.

111
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,440
You've worked with that. You used it.

112
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,960
But can you put it in your own words?

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,880
Can you talk about it?

114
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,680
Can you can
you answer the question? Right.

115
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,200
What is an ArrayList? Right.

116
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,640
What is it all?

117
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,720
Can you answer these questions?

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,360
So this this ladies and gentlemen,
it takes practice.

119
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,920
Does that make sense?

120
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
But it takes practice.

121
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,480
But most importantly,
you need to follow one.

122
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,440
One thing.

123
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
You know, you need to follow something.

124
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,440
And that's called

125
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,040
patients.

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,760
Okay.

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,640
Be patient with yourself.

128
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,120
Okay, Cool.

129
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
Be patient with yourself.

130
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,960
You know, understand yourself.

131
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,240
Respect yourself.

132
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,760
You know, be patient with yourself.

133
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,480
You're going to achieve
what you want to achieve with patients.

134
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,440
Yeah. Cool.

135
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,880
Tomorrow. Welcome to class.

136
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,120
Is that a show up?

137
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,240
Very good.

138
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,840
All right, questions or not,
before we start

139
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,600
this class, are you guys ready
or you guys ready?

140
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,760
You guys already know things.

141
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,800
I expect you to take your own notes down.

142
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,800
Okay, That's.

143
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
That's kind of, you know, standard by now.

144
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,240
Take your own notes, ask questions,
and we'll go from there.

145
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,640
Okay, So, Jenkins.

146
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,640
Okay. What is Jenkins?

147
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,080
Maybe you may have Googled it.

148
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,920
You may have watched YouTube videos on it
and stuff like that.

149
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,560
I want to say something about Jenkins.

150
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,040
Jenkins is very, very easy
topic and it's very easy to talk about,

151
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,800
but it's actually considered a buzzword

152
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,840
in in the industry

153
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,960
because of many reasons like

154
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,920
women,

155
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,480
you guys, we only have 49 participants,

156
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,400
but I've been to like

157
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,640
the rest of the class

158
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,280
is this is this is is the attendance here?

159
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,280
That is not what it is.

160
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,880
I thought at some point we had like.

161
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,960
So you guys made the cut, right?

162
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,720
You guys made the cut.

163
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,160
So, all right, you guys made it.

164
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,880
So congratulations.

165
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,040
Right. More doubts for you.

166
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,800
Right? So, anyway,

167
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,400
Jenkins is a is is a buzzword.

168
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,000
A buzzword.

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,160
When I use when I say buzzword,
I mean like a word that

170
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,840
just goes
and spreads around that people talk about.

171
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,240
Other people say,
but they don't understand what what it is

172
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,440
or what it means.

173
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:14,800
Okay.

174
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,320
I've interviewed a lot of people
when it comes to the topic of Jenkins.

175
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,320
They they freeze,

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,440
they kind of stop, you know,
and they don't know what to say

177
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,040
even though it's on the resume.

178
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,920
So, you know, it's very easy.

179
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,400
And that's the whole point of today's
class.

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,840
And tomorrow's class promised promise
to go easy because it's the finish line.

181
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,640
But here we go.

182
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,200
So Jenkins is considered a CIA tool.

183
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,280
Jenkins is a CIA tool.

184
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,600
This means continuous.

185
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,200
Continuous integration.

186
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,840
But what does continuous integration.

187
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,720
Meaning?

188
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,600
Okay, so

189
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,520
what does it mean?

190
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,480
So first of all, a lot of companies
use Jenkins.

191
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,120
And Jenkins is not the only CI tool.

192
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,040
I was going to organize some military you
there are other tools out there

193
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:16,000
that you can look like bamboo build bot
Travis CI GitLab and that kind of stuff.

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,560
Right.

195
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,760
But the thing is
that with continuous integration,

196
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,880
it means to continuously integrate
your code.

197
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,200
Okay.

198
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,160
But the reason it
became so popular was because

199
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,200
a long time ago and I don't
think you will experience this at work,

200
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,320
but before you could be like
in a development team,

201
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,200
let's say a team of of five developers

202
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,040
and let's say every developer

203
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,080
is, you know, committing code.

204
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,320
And when I commit code,
I mean pushing code to like GitHub or

205
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,320
whatever, what, whatever their source code
management tool is, right?

206
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,160
Like you guys are using GitHub, right? So

207
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,400
you guys imagine you're working with like

208
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,120
five of your teammates
and you're continuously pushing code.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
But the thing is that with that team,

210
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,320
a lot of this organization, a lot of,

211
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,320
you know, let's say

212
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Mohammed Mohammed pushes this code
and then 3 hours later, Alana

213
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,280
pushes her code and then 3 hours
later, Allen pushes his code.

214
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,360
But when it came time to run the project,

215
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,240
maybe something felt

216
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,240
right and they don't know what failed.

217
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Okay, I'm not blaming you, Allen,
So I'm just saying, does that make sense?

218
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,040
Like Mohammed works, He pushes his code,
then Alana pushes are called.

219
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,520
2 hours later,
Allen pushes this code 2 hours later.

220
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,200
And then when it's time
to run the project, it sells.

221
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,840
It felt So then Mohanad, who
was the first person to commit his code,

222
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,560
he kind of starts to feel like,
What happened?

223
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,400
I pushed this code

224
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,000
like 6 hours ago and now you're telling me
that it's failing, right?

225
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,320
So to continuously integrate your code

226
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,080
and let me just add some words, you know,

227
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,320
continuous integration and continuous

228
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,880
continuous

229
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,320
use development.

230
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,160
So that's why they call it a C. ICB

231
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
is a CI

232
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,600
KB tool.

233
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,840
This means this read.

234
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,760
As soon as Mohammed pushes
this code, the project will run.

235
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,760
Okay.

236
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,520
And if it runs good,
then Alana can push her code

237
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,240
and then when she pushes her code,
the project will run

238
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,440
and then if it fails,

239
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,800
then she is notified immediately.

240
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,680
Does that make sense?

241
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,080
That means that she can fix her stuff
right off the bat.

242
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
She can. She'll get the results.

243
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,440
Maybe it could have been an issue
with with Mohammed.

244
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,880
But the whole point of that was that

245
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,320
when Mohammed pushes this code,
the project will we call it build?

246
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,560
Okay. That's what I mean by running.

247
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,120
When it when the project builds,
everything is good,

248
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,640
Then that's good, right?

249
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,320
But when there is an error,

250
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,400
you can be notified immediately

251
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,520
and you don't have to wait
for everyone to push their code.

252
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,640
So this is where the idea of Jenkins came
came,

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,840
you know, came about.

254
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,800
Does this make sense so far?

255
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,440
I know that it's kind of a little tricky
to talk about, but

256
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,040
all of these things get created,
for one thing.

257
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,880
Efficiency, right?

258
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,080
For efficiency.

259
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,400
That's that's why these tools get created.

260
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
So then they took it to a next level.

261
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,800
For example,

262
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,600
let's say you have a team with five
developers and Allen to mine on this here.

263
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,600
They're all working,
They're all developers,

264
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,040
they're pushing their code,
everything is working right.

265
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,320
But now they can design,
they can design their Jenkins jobs

266
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,240
to like for if they're
when their project builds and everything.

267
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,200
So when the project successfully builds,
then guess what?

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,560
Then they can trigger
your selenium test automation right away.

269
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,960
You don't have to.

270
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,280
Allen doesn't have to.

271
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,560
Do you know, the development team
doesn't have to test tonight and then wait

272
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,800
till tomorrow morning to message the queue
and say, Hey, testing is ready, right?

273
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,240
What can happen is
if you have your test automation,

274
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,080
which is your which are your cucumber
selenium test kit test cases,

275
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,560
as soon as they push their code
and everything works,

276
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,440
then they can trigger your automated tests

277
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,640
without you having to do anything.

278
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,640
Which is really cool right?

279
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,960
And then will your test automation pass?

280
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,440
Well, hopefully.

281
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:55,800
Right.

282
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,040
And if it all passes, then that's good.

283
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,760
If something fails, then you and your team
get notified of any failures.

284
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,480
And so the developers, because developers
want to know if anything

285
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,720
had felt like this, Does that make sense?

286
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,040
Guys?

287
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
Why does that make sense?

288
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,280
So that is the whole point of this idea

289
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,520
of of CI CD the right Lumos.

290
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,160
Okay, if I'm a developer,
I want to push my code.

291
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,280
If my code is good,
then execute Lumos test cases right?

292
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,080
Another thing is that we're going to talk
about is scheduling, scheduling jobs.

293
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,640
Right? Scheduling jobs.

294
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,280
There's an interview question
that I'm going to ask you right now.

295
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,880
And maybe you know the answer to this.
Maybe you don't.

296
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,560
But what do you do in your project

297
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,360
to ensure the stability
of the application?

298
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,160
Go? What do you do in your project,

299
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,200
in your project,

300
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,560
to ensure the stability, stability of

301
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,200
the competition?

302
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
What do you do?

303
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,160
Go ahead. Take a shot sensor.

304
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,520
You don't know. That's okay.

305
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,720
Take a shot.

306
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,840
Someone. So check requirements.

307
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,600
Very good.

308
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,240
That's right.

309
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,560
Muhammad Smoke tests.

310
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,080
You run your smoke tests, right?

311
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,640
There's smoke test.

312
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,600
Remember when we talk about
the different type of testing, right.

313
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,160
We said that smoke tests
are can be run every day.

314
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,040
And this is just to check the stability
of the application, because just because

315
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,640
your test case is passive, it doesn't mean
they're going to pass tomorrow.

316
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,680
Right.

317
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,440
Does that make sense?

318
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,920
For example, let's say you have a scenario
that's logging in,

319
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,720
everything is working,
the logging button's working,

320
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,000
but then all of a sudden tomorrow
the logging button doesn't work.

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,640
Okay?

322
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,640
So as long as you understand that,
then we're good

323
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,800
questions.

324
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,320
Questions are not right.
So you run your smoke test.

325
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,240
So another cool thing about Jenkins
is that you can schedule your smoke tests.

326
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,440
You can't and you can schedule it to

327
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,200
maybe your project wants you
to schedule them at midnight, right?

328
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Maybe your schedule.

329
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,360
Maybe you want to schedule them at 7 a.m.

330
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,560
The whole point is that you actually
don't have to be working.

331
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,280
You don't have to be on your laptop
at all.

332
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,000
You can just live your life,
go to sleep, wake up tomorrow,

333
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,120
and then wake up to see reports,
to see what happened.

334
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,880
Okay.

335
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,160
Does that make sense?

336
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,200
But you don't have to wait.

337
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,600
You don't have to wait.

338
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,040
Now, it sounds too good to be true, right?

339
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,480
But you can do it now.

340
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,560
One of the most common problems about

341
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,080
running your or, you know, running
your test automation on Jenkins

342
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,960
is that you get random failures
all the time.

343
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,320
Okay.

344
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,360
Different failures, like maybe

345
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,440
the server was down or maybe

346
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,560
your automation failed

347
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,160
because the execution time was too fast.

348
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,240
Right?

349
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,880
And you'll get like a you'll get like,
you know, such elements, right?

350
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,480
Or element not interactive
or some exception from the web driver.

351
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,120
Right.

352
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,640
But the thing is that
when you run it on your local machine,

353
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,760
when you run these test
cases on your local, they pass

354
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:32,800
this.

355
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,960
Does that make sense?

356
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,520
So there are some things
that some workarounds that you may have to

357
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,560
to do in your test cases
so that your test cases can pass

358
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,600
when you run them on.

359
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
JENKINS For example,

360
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,920
if you're getting a not
so you're running your test case

361
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,560
and everything is passing
in your local machine.

362
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,760
But when you run it on Jenkins,
it's failing.

363
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
You're getting a no such element exception

364
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,920
somewhere.

365
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,640
Okay, what would you do?

366
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,720
Like you're running that same test
case on your laptop right now.

367
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
It runs. Everything passes.

368
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,040
But on Jenkins, it's failing
because of this. So what?

369
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,800
What would you do?

370
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,080
Okay, cool.

371
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Explicit. Wait, wait.

372
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,560
I you that gets passes that's 20.

373
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,280
Exactly.

374
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,200
So the idea is that you would add
some sort of weight, right?

375
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,200
You add some sort of weight.

376
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,760
Cool.

377
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
All right, perfect.

378
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,200
All right.

379
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,520
So that's pretty much Jenkins.

380
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,280
And if you understand Jenkins,
then that's cool. So,

381
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,240
look, you can monitor when you guys want
to interview them and ask you, do you use.

382
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,920
JENKINS Yes.

383
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,080
You can say no if you don't feel
comfortable with it, but you can say yes.

384
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,800
What do you do with Jenkins
Well, I monitor,

385
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,400
monitor and schedule jobs
and just get the jobs right.

386
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,600
What jobs?

387
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,920
You schedule world, you schedule

388
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,280
or smoke tests

389
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,160
or smoke test and regression
regression tests.

390
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,000
However, for regression like
and I'll tell you this, we actually don't

391
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,040
have a scheduled job for regression,
but we have a job for regression.

392
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Why is that?

393
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,280
How often do we execute regression?

394
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,040
Do you remember?

395
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:31,920
That's

396
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,920
another interview question
that you should be able to answer.

397
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,840
So the question is right.

398
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,080
How often right did you

399
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,680
execute your

400
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,320
regression tests?

401
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,920
Yeah, when updates are made.

402
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,560
Well, not really.

403
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,400
When updates are made,
every spin at the end of each sprint.

404
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,160
Yeah, sure.

405
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,680
At the end of every sprint.

406
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,880
Right At the end of every sprint.

407
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,320
Like for example, if

408
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,240
the developer is working on a user story
and they develop that user story,

409
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,640
but they have like
ten more user stories to work

410
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,960
on, are you going to execute your whole
regression test because of that,

411
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,040
or is it a better idea for them to finish
what they're doing completely?

412
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,080
And then you can run your regression tests

413
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,760
this way?

414
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,680
Exactly.

415
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,320
So your regression test
aren't run every day.

416
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,120
Okay.

417
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,840
They're probably run every sprint

418
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,920
or every two sprints
or you know what the best answer is?

419
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,400
They are executed prior to a release.

420
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,440
Okay.

421
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,720
Regression so or executes

422
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,840
either or at least the work prior rates

423
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,600
before. So.

424
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,880
And what is it? Release.

425
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,240
Oh, man.

426
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,440
What is a release?

427
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,680
What is a release?

428
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,680
And by the way, you're probably asking
yourself, how is this related to Jenkins?

429
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,320
Right.

430
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,600
And I'm going to explain why,
because later on

431
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,920
we're going to have to talk
about what DevOps is. Okay.

432
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,520
And this is all part of DevOps,
by the way.

433
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,800
DevOps stands for Development Operations.

434
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,520
Okay.

435
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,360
But we are going to discuss that at the
after we cover this stuff, right?

436
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,200
So what is a release? Does anyone know?

437
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Does anyone want to take a shot of
what is a release?

438
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,280
A release is a deployment, Yes, a

439
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,200
release is a deployment to what?

440
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,280
To what guys?

441
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,280
To production.

442
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,920
Right. You are like you've paid attention.

443
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,680
Wait to go right

444
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,720
alone. I'm. I'm proud of you. I'm.

445
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,160
I told you five months ago
I believe in you.

446
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,600
Right.

447
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,240
So a release is a deployment
to production.

448
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,520
Let's talk more about what is a release
and how often is deployment to production.

449
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:06,840
Okay.

450
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,680
How often

451
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,800
stage deployments

452
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,880
are production?

453
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,320
And ladies and gentlemen,
I just want to say something to you. US.

454
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,600
It's very important
that you are paying attention

455
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,760
to these questions

456
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,400
because these questions that I'm literally
telling you right now that I'm asking

457
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,640
you right here, these are the questions
where students get stuck.

458
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,520
Do you know why they get stuck?

459
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,600
Because they didn't care to pay attention
or they didn't care to learn this.

460
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,360
They thought it was important. Okay.

461
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,000
So if I were you and you're
in front of the laptop right now,

462
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,520
write these questions down on your
on your notebook.

463
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,840
Okay.

464
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,160
These questions are incredibly important.

465
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,640
All right.

466
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,080
I had a student that got a six figure job
just by answering these questions. No.

467
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,200
So then it was just, by the way,
most of the questions.

468
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,560
No job, no questions,
just questions like this

469
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,880
is gone, which are very easy.

470
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,520
Questions, concerns, comments.

471
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,280
Guys, are you guys they're less excited.

472
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,200
Are you guys mentally checked out?

473
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,000
What's going on? Guys?

474
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,680
You guys need more energy.

475
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,040
We need we need energy.

476
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,880
Guys, I'm not I'm not
feeling the energy of this class

477
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,320
now. So what's going on, guys?

478
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,840
What? Talk to me. What? What is the issue?

479
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,600
And by the way,
if you need me to repeat something, ask.

480
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,520
Say it. I'll repeat it.

481
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,800
Okay, I repeat it.

482
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,720
All right. Came from work.

483
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,040
Tired and hungry. It's okay. I understand.

484
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
Take your time, you know, get some food.

485
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,560
Do what you got to do.

486
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,120
Writing things down. Cool.

487
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,600
And again, if you need me to repeat
something, don't be shy. Ask.

488
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,400
There's a lot of there's
a lot of students here

489
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,040
that probably have the same questions
that you do.

490
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,720
I've heard Jenkins is for developers.

491
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,400
No gen testers are using Jenkins.

492
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,720
My team uses Jenkins.

493
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,560
I use Jenkins all the time.

494
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,240
So it's not for developers.

495
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,920
Okay,

496
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,000
This is not going to be on canvas.

497
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,560
I'm going to share the notes
with you though.

498
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,040
But as you can tell, I'm
not going to write so many detailed notes.

499
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,800
I really want you guys
to listen and understand

500
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,640
and ask your questions.

501
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,680
Okay, So let's kind of recap

502
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,560
everything that we talked about
from the beginning of the class.

503
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,480
Okay.

504
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,120
So we talked about congratulations, right?

505
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,440
Because you guys made it.

506
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,440
You guys are gratitude,
this business right?

507
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,360
So you guys are you guys sorry.

508
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,080
This is your last classes.

509
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,840
I told you to be patient with yourself,
okay?

510
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
You have to be patient.

511
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,000
We said that Jenkins is a CI
CD tool for continuous

512
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,160
integration and continuous development.

513
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,800
We talked about what
continuous integration was, basically

514
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,640
to continuously integrate your code
with someone else's work.

515
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,680
Right?

516
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,560
So if Nas was a developer
and if he pushes his code

517
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,360
to his source code management tool
like GitHub,

518
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,320
he wants the test cases
to automatically run as soon as he pushes.

519
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,800
Well, first of all, his
his code needs to build code.

520
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,000
Once this code builds, then

521
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,920
then you can

522
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,360
design Jenkins to automatically trigger
his test cases.

523
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
Okay.

524
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,000
We talked about the idea of tools
like these being created, right?

525
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,360
And every tool is being created for one
purpose, for one purpose to make your life

526
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,120
difficult, to make your life harder

527
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,880
to use, to make it easier, right.

528
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,800
To help to see if they can find a way
to help your efficiency.

529
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,760
Right.

530
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,320
And then what can you do with Jenkins?

531
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,480
There's a future
where you can schedule jobs.

532
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,920
And there's a question here for you
What do you do in your project

533
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,800
to ensure the stability
of your application?

534
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,080
You run your small tests.

535
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,560
Does this mean that you have to run it
through automation?

536
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,240
And now

537
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,000
when you run your smoke test,
you can do it manually.

538
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,680
I was in a project once
where we were running our small test,

539
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,840
and by running I mean executing.

540
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,080
Okay, By running, I mean executing.
I'm going to put that here.

541
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,480
We're running.

542
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,040
I mean, execute

543
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,360
executing a smoke test manually, right?

544
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,560
It was just done over the top,
maybe like about 20 minutes, 20,

545
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,480
20, 30 minutes every day.

546
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,640
And with automation,
it took like 2 minutes

547
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,280
right?

548
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,160
So we talked about

549
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,520
random failures

550
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,440
and grand failures

551
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,280
with Jenkins, right?

552
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,440
We talked about this

553
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,560
with Jenkins, for example.

554
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,520
What do we say your Jenkins jobs
could fail because of what?

555
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,040
Like it could pass on your local.

556
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,600
You're running it on your laptop

557
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,840
server outage.

558
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,040
Maybe it went too fast. Right?

559
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,400
So you have to add some weight,

560
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
right? Different things like this.

561
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,440
This comes to show you. Right.

562
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,960
And this comes to show you.

563
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,560
Is Jenkins perfect?

564
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,760
No, it's it's actually not good.

565
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,280
It's like the idea of Jenkins
is fantastic, Right?

566
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,320
But a lot of things can get in the way.

567
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,920
Uh, yesterday,

568
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,800
which was Monday, and on

569
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,640
Friday, all of my Jenkins jobs at work
found all of them.

570
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,080
We had, like

571
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,560
27 Jenkins jobs.

572
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,080
They all felt

573
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,840
because of wait times.

574
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,160
Because of wait times.

575
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,800
We were curious.

576
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,320
We were like, Well, this is executed.

577
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,360
This is passing on our local machines.

578
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,560
Why is it failing?

579
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,080
Because of wait times in some areas.

580
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,840
Okay, so there it is.

581
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,000
Okay.

582
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,880
And when the developers
get the notification,

583
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,320
they're like, Hey, what happened?

584
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,280
Well, it's okay to say, Oh, our test cases
fell because we just it went too fast.

585
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,560
And they're like, okay, cool. Right?

586
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,480
So these are the issues that you will
most likely experience at work.

587
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,000
Yeah.

588
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,680
So we said that you can use Jenkins
to monitor and schedule jobs.

589
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,840
Monitor meaning like, you know,
check the status of your smoke test

590
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,320
or whatever tests
you're running, scheduled jobs.

591
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,880
You scheduled jobs to run your small test
and regression test.

592
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:50,960
Actually,

593
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,680
we don't schedule jobs.

594
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,760
You could you could
I haven't been on a project

595
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
where they schedule a job
for a regression.

596
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,920
Well, Lubo.

597
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,800
That is a fantastic question.

598
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,120
Right?

599
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,080
The question is,

600
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,440
why didn't you implement implicit
and explicit weights to begin with?

601
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,520
Well, here's the thing,

602
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,680
and that's a very good question.

603
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,440
An explicit weight
you have to explicitly specify

604
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,160
somewhere in your code
where you want that extra weight.

605
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,320
Right.

606
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,400
But what if everything's
passing in your local?

607
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,760
You don't know what step needs
that extra weight, right?

608
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,720
Does that make sense?

609
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,880
So you actually have to run your test
cases to find out where it's felling?

610
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Yeah, that's thing number one.

611
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,920
Thing number two is,

612
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,080
is the implicit weights,

613
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,040
the first of which are good idea.

614
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,840
But they here's the thing,
there's something called

615
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,240
the Selenium.

616
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,000
Selenium JSON wire protocol, right?

617
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,480
I didn't want to teach it to you, but so

618
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,880
I would talk about it. Okay.

619
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,320
So if you go on Google
and you type in Google

620
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,280
Glass, type in, do you saw

621
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,640
wire protocol, selenium?

622
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,480
Okay.

623
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,240
This right here actually discusses

624
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,080
the architecture of the Web tracker.

625
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,280
Okay.

626
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,080
And how the Web Java actually works.

627
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,280
Right.

628
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,760
So this is the concept of

629
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,920
you writing your code with Java Selenium.

630
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,080
Okay.

631
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,040
And you can write it

632
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,000
anywhere.

633
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,480
You can write it using anything, right?

634
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,640
You can use Python,
you can use JavaScript,

635
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,280
you can use Ruby,
you can use different programing languages

636
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,440
with Selenium to
to perform your test automation.

637
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,280
However,

638
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,720
your the browser,

639
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,200
the Chrome browser is not designed to read

640
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,360
Java code, it's not designed
to read Python or JavaScript.

641
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,720
It's not designed to
to read any of these languages.

642
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,840
So how does this really work
on the architectural level?

643
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,160
Okay.

644
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,840
Does anyone know

645
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,000
when you write your code
in Java and Selenium?

646
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,760
Okay, you guys all you guys know, as do
you guys just hit this play button, right?

647
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,800
Or you guys run your runners.

648
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,880
It's like just click,
not play, but. Right.

649
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,520
How do you think how do you think
this request gets made to the browser?

650
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,320
And now I can talk about this
because you guys did.

651
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,640
I heard you guys had the most amazing

652
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,880
API testing classes.

653
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
Web Java interface takes care of it.

654
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,480
No, not really.

655
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,600
What what what do you guys think?

656
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,960
I'll tell you this.

657
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,560
You guys had the most amazing Web services
classes, right?

658
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,160
So when you guys make this request,

659
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,800
okay, your Java

660
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,240
will have this open.

661
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,840
See your Java and Selenium code

662
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,600
actually get converted into the request,
gets converted into it.

663
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,840
JSON object.

664
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,360
Exactly. Very good.

665
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,880
And it needs the help of a web

666
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,640
service to help transmit that code.

667
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,720
What is the name of that web service?

668
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:38,040
What is it?

669
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,240
I mean, it's it's a rest API,
but what is the name of the what?

670
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,280
The rest assured it's not a web service.

671
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,440
Rest assure as a Java library.

672
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,120
Okay.

673
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,080
That's that's not a web service.

674
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,960
What is a

675
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,880
it's a restful web service.

676
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,800
Yeah, we already said it.

677
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,280
Russ API RESTful Web service.

678
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,320
You don't rest. Webster.
It's all the same thing.

679
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,000
Except rest assured us is, first of all,
are we clear with it?

680
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,040
Guys, rest assured is not a web service
register.

681
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,200
Sure, it is just a Java library.

682
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,240
That's just the name of it.

683
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,280
It's not Rest API.

684
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
Okay, But there is a web.

685
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,320
There's an API that is going to be used
to transmit that request.

686
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,120
You guys know what it is?

687
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,360
Yeah.

688
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,280
Unit is also library.

689
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,800
No, those are those are methods guys.

690
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,320
I'm talking about a web service.

691
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,680
There's an API.

692
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,960
It's called the Chrome driver.

693
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,760
It's called the Gecko driver

694
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,640
or whatever browser
you are communicating with.

695
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,920
Right. That is the web service.

696
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,280
That is what's going to transmit
that request to the browser.

697
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,280
Okay.

698
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,520
And when the browser,

699
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,600
the browser will understand
the JSON object.

700
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,040
Right. And they will execute
whatever it's going to execute.

701
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,520
Well, guess what?

702
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,120
When you make a request to a server,
expect

703
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,320
a what?

704
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,280
When you make a request
to a server, expect a response.

705
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,880
Right?

706
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,160
So the server is going to
the browser is going to respond.

707
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
Okay with

708
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,720
you know what

709
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,600
the JSON bar protocol says
that it's going to respond with.

710
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,120
Right.

711
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,800
And it tells you
here is a very really so resource

712
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,440
to understand, you know
selenium web driver a period right.

713
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,120
Look at this.

714
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,480
It tells you if this response

715
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,120
responds with code
seven, throw a no such element exception.

716
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,120
Right.

717
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,320
If if it throws code eight,
that means that there is no such frame.

718
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,160
Right. Look at that.

719
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,440
You guys have seen these exceptions
before. Right.

720
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,680
Still element reference exception element

721
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,320
not visible element is not selectable.

722
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,960
No such window.

723
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,760
Have you guys seen these exceptions
before?

724
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,600
It looks very familiar. Right.

725
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,280
I hope that you guys have seen
these exceptions before right.

726
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,120
So but the thing is that it's responding
with these codes and then the web service

727
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:13,080
is just converting, you know, printing out
whatever has to be printed out right.

728
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,240
You guys probably didn't know that,
but now you do and you see

729
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,440
response status codes
and go ahead, read this.

730
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,760
If you want to learn
more about how all of this works, good.

731
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,320
You don't

732
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,600
have to talk about this during interviews.

733
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,760
Right.

734
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,520
But back to what's his name,
the question that he asked Lubo.

735
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,400
Right. But this was your question.

736
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,120
Right.

737
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,400
Back to how that works.

738
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,480
And let me tell you, I think I ran
the automation here on this project.

739
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,640
I want to show you
there's something where the your reports

740
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,720
get stored

741
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,320
when you reports in the target folder.

742
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
I hope you know that. Right.

743
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,200
And then it gets stored in a cucumber
about JSON files.

744
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,080
So this is the report that gets generated.

745
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,000
Okay, This is the report.

746
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,080
Now, this is a JSON object.

747
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,680
You guys know how JSON object looks like.

748
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,800
My question is and look, it's
a very small test case.

749
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,120
You can kind of see here
the timestamp, the time it was wrong,

750
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,520
the duration, the location, basically.

751
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,160
What did you run that
name of the scenario?

752
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,640
B Now the stat is red.

753
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,560
Here's the thing. This is a report right?

754
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:37,280
Is this the report
you want to give to your team?

755
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,840
Like I'm going to give this to you
and say, hey, here's my report for today.

756
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,080
They're probably going to read it.

757
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,800
And if you give it to if you give it to

758
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,760
to your project manager,

759
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,040
they're going to be like, what is this?

760
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,320
I don't understand this. Right.

761
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,720
I don't get it.

762
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,400
And if you remember in class,
have you guys generated cucumber

763
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,480
reports?

764
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,240
Exactly.

765
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,520
So this is the first report to get
generated, which is something that is

766
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,360
specified in your pump that X And now,
ladies and gentlemen.

767
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,840
Right.

768
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,320
Let's let's go down here and let's see
what the situation is with our plug ins.

769
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,880
And this you can do this with any project,
by the way you go to them,

770
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,920
maybe a project it uses the help of.

771
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,480
Sure.

772
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,760
Plug in that's used to generate that
JSON report and is used to execute

773
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,200
your test cases using maybe
command statements in the terminal.

774
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,160
Okay.

775
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
That's what your favorite plug in is.

776
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,920
The one that gets generated.

777
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,960
We use another plug in called the Maven
Cucumber reporting provided by net

778
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,200
dot Master Thought
and this is what converts that JSON file

779
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,000
to that nice, beautiful cucumber

780
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,520
HTML report that you guys generate.

781
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,240
Does that make sense?

782
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,120
This is a MAVEN report.

783
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,040
So if you want to execute a MAVEN report,
you must specify that

784
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,840
in the heart of the MAVEN project,
which is the palm dot X amount.

785
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,400
Cool.

786
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,360
Does that make sense?

787
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,560
I feel like I gave you so much information
there, like in like a minute,

788
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,760
like you guys have questions
or what's what's the

789
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,160
you guys good

790
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,880
questions concerns and you can do this.

791
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,360
Open your framework.
Take a look take a look. Right.

792
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,600
That is how these reports are generated.

793
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,680
So actually, I don't know if I have

794
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,640
a report.

795
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,840
I don't have a full report to show you.

796
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,960
Okay.

797
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,160
But if when we run it later,
I'll show you and stuff.

798
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,920
Cool.

799
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,760
So and here's a thing.

800
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,000
Now that we've talked about these reports
and how JSON

801
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,920
protocol works and everything like that,
there's a question that Lobo asked.

802
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,120
He said, when you said this before,
Well, here's the thing.

803
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,120
The Jason protocol of the web,
Java is unreliable.

804
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:11,920
Okay?

805
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,880
And what does that mean?

806
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,320
Okay, That means that Lobo can

807
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,800
explicitly specify in his code.

808
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,080
Wait up to 15 seconds to do whatever he's

809
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,520
going to do with that Elemental element is
present or element is visible

810
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,600
and that kind of thing.

811
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,280
Right?

812
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,200
But the thing is
that sometimes execution happened so fast,

813
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,240
especially when you run
your test automation in headless mode,

814
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,400
which is what we're going to do as well,

815
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,920
to the point where it actually doesn't
wait 15 seconds, you know what I mean?

816
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:56,320
Like, it'll probably just wait
like 6 seconds and process it as it waited

817
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,400
15 seconds because of the execution time
being so fast.

818
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,840
Okay.

819
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,280
Some ways to get around
this is by increasing

820
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,960
the explicit wait time by a lot longer.

821
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,120
Okay.

822
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,320
The thing is, with that problem
is when you specify a very long

823
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,040
wait like that,
like a minute or like 2 minutes,

824
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,280
and if the Jason protocol
is being reliable in that execution,

825
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,200
it's going to take a long time
to find that element.

826
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:26,840
Okay.

827
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,680
Now, I know one

828
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,200
minute it's not a long time, but still,

829
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,800
does that make sense?

830
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
So everyone

831
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,840
and you kind of need to be careful

832
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,560
because if you have very, very long test
automation case,

833
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,520
long test cases,
let's say it takes 15 minutes to execute.

834
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,880
We have at work a single test case
that takes about 30 minutes to execute.

835
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,120
So if I'm going to go in there,

836
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,080
implement like explicit
weights everywhere, you know,

837
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,440
you could easily prolong that 30 minutes
to maybe 45 minutes

838
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,640
sometimes, you know, So
you kind of have to decide where you want.

839
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,640
Now, you may need to say this
in the interviews, Right.

840
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,400
This is this concept is important
to at least be able to explain

841
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:26,600
what these weights are, but also, it's
okay to use the hard sleeps.

842
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,800
It's fine, right?

843
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,240
You guys know that this lead method
from the thread class at Java Red

844
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,680
thread, that's deep
and you specify the time, right?

845
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
I was going to say time, right?

846
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,120
It's okay to put this. It's
okay to use this.

847
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,480
It's fine.

848
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,040
Just wait 2 seconds. Right.

849
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,360
Wait 3 seconds. That's okay.

850
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:43,600
Right.

851
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,320
And that's actually
what we do in our project, actually.

852
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,520
Yeah, you can say it. An interview.

853
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,480
I say an interview. Right.

854
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,880
But you're going to say, listen,
we tried to use the implicit

855
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,400
and explicit weights from the web Java
as much as we can,

856
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,280
but when that's not working, sometimes
we end up using hard sleeps, You know?

857
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:01,960
It's okay.

858
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,280
Say it.

859
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,240
So in your example right now,
you are running your test

860
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,200
from the palm that XML
or you were showing a dependency for it.

861
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,280
I was just showing the dependencies for
if I show like

862
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,840
how the reports get generated
and the architecture behind that

863
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,600
because look, you can run it,
you can run your

864
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,520
you can run your test cases
from your runner's classes, right?

865
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,000
You can just open your runners
right click run or whatever.

866
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,600
But that's not

867
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,520
in most cases, depending on
how you configure your your automation.

868
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,840
If you want to generate a MAVEN report,

869
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,800
then you need to run it from the Palm

870
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,840
or you need to run it in the Maven way.

871
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,520
Okay, do me a favor.

872
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,840
I don't have your project, okay?

873
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,800
You guys do me one favor, please.

874
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,360
Okay.

875
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,000
Can you guys run?

876
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,560
Just test case from your framework.

877
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,080
Just a single one. And,

878
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,160
like, just go to your runners, run it,

879
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,480
and then tell me
if a report gets stored in the first.

880
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,280
Do a maven clean.

881
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,000
You guys know how to do it?

882
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,080
Maven Clean.

883
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:31,640
Maven Clean does what?

884
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,720
Maven Clean does what

885
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,040
It cleans.

886
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,280
It cleans the target folder.

887
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,680
It cleans the target folder.

888
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,440
So when you run your when you're
when you run your runners

889
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,000
after Maven clean, then the reports
get stored in the in the target folder.

890
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,240
Right.

891
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:55,840
Okay.

892
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:03,360
And are they the beautiful pie charts,
Are they the

893
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,920
you know what some of the question marks

894
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,120
is it

895
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,320
under description to decide
what really part of my smoke does?

896
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,120
I want to know
what is the scope of my decision making?

897
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,160
Mohammad
You can talk to your team about it.

898
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,520
You can say, Hey, like

899
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,200
what do you consider like the most top
ten important test cases, right?

900
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,520
The most, like, so I can put them on here.

901
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,720
I can, you know, add them to my smoke test

902
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,840
and they will tell you

903
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,480
the question.

904
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,960
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

905
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,120
No, I got confused.

906
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,280
Are you asking me a question
or do you want me to ask you a question?

907
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,400
I don't understand.

908
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:39,960
You said. Yeah.

909
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,440
And the question mark

910
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,480
we have

911
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,080
an X is the cucumber reports
like the pie charts?

912
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,920
Oh, that was a question.

913
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,840
So no,

914
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,280
let me

915
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,560
know.

916
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,800
Is it okay with you if I can ask you to
please repeat your question?

917
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,960
I just want to know.

918
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,360
I may have missed your question.

919
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,560
Last one. What do you mean, last one?

920
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,960
There's like a lot of comments here.

921
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,000
You saying question Mark

922
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,320
cleaned previous reports.

923
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,320
So I don't see a

924
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,320
sorry, I was asking your last question.

925
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,720
Okay.

926
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,560
My question is, can you.

927
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:30,480
Okay.

928
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,200
Worries can you run your runners
first, do a maven clean

929
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,320
and then run your run?

930
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,800
Any runners just run a test case
and see if a report gets generated.

931
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,200
And if it does, can
you send me a screenshot of the report,

932
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,400
please?

933
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:52,920
Can you send me
a screenshot of the report?

934
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,200
Hope it's not a question.

935
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,480
Okay.

936
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,720
Go ahead and send me
a screenshot of the report.

937
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,240
No, no. The the pie chart report.

938
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,720
I think it's a start on that.

939
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,720
Is it

940
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,000
cucumber that html?

941
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,560
I'll do this, do this.

942
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,680
Is that how awesome I seem? See?

943
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,000
Okay. You're using intelligence.

944
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,640
Can you right click on cucumber

945
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,800
dot html can you right click on that
and when you right click on that

946
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,960
you should see something
like copy full path or something.

947
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,320
Right.

948
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,120
And when you copy that full path,
can you just open your Chrome browser

949
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,680
and paste it in the URL
search box and hit enter?

950
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,880
You should be able to see it.

951
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,080
Yeah. Open.

952
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,880
Aisha, what is this you're seeing?

953
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,200
There you go. Very good.

954
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,760
Nice.

955
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,080
Is it possible to view like this?

956
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,000
What do you mean, like this?

957
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, it doesn't look good like that.

958
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,320
I think. I don't.

959
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:13,800
I don't see.

960
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,520
Like,
I think you didn't copy the right one.

961
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:22,240
Maybe I saw.

962
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,400
That's interesting that it looks at.

963
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,360
This is what happens when you copy.

964
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:27,720
Okay,

965
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:29,760
cool.

966
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,320
Let's see.

967
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,600
All right. That's okay.

968
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,840
No worries.

969
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,240
Right.

970
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,720
But I need you to guys
to understand something.

971
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,320
When we generate what we call
MAVEN reports,

972
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,160
we can go to the renders and right
click and run the test.

973
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,440
We have to specify that.

974
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,520
And the pom that XML file.

975
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,080
I don't know if you guys ever installed
Maven.

976
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,160
Right.

977
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,400
I don't know if you guys ever installed.

978
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:01,800
Did you get.

979
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,800
No, but like did you guys, you did.

980
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,040
Okay, so can you open your terminal.

981
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,240
Are you guys
using the built in terminal and

982
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,040
you can use the terminal on

983
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,200
your laptop doesn't matter.

984
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,440
You can run it on the terminal.

985
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,880
Okay. Okay.

986
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,680
So now let me ask you this.

987
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,160
Let me do amazing clean.

988
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,240
Okay on my project.

989
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,080
Okay, cool.

990
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,840
Target folder is gone.

991
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,400
Now let me run a test.

992
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,640
Let me see something.

993
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,280
Okay.

994
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,200
So do you guys know how to run from your
terminal, or would you like to learn that

995
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,800
we know?

996
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,720
Tell me how to do it.

997
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,080
Maven test. Okay,
so that's all I have to do.

998
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:01,640
Maven test nothing else.

999
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:05,280
Maven clean test does that it

1000
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,120
press enter? No.

1001
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,320
All right, So of course I'll show you.

1002
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,960
So open the pom and where you have
your Sure fire plug in here.

1003
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,320
Can you guys go here.

1004
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:19,600
You see.

1005
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,880
I see we're configured.

1006
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,720
You guys have configuration or. No.

1007
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,520
The configuration tag.

1008
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,280
You guys have this here.

1009
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:29,920
Okay.

1010
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,400
And the US have the includes tag like I do

1011
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,000
and then here you're specifying
it. Runners.

1012
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,120
Let me comment this out so that you guys

1013
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:45,240
can see better,

1014
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,640
which is how you commit an X amount

1015
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,280
because this is an X and Y file.

1016
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,200
And the reason I want to show you this
and if you understand it,

1017
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,560
you're going to understand
everything much better.

1018
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,600
So go ahead and save it.

1019
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,000
Here.

1020
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,880
You have to specify
the name of your runners.

1021
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,040
Okay?

1022
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,840
Your name of your runners. Cool.

1023
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,400
So go ahead and do this, guys in these.

1024
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:11,720
Sure.

1025
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,600
Fire, plug in, Specify
the name of your runners class,

1026
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:19,640
the one that you want to run
and is to be spelled the exact same way.

1027
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,840
Then that Java. Okay.

1028
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,560
Do you guys go ahead and do that
right now?

1029
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:32,280
Please?

1030
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,200
You guys can go ahead and do that
right now

1031
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,880
are greatly appreciated.

1032
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,360
I'm going to try to generate a report
for you

1033
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,600
And guys, I'm here to help
you have questions.

1034
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,360
Ask like, you know,
I want you guys to be able to

1035
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,280
to to do this

1036
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,800
includes dot, dot, dot small.

1037
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,520
Okay. So you know what that means?

1038
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:59,400
That means that you want to execute
any runners class that ends what?

1039
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,160
Smoke.
You can do that as well if you want.

1040
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,400
Yeah, you can do that.

1041
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:04,800
That's fine.

1042
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,720
As long as you specify something there
that's going to work.

1043
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,240
That's okay. Right?

1044
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,840
So I'm going to go to the terminal.

1045
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,840
If you go ahead and open the terminal, do

1046
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,400
Maven clean from the terminal
to clean the target folder.

1047
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,960
Okay.

1048
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,600
And see, this was the one that I want.

1049
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,120
Okay.

1050
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,520
Both Right.

1051
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,280
Can you please go back to your palm?

1052
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,160
Yes, sir.

1053
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,200
Or let's see

1054
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,760
right here.

1055
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,280
Absolutely right here.

1056
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,160
This is what you need. Okay.

1057
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,640
The configuration tags, right?

1058
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,640
Or Madam? I'm sorry.

1059
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,600
It was just a habit. Yes, madam.

1060
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,280
But do you guys see this

1061
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,800
right here?

1062
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,160
You guys need this, this.

1063
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,400
This whole thing.
If you guys don't have it.

1064
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,600
But it looks like you do, because
I've often said that it's included it

1065
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,000
in his

1066
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,360
in his.

1067
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,760
Perfect. And you've specified something
here, right?

1068
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,880
I think you guys have that dot, dot star.

1069
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,240
Whatever.

1070
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,760
The star star slash star does start smoke,
right.

1071
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,720
And see Mohammed's.

1072
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,840
All right, cool.

1073
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,440
Right.

1074
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,920
So open your terminal.

1075
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,120
Do even clean

1076
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,240
the end

1077
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,720
and get clean.

1078
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,080
And then make sure you get to build
success.

1079
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:43,680
Just clean your target folder. Got.

1080
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,840
And then we can simply do ambient test.

1081
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,920
Okay, like MAVEN test,
let's see what happens.

1082
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,960
So if I do MAVEN test, it's
going to start compiling.

1083
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,800
Once the code, once a project compiles,
then it's

1084
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,560
going to start to build and the build
is going to happen right here.

1085
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:01,960
As you see,

1086
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,920
as I'm running a completely different test
case, ignore what I'm running.

1087
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,840
Just run.

1088
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,760
Whatever you're running.

1089
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,200
Okay, so I'm doing this.

1090
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,120
This is just application.

1091
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,360
Let's going to be automated.

1092
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,200
Execute it.

1093
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,280
It's just a form, right?

1094
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,640
We see it here.

1095
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,800
Go ahead and run yours. Please

1096
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,040
go ahead and run yours.

1097
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,160
And let me know when you guys
have finished running your work code

1098
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:39,200
right. So.

1099
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,200
All right, slow.

1100
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,960
You said slow.

1101
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,200
What is your slow?

1102
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,320
Are you saying that you are slow

1103
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,240
service website?

1104
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

1105
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,560
Build success.

1106
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,600
Nice.

1107
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,440
It's all right.

1108
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:08,640
Go. Nice job.

1109
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,240
The same. Very good.

1110
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,280
Very good. Very good.

1111
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,680
All right, then. Well, all right.

1112
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,960
Test case done. You guys ran yours.

1113
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,280
Beautiful, Right?

1114
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,320
And then the target folder

1115
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,840
will now have the cucumber HTML reports.

1116
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,440
Okay, cool.

1117
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,360
You see how you can have the.

1118
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,440
Do you guys have something similar
to what I have is called

1119
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,760
the overview hyphen features
or feature or something like that.

1120
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,680
Can you take
can you take a screenshot of your target

1121
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:50,480
folder and short show to replace?

1122
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,800
Took a screenshot of your target. See?

1123
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,960
Yeah. There you go. Perfect. Beautiful.

1124
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,640
All right, so let's

1125
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,240
rank.

1126
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,480
How do you guys open this in the browser?

1127
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,920
Right click.

1128
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,520
Was it copy relative pass?

1129
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,640
Let's see

1130
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,640
here.

1131
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:18,480
Yes. Nope.

1132
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,920
Wasn't this one copy

1133
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,240
on? Okay.

1134
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,560
There you go.

1135
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,040
See, I just copied the path of the report
and bam.

1136
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,560
Well, all right, so you can open it.

1137
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,040
You can see what's there.

1138
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,200
And it looks like it looks like
there are no screenshots.

1139
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,680
Which is

1140
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,640
which. I don't know why they're not there.

1141
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,560
We have to take a look.

1142
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,320
Okay.

1143
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,640
So you can see that
this whole scenario read.

1144
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,080
You can see the hooks,
you can see the tags, right?

1145
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,800
You can see all of that stuff go.

1146
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,440
You can see the steps and so forth.

1147
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,360
All right.

1148
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,600
But now that you understand this, okay,
and you see, here's the email file

1149
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,680
that got generated, which is in the form
all the jigsaw objects.

1150
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,200
Well,
that's actually an additional document

1151
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,040
that then gets converted to just an object
to generate that reports.

1152
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,480
Okay.

1153
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,680
Or I'm sorry, it got generated
from a JSON object to generate this page

1154
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,680
HTML report, but because of the plugins
that you guys have,

1155
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,640
that's why we see the beautiful HTML
pie charts kind of thing.

1156
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,120
All right.

1157
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,120
So the idea was that
we ran this from the Palms X amount.

1158
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,480
Okay?

1159
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,360
And this is exactly
what we have to do with Jenkins

1160
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,280
code.

1161
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,400
We have screenshots.

1162
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,360
I mean, so the real questions
that screenshots questions,

1163
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,640
any questions, guys,

1164
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,080
any at all.

1165
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,720
Anything.

1166
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,160
So let's talk about one more thing, right?

1167
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:06,920
Because

1168
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,760
and this is all related to Jenkins,

1169
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,800
by the way, everything we're talking about
is related to Jenkins.

1170
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,560
Let me ask you this, though, okay?

1171
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,520
And I want you to think about this.

1172
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,800
You're the test automation engineer
in your project.

1173
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,000
You got hired as a Q engineer.

1174
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,560
You're doing automation.

1175
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,320
And then okay, let's say
you don't have Jenkins set up,

1176
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,520
you don't have Jenkins set up.

1177
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,600
And they say, okay,
can you run the automation?

1178
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,640
And then the most important
thing for management is what

1179
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,400
the most important thing

1180
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,280
for management is what

1181
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,160
reports are reporting, right?

1182
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,480
You don't just say,
I ran the automation, We're good, right?

1183
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,440
You need to show a report.

1184
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,200
So let's say you have Jenkins,

1185
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,040
you ran this on your local
and then all of a sudden they say,

1186
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,600
hey, has seen
can you share a report with us?

1187
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,560
How would you share the report
with your team?

1188
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,960
How would how would you share the report?

1189
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:16,040
Does anyone know how you will
share the report with your team?

1190
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,560
So you're saying that you would take.

1191
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,040
No, not me.

1192
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,360
Yours does take screenshot.

1193
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:27,960
My task is didn't take screenshots.

1194
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,760
Okay.

1195
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,200
You'll get a says over email.

1196
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,200
Okay, cool.

1197
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,840
No, there's no get say.

1198
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,760
There is no get
this is just your local machine

1199
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,280
but okay you'll get over email.

1200
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,800
Interesting.
How are you going to send it over email.

1201
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:56,240
What are you going to do?

1202
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,680
Send a link,
Send the link to the report and email.

1203
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,480
Okay.

1204
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,520
Mohammed.

1205
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,880
Mohammed, you're saying
send the link to the report in the email.

1206
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:09,360
What link are you talking about?

1207
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,720
What link are you talking about?

1208
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,600
Alan We'll talk about that in just a bit.

1209
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,840
You guys are saying the report link.

1210
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,720
Okay, cool.

1211
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,920
Share me the report link right now.

1212
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,160
Show me the link to the report.

1213
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,640
Any report

1214
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,480
someone says attach it to my file.

1215
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,040
It's very good.

1216
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,480
You're going in the right direction.

1217
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,960
This ATP report.

1218
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:38,640
How did you get it?

1219
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,120
Mohammed?

1220
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:47,720
How did you get it?

1221
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,840
Why is it failing?

1222
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,200
Okay,

1223
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,840
it's failing, though.

1224
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,840
I enter, I answer what you gave me,
but it's failing.

1225
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,960
So What? Why?

1226
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,000
It's like, Hmm.

1227
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,320
That's right.

1228
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,640
Yes. Nikola.

1229
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,160
Very good, right?

1230
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,280
Because that link that you share with me

1231
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,080
will only work on your local machine.

1232
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,160
Okay? Someone else sent me the some.

1233
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,520
Someone else sent me the.

1234
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,400
The path to your to your

1235
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,320
to come report.

1236
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,280
It's html email, email, double report.

1237
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,320
Okay.

1238
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,520
How would you do that?

1239
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,960
By meeting.
Send presentation representation.

1240
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,560
Now you need to send it to them.

1241
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,560
So one, you can't send a pass, right?

1242
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,360
Because the path is just going to be
the path to your local machine.

1243
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,080
Does that make sense?

1244
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,520
And like if you're using your local
and then I use it on

1245
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,760
mine, it's not going to work.

1246
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,880
We learn that we have reports of cucumber,

1247
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,560
but no one actually told us
how to send those reports. Exactly.

1248
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,840
Well, that's why I'm here with you
on the last day on the finish line.

1249
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:08,600
Right.

1250
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,480
I'm giving you everything you need to go
and be successful.

1251
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,720
Right? That's it.

1252
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,280
That was the whole point of this, right?

1253
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,200
Because the whole point of this.

1254
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,520
Okay, cool.

1255
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,480
Let me tell you something.

1256
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,600
This is going to be a fun fact.

1257
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:25,200
You tell me
you guys said kind of the correct answer.

1258
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,560
You're saying that you would email
the report.

1259
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,400
Okay. How would you do it?

1260
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,000
Right.

1261
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,480
Well, let me
and you can try this on your own.

1262
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,080
Right.

1263
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,080
We have the the project here.

1264
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,160
Let me minimize this.
So everything looks normal.

1265
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,360
So we have the
the like everything here, right?

1266
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:49,160
And if I go to the target folder
like you guys have and I open this,

1267
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,480
I want you guys to get this overview,

1268
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,680
steal
my report and upload it here on Slack.

1269
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,760
I think you can do that.

1270
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,000
So you're going to have to

1271
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,880
button your target.

1272
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,320
We said it's in the Cucumber HMO report

1273
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,360
and it just when you see this,
I want you guys to send this to me.

1274
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,200
I want you guys to do this
file right here.

1275
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,840
If you can just go to your directory.

1276
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:26,160
I want you guys to send me this file.

1277
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,440
Oh, look at that.

1278
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,080
Why is it pasting like that? Hmm.

1279
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:32,760
Interesting.

1280
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,960
Anyone else want to try?

1281
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,080
Okay, now I want you to do this.

1282
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,800
I want you to do this.

1283
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,280
I wanted to get this to your mail report

1284
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,720
and send it to yourself in an email.

1285
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,520
Can you do that?

1286
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,200
Send it to yourself in an email,

1287
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:58,000
and then tell me what you see.

1288
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,080
So tell me what you see.
Go ahead and do it.

1289
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:01,520
So you see how it's sending it.

1290
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,000
Sending
in a very weird email format, way. So

1291
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,320
I just want
you guys to send it to yourself to see

1292
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:13,600
you will see the report,
but you won't see the pie chart report.

1293
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,360
Let me click on what Alex just sent

1294
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,480
you. Just download, okay?

1295
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,160
He downloaded this.

1296
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,480
Okay, There it is.

1297
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,280
Watch this.

1298
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,080
So this is what he sent, right?

1299
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:31,800
It looks like he was able to upload it,
but is this what you want? It?

1300
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,000
Where are the pie charts?

1301
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,680
Where's the pie chart?

1302
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,320
By the way, this is what you will get
if you send it through email.

1303
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,440
I mean, it says that the rotation,
it says the runtime,

1304
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:47,720
the operating system that was used,
but where the pie charts, where is it?

1305
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,000
Like the screenshots are here.

1306
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,640
Okay, well, there's only one screenshot,

1307
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,560
so click the link.

1308
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,040
Which one?

1309
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:57,840
This one

1310
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,480
will link.

1311
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,440
Okay, there's no pie chart,

1312
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,240
but there's no pie chart.

1313
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,000
All right. So the answer is this.

1314
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,400
And I want you guys to understand
the structure of this,

1315
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,200
because this will also apply to Jenkins.

1316
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,080
Okay.

1317
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,080
Again, everything that we are learning
and we're talking about right now,

1318
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,040
all is related to Jenkins.

1319
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,120
So I'm going to close this. Okay.

1320
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,600
So back here,
if you want to send a report to your team

1321
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,640
and if you want them to be able to see

1322
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,280
the beautiful pie charts like the way
you're sending them, you actually have

1323
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,560
to send the whole cucumber HTML report

1324
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,560
folder and all of the contents in it.

1325
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,120
Okay.

1326
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,960
So again, if you want to send the report

1327
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,600
this asiamah file

1328
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,720
this report,
you need to send this whole folder

1329
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,640
with all of the contents in it.

1330
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,320
Only then will
you be able to see the report.

1331
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,920
So someone, if you can,
please send me this folder here,

1332
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:13,440
this one on Slack, please send me the

1333
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,600
the some one of you guys
who read the text.

1334
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,360
Send it

1335
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,600
to me please.

1336
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:31,960
Do we have any volunteers?

1337
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,880
Any volunteers class.

1338
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:44,040
You guys there?

1339
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,600
That's just a pass.

1340
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,720
I need to.

1341
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,880
I need you to actually
upload the folder here

1342
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:54,160
on Slack.

1343
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,280
See it uploaded here.

1344
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,880
That's not supported. It says on Slack.

1345
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:05,400
Why is that?

1346
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,960
Because it's probably too big, Right.

1347
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,160
Added in. Is it added in. Is it.

1348
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,160
It's failing every time.

1349
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,480
Can you zip the file.

1350
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,120
Too big, Too big for slack.

1351
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,600
Zip it. How do you zip it?

1352
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,680
Just copy the you can copy the folder.

1353
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,240
We can go to desktop.

1354
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,600
I pasted here.

1355
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:31,560
Where is it?

1356
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,920
Okay, I'm going to zip it, zip

1357
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,840
it, compress it,
and then you can send this.

1358
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:43,640
Can you guys send the zip file Too
big for Slack.

1359
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:48,920
Even zip is too big.

1360
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,480
We give it a try.

1361
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,080
A type of file not supported in slack.

1362
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,680
Okay, there it is.

1363
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,240
Thank you very much.

1364
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,360
The same. Let me open the zip file.

1365
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,680
He was able to do it

1366
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,080
so I'm opening the zip file,

1367
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,720
which is right here

1368
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,280
and now.

1369
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:17,240
If I if I come this, I open the zip file,
I'm going to do the overview of futures.

1370
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,040
We see

1371
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,760
a copy.

1372
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,840
There you go. Look at that. I can see it.

1373
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:29,800
You see?

1374
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,200
That makes sense.

1375
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,000
So I'm able to see the report

1376
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,680
that has team generated.

1377
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,680
Okay, Now, he sent me the whole folder.

1378
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:46,040
Okay, Does that make sense?

1379
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:46,800
Cool.

1380
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,280
Do we have questions?

1381
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,080
Okay, so your email is is right.

1382
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,680
So your answer was right.

1383
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:00,600
You can email the zip file
and then the email just type in team.

1384
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,920
Just click on the file.

1385
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,840
That's called overview features
and then you will see the the report.

1386
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,760
There must be an easier way for this.

1387
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,680
Ahmed Yes, sir.

1388
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,800
On the local machine
there is an unfortunately

1389
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:18,480
there is not.

1390
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,240
I mean you can always take a screenshot
of this and send it to them, right?

1391
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,920
You can take a screenshot
of the report, right.

1392
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,000
But you want to be that

1393
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,880
QA engineer, right.

1394
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,320
For right now
I showed you how to do it manually.

1395
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,080
All right.

1396
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,800
We have questions and thank you very much
for sharing the report.

1397
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,320
See, thank you very much.

1398
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,560
Does that make sense to guys?

1399
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,120
Learn something?

1400
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:51,000
Do you guys feel good about life?

1401
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,040
Okay, cool.

1402
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,800
So the question is,

1403
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:58,280
now, let me ask you this again.

1404
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:02,360
If you only had your local machine kind of

1405
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,120
if you only had your local machine

1406
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,840
and you had to share a report,
how would you do it?

1407
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,680
Give me the answer.

1408
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:19,760
Now that you guys know,
how would you do it?

1409
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,600
I would.

1410
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,520
How would you how would you do it?

1411
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,680
Okay. Zip. What?

1412
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,480
Zip. And him?

1413
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,760
Zip. What exactly were you going to say
in an interview?

1414
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:36,000
He is going to say zip
file, zip the cucumber folder.

1415
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,120
The question was,

1416
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,160
now that you know how to do this, I'm
going to ask the same question

1417
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,080
I asked before
we showed you how to do all of this.

1418
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,800
I said, How would you send your report
if you only had your local machine?

1419
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,840
How would you send your Capcom report

1420
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,200
zip and tie, cucumber folder,

1421
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,840
cucumber, report folder and send it
via email.

1422
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,320
Very good.

1423
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:05,080
Go. Does that make sense?

1424
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,560
All right. Very good. Very good, class.

1425
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:13,480
So go ahead and take a Let's do
10 minutes.

1426
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,760
So call. Come back. 825.

1427
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,720
How do you
how often is it deployment to production?

1428
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,080
That depends on how often your cut

1429
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:26,520
your project has releases
and we're going to talk about that

1430
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,040
if you want.

1431
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:32,640
We're going to talk about this
because it's different for every project.

1432
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:32,840
Okay.

1433
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,160
So go ahead, guys,

1434
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,840
and let's come back at 825.

1435
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:43,560
All right.

1436
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,960
Break down. That's right.

1437
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,080
So you kavalan you want taking our review
on Asia, It's up to you.

1438
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,600
We're going to start at 825.

1439
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:54,760
You want me to take it?

1440
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:03,080
You didn't take two days off
Going to do it. It's

1441
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,680
all right. I will wait for you.

1442
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:12,720
No worries.

1443
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,440
All right.

1444
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,800
And if you guys are here
and you guys have any questions,

1445
01:12:17,120 --> 01:13:10,800
please ask away.

1446
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,880
Do you prefer your idea
better than until the day?

1447
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,040
Absolutely.

1448
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:24,000
The Visual Studio is amazing.

1449
01:13:24,000 --> 01:14:06,720
Yeah, it's very powerful as well.

1450
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:14,160
Any questions?

1451
01:14:14,160 --> 01:23:04,920
Concerns?

1452
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:10,280
Lots of guys.

1453
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,640
As usual.

1454
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:16,320
I thought I'd give you some extra time,
you know,

1455
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,360
because you guys don't come back on
time for your break.

1456
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:26,760
So it's all good.

1457
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:29,600
And some of you guys are still on your
break.

1458
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,720
So let's just wait.

1459
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:35,760
Let's wait and let's wait. So

1460
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:43,200
Lubo, Luba, Luba, Lupo.

1461
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:43,720
It's okay.

1462
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,680
Just let let's just wait for them
then take your 15, 20 minutes.

1463
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,840
Whatever it's for. Lubo

1464
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,320
What are the phases of

1465
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:14,240
the software development lifecycle?

1466
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:18,200
You just say next,

1467
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:27,280
if you want to go to the next question.

1468
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:51,720
Okay.

1469
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:53,920
Write maintenance.

1470
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,520
All right.

1471
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:05,760
When the when does user acceptance
testing happen?

1472
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:14,760
When does user acceptance testing happen?

1473
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:20,480
Why would it be after deployment?

1474
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,120
A Well, when you guys say deployment, like

1475
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,200
what do you guys talking about deployment?

1476
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:25,960
Where

1477
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,720
final stage of development

1478
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,920
not the final stage of development

1479
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,720
because development is done.

1480
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:48,040
What environments that

1481
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,840
Oh man, don't
tell me you guys forgot these concepts.

1482
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,080
These are concepts
that could get you a job that just

1483
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:01,040
looks like we have to revisit them, right?

1484
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:08,200
Looks like we have to revisit them.

1485
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,200
That's all right.

1486
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,320
Take a deep breath.

1487
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,000
Yes, I know.

1488
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,320
We're going to have to study.

1489
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,240
It's all right.

1490
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,480
Delivered to the customer.
What do you mean?

1491
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,920
What is what do you say or what?

1492
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,080
What's what does that mean?

1493
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:29,760
Delivery to the deployment of the product,

1494
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:35,800
to the customer.

1495
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:40,880
We're going to talk about this.

1496
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,640
Will you take some interview prep classes?

1497
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:44,840
I actually I don't think I will.

1498
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,760
I'm not sure.

1499
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:50,680
Abdoul You're kind of right. Right.

1500
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:55,680
But you need to think of it
in terms of to use the appropriate words

1501
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:59,280
like, you know, when deployment is done
to the stage environment.

1502
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:02,080
That's where they do their testing, right?

1503
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:05,560
That's where the client tests.

1504
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,400
Right. And

1505
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,880
but the question is, when does it happen?

1506
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:12,720
Right.

1507
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,800
When when in your project does it happen?

1508
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,400
And that's what we have to revisit

1509
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:27,600
that we will revisit on that.

1510
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,080
But I'm glad that you were able
to remember some of it.

1511
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:32,280
So that's good

1512
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:40,440
questions.

1513
01:27:40,440 --> 01:28:01,720
Anybody, when the test

1514
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,880
when the test process theory, what is

1515
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:14,160
are you asking me a question?

1516
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:18,160
Oh, it does not start in the requirement

1517
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:22,720
space.

1518
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,280
Nope.

1519
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,560
All right. Are we back? We are back.

1520
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,240
So that's it.

1521
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:31,160
I give you guys some time
and let's get this party started.

1522
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,920
So listen to what I'm going to sing.

1523
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:36,960
Okay? We are going to start with Jenkins.

1524
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,840
We're just going to we kind of talked
about what Jenkins is, right?

1525
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:44,280
We're going to go in there
and I'm going to tell you what to do.

1526
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:45,120
Listen,

1527
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:50,200

code, just like

1531
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,880
if I tell you not to do something,
don't do it.

1532
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,720
Remember, does those good old days

1533
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:12,960
where we found out
that there were some kids in this class?

1534
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,440
Do you guys remember?

1535
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,920
Right, Exactly.

1536
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:22,120
So this is I hope that you have.

1537
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:24,480
If you were once a kid,
I hope that you have grown up

1538
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,200
at this point in class.

1539
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,120
Okay, So.

1540
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,560
Well, let's hope for the best.

Who told you to log in?

1568
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,120
I see it. I do it.

Lumo do.

1572
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:00,120
You should not have shown the instructor
only part.

1573
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,080
I trust you guys.

1574

Goodness.

1591
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:46,320
All right, well, let's get started.

1592
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,880
All right, So log in.

1593
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:51,000
And I'm going to log in
with my credentials.

1594
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,320
The ones that say instructor only.

1595
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,040
Okay, so this is yours.

1596
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,520
Log on, please.

1597
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:02,640
And I'm already logged in by the list.

1598
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:10,880
When you guys log in, let me know.

1599
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,800
Nice, nice, nice.

1600
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:14,640
Very good.

1601
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:23,560
It wasn't so hard, was it?

1602
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:25,200
So this is Jenkins.

1603
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,880
Let's talk about a few things here.

1604
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,240
This is the what we see right here,
at least what most of us

1605
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:31,080
are seeing right here.

1606
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,480
And ignore all of this on top.

1607
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:36,120
All these things that say pipeline,
everything like that.

1608
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,680
I'll explain what a pipeline is.

1609
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:41,120
If we have time tomorrow,
we will create a pipeline

1610
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,680
just so that you can have an idea
on what it is.

1611
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,680
It's not necessary.

1612
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,680
And this is stuff that you

1613
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:56,640
most likely will not be doing at work.

1614
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,920
There's only so much a tester
does at work, at least from experience.

1615
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,680
And I've been on multiple projects
where we've just Jenkins

1616
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,160
If the developers are using Jenkins,

1617
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:11,640
then they actually take responsibility
for a lot of the tasks

1618
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,080
that happen on Jenkins.

1619
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,120
So at most Okay.

1620
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,480
And listen to this at most.

1621
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,520
Jenkins You will use Jenkins

1622
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,800
just to monitor it, schedules
your job, sets it

1623
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:28,200
and what we're going to do
is we are going to create jobs.

1624
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,440
We're just going to mess around with it.

1625
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,040
We're going to play with it,
we're going to

1626
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,360
do something and that's it.

1627
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,040
Okay.

1628
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,720
Does that make sense?

1629
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:40,440
Now, the creating jobs

1630
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,640
part, for example,
and I just kind of want to say this right?

1631
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,080
When I create a smoke job,

1632
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,520
you only

1633
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,400
have to create it once
and you can just use that same smoke job.

1634
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:54,440
I have using the same Jenkins job
as my project

1635
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:57,480
for the last year and a half.

1636
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,000
So it's actually been a year and a half

1637
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:03,640
since I've created a new job.

1638
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:06,760
Actually, no, I created one last month,
but aside from that,

1639
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:12,640
it's really been a year and a half
since I created a job.

1640
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:16,800
So you're not going to be required
to create jobs all the time.

1641
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,920
Does that make sense?

1642
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,440
Like, this is just the thing
that is pretty much done.

1643
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:27,000
Like maybe once you just keep using it,
kind of like when you develop

1644
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
your framework, you don't develop
your framework every right.

1645
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,440
It's already developed.

1646
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:35,240
Like if I were to ask
you exactly everything

1647
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:38,640
that's in your Common methods class,
then you probably know what's in there.

1648
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:42,000
But it's not like you're going to remember

1649
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,600
the exact code of it
because you don't do it every day.

1650
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,720
It's already been developed.

1651
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,240
Does that make sense? That does.

1652
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:54,240
Okay, so just keep that in mind.

1653
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,480
But so this is what we're going to do.

1654
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,080
So let's talk about this.

1655
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,240
This a

1656
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,720
Jenkins

1657
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:05,920
UI, these pipelines ignore them here.

1658
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:09,520
What we see is we see a status
and we see the weather

1659
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:12,680
report.

1660
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:16,520
Basically, depending on your build result,
Jenkins

1661
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,520
likes to use

1662
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,440
what they call weather reports,
which is kind of funny.

1663
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,440
Okay,
because like if it passes, it's sunny.

1664
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,320
If it felt there's like this
thunderstorm, scary

1665
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:34,320
thunderstorm kind of thing they just knew
we had kids in this class, right?

1666
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,480
So they were like,
hey, let's throw pictures in here.

1667
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:38,400
Right.

1668
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,040
And that that's that's what happened.

1669
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,080
So To make this more interactive for you.

1670
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,960
This was this was added here. Right.

1671
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,040
And they say, hey,
I think picture with the sun

1672
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:53,720
and some clouds just to show them
that their bills are inconsistent.

1673
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,800
Maybe they will understand like this.

1674
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,000
But anyway, you can see all the sun's

1675
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,880
all the here
a little cute little sun's here, right?

1676
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:06,280
And this means that it's good
everything passed.

1677
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:07,560
Okay?

1678
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,000
And here this means.

1679
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
What do you think this means? Like fell?

1680
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:16,560
I mean, do you think this means pass?

1681
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,920
I mean, spell catastrophic? Exactly.

1682
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,520
And you can see here

1683
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,080
on the side, it's
also there's also a little circle.

1684
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,200
And it just Right.

1685
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,360
And then these say success.

1686
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:32,560
Okay, when this one is like this color,
it just means it wasn't built.

1687
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,320
Okay, cool.

1688
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,240
All right. Okay.

1689
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:42,240
So here these are all all of these, by
the way, are Jenkins jobs, each of them.

1690
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:45,560
So I'm not sure how many we have here.

1691
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,880
We have a lot.

1692
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:48,000
Okay.

1693
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,360
But just ignore all of these here.

1694
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,000
Okay?

1695
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,600
Does that make sense?

1696
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,640
When we create a Jenkins job,
I'm going to tell you

1697
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,520
to follow a naming convention
so that you can easily look up your dog.

1698
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:04,760
Please don't touch anybody else's job.

1699
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:05,200
Okay?

1700
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:08,040
This is again, for your learning purposes,

1701
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,360
you know, for you and stuff at work,

1702
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,600
there may be some access limited to you.

1703
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,040
So you may not, you know,

1704
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,000
just don't don't,
don't just don't touch anyone else's job.

1705
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,920
So let's click on new item on the left.

1706
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,680
And as your naming convention, enter

1707
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:30,840
first job.

1708
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,760
Okay.

1709
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,400
And put your name here.

1710
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:36,240
Your name.

1711
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:38,880
Okay. I'm going to let you do this first.

1712
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,240
And by the way, don't type
your name, type in your actual name.

1713
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:46,320
So for example, type in instructor

1714
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,560
and instructor code.

1715
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:54,880
You guys will put your name.

1716
01:37:54,880 --> 01:38:03,640
Let me know if you have any issues
following instructions.

1717
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,920
Okay. Very good.

1718
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:06,680
Very good.

1719
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,520
Very good. Very good.

1720
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,360
Okay.

1721
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,680
You guys will also use we're going to use.

1722
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,240
Okay, let's take this step by step.

1723
01:38:16,240 --> 01:38:20,360
So click on MAVEN project
because that's what we want to do.

1724
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:22,920
And by the way,
you can create different types of jobs.

1725
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,320
We can create pipelines

1726
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:27,960
here, folders and stuff like that,
but click on me, then project

1727
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:32,080
and then once this is done, as everyone
done, like you guys entered this,

1728
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,440
you clicked on MAVEN project.

1729
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,000
Okay, okay.

1730
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:41,400
Does anyone need me to wait for them?

1731
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:42,800
Anybody

1732
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,160
know you're good?

1733
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:47,520
Five, four, three, two, one.

1734
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,880
All right, so you're going to scroll down
and you're going to click okay

1735
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,960
when you click okay, your Jenkins job.

1736
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,360
Hold on. Wait for it. It's loading.

1737
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,760
Go ahead and click. Okay. By the way.

1738
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,560
Go ahead and just click. Okay.

1739
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,040
It's a little slow because so many people
are accessing the same server.

1740
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:08,160
So just let it do

1741
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:12,280
its thing.

1742
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:14,120
Okay, cool.

1743
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:18,000
Now listen to what I'm going to say,
what I'm going to show you.

1744
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:23,400
All right.

1745
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,080
Still loading.

1746
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:27,680
Okay. I will wait for you.

1747
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:30,480
Shows me Harry shows a screenshot

1748
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,640
wait.

1749
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,080
Job already exists
with the executive name.

1750
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,560
First name

1751
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,000
Jenkins joke.

1752
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:44,200
You know have you ever created a name?

1753
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,040
Let me see. Mario.

1754
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:49,280
What's going on here?

1755
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:49,800
Mario

1756
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,080
Abedi.

1757
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:53,960
Oh, let me ask you this, Marieme.

1758
01:39:53,960 --> 01:40:01,040
How many times did you click okay?

1759
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,440
You probably clicked it a few times.

1760
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:04,560
And you know what? Nice.

1761
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,000
Because yeah, if you click that.

1762
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,320
Okay, so first of all, wait for me.

1763
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:09,320
Yeah, exactly.

1764
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:12,800
So it already created a job, but because
it's so slow and you create, you click.

1765
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,920
But again, it was too slow to show you
that the job actually got created.

1766
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,040
So go back and look for it.

1767
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,360
It's going to be there.

1768
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:21,760
Okay, But wait for me. Hold on.

1769
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,120
Wait, wait, hold on, Wait.

1770
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:25,560
Before you look for it, please wait.

1771
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,920
I'm waiting for everyone
to reach this page.

1772
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,840
Okay, I'll show you.

1773
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,920
I'll show you what to look for It.

1774
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,040
Just wait for me.
If you couldn't find your.

1775
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,600
If it didn't work, just wait for me, okay?

1776
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,600
I'll show you where it is

1777
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,120
okay for the rest of you.

1778
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,200
If you're here, that's good.

1779
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:45,000
Okay.

1780
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Yeah. So are we good?

1781
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:51,000
All right, now let's go back and look for
the jobs were created.

1782
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,960
So what I'm going to do is I'm going
to click on Jenkins right here this link.

1783
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,920
So go ahead and click on Jenkins
and let's look for your your job.

1784
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:03,520
You can do search or you can do control F
on your keyboard type in your name.

1785
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:09,040
So I was an instructor.

1786
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:10,440
Let's see what comes up.

1787
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:10,760
Okay.

1788
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,640
If that doesn't come up,
then I need you guys to do this.

1789
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:20,040
Control F or command F if you're
using a mac and, look for what you have.

1790
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,760
Instructor You see, minus there.

1791
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:26,760
So, Mary, on this,
if you did yours, what is your name?

1792
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,360
Mariam or Yo Guido.

1793
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:31,360
You see, your

1794
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,720
name is there, You'll get it,
you see it, it's there.

1795
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:35,720
Okay.

1796
01:41:35,720 --> 01:41:38,320
So if you find it,
go ahead and click on it.

1797
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:39,600
Mariam.

1798
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,000
Mariam, your name is there.

1799
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,760
You see it? It's there.

1800
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,000
Is there anyone else that's looking it

1801
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:49,880
on? Mac?

1802
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:52,560
It's command F on your keyboard,
command F,

1803
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,600
and then this little search bar
will come up here

1804
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,600
and then like if you want to

1805
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,640
look for your name, type in a Lenny.

1806
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,520
Hello, Lenny.

1807
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:06,760
And there is a Lenny Jenkins job,
which, by the way, shows me you didn't

1808
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,720
the naming convention, right,

1809
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:14,920
Lenny?

1810
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:15,600
Okay.

1811
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:20,760
Are we good for the rest of you?

1812
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:21,080
All right.

1813
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:26,840
Can I move forward?

1814
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,840
Let's open Lenny, I guess.

1815
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:35,040
What's the situation, Commander?

1816
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,800
And then when you type in commander,
you can search up

1817
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,160
or you can just look for it.

1818
01:42:40,160 --> 01:42:42,480
But looking for it's
going to take a while.

1819
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,880
But it also looks like you didn't
follow the naming conventions.

1820
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,400
So, like your name is I think I found it.

1821
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,360
And it's this one.

1822
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:52,040
It's right here. A Lenny.

1823
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,640
Lenny. Okay. Right, right here.

1824
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,640
This is your job,
the one that you created.

1825
01:42:55,640 --> 01:43:00,000
This. You

1826
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:06,680
know.

1827
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:07,640
Very good.

1828
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,880
Very good. Very good.
Now don't do anything.

1829
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:11,880
Just wait

1830
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:13,800
and wait for the class.

1831
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,160
You either can be impatient right away.

1832
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:20,760
We're a team.

1833
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,320
Can I change? Don't worry about it.

1834
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,760
You already didn't
follow the instructions,

1835
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,120
So just click on it and open it
and then let me know when you're there.

1836
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,320
Just try to follow instructions

1837
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:33,960
as we go.

1838
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:44,240
We good, Lenny?

1839
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:44,720
We're good.

1840
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:53,280
We're waiting for you.

1841
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,160
I'm going to find mine.

1842
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,880
I'm going to click on it.

1843
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,720
Bam, Right there.

1844
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,280
Thumbs up.

1845
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:05,560
If we're here.

1846
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:07,720
All right. Very good.

1847
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,320
Okay, Awesome.

1848
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:10,920
Right

1849
01:44:11,960 --> 01:44:16,320
now, let's take a look.

1850
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,480
This is our first Jenkins
job. Congratulations.

1851
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,560
Give yourself a round of applause.

1852
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:22,040
You created your first Jenkins
job. That wasn't so hard, right?

1853
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,520
Good stuff.

1854
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:27,640
Good stuff.

1855
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:32,880
Yes. All right, so let's configure this.

1856
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:37,080
Let's go to configure
and let's do some really cool stuff.

1857
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:43,440
So everyone click on
configure to the last.

1858
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,360
Okay?

1859
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,240
Let's just in the description, say

1860
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:51,320
this is my this is my first day at school.

1861
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:53,880
This is my first Jenkins job right here.

1862
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:55,080
Okay.

1863
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:57,000
This is my first Jenkins job.

1864
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,280
Go ahead and write it down.

1865
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,640
This is my first Jenkins job.

1866
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:01,680
Go ahead. In that your name?

1867
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:04,560
So I'm going to put instructor
Add your name.

1868
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,680
Christine. Oh, it's floating away.

1869
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:11,760
So a lot of us are using this.

1870
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,840
Yes, sir.

1871
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:13,880
I mean, yes, ma'am.

1872
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:19,000
That we will slow down or slow down.

1873
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
It's okay. We're all using it.
That's fine.

1874
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,200
That's why it's a little slow.

1875
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:43,320
That's okay.

1876
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,840
Batch 11 touch of this

1877
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,840
or something like that.

1878
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:59,040
Right?

1879
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,680
It's still loading.
All right, we're going to wait.

1880
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:06,640
I need you guys to press.

1881
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,760
No one said why? Why?

1882
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:09,760
Why would you go to work?

1883
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:15,000
When did I say anything about workspace?

1884
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:19,880
Confused.

1885
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:20,400
What?

1886
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:31,320
What did you miss?

1887
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:34,960
Yeah, you click on configure on the left,
click on configure

1888
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:41,080
and it'll bring you here.

1889
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,560
Mustafa, click on configure.
I think that's what you're talking about.

1890
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:44,480
Remote stuff.

1891
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:47,040
Like what do you click on on the left

1892
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,960
click on configure

1893
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:58,280
error.

1894
01:46:58,280 --> 01:46:58,760
What do you mean?

1895
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:05,880
Are? Alanna
That's a very good question, right?

1896
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:08,080
So think about it.

1897
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,680
If you need a small job done
and you have a test,

1898
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:16,480
you have a team of testers,
how many jobs should you create for smoke?

1899
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:17,520
Just one.

1900
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,440
So maybe only one person
gets to create it, right?

1901
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,760
You all use the same one
when I click on configure.

1902
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,040
Okay. Can you refresh the page please?

1903
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,920
Can you refresh the page

1904
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,560
and see if it works

1905
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:47,640
for the rest of you over here?

1906
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:49,360
So let's type in.

1907
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:55,520
This is my first Jenkins job, okay?

1908
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,360
And then once you've done that,
then do the following.

1909
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,760
This is how we properly say what Jenkins

1910
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:06,040
You want to click, play

1911
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:07,840
and save,

1912
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,840
and then it'll bring you back here? Yes.

1913
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:13,040
Put your names there like I had.

1914
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,320
This is my first, you know. That's fine.

1915
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:34,960
Go ahead and do it.

1916
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,960
Click Save and then click apply.

1917
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:40,400
Well, this is what I'm going to show you.

1918
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,840
I'm going to show you again.

1919
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:48,200
All I did was like, click on configure.

1920
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:51,440
And then here in the description
I just opened, this is my first Jenkins

1921
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:53,840
job, Okay?

1922
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:57,520
And then once you type and enter your
name, don't have instructor, by the way.

1923
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:02,080
And then I just clicked on the proper way
to save us.

1924
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:06,960
Click on Apply
and then saved and Saved takes you back

1925
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,920
here. Yup.

1926
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:15,400
Appliance saved.

1927
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:23,680
Cool, cool cool cool

1928
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,000
cool cool. Cool.

1929
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,840
Class. Are we here?

1930
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,240
You guys still there?

1931
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:33,920
Are we.

1932
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:34,680
Is it loading?

1933
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:42,280
Is are we good or what's the
what's the situation. 200

1934
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:44,440
good.

1935
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:47,760
All right, so now let's go back
here, Let's click on configure

1936
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,960
and let's continue to make some changes

1937
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:59,400
to to the job.

1938
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:06,960
And of course we have to wait
because it takes forever to load.

1939
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,800
Okay, We're here.

1940
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:11,000
All right, you ready?

1941
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:11,760
Here we go.

1942
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:15,160
So we're going to do
is I'm going to scroll down.

1943
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:17,680
I'm going to say JDK, don't do anything.

1944
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:21,240
Just leave it like this system. Okay,

1945
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:25,880
So you can select GitHub project here,
but just uncheck it.

1946
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:28,560
Don't do this. This project,
this parameter.

1947
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,760
Okay, let's do something here.

1948
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,200
Click on this.

1949
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,960
This project parameter tries.

1950
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,000
Oh, and by the way.

1951
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,840
Okay, don't do anything.

1952
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:38,920
Don't. Don't do anything. It's okay.

1953
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,520
Just watch my screen. Okay?

1954
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:41,360
Just watch my screen.

1955
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,880
Please don't do anything.

1956
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:47,480
I'm going to go back. Go,

1957
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:48,240
going to leave this space.

1958
01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:53,640
I'm going to go back to here and you see
how I have build Now it's just a button.

1959
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,880
If I click on it,

1960
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,160
there's nothing is going to happen
because there's really nothing.

1961
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:02,160
Well, there's two bills are filling and.

1962
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,880
They're failing
because there's not enough.

1963
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:06,000
There's nothing to happen.
Like there's nothing there, Right?

1964
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:08,400
There's nothing to build done.

1965
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:12,720
I clicked it twice and it's well, it's
going to come again.

1966
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:15,520
It's the third time or failure. Right.

1967
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:18,960
But you see how it's just a button
that says build now.

1968
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,240
Okay. And don't do anything.

1969
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:25,360
But now we want to make this job
dynamic as well.

1970
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,160
Okay.

1971
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:29,880
And actually,
we'll do this after you guys do this.

1972
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:32,880
But the thing is it's taking so long
to load that far enough, we should do

1973
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:33,480
it right now.

1974
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:34,920
All right.

1975
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,200
So how about this? Let's do this.

1976
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,760
You see where it says
source code management

1977
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:43,080
right here.

1978
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:46,200
You see that?

1979
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:48,240
Click on get.

1980
01:51:48,240 --> 01:51:49,440
Okay, click on Get.

1981
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:52,680
Now, everyone pass for just a second.

1982
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:54,720
Everyone pause for just a second.

1983
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:56,560
Let's understand

1984
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:58,640
some things first before we just start

1985
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:01,600
clicking buttons and doing that
and then just building.

1986
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:05,600
We need to understand
what is going on right?

1987
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:09,200
So you guys have the framework
on your local machine, right?

1988
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:10,920
In your ontology,

1989
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:13,320
You know some of them, right?

1990
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,360
We all have our projects
in our local machine,

1991
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:18,760
but we, our projects are also where

1992
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,040
in GitHub, right?

1993
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:26,640
Exactly. Our projects are there.

1994
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:29,040
So we have to tell Jenkins

1995
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,640
that our project is on GitHub.

1996
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:33,000
Okay.

1997
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,520
We cannot tell Jenkins
that our project is on our local machine

1998
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,280
because if we wanted to run it

1999
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:40,520
from our local machine,
that means we have to install.

2000
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:44,400
Jenkins On your computers,
you have to connect these ports,

2001
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,680
you have to do all this crazy
installation part.

2002
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:49,800
Whereas here we just logged into Jenkins

2003
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:53,760
because it's being hosted
on the different server.

2004
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:56,160
It's being hosted somewhere. Okay.

2005
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:58,680
But the thing is here,

2006
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:03,320
we need to tell Jenkins
that our project is on GitHub.

2007
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:07,560
Okay, does that make sense?

2008
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:11,360
And it's going to use that project
and build it.

2009
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,840
So let's go to get Hub.
You have to go to get Hub.

2010
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:18,080
Let me know if you're on GitHub
and what is the

2011
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,080
what is the name of your batch

2012
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:24,600
guys like,
what is the name of the repository?

2013
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,760
Is that Cucumber framework Batch 11?

2014
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:29,720
Is that yours?

2015
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,880
Okay, so let's click on this.

2016
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,560
Let's get the code,

2017
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,920
click on code and copy
this, the project URL.

2018
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:41,560
Okay, copy the project and we can do this

2019
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:46,200
question, this website, what we use, it's
not real.

2020
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:50,600
Jenkins No, this is real.

2021
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:52,120
This is why would not be real?

2022
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:55,240
Jenkins This is real. JENKINS

2023
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:58,680
But obviously we're just practicing there.

2024
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,240
That's why. Because we're just practicing,

2025
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,040
you know,

2026
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,200
that's why it's not secure.

2027
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:07,160
Obviously, at work.

2028
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:08,840
It will be secure.

2029
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:11,720
Okay, Okay.

2030
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:14,480
Does that answer your question? Alex

2031
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:16,880
Right, Yeah. So,

2032
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:20,680
okay, no, don't,
don't get your own project.

2033
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:23,040
Get, get a copy.

2034
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,440
This one, the main project.

2035
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:26,560
The reason for that is because I feel like

2036
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:30,200
some of you guys have code in your project
that are going to fail.

2037
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:34,360
Okay, so just use this one.

2038
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:34,800
Okay?

2039
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,080
Just use this one for now.

2040
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:38,160
Okay?

2041
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:41,160
And then later we will create more jobs
and you can do

2042
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:45,680
as you please.

2043
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:46,320
Cool.

2044
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:48,440
All right.

2045
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:49,680
Very good.

2046
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:53,640
So now what I'm going to do is copy
this URL

2047
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:58,200
and I'm going to go back to Jenkins
and I'm going to place the repository

2048
01:54:58,200 --> 01:55:01,200
URL here.

2049
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:03,960
Go ahead and do that.

2050
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:09,520
Go ahead and do that.

2051
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:10,720
Did it go?

2052
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:14,480
And for your credentials,
please choose the following

2053
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:22,200
on that. Hmm.

2054
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:29,440
Think about this.

2055
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,560
Hold on, hold on, guys.

2056
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:33,480
Hold on.

2057
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:39,360
Okay.

2058
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,400
I want to see which one of these
we're going to use.

2059
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:44,040
I can't see the password. So

2060
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,840
can we use

2061
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:49,040
to think about this?

2062
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:50,480
Can we just use this one?

2063
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:53,320
The one that's a syntax technology
slash star.

2064
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,680
Star, star, star, star. Diego
Jenkins token.

2065
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:59,400
You select that one to

2066
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,840
go ahead and selected.

2067
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,320
Okay.

2068
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:07,680
All right.

2069
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:08,360
All right.

2070
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:11,600
Now let's

2071
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:14,280
let's click, apply and save.

2072
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:17,160
Oh, and one more thing before you do that,
you see how it says

2073
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:21,200
the branches
to build the branch specify to

2074
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:25,160
this is going to run the project
on Master branch.

2075
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:29,720
But if you had other branches right,
you would just create them here.

2076
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:31,600
It looks like there's only one branch,

2077
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:34,680
but if you have different branches
like you know your own branch

2078
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:38,920
and you want to run just your branch,
only then you would change the name

2079
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,320
of that branch here. Okay,

2080
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:44,760
cool.

2081
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:48,040
Okay, let's, let's scroll down.

2082
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:50,560
Let's just quickly do an apply and save.

2083
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,480
We're going to come back here.

2084
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:54,640
Okay? Very good.

2085
01:56:54,640 --> 01:57:00,760
And then let me know once we're back here.

2086
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:03,120
Done.

2087
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:03,720
Okay,

2088
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:08,200
so now we have a what do we do there?

2089
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:11,280
We basically told Jenkins
where our GitHub project is, right?

2090
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:15,600
We told it we had to tell it
where our GitHub project is

2091
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:19,360
and we had to give it its credentials
so that it can clone the project.

2092
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:20,600
Okay.

2093
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,480
Jenkins Pretend as as a person
who has their computer

2094
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:28,720
and they want to run their project
on their computer,

2095
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:32,280
okay, Can we think of it that way?

2096
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:32,880
Right?

2097
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:36,400
Pretend that Jenkins is a person
that has a laptop

2098
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:41,560
and you're telling that person
to run your automation at any time,

2099
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:45,480
and he needs your GitHub credentials
to clone the project

2100
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,800
and to do whatever
it is that you want. Okay,

2101
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:52,160
That's what the situation is here. Go

2102
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:11,440
now. We talk now.

2103
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:13,520
Let's play build now. Just click it once.

2104
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:14,960
Let's see what.

2105
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,240
Let's see what's going to happen.

2106
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:18,400
Just let it click.

2107
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,880
Just Let it, let it click at once.

2108
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:24,120
Let's see what what's happens

2109
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:26,200
Don't go and click Get so many times

2110
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:29,120
right here.
There's a button here that says build.

2111
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,640
Now just click that. What?

2112
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:36,360
Just click it once got my permalink.

2113
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:38,360
It doesn't show any history.

2114
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:39,320
What do you mean? Permalink links?

2115
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:43,800
Doesn't show any history.

2116
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:45,600
Okay, let me

2117
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:50,520
refresh it.

2118
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:51,000
Okay.

2119
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:54,800
And if when I refreshed it,
you can see that the project is building,

2120
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:56,040
something is happening.

2121
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:58,080
That's a good. Yes.
That's what we want to see.

2122
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:01,760
Now, it's going to fail
because it's just going to fail.

2123
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:04,440
Right?
But it's building. That's what we wanted.

2124
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,200
Okay.

2125
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:09,640
Because Diego tried build.

2126
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:11,320
We didn't.

2127
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:12,920
What what's I mean.

2128
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:13,200
Yeah.

2129
01:59:13,200 --> 01:59:17,520
So I'm going to refresh this page,
try to refresh it.

2130
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:18,640
So we see a build status.

2131
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:20,800
So it's it's running, right?

2132
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,600
It's running and it looks like very good.

2133
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:25,320
Just let's just wait

2134
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:28,520
on actually
go ahead and click on the little circle.

2135
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:30,800
Okay. The little ball right here.

2136
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,520
Go ahead and click on it.

2137
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:36,360
And when we click on it, it's
going to take some time to to load.

2138
01:59:36,360 --> 01:59:38,800
But you can see a console output

2139
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:42,760
that it's supposed to show you
what's going on.

2140
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:46,240
But I guess because
we're using this so much, there's here

2141
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,520
the progress shows

2142
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:52,800
a screenshot of you
see something here, the console output

2143
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:58,000
minus still mine is still building
wonderful.

2144
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,400
That's exactly what you should be seeing.

2145
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:05,240
But for some reason
miners are still loading.

2146
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:07,680
Oh, there it is. Okay, so

2147
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,160
you see, let's read the console.

2148
02:00:10,160 --> 02:00:10,680
Right?

2149
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,440
It says right here cloning

2150
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:16,360
the get the remote repository.

2151
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:18,840
What repository? This one.

2152
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,960
You see what I mean?
It's cloning it, right?

2153
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:25,000
Because Jenkins is a person
that has a laptop

2154
02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:28,120
that needs to clone their

2155
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:29,880
their

2156
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:32,920
you know, the project
we really talked about this all.

2157
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:34,000
But then look at this.

2158
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,640
Get in it. Right.

2159
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:41,320
So it looks like there it looks like
Jenkins is trying to initialize

2160
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:44,480
a git directory and Jenkins, that's
what get in.

2161
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:45,560
It does.

2162
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:49,120
And then here it's just getting
the versions is verifying some things.

2163
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:53,640
And there's a lot of stuff here
that you don't need to understand at

2164
02:00:53,680 --> 02:00:54,600
the last Oh, look at this.

2165
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:58,040
The last commit
message says API class date.

2166
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:03,480
You see, this is why you need to be
very careful with your messages at work

2167
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:06,480
because everyone will be able
to see those messages.

2168
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:10,040
So It was not going to look good
if you just entering

2169
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:11,880
stuff that you don't care about.

2170
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:16,920
Let's see what's going on.

2171
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:19,600
It's running. Oh, so you see this? What?

2172
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:20,040
What is it?

2173
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:23,320
Saying that the project is building
and that's downloading

2174
02:01:24,680 --> 02:01:27,760
the dependencies from

2175
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:28,440
the repo.

2176
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:30,600
The centralized maven, a bunch of dot org.

2177
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:33,640
Right. That's what's happening as well.

2178
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:37,000
So don't put silly

2179
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,960
quotes with them in silico.

2180
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:52,680
What is cool.

2181
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,840
Oh like don't put a silly message.

2182
02:01:55,080 --> 02:02:03,120
Yeah.

2183
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:09,560
Wait, that's okay.

2184
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,200
Don't worry about it
Lenny. It's just about it.

2185
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:16,480
That's because I have my the wall
that I clicked on was red

2186
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:19,680
because the previous bills have found
yours was just

2187
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:21,680
why you don't have a history yet
which is white.

2188
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,000
But if this one fails,
then it's going to fail.

2189
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,560
Well, let's just.

2190
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,600
Let's just see what what's the issue here?

2191
02:02:28,240 --> 02:02:29,400
Let's let's let it build

2192
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:35,360
the dependencies, download it, and let's

2193
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:40,400
see what's what's going on.

2194
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:41,880
Is it working for you guys, by the way?

2195
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:51,360
Like, do you guys see what I'm saying?

2196
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:52,440
Good. Let's see.

2197
02:02:52,440 --> 02:02:55,560
Is there any one to anyone here
that's struggling

2198
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:58,800
and it's guidance that's low?

2199
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,280
Yup. Same with mine.

2200
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:01,080
Slow.

2201
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:02,600
Still building

2202
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:17,560
code.

2203
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:20,640
It's got to wait.

2204
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,680
No console yet.

2205
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,120
I think it's coming.

2206
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:42,560
It has to come.

2207
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:45,520
Will we be testing on phone browser
environments?

2208
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:46,800
Yes, maybe.

2209
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:51,480
Depends on your project?

2210
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:52,560
Depends on your project.

2211
02:03:52,560 --> 02:04:06,400
If they want to do mobile testing,
then they will do it.

2212
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:06,840
What do you mean?

2213
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:12,160
Same concept.

2214
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:13,680
So they don't have access to.

2215
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:21,640
To what exactly?

2216
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:23,680
To phone browsers

2217
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:25,920
to automate from browsers.

2218
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:28,840
You can use APM,

2219
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:31,760
which is basically a wrapper
over Selenium libraries.

2220
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:38,880
So the question is yes, the answer is yes.

2221
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:59,520
We'll talk about that later, though.

2222
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:08,640
So building right.

2223
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:09,160
Let's go.

2224
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:10,680
Let's go, Let's go back.

2225
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:13,320
Well, it finishes building,
so let's click on this right here.

2226
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:14,880
I'm going to click on this.

2227
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,480
This is go back
and see if we can talk about other things.

2228
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:19,560
One, this building,
you don't have to be here, by the way.

2229
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:23,400
Like you don't have to be on this page
just to wait for it to build.

2230
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:26,840
Okay.

2231
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:30,040
But anyway, we're going
to let that one builds.

2232
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:32,680
And let's see.

2233
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,920
You guys should see the little status bar
here on the bottom left.

2234
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:40,360
Yeah, this has taken a very long time,

2235
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:44,560
but what was it that we did?

2236
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:47,000
We basically just told Jenkins
what our project was

2237
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,080
and we provided the credentials. Right.

2238
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:52,520
And I think it's working
because it cloned.

2239
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:55,440
I think it would have felt by now
if the credentials didn't work.

2240
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:57,720
Okay. But we'll see.

2241
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,960
We will see.

2242
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:02,120
Okay, I'm going to click on configure.

2243
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:06,240
You guys can do so as well.

2244
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:06,800
Okay.

2245
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:11,320
So here, let's see, we have a lot of
different topics to discuss.

2246
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:14,560
Okay.

2247
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:15,560
But I need this.

2248
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:18,600
I need this.

2249
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:21,720
I need this job to finish first.

2250
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:24,280
So let's just wait for it,

2251
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,720
okay?

2252
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:30,840
All right. Questions.

2253
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:36,560
And you want questions?

2254
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:39,200
Questions, questions, questions.

2255
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:41,880
Shows
the wrong time is not the wrong time.

2256
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:48,480
The server is just another country.

2257
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:50,960
It tells us it's at a different time.

2258
02:06:51,120 --> 02:06:53,880
By the way.

2259
02:06:53,880 --> 02:06:56,680
So it's not it's not our time.

2260
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:58,080
It's it's another time

2261
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:01,760
someone says, Tell us a cool story.

2262
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:04,040
Yeah, sure

2263
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:08,040
cool story is that you are very close

2264
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:13,880
at getting a nice I.T. job.

2265
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:16,320
That's cool, right?

2266
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:20,160
So cool story.

2267
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:22,000
Okay, let's see.

2268
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,600
I'm going to give it 30 seconds.

2269
02:07:23,600 --> 02:07:25,880
If not, then
we're going to have to do something else

2270
02:07:25,880 --> 02:07:29,040
so that we don't waste time.

2271
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:31,680
Okay? It's still building.

2272
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:33,840
Okay.

2273
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:34,560
All right.

2274
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:39,760
So I need that to build

2275
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:42,840
again.

2276
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:46,720
We just created our

2277
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:51,480
why we need so much.

2278
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:52,680
I'm sorry, What's your question?

2279
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:54,760
Why we need so much?

2280
02:07:54,760 --> 02:07:59,440
Are you seeing Maven?

2281
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:01,520
Maven as a building management tool?

2282
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:14,160
Yeah, that's where all dependencies are.

2283
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:15,160
Okay,

2284
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:20,280
let's see what situation is here

2285
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:21,800
as it tinker right now.

2286
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:22,960
It doesn't take that long.

2287
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:25,000
It's just really slow,

2288
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:29,840
which is playing a big role in our

2289
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:31,400
success

2290
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:37,720
here.

2291
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:39,960
Okay, It started it started running.

2292
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,600
What runner's classes did running here?

2293
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:43,800
Can you guys see

2294
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:52,400
your finish shows?

2295
02:08:52,400 --> 02:09:00,120
A screenshot?

2296
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:06,480
There is a scenario called frontend
and backend testing.

2297
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:10,560
Did you guys do anything with that?

2298
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:12,360
You guys probably

2299
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,200
found pretty

2300
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,120
nice.

2301
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:21,600
Nice, nice, nice

2302
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,320
cocoa called

2303
02:09:25,080 --> 02:09:28,680
sequel.

2304
02:09:28,680 --> 02:09:35,720
Good, good stuff.

2305
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:37,680
Okay,
so I'm just going to wait for my to fell.

2306
02:09:37,680 --> 02:09:40,640
I'm glad that yours finished

2307
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:46,000
and is there anyone else finish

2308
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:53,960
your night yet.

2309
02:09:53,960 --> 02:09:56,040
Your crazy testers are testing everywhere.

2310
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:06,960
Interesting.

2311
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,080
Oh okay.

2312
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:11,560
So let me see what happens

2313
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:24,400
if I refresh this.

2314
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:29,400
Oh, look at that.

2315
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,080
Look at that.

2316
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:33,600
Better refresh.

2317
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:36,560
Jenkins is letting us down.

2318
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:42,040
It is letting us down.

2319
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:45,240
This is not good.

2320
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:47,760
Let me complain about this

2321
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:49,920
because it is taking

2322
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:57,000
our time.

2323
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:03,320
Okay? Do

2324
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:06,920
you guys need something else than what
I see?

2325
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:09,560
Mine just gave up. It's still loading.

2326
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:14,720
Give it some time.

2327
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:15,240
Kind of quit.

2328
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:18,240
All right, So lecture time,

2329
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:20,040
Lecture time, lecture time.

2330
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:22,800
Let's
go back to what we were talking about.

2331
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:28,920
So now you guys know what Jenkins
is, and I wish I could show you more.

2332
02:11:28,920 --> 02:11:30,280
I'm just going to wait for it to finish.

2333
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:31,480
But let's talk about more things.

2334
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:33,800
So if I were to ask you a

2335
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:36,000
what do you use Jenkins for, like

2336
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,240
in your project, you as a tester,
what are you using Jenkins for?

2337
02:11:39,720 --> 02:11:44,440
What should your answer be?

2338
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:46,360
Monitor and schedule jobs.

2339
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:48,760
Very, very good.

2340
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:50,720
Very, very good.

2341
02:11:50,720 --> 02:11:53,840
See right there. Perfect.

2342
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:57,840
Okay.

2343
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:03,240
What do you what,
what what jobs are you like monitoring?

2344
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:05,880
A lot with which test cases?

2345
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:09,680
Smoak Okay,

2346
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:11,400
very good.

2347
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:14,360
Okay, very, very good. Very good.

2348
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:16,760
You see, that's it. Was that hard?

2349
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:21,040
It wasn't right.

2350
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:21,720
Let's see.

2351
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:31,400
What do you do in your project to ensure
the stability of your application?

2352
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:34,560
What do you do in your project
to ensure the stability

2353
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:40,000
of your application?

2354
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,400
You run your smoke tests. Okay.

2355
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:44,360
Very good.

2356
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:47,680
Very, very, very, very good.

2357
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:49,680
Okay, Very, very good.

2358
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:51,160
I'm so proud of you guys.

2359
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:53,920
I am so proud of you.

2360
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,920
Do all of your Jenkins jobs pass

2361
02:12:55,920 --> 02:13:00,160
every day?

2362
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:04,480
No. Sometimes

2363
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:08,000
we will catch real bugs,
however, every time you are.

2364
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:10,960
So here's the thing.
I forgot to mention this.

2365
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:12,120
If you.

2366
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:14,960
If you experience a failure with Jenkins.

2367
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:15,480
Right.

2368
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:19,760
You'll obviously have to risk you have to
do some research to see why it failed.

2369
02:13:20,400 --> 02:13:25,160
The best practice is to see if you can run
that same test case again.

2370
02:13:26,560 --> 02:13:27,560
And then the second

2371
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:31,400
practice, the next best thing to do is.

2372
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:34,360
And I actually told the testers
in my team this,

2373
02:13:34,680 --> 02:13:38,160
If a Jenkins job feels like if a test case
feels like we're having, like,

2374
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:41,280
let's say like 90% or 80%

2375
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:46,560
a test cases are passing,
I ask them to execute the other test

2376
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:50,000
cases
manually to see if there actually are

2377
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:53,040
no bugs.

2378
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:55,800
Okay, Does that make sense?

2379
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,600
I actually tell them like, you know what?

2380
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:00,560
Just to make sense,
let's just execute this test manually.

2381
02:14:00,560 --> 02:14:03,360
Let's see,
let's see if there's actually a bug guy.

2382
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:06,520
And that that's that's really
that's our process

2383
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:11,520
here.

2384
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:16,560
If it's fast, it doesn't throw exceptions
it'll throw it'll throw the exceptions

2385
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:20,520
that the that that the test through
it will show you where it failed.

2386
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,720
Let's hear this.

2387
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:24,640
Oh, there it is. Okay.

2388
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:27,960
It's still in the same place.

2389
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:31,200
So it got stuck executing this front,
then testing.

2390
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,360
All right.

2391
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:35,840
I'm going to go back to the job

2392
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:42,360
here.

2393
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:45,000
Still own thing. Okay.

2394
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:49,680
But that's pretty much
now we're able to do a lot of this.

2395
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:52,560
But in Jenkins,

2396
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:54,560
for most projects, yes, you'll you know,

2397
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:56,960
it's used for smoke and regression
testing purposes

2398
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,280
at work.

2399
02:15:01,160 --> 02:15:05,360
You know, again, you really only create
a job once every now and then.

2400
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:09,360
You know, you smell a you create
your smoke jobs every single day.

2401
02:15:10,160 --> 02:15:12,880
Right.

2402
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:16,440
That's that's how this kind of works.

2403
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:24,000
Come still loading.

2404
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,200
Not such a complicated topic, right?

2405
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:28,600
Not such a complicated topic.

2406
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:32,240
Also,
keep in mind that you may not be able

2407
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:35,320
to do a lot of stuff
and get on with Jenkins at work.

2408
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:37,640
They may limit your access.

2409
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:40,480
This is just to

2410
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:43,960
be safe, to be careful.

2411
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:44,480
Okay.

2412
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:47,920
In terms of speed,
Jenkins is tied to Jenkins.

2413
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:50,640
Well, it's just this is this server.

2414
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,080
It's where we are hosting this
this Jenkins

2415
02:15:54,080 --> 02:15:56,400
instance that that's where

2416
02:15:57,760 --> 02:16:00,040
that's, that's what's slow.

2417
02:16:00,680 --> 02:16:04,080
Because if like, for example my job are

2418
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:07,520
Jenkins likes is is really fast.

2419
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:09,800
Right. But

2420
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:12,400
keep in mind that these companies pay

2421
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:16,800
a lot for that
even though Jenkins is open source.

2422
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:19,480
But you need to host it somewhere, right?

2423
02:16:19,560 --> 02:16:20,960
It needs to be secure.

2424
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:25,440
You pay for the hosting services.

2425
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:27,840
For example, on most of our applications,

2426
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,320
we are only allowed to test
between the hours of 7 a.m.

2427
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:32,800
and 7 p.m..

2428
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:37,680
After that,
the service gets shut down. Why?

2429
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:40,400
Well, save money

2430
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:43,760
some time.

2431
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:47,480
Sometimes what we've had to do
when we have to do a lot of extra testing,

2432
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,920
they will leave. They will leave them up

2433
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:54,960
just to give us more time.

2434
02:16:54,960 --> 02:17:01,200
But then they you know,
if they can save money, why not?

2435
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,240
All right.

2436
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:03,840
Questions. Nice

2437
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:07,720
at this point.

2438
02:17:07,720 --> 02:17:09,440
Anything I'm doing, I can. You do.

2439
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:17,040
Sorry about the delay, guys.

2440
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:19,960
Let's see.

2441
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:24,320
I'm even clicking on this.

2442
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:29,040
Nothing is working.

2443
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:33,360
All right, Thanks. Huh?

2444
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:35,320
Yeah.

2445
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:38,840
At least we have a picture deck, because
I wanted you guys to do a lot more.

2446
02:17:38,840 --> 02:17:41,200
You know, I don't know why it's so slow.

2447
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:44,400
This hasn't happened before,
and it's not like.

2448
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:48,240
It's not like we have so many students
either.

2449
02:17:48,920 --> 02:17:50,040
Are you? Yes.

2450
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:54,400
We're using MWC.

2451
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:56,320
Yeah, I don't.
I don't know what's going on.

2452
02:17:56,320 --> 02:18:00,600
But the good news is
that we were almost done with the class

2453
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:03,120
tomorrow.

2454
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:05,960
Wanted to focus
on showing you how to schedule a job.

2455
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:09,920
I actually want to do that today,

2456
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:14,760
but knowing how slow it's going, I'm
so sure that we're going to have

2457
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:16,760
oh, that's

2458
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:20,480
just what the company decided to use
we have now.

2459
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:21,800
We'll look at that loaded.

2460
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:24,200
Oh, see, that's
just what the company decide to use.

2461
02:18:24,560 --> 02:18:25,680
They can use whatever they want.

2462
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:30,120
They can use us, Microsoft

2463
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:32,600
Azure, whatever they want to pay for.

2464
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:33,720
Right.

2465
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:37,440
That's that's done.

2466
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:37,760
Okay.

2467
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:39,760
So I don't want to click on that anymore

2468
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:42,240
because I'm afraid that something
is going to happen.

2469
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:44,360
Let's click on configure.

2470
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:45,560
Can you guys get back here?

2471
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:51,160
Is it still loading for you guys?

2472
02:18:51,160 --> 02:18:55,080
Still loading.

2473
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:56,160
All right.
You know what we're going to do?

2474
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:59,360
We're just going to have
a small interview review while this loads

2475
02:18:59,360 --> 02:19:05,280
are you guys go with that,
maybe some interview questions here

2476
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:10,560
and there until we do some progress here.

2477
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:11,480
All right. So

2478
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:18,360
give me a topic.

2479
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:19,880
What topic do you guys want to talk about?

2480
02:19:19,880 --> 02:19:25,080
Any topic.

2481
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:28,840
And this is actually taking a very long

2482
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:35,240
time.

2483
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:38,960
Oh, okay.

2484
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:40,400
All right.

2485
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:53,200
So how many how big is your team? Six.

2486
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:56,960
Can you please answer that question
when they user test applications?

2487
02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:01,400
No, I'm so confused with your question.

2488
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:02,760
You mean like

2489
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:05,200
how big is your team?

2490
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:07,760
Can you please answer that question
with the user test?

2491
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:09,520
I don't understand the question.

2492
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:15,920
No, sorry, you please rephrase it.

2493
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:17,760
Okay. Thank you.

2494
02:20:17,760 --> 02:20:20,480
Yup. Around 5 to 6
you can see around 5 to 6 guys.

2495
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:22,160
You can say any number.

2496
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:25,760
The whole point is that whatever you say,
you stick to it.

2497
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:27,120
Okay?

2498
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:28,880
Does that make sense?

2499
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:31,360
You stick to it.

2500
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:33,720
You can say five, you can say six.

2501
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:36,800
I'm right now
I'm on a team that has only four people.

2502
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:38,120
I mean five folks.

2503
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:42,000
And I'm on another team
that has like 15 people you just got out

2504
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:48,480
of, you know,
whatever the story is, just stick to it.

2505
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:48,920
Yeah.

2506
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:53,080
So you're saying around 5 to 9, that's
kind of like a big gap.

2507
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:55,680
You want to say like 5 to 6 sounds better.

2508
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:58,560
It sounds better
when you have an exact number.

2509
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:01,480
Actually, we say, Oh,
we actually were a team of eight.

2510
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:03,880
It shows that, you know, your team know.

2511
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:08,600
I mean, so you can say

2512
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:12,760
we're actually a team of

2513
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:16,080
we're actually a team of

2514
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:19,920
of eight, eight, eight people.

2515
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:21,360
It is.

2516
02:21:21,360 --> 02:21:23,800
And then you make stuff up right
you can say,

2517
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:28,280
okay, my my current team sighs,
The one that I'm currently working on.

2518
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:31,320
We have two developers,

2519
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:34,400
one business analyst, one project manager,

2520
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:37,880
two cookies and

2521
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:44,320
a product owner, and that's a car

2522
02:21:48,480 --> 02:21:50,880
put on the other team.

2523
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:54,080
There is like five developers.

2524
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:57,000
We have only two key ways.

2525
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:00,200
We have a Scrum master in that team.

2526
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:03,600
We don't have a Scrum master at this other
smaller team that I told you about.

2527
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:06,840
So the business analyst

2528
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:12,000
actually runs the Scrum meetings.

2529
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:15,240
So do you need to have a Scrum master
in your team?

2530
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:18,240
No, you do not.

2531
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:18,640
Okay.

2532
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,120
So you can have many teams
at the same time.

2533
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:21,840
It depends.

2534
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:26,720
If you get hired for a project
where you're only working on one project

2535
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:27,800
at a time.

2536
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:31,600
I work for a client where work on over 30

2537
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:36,280
different applications, so I'm pretty much
in over 30 different teams

2538
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:41,640
and they're all different.

2539
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:42,960
They're all different.

2540
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:45,200
How many times do we do a day?

2541
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:47,520
That was one interview.
That was one of the two.

2542
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:52,400
But you already went on the market.

2543
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:53,160
Is that

2544
02:22:54,280 --> 02:22:56,760
how many tests do you execute a day?

2545
02:22:57,240 --> 02:22:59,120
Well, it depends on what you're testing.

2546
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:01,880
There are some days where you actually

2547
02:23:01,880 --> 02:23:03,920
don't executing the test cases.

2548
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:06,560
You're
maybe you're writing your test cases.

2549
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:11,280
You know,

2550
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:14,520
that means we need a close to true
stories.

2551
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:18,080
No. Remember, guys, I told you, right?

2552
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:19,200
I Told you guys.

2553
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:24,640
And I'll tell you,
I always tell you guys this.

2554
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:27,160
You either finesse the system

2555
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:34,120
or the system will last. You

2556
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:38,720
and you pick your poison.

2557
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:43,800
That's my advice to you.

2558
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:46,720
And that's all I'm going to say. Go.

2559
02:23:48,040 --> 02:23:50,680
That's all I'm going to say.

2560
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:56,320
Well,

2561
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:59,560
to choose your character,
that's free to choose.

2562
02:23:59,880 --> 02:24:12,680
Choose your character.

2563
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:13,320
Well,

2564
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:16,000
how do you decide which stays

2565
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,160
to what test to automate
and which ones to manually perfect?

2566
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:21,480
Good question.

2567
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:25,440
So in in general, it's

2568
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:30,600
good practice to automate test cases
that are repetitive

2569
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:37,040
test cases that are long or test cases
that require to be executed

2570
02:24:37,360 --> 02:24:39,840
multiple times
with different sets of data.

2571
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:44,240
Write a test case that you wouldn't
automate

2572
02:24:44,240 --> 02:24:48,080
as a test case that can be automated
by the tool that you're using.

2573
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:51,680
Like selenium has limitations.

2574
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:54,280
You also don't want to automate
a test case

2575
02:24:54,280 --> 02:24:57,000
where the requirements
keep changing, right?

2576
02:24:57,360 --> 02:25:00,040
Because you're going in there,
you're writing your code, you're

2577
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:01,240
inspecting all these elements.

2578
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:03,320
But then that requirement
changed. Tomorrow.

2579
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:04,520
Then that means that the code is going

2580
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:07,640
to change, that you're going to go back
and inspect everything again.

2581
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:10,400
And at that point,
you're wasting a lot of time.

2582
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:13,080
You know what I mean? You're wasting
a lot of time just trying to

2583
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:19,720
to automate something that keeps changing.

2584
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:21,600
Very good question.

2585
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:23,120
Next question.

2586
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:25,400
Come on, guys, interview me.

2587
02:25:25,400 --> 02:25:27,200
I am a really bad liar.

2588
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:30,160
When they asked me to tell day to day

2589
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:33,560
job activity based on for Oh, it's easy.

2590
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:35,840
Lying has been very easy.

2591
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:37,920
I'll show you how to lie spread

2592
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:42,120
so it's

2593
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:49,360
very easy.

2594
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:50,800
You know what's funny?

2595
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:54,240
Like whether you guys want to go
with the fake resume or not or fake.

2596
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:56,600
I don't say fake recipe.
I want to say experience.

2597
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,600
You know, people that are honest
and the resumes, you know,

2598
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:03,040
they're also lying
because they're also overexaggerating

2599
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:08,320
the work
they did at their in their job right.

2600
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:08,840
Right.

2601
02:26:08,840 --> 02:26:11,360
And again, I'll say this.

2602
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:17,600
You either finesse the system
or you let the system finesse you.

2603
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:20,880
The resume is not going to get you a job.

2604
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:22,480
Okay?

2605
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:27,760
The resume is just going to get you
the interview.

2606
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:32,160
Does that make sense?

2607
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:34,760
Cool. That's it. Plain and simple.

2608
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:39,360
If your resume says that you know this
and that, well, then prove it.

2609
02:26:39,360 --> 02:26:43,520
At the time of interview, go prove it.

2610
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:47,280
At the time of interview, obviously,
some people are like,

2611
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:49,160
Oh, what if I get hired?

2612
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:51,960
And then they fire me later because
they realize I don't know anything.

2613
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:54,880
Well, to be honest, that doesn't happen

2614
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:59,400
because they actually interview you
before you joined the company, Right?

2615
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:02,200
So that's not going to happen now.

2616
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:07,200
They could get fired if you just are like
showing up late to work,

2617
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:11,680
if for some reason
you're not responding to messages or,

2618
02:27:12,040 --> 02:27:13,320
you know, that kind of thing,

2619
02:27:14,280 --> 02:27:15,600
does that make sense

2620
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:19,920
that that's pretty much it?

2621
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:22,360
There was a question
I assume was a challenge

2622
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:24,520
you experience where you work
in your current company.

2623
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:28,880
I don't want
you guys think about current company.

2624
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:31,840
I want you guys
to think about current project

2625
02:27:32,680 --> 02:27:35,960
because your company can support
so many different projects.

2626
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:38,400
Your Company can support
so many different projects.

2627
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:42,480
Like if you work for a government
contractor like Right,

2628
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:48,000
or Deloitte or Booz Allen or ICA
or anything, like they have contracts.

2629
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:49,320
Like what?

2630
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:53,360
That, you know, Department of Homeland
Security, IRS,

2631
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:58,520
you know, some schools systems,
you know, here and there.

2632
02:27:58,520 --> 02:28:01,480
So I don't want you guys to think of it
like it.

2633
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:04,960
JOHNS Your experience when you worked
in your current company, it should be

2634
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:09,320
as they change your experience,
you worked in your current project or at.

2635
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:11,320
Johns
You experience in your current project,

2636
02:28:12,600 --> 02:28:14,880
right?

2637
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:21,360
Oh, cool.

2638
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:26,960
Well, we'll learn how to answer those

2639
02:28:28,480 --> 02:28:28,960
project.

2640
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:32,920
So a challenge is I mean, one of
the biggest challenges here is that,

2641
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:38,120
you know,
we like requirements change a lot,

2642
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:42,840
so we have to be very good at up to date
with the changes.

2643
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:44,720
As a testing team,

2644
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:47,360
we have to continuously update

2645
02:28:47,360 --> 02:28:50,400
our test cases and so forth.

2646
02:28:50,400 --> 02:28:50,720
Right?

2647
02:28:51,360 --> 02:28:55,200
So that's one challenge.

2648
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:57,480
Have I.T. experience.
I have certifications.

2649
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:00,640
Want to know what my honest resumé
got me in a year and a half,

2650
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:02,640
two interviews, not job.

2651
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:04,120
I'm willing to try something new.

2652
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:06,240
Alan How about we do this?

2653
02:29:06,240 --> 02:29:10,080
We get your experience,
we get your certifications,

2654
02:29:10,080 --> 02:29:14,160
we make a wonderful resumé,
throw some salt and pepper in there

2655
02:29:14,600 --> 02:29:17,160
and bam, we get you a good job.

2656
02:29:17,960 --> 02:29:21,240
It sounds good, right?

2657
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:22,920
Yup. That. That's the plan.

2658
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:23,640
Very good.

2659
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:24,840
There was a question

2660
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:27,840
who makes that decision of what task
is to automate versus manual?

2661
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:29,200
You do

2662
02:29:30,160 --> 02:29:31,920
and you
can actually discuss with your team.

2663
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:32,840
If you're working with the team,

2664
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:36,120
I'm sure you discuss with a team and say,
Hey, I think we should automate this.

2665
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:38,400
You know,
you discuss this as a team and that's it.

2666
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:40,760
And if you're the only way, then you're
the one it.

2667
02:29:42,120 --> 02:29:42,760
Does that make sense?

2668
02:29:42,760 --> 02:29:45,080
I sure.

2669
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:51,040
Would you prefer to develop your framework
from scratch or work on an existing one?

2670
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:56,320
I've worked on multiple projects
where I had to do one or the other.

2671
02:29:56,320 --> 02:30:00,600
When you work, when you develop
a framework, you develop it based on

2672
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:04,640
the testing needs that you will,
the testing that you have to do.

2673
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:08,600
So I know that you guys here
Selenium Java cucumber, but to be honest,

2674
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:12,360
all of these frameworks are very different
than many different projects

2675
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:16,360
and they are designed to test
their specific application.

2676
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:17,480
Okay.

2677
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:20,640
It it is,

2678
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:23,400
it's, it's really up to you.

2679
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:27,480
But what the most difficult thing
to testing already talked to

2680
02:30:27,480 --> 02:30:28,400
you guys about this.

2681
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:33,720
What is the most difficult
part to testing?

2682
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:36,520
Is it creating a framework?

2683
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:38,800
Is it grabbing any tool
and starting automating?

2684
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:42,120
What is the most difficult part to testing

2685
02:30:44,320 --> 02:30:45,520
the most difficult part?

2686
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:49,800
This is still loading, but there.

2687
02:30:49,800 --> 02:30:53,640
Sorry for the delay guys

2688
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:56,040
trying to do some value in here
to you guys too,

2689
02:30:56,120 --> 02:31:01,800
because you guys are patiently waiting.

2690
02:31:01,800 --> 02:31:03,840
I'm sorry, what was the question
that I ask the question?

2691
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:06,680
Understanding requirements
minus loading forever.

2692
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:09,320
How can we imagine ideal work environment?

2693
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:10,680
I'll Show you a Catarina.

2694
02:31:10,680 --> 02:31:15,280
That's easy, but the most difficult part.

2695
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:20,920
Look, right now
I'm a I'm a test architect, right?

2696
02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:24,080
And I've been to a of different projects.

2697
02:31:25,840 --> 02:31:26,920
People think that the

2698
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:30,720
hardest part is to just get a tool
and start automating.

2699
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:33,000
They think that it's, that

2700
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,520
they think that that's the hardest part
to develop the framework.

2701
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:38,800
That's nice and all right.

2702
02:31:38,800 --> 02:31:41,640
And obviously the challenges are there.

2703
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:43,800
You can start automating
your first five test

2704
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:46,920
cases, your first ten,
your first 15, your first 20,

2705
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:50,440
but then what happens
when you have 300 test cases?

2706
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:53,400
What happens when you have 1000?

2707
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:55,720
What happens when you have so many?

2708
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:58,080
Then what happens?

2709
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:01,080
The truth is that the most difficult part

2710
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:04,320
to testing in general,
both and test automation

2711
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,840
is maintenance.

2712
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:10,360
Maintenance is the most difficult

2713
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:13,560
part to testing in general.

2714
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:16,800
Okay, that's what it is.

2715
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:20,520
But just if you don't believe
that, you will see

2716
02:32:20,600 --> 02:32:24,440
with with time,
you will see the experienced tester.

2717
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:28,160
Well well can agree
with that the same thing

2718
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:35,120
can you a little more explain.

2719
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:35,400
Yeah.

2720
02:32:35,400 --> 02:32:38,560
Maintenance for example
you have a dozen test

2721
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:41,280
cases, right and then requirements change.

2722
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:44,880
First of all, it's
the way you design your framework.

2723
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:47,320
How about I take you through my framework
just a little bit

2724
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:48,600
to show you how different it is?

2725
02:32:48,600 --> 02:32:51,480
This is a real time project, by the way.

2726
02:32:51,720 --> 02:32:54,240
And, and we actually have everything

2727
02:32:54,280 --> 02:32:57,000
like we actually have two big documents
here.

2728
02:32:57,320 --> 02:33:02,280
Like what we told the new testers
is to come to our documents.

2729
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:04,560
We have a code review checklist.

2730
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:09,280
This is a checklist that the code
these are the standards

2731
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:13,400
that you have to follow in order to pass
code reviews in our projects.

2732
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:14,080
Right.

2733
02:33:14,080 --> 02:33:20,200
One of the code
reviews say that in our project,

2734
02:33:20,200 --> 02:33:24,000
like in every pages classes
that you have, okay,

2735
02:33:24,200 --> 02:33:28,080
and every page is classes that you have,
you need to have I'm

2736
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:32,320
going to show you.

2737
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:37,320
You see, this is the pages class, right?

2738
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:42,480
You need to have commented lines up
in every single element.

2739
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:43,600
Okay.

2740
02:33:43,960 --> 02:33:47,400
Right here with every single element
that you want with proper

2741
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:53,000
naming conventions
so that we know what that element is for.

2742
02:33:53,320 --> 02:33:55,440
Right. Does that make sense?

2743
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:59,440
Because the day of tomorrow,
if another tester joins a team

2744
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:02,840
and they clone the project that does

2745
02:34:02,840 --> 02:34:06,920
or should be able to easily
find all of the inspect that.

2746
02:34:06,920 --> 02:34:10,960
Okay, so we comment all of the stuff
here as well.

2747
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:13,080
You see all of the elements.

2748
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:16,920
We divide them, we organize our elements,
we use comments, right.

2749
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:18,480
And stuff like that.

2750
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:20,240
Does that make sense? Right.

2751
02:34:20,240 --> 02:34:24,000
This is just one of the code review
checklists and stuff like that, right?

2752
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:28,400
Because if you don't have this,
you're going to sell code review.

2753
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:31,000
You're going to at least in

2754
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,880
my project and I've been in other projects
where they do the same thing.

2755
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:37,200
So this practice isn't new.

2756
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:39,440
Okay. Yep.

2757
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:41,880
And you notice
that that was a good call, right?

2758
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:43,120
Someone looked at it.

2759
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:44,280
Let me see.

2760
02:34:44,480 --> 02:34:45,920
Let's go here.

2761
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:47,240
What are we using?

2762
02:34:47,240 --> 02:34:48,880
A lot of expert.

2763
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:51,400
Expert. Expert, Expert. Expert.

2764
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:55,800
Expert and expert experts.

2765
02:34:55,800 --> 02:34:56,240
Right.

2766
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:58,920
We only use experts

2767
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:03,600
in this project. Why?

2768
02:35:04,440 --> 02:35:07,680
Because let's compare this one.

2769
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:10,520
We can make
we can locate very dynamic elements.

2770
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:11,640
That's thing number one.

2771
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:14,760
The difference between success and expert

2772
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:19,440
really is that you're able
to customize the experts more.

2773
02:35:19,440 --> 02:35:22,840
You can really customize access, select
so much.

2774
02:35:23,480 --> 02:35:24,120
Okay?

2775
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:29,160
And that is a big disadvantage,
of course, of using CSS selector.

2776
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:32,280
Okay.

2777
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:34,840
So that that there goes that

2778
02:35:36,160 --> 02:35:36,600
and that

2779
02:35:36,600 --> 02:35:40,680
is that is one that is a big
that's a big deal.

2780
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:41,200
Okay.

2781
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:44,760
So M has four new locators.

2782
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:51,920
That's interesting.

2783
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:56,080
Why there's no like I d I just,
I just told you we just expense.

2784
02:35:56,960 --> 02:35:57,480
That's fine.

2785
02:35:57,480 --> 02:35:59,560
You know, like, that's what we use.

2786
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:03,080
Every project will have like it's it's
standards, right?

2787
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:08,160
Like they'll say we use ides,
we use this, we that you know

2788
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:11,320
like they wanted to use something for us
because we're working

2789
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:14,480
with an angular application
and some service apps.

2790
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:18,400
We are using this.

2791
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:20,880
But that's just to give you an idea,
it's still loading.

2792
02:36:21,360 --> 02:36:22,040
All right.

2793
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:28,440
Do you guys have questions?

2794
02:36:28,440 --> 02:36:29,840
Is it a project requirement?

2795
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:32,040
What do you mean, project requirement?

2796
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:32,880
One more time?

2797
02:36:32,880 --> 02:36:34,600
What was the advantage of success?

2798
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:37,800
The only advantages, of course,
is that you can write them very fast.

2799
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:39,000
They're very easy to write,

2800
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:40,600
right?

2801
02:36:40,800 --> 02:36:43,320
They're very, very easy to write.

2802
02:36:43,640 --> 02:36:44,760
Write this stuff.

2803
02:36:44,760 --> 02:36:48,000
You can also Google as well difference,
which can see us as an expert.

2804
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:52,080
And you will find that
who say that expert is is better

2805
02:36:52,080 --> 02:36:55,320
because it's more customizable.

2806
02:36:55,320 --> 02:37:01,720
You know, what do you prefer to work
as it tests or test lead

2807
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:06,680
whatever pays more, we're based more.

2808
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:08,640
It's the same.

2809
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:11,160
I don't know like it's

2810
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:12,600
where pace

2811
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:15,280
you know, that's

2812
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:22,080
that's that's fine.

2813
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:22,560
That's okay.

2814
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:24,800
You know let's start with to

2815
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:29,640
not lead one.

2816
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:31,800
Yeah. Okay.

2817
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:35,400
Why did you decide to switch a job?

2818
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:36,600
Well,

2819
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:40,200
what will you do if you don't agree
with one of your colleagues?

2820
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:42,280
You're going to fight them
in the parking lot.

2821
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:45,600
You're going to we're going to call them,
and you're going to just start going

2822
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:54,360
crazy.

2823
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:57,080
Did you actually start a Q?
Is it a manual?

2824
02:37:57,800 --> 02:37:59,680
No, I was actually automation

2825
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:04,040
with a lot of manual work.

2826
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:07,000
What will we say,
which company we're working for this

2827
02:38:07,080 --> 02:38:09,280
that will be covered in the interview
preparation, guys.

2828
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:14,120
All of that will be covered
in the preparation.

2829
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:14,720
Okay.

2830
02:38:15,960 --> 02:38:18,400
But, you know, the questions
that we kind of went over today

2831
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:21,520
are some questions
that you were going to get

2832
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:24,640
and some of you guys
already have questions.

2833
02:38:25,480 --> 02:38:28,560
You know, they asked you
why did you decide to switch projects

2834
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:33,520
or something like, Well,
I always pursued newer opportunities

2835
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:37,600
when I felt like I could grow more,
you know, make it sound good.

2836
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:42,160
You don't say, Oh, I was bored
and I decided to leave, you know.

2837
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:43,760
It's it's about how you talk, guys.

2838
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:45,600
It's about how you talk.

2839
02:38:46,120 --> 02:38:47,960
What if they ask where you graduate from?

2840
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:52,200
Will say, Say
I went to this university or, this school.

2841
02:38:52,840 --> 02:38:57,000
You know, Did you go to

2842
02:38:57,200 --> 02:39:01,800
what did you go to?

2843
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:05,160
I may learn JavaScript
after a couple of months, start working.

2844
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,280
What do you think is a good choice?

2845
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:07,760
I see.

2846
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:14,800
Are you working already or what's
what's the deal?

2847
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:15,520
They will ask.

2848
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:20,200
It will be okay to start Manual
nine that we have for

2849
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:23,640
it is how to agree but not sorry.

2850
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:25,080
The question is they will ask it.

2851
02:39:25,080 --> 02:39:29,160
We will be okay to start manual
nine that we have

2852
02:39:29,160 --> 02:39:33,320
five years experience How to agree
but not sound desperate.

2853
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:39,440
I don't understand the question
I sure you asking.

2854
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:44,280
If you guys get a job that requires you
to learn a new set of tools, then do it.

2855
02:39:44,880 --> 02:39:46,560
It just adds more to your resume.

2856
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:49,640
It makes you more of a lucrative tester.

2857
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:50,040
Right?

2858
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:52,920
How many testers are going to go out
in the market knowing, selling a job?

2859
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:53,600
Right.

2860
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,880
Imagine, you know, you having a different
tool under your belt,

2861
02:39:58,440 --> 02:39:59,000
right

2862
02:39:59,760 --> 02:40:06,600
Now they go, I graduated in business
studies in the fall.

2863
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:12,360
So then say that, Yeah, see,
I got my degree from you know,

2864
02:40:12,360 --> 02:40:16,120
I got my degree in the fall,
but so so I'll go with that.

2865
02:40:16,360 --> 02:40:17,440
If they say

2866
02:40:17,440 --> 02:40:21,600
would you be fine to start doing
manual test a lot, say yeah, absolutely.

2867
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:25,280
No, you know, testing is a challenge
itself and I love testing.

2868
02:40:26,160 --> 02:40:33,480
You know, I'll be up for the challenges.

2869
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:34,920
Okay.

2870
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:38,520
All right, guys, listen, Jenkins
let us down.

2871
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:43,280
So let's just call it a night, okay?

2872
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:47,080
Let's get 50 minutes early

2873
02:40:47,080 --> 02:40:47,720
tomorrow.

2874
02:40:47,720 --> 02:40:49,680
Let's see what we can come up with.

2875
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:54,600
If tomorrow just not working,
then I'm just going to have to show you

2876
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:58,840
how to do stuff without you
having to do it, which I wouldn't like,

2877
02:40:58,840 --> 02:41:03,240
because I want you guys to get hands
on, you know?

2878
02:41:03,800 --> 02:41:09,800
But we can go from there.

2879
02:41:09,800 --> 02:41:12,840
All right, cool.

2880
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,520
All right, guys, have a very good night.

2881
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:18,000
And I'll see you tomorrow.

2882
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:21,240
All right? Okay. No worries.

2883
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:22,280
I'll take a look later.

2884
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:30,440
Thank you.
