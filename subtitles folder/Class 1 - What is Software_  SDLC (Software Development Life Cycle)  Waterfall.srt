1
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,440
Oh, Dad, I know it's a first

2
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,160
class, though, so it gets a little bit,
you know, confusing.

3
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,760
It's very late. 2 a.m. here.

4
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,240
Istanbul. Oh, wow.

5
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,280
Okay.

6
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,920
ATC, can you give us an idea
what a laptop.

7
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,120
As long as you have a gigabytes of RAM.

8
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,520
It can be Windows
or Mac and 200 GB storage.

9
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,400
Mathias, I think you should be fine

10
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,560
and you should be absolutely fine. Hey,

11
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,760
guys, one thing.

12
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,560
Whenever we have a class,
just one thing, please.

13
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,840
This is everyone's duty.

14
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,720
Now, I know sometimes the instructors
forget this. Do

15
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,120
remind all the instructors who, whenever
they are teaching to start recording.

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,480
That's the most important thing right
now. Yep.

17
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,960
It's recording. Perfect.

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,600
So we want to make sure

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,280
that, you know, when we start
that you guys don't miss anything.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,240
But yeah, it does happen in this zoom.

21
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,120
You have to manually press record,
otherwise it doesn't us.

22
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,280
We want to make sure that, you know,

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,240
whenever the class started,
just remind your instructors as I'll be

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
your instructor for just a few classes
and then other instructors take over

25
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,000
and we'll go through five or six
different instructor in this course.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,200
So there's a bunch of them out here.

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,840
But while I'm here and least remind me

28
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,880
as he a few more people
still asking questions.

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,040
Okay. No, that's good in Slack. Okay.

30
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,240
So, guys, as you can hear me right now,

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,800
let's let's also any questions,
anything you have just strictly

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,760
go to the live questions,
not the support or syntax students.

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,840
Again, it's a first class, though,
so I completely understand.

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,720
It just takes time to get adjusted.

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,160
But I just want to make sure
everything is smooth for everyone.

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
Let's hear

37
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,440
myself.

38
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,240
I mean, I'm here for three or four.

39
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,480
You and
and then we have different instructor,

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,760
different module.

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,880
Is there a deadline to delete the videos?

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,960
You have those access to those videos
till you get your offers jobs basically.

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,600
So we we keep you keep it till that time
and then we give you

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,960
a month or so afterwards if you need it.

45
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,840
But if you ever needed, let's say
once you're done with the program,

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,680
get the jobs and everything, you know,
you requested.

47
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,240
We always get back to you on that.

48
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,640
Okay. So that's that over there.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
I think we're ready
to basically get started.

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,920
I think I see everyone jumped on.

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
I don't see everyone. Everyone jumped on.

52
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,440
But it's fine. Totally fine.

53
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,560
I think some people are just
getting adjusted to the online one.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm just going to check if there's anyone

55
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,200
and see.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,360
Is there any book or reading material
for class?

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,880
Are books too outdated in this sense?

58
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,840
We won't really, really use any books
or anything, but everything you have over

59
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,240
here is going to be the slides, notes
and videos.

60
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,920
They're going to be more helpful.

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,120
Yes. When you get into the programing
class sometime instructors

62
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,560
do recommend some books,
so you can definitely

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,160
look over those
and we'll definitely give you also

64
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,320
some time
eBooks in the canvas as well too.

65
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,440
But kind of don't really need any books
particularly so.

66
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,880
So you should be good.

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,480
Yeah. There you go.

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,400
You can use Udemy
as an additional resource.

69
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,360
YouTube,
a bunch of other things out there, Right?

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,080
So you have a lot of options
in that sense.

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,520
Well, guys,
I'm excited and ready to get started.

72
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,080
One thing before some of you I don't see
pictures of you on your slides.

73
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,800
If you guys can,
please, definitely if you can

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,520
add your

75
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,600
pictures,
I think that it's going to be fine.

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,160
You'll get it.

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,560
You get to see this,
these slides on canvas after class.

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,520
We usually don't give them before

79
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,560
because we've seen
some people get distracted on that.

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,160
So once the class is done and everything,
you'll see everything on canvas.

81
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,640
You'll see all these slides over there.

82
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,080
Yeah.

83
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,480
All the content, like, you know,
notes, PDFs, everything like that.

84
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,120
You're going to see all of them on
Slack, sorry, on, on canvas.

85
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,200
And that's basically where we have

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,600
everything.

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,920
Someone says, My voice is gone.

88
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,480
I just want to make sure, okay,
maybe that might be yours from our end.

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,520
Usually our connection is very smooth.

90
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,040
By any chance, if the video's not showing
or voice is going on

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,360
enough,
do check your connection, by the way.

92
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,440
So just to make sure.

93
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,280
All right, guys, let's just get started.

94
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,600
Let's just get started. Okay.

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,920
So we have an agenda, basically,
of what we're going to cover today

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,040
for some of
you might be a little bit easy.

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,760
It's fine.

98
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,640
If it's not easy, that's totally
fine as well to just stay put with this.

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,320
You know, we like to start off
slow, get you into the rhythm,

100
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,800
make you understand what everything is,
and then basically pick it up.

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,120
Okay,

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,400
How to mute sound in Slack.

103
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,240
And the best way to do it is
go to the notifications in your channel.

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,600
Go to notifications and you can

105
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,400
you can control the yeah, the pop,
the sound and everything

106
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,080
can be a little bit like in there
or go to the settings in there.

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,920
You can, you can mute that out
so if you don't want it.

108
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,160
Yeah.

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,280
Otherwise
all the things you're going to see

110
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,880
the notifications coming and going anyway.

111
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,280
So this is the agenda,
very simple and easy.

112
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,640
I try to go it at a pace where everyone
can understand and if it's easy, relax.

113
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,600
That's totally fine.

114
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,960
You know,
just maybe hear some examples and things.

115
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,600
If it's the first time you're hearing

116
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,000
about some of the examples,
you know, take notes, anything you want to

117
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,280
my my goal is to make it very simple
for you guys and relatable.

118
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,280
So that way, you know, it's easy
to understand the big picture.

119
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,280
So we start off slow or very basic

120
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,200
and we basically pick up
on hearing tomorrow's session.

121
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,120
You will have more terminologies and such.

122
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,200
This is just step.

123
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,360
But for that one thing,
guys do ask questions.

124
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,600
I'm looking exactly at Slack.

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
So what?

126
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,960
I'm looking at Slack, any question
that comes along, I try to answer them

127
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,720
if I miss anything, not on purpose,
repeat the questions and I'll get to you.

128
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,760
Try to make sure everyone's
questions are answered.

129
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,800
And yeah, that's
basically typically the how the process is

130
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,200
one thing goes is interaction.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,760
In these theoretical classes,
interaction is very much needed.

132
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,080
So when I ask basically starting my class,
which I'm bored of doing any second,

133
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,320
you know, I asked you questions,

134
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,920
I want you to basically type away
your answers in Slack.

135
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,880
That way we all can be interact
and see what everyone thinks,

136
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,080
so it makes the class more fun
and you get to see exactly

137
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,320
if everyone's understanding
or not understanding what's going on.

138
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,720
So let's make it more interactive, right?

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,120
So today's agenda is
what is exactly software?

140
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
What exactly is software in your device?

141
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,480
No, but let me see what you guys think.

142
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,920
Then we're going to go into something
called software development lifecycle.

143
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,400
And there's something called

144
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,160
what is Waterfall, which is one of the
methodologies that we're going to cover.

145
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,400
So this is what we're going to cover.

146
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,760
Basically in today's session.

147
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,600
Some of you probably researched this
and I saw someone share some links,

148
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,560
which was nice.

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,840
That means they went to canvas
and they looked at the calendars.

150
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,800
So good job if you did that. Right.

151
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,040
So maybe you did some research already.

152
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,320
So let me ask you this.

153
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,200
I like to make my class more interactive.

154
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Let's see what you guys think.

155
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,960
So what do you guys think? And type it.

156
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,240
Okay, guys, everyone, I need everyone's

157
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,240
participation here.

158
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
What do you think is a software?

159
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,000
What do you guys think of the software?

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,040
Give me some examples.

161
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,360
Is going to be all examples of you
guys. Now,

162
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,080
before I go in and explain what software

163
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,640
is, directions

164
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,080
that we can program, Okay.

165
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,040
Applications.

166
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,320
Okay, very

167
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
good. See, and now I see more interaction.

168
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,680
Okay, everyone try to type it away,

169
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,560
sees to see what you guys think.

170
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
Software is a code that directs
electric segment.

171
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,480
Go in the room shape.
Are you in more technical?

172
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,680
But that's great and

173
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,040
it's your program application
collection of data.

174
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,480
Okay.

175
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,200
It's a program that helps interpret
the commands.

176
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,520
Okay, perfect.

177
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,840
With structured data, Windows or iOS
that spills are definitely

178
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,920
some examples
and instruction for the computer.

179
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,000
So instead of unstructured data programs,

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,640
life of program,
someone said, okay, Alexa,

181
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,240
awesome

182
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,480
software as a system hand which okay.

183
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,480
And if program is a software okay

184
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,800
language of machine right.

185
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,760
Okay.

186
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,240
What about like, I don't know.

187
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,600
Let's see Windows is Windows a software is
type of let's say Microsoft Office?

188
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
What about Microsoft Office

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,680
software?

190
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,880
Some sort of software. Okay. Okay.

191
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,400
Your OS Windows or Mac OS
is that we have okay.

192
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,360
Software.

193
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,640
Okay, good, good looks. Look.

194
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,000
So we on the right, Right, Pat? Yes.

195
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,960
So let's look into a basic example. Right.

196
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,760
A machine readable code or a program
that tells the computer

197
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,400
how to perform tasks, programing code,
you cannot touch it.

198
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:50,640
Right?

199
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,880
Basically, that's exactly
what software is now, what about, like

200
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,360
Uber, Lyft, X
Excel out of no different type of program?

201
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,680
Zoom?

202
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,120
Are these softwares?

203
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,840
Yeah, they're all softwares, right?

204
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,080
Yes. Uber Live, their apps.

205
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,200
Apps is a form of software, right?

206
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,360
Some of them. Right.

207
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,280
So all of these are softwares.

208
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,120
We cannot touch any of them,
but they do a lot of things for us.

209
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,360
This class itself, is this a hardware
class or is this a software class?

210
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,720
Let's see what everyone thinks.

211
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,400
Well, I'm glad we're on the right path.

212
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,560
Yes, it is mostly well, 99% is software.

213
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,400
It will bring some other details in there.

214
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,760
But yes, it is completely software.

215
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,680
All right.

216
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,800
So we on the right path over here.

217
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,680
All your games, let's say Candy crash,
a lot of know call of duty nowadays.

218
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,720
So many games,
everything is software, hardware.

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,040
What are the examples?

220
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,920
Software, right? Yes, yes, yes. So

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,040
all for
let me ask you this on a day to day basis.

222
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,680
Let me see.

223
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,720
Let me just see the dependency
of people on software.

224
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,280
Right.

225
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,600
How many apps do you guys on average
use on a daily basis?

226
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Like three or four or five?

227
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Let's see how many apps, 5 to 6, ten, ten,

228
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,840
five, ten, six, eight.

229
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,240
A lot of software is right.

230
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,400
Look to too many 20.

231
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,920
Well, I hope you're not using 20.

232
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,320
That's too much.

233
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,800
15 apps a day.

234
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,200
Wow. Okay.

235
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,840
A lot of infinite
a lot of apps on your phones, right.

236
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,240
A lot of them out there.
And you guys use a lot.

237
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
Quite a few of them.

238
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,480
Makes our life easy.

239
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,040
Can be kind of Candy Crush free.

240
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,440
Depends with kids games. Yeah absolutely.

241
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,120
Market apps, stock apps, crypto apps.

242
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,320
So many apps out there

243
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,840
you would inside of a dating software
that's true right

244
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,800
had Tinder and all these apps
that are there absolutely

245
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,640
the world is changing and slack
AB Right here

246
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,840
great great

247
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,400
see look at the world
how much it has evolved right

248
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,040
And we have looked at this,
if you look at it the last 20 years.

249
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,920
Wow, maybe some of you weren't born.

250
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,680
We have some 1890 year old,
but things have changed quite a bit now.

251
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,000
What is the opposite, right?
What is a hardware?

252
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,040
Let's see what you guys think.

253
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,960
What is a hardware?

254
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,120
How many types of talk,
a type of software?

255
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,000
There's a few of them
which we'll cover actually in a few cases.

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,520
Actually.

257
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,360
Let's see, it's touch about PlayStation
five.

258
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,640
Hard drive a machine.

259
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,400
Okay.

260
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,160
Computer Okay, this CPU

261
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,760
let me see
every physical part of the computer.

262
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,720
Good ads are okay.

263
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,320
Keyboard scanner, mouse.

264
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,360
Okay. All right, perfect.

265
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,400
The actual silicon
that can be and runs the software.

266
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,240
Okay, that's great.

267
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,120
Physical pass. Tangible.

268
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,400
Good way to look at it. Yes.

269
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:02,640
Everything that's tangible processor. Yes.

270
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,960
Actual accessories.

271
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,000
Good, good, good.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,440
You guys are sharp.

273
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,480
All ready? Yeah.

274
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,680
I like some of the apps
that you guys are giving me already.

275
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,360
Okay. Yeah.

276
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,520
Are these physical, like screen monitor,
keyboard system unit speaker?

277
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,200
You can touch it.

278
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,400
All of these think is your phone
or software and hardware.

279
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Is it a combination?

280
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,480
I'd say absolutely, yes.

281
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,320
Both read

282
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,680
PlayStation five.

283
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,120
Someone said write Ops four or something.

284
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
That's a combination, right?

285
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,760
It has a software,
it has a hardware as well.

286
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,640
Perfect. Perfect.

287
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,000
At least we know the difference
between two.

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,640
Part of it, though, you know what
a software is, what a hardware is, though.

289
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,600
Your printer, your mouse, just your
the camera

290
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,200
that's connected here that we can see that
that has some sort of software there.

291
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,600
But it's hardware as well, too.

292
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,560
We need both in the tech world.

293
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,280
You need both.

294
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,840
You need both in order to build
apps to do things and everything.

295
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,520
You need both part of it.

296
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,680
But software is basically the brain.

297
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,400
Remember this and the hardware,

298
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,320
if it doesn't have some sort of software,
for example, your phone,

299
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
if it doesn't have any software, it's
useless.

300
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,480
Right?

301
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,160
Back in the day it wasn't.

302
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,960
We had the large phones and everything,

303
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,200
you know, it worked better.

304
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,960
But nowadays your smartphone is
if it doesn't have any apps, that's

305
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,480
it is garbage basically.

306
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,760
That's the
that's like if you look at that is the

307
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,480
that is the brain
someone said at the beginning I saw

308
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,080
which was nice that's the soul of
the of the computer is basically

309
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,000
it means the stomach

310
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,880
it's the perfect you guys are good

311
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,880
virtual stuff

312
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,320
now older I see do you you

313
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,680
how can I go to select
without know lose dessert

314
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,440
you can minimize or shrink your window
your screen if you can

315
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,840
and you'll see like this or that's
why guys I remember now you might see

316
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,360
separate screen would help a lot though
by the way sorry guys,

317
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,720
if I don't pay attention to your cue,
any questions on Zoom?

318
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,440
That's why I'm looking strictly at slide,
but I'll try to do it for today's class.

319
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,600
But if I missed apologies,
just try to stick to slide.

320
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,280
All right.

321
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,360
We're on the right track. We are.

322
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,480
We are on the right track.

323
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,000
Router.

324
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What about router, modem, keyboards?

325
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,080
They're all part of basic.

326
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,520
They're all hardware. Right.

327
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,440
So we both have hardware and software.

328
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,960
They go hand in hand.

329
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,360
This course will strictly focus more on

330
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,480
what it takes to build software.

331
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,680
What is behind the software?

332
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,600
Who are the people
behind the software that

333
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,200
are created?

334
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,560
Right.

335
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,240
And if you are,
I get to the point in a very good way

336
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,200
to basically explain to you
what's going on.

337
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes, developers are there,
but you will see today also

338
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,240
there's a lot of other people involved
in, let's say, creating the next.

339
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,320
I don't know, Uber app or Facebook app
or Instagram, whichever it is.

340
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,880
Right.

341
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,800
It takes it takes more than that.

342
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,680
You know, just one person. Right.

343
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,960
And if you look at in the last 25 years,

344
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,120
has technology
changed a lot significantly?

345
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,160
What would you guys say?

346
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,520
Yes, right.

347
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,880
Quite a bit. Absolutely.

348
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,400
What are the what do you guys think?

349
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,280
One, what could be also one of the biggest
pillar to a lot of change, let's say

350
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
crime timing.

351
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
What about right now?

352
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,960
Now, technology
is moving at a very fast pace.

353
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,480
We have more and more basically innovation
and things of that.

354
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,000
But what do you guys think
could be a very big key to that?

355
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,200
Anyone think, guess

356
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,200
where is

357
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,440
something that changed significantly
and is creating more?

358
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,200
Yes, there is someone already answer
Internet.

359
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,920
Internet Internet. Yes.

360
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,520
Internet has made a massive difference
in innovation.

361
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
The speed of Internet
and all of these things

362
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,600
have made a major difference
when it comes down to

363
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
it has created a lot of laziness to AI,

364
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
but it has brought a lot of innovation.

365
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,080
It's doing a lot of things
that we were not able to.

366
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,560
If we look at it, guys, what was it, 12
years ago, I think in 2000, eight or 29,

367
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,880
When did when did the iPhone come out
in 2000, nine or 2000 around that time.

368
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,400
Right.

369
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,080
Or came on 2007.

370
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,880
Really should I forgot.

371
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,200
Okay.

372
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,480
Yeah, maybe iPhone came out in 2007, but
the app Store came out in 2009, I believe.

373
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:41,760
Right

374
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,600
around that time,

375
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,360
2029, the App Store came out,
if I'm correctly.

376
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,920
Now think about it, guys.

377
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,720
Look at all the things I asked you at
the beginning, how many apps people use.

378
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,360
You guys said five, six, seven, nine.

379
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,760
Then I saw some 20.

380
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,960
But if you just think on

381
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,040
just for last 12 years,
look how much has changed.

382
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,360
Billions
and billions of dollars of companies

383
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,240
have been introduced to the world
because of the App Store

384
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,400
or the Google Play Store
because that was the new you know,

385
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,840
if you look at it,
that's why they said Steve Jobs, you know,

386
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,160
they give him a lot of credit
is because if it wasn't for the app stores

387
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,920
you want to have these
these cool new apps and things and such.

388
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,360
You know, a lot of different things
that changed because of the App store

389
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,760
came out.

390
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,760
Look at how much innovation has happened
since they're so quite

391
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,520
a few things have changed
and we're doing this at a very fast pace

392
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,840
Is the

393
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,080
change only in software
so or it's also in hardware?

394
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,040
Absolutely.

395
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,080
And I'm glad that you brought up to
just guys.

396
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,520
Think of your 20 year lesson
as do 25, let's say 30 years ago.

397
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,800
What did you guys use for music?

398
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,240
What did you
if you wanted to listen to music,

399
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,920
what did you have 30 years ago?

400
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,680
Cassettes, Walkman, Raid boomboxes,
tapes, Right.

401
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,320
Some people probably don't even know
what cassettes and Walkman are

402
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,160
if they're know born in the 2000,
you know, CDs.

403
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,720
There you go. Right.

404
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,040
But look at just music.

405
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,800
Just look at how music have changed.

406
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,160
You had boomboxes, those big things.

407
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,280
You have cassette tape, ones
you have to listen to.

408
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,320
You know,
I believe it's still someone using that.

409
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,960
Okay.
But look at how much that has changed.

410
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,800
We had that.

411
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,720
Then came CD player.

412
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,240
CD player was the cool thing.

413
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,680
You know, you you either
downloaded some music on the scene

414
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,480
or you actually had the CDs
and listened to all the music right?

415
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,160
Then you had M.P.

416
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,160
three player and B three players came out,
the small ones, and then iPod came out.

417
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,640
So look at that.
That's the hardware change.

418
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,640
You know, we went from a big device
to a smaller device.

419
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Now I use LimeWire.

420
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,680
Yes, I use LimeWire and Morpheus
for my delivery when I was younger, too.

421
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,760
Yes. Everyone did.

422
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,440
So if you look at it, quite
a bit of change when it comes to software

423
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,160
and hardware.

424
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,480
Hardware
especially has changed quite a bit.

425
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,280
And over time,
as you know, hardware have shrunk

426
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,680
and a lot of
it has shrunken in size as well.

427
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,120
If you if you haven't noticed, you know,
so there's a massive,

428
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,960
massive, massive evolution
when it comes down to technology.

429
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,080
Now, if you look at it,
all of these things right there, all

430
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,840
if you look at it,
why the technology is changing so much.

431
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,800
If we really look at it,

432
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,000
how can I turn off this notifications
like go to the channel,

433
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,640
it's up in the channel.
There will be let me see.

434
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,280
I know some people get annoyed by this.

435
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,760
I actually get annoyed too.

436
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,880
So where you see, let's say live questions
go to Slack in there.

437
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,600
You can change the

438
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,280
you can change your settings there
and that will basically.

439
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,080
But if we look at that,
let's go back to the thing.

440
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,680
There's the topic itself.

441
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,040
You know, all this
evolution of technology is

442
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,200
is always basically changing
or solving a problem.

443
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,320
That's one thing to understand.

444
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,960
It's solving a problem either
something already exists

445
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,720
and it's making it better in the sense of,
you know,

446
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,960
improvement there or completely
solving a problem right there.

447
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,360
Right.

448
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,600
And there are apps and things that
we already had, but they no longer exist

449
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,720
because someone came out there
and they made it completely different.

450
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,680
They did not reinvent the wheel, but
they just add some some some touch to it.

451
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,200
It made it better.
To give you some examples,

452
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,080
back in

453
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,040
2008, let's say, or maybe before 2000,

454
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,800
what did you guys use
as a social media platform?

455
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,000
What was the big social media platform,
let's say late

456
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,840
nineties or early 2000?

457
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,840
MySpace high five. Okay.

458
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,520
Oh, well, yes, I remember that time.

459
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,680
VK Yes, if you're Russia, yes.

460
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Or yeah, get your kid to Yahoo!

461
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,080
Messenger. Right.

462
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,440
Those were your your if you look at those
were your main social media platforms.

463
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,960
Do they exist now or do they

464
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
are we using them anymore?

465
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,880
I think VK is still being used, but
a few of them, very few survive right now.

466
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,920
If you look at it.

467
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes, One big example would be MySpace. RE

468
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,400
MySpace was really cool.

469
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,800
You when you joined MySpace,
you had your one friend right away, Tom,

470
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,440
you had Tom with you there.

471
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,960
So whether you joined if you didn't have
any friends, you at least have Tom, right?

472
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,000
Good old Tom. Yes.

473
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,720
You had Tom with you
and you know, that's how it started.

474
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,160
But if you look at it,
when things started happening,

475
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,400
when MySpace became very popular,
it became very spammy.

476
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,600
There was a lot of things,
you know, adult content started coming on.

477
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,480
There was becoming
cluttering and everything.

478
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,120
So you see it was becoming
it was just kind of going downhill.

479
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,600
What came after MySpace that took over

480
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,000
Facebook, right?

481
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,320
Facebook came over.
Now let's look at Facebook.

482
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,920
MySpace exists.

483
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,720
What would you say the similarities
between Facebook and MySpace were?

484
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
How similar were they?

485
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,680
I mean, they're different
at the same time.

486
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,920
No, but very similar. Right.

487
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,160
If you look and it was very similar
in the sense of the idea was the same.

488
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,440
But what did
what did basically Facebook do?

489
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,600
It was basically.
Yeah, there you go. Luis.

490
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,320
It was an improved version of it.

491
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,800
It took away the clutter, added
it, made it nice and clean,

492
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,880
and it connect you directly
with people of the universities and all,

493
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,400
you know, colleges, universities,
all of that.

494
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,760
It was a very different nice touch to it.

495
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,080
It was a lot cleaner and it targeted
basically at the beginning.

496
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,680
All the university college
kids, basically.

497
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,160
Right.

498
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,520
So if you look at they existed,
it's already existed.

499
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,000
Something already exists.

500
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,800
Before a MySpace, there was Friendster,
I believe Friendster was there.

501
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,320
So, you know, someone came.

502
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,280
They saw that there was a problem there

503
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,680
or there was something like, Hey,
how can I make something improve?

504
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,800
How can I change something?

505
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,880
And there you go.

506
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,000
You have and you end up with

507
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,560
there was something called yearbook
to wow, I didn't know that.

508
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,840
But, you know,
someone came with a better version of it.

509
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,640
And look,

510
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,440
when you improve certain things, look,
you take over, you basically take over.

511
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,400
And we've seen that over the course
of last 20 years

512
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,640
in throughout basically, you know,
in the tech world and outside of tech,

513
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,200
where we've seen a lot of evolution
in technology nowadays.

514
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,400
Yes, man, they're more on Monopoly now.

515
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,240
But but let's look at basically
just said the beginning how things work.

516
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,720
Right?

517
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,840
And this doesn't just apply to Facebook.

518
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,040
You know, let's think of another example.

519
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,760
I want to give you a lot of examples
so you can kind of picture everything.

520
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,440
Think of what was your guys number one

521
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,280
or the first X, what's that?

522
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,360
Internet browser. You guys use?

523
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,280
What did you guys use?

524
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,720
Do you guys remember the early days?

525
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
Internet Explorer. Okay.

526
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,000
Explorer.

527
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,440
Firefox. Explorer.

528
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,520
Firefox came a little bit later though,
but someone already said it.

529
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,760
The very first one was not Internet
Explorer.

530
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,840
It wasn't open, right?

531
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
It wasn't Chrome.

532
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,200
It was Netscape.

533
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,360
There you go.
Someone say Netscape was one.

534
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,120
Netscape came out
and then I believe afterwards came out.

535
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,480
Was it Internet Explorer
or Firefox? Right.

536
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,840
So we go all the way back, guys.

537
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,360
Netscape was the very first browser.

538
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,160
Now, if you look at Netscape,
you see some of you even know

539
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,440
what Netscape was someone probably born
in 2000, in early 2000.

540
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,800
They have no idea what Netscape is, right,
because you see outdated it out.

541
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,520
And now we have Google Chrome.

542
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,440
Of course we have Firefox still.

543
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,760
But if you look at it right,
it has evolved.

544
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,360
So much.

545
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,840
Things have changed in the last 20 years.

546
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,000
It's ridiculous.

547
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,360
And now it's going at a pace
that's that's it's it's it's

548
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,120
hard to keep up even just,
I don't know, just modern technology.

549
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,000
But I'll give you an example.

550
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,640
How many of you or just any of you
have anyone visited China, by the way?

551
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,280
Let me ask I'm going to
give you a very cool example.

552
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,160
Has anyone been.

553
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,960
Not yet. Okay.

554
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,560
I was a banker and not yet.

555
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,120
Okay.

556
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,120
So few years ago,
I think in 2019 I went to China.

557
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,320
Or was it like would never been to China?

558
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,920
Man, it will blow your mind away.

559
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,560
It is massive and the buildings
and everything just makes you feel like,

560
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,720
Wow, New York is nothing
compared to what you see in China.

561
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,200
Right?

562
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,320
But one crazy thing that I saw in China,
which really blew my mind

563
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,280
away, you know, in China,
people don't use cash.

564
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,480
They don't use cash.

565
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,000
My cousin actually lived in China,
so I went to visit him.

566
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,000
But they don't use cash anywhere.

567
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,720
Do you guys know what they use?

568
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,520
And we're talking about three years ago.

569
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,400
Yeah, barely anyone uses cash over there.

570
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,920
Like, you know,
we don't use the currency credit cards.

571
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,800
Not much as well.

572
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,960
Do they use guys in China
if you're not if you don't know about it,

573
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,520
they use Wechat's.

574
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,960
Yeah,
they use WeChat and basically everything.

575
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,840
Everywhere you go
there's a QR code and everyone scans

576
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,120
there, opens their phone
and literally guys, it can be a

577
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,520
this was before COVID, by the way of way
before COVID.

578
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,200
We'll talk about 2000, 19, 2018.

579
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,720
Guys everywhere over there uses
just their WeChat.

580
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,680
Take out WeChat.

581
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,360
It could be a street vendor, it could be
a fancy mall, it could be anywhere.

582
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,520
And you just go there and swipe your phone
basically, or you just scan the QR code

583
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,880
and you pay. That's how they're going.

584
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,200
So look at this now.

585
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,320
In 2018, 19, way before COVID,

586
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,960
we're talking about and to this day,
of course, is what no one is using.

587
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,960
No one is using cash.

588
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,840
Basically, let's say, you know, now

589
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,560
I think two or three years down the road
now we have Apple Pay.

590
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,600
Some of these things like WeChat
is similar to WhatsApp,

591
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,080
but a lot bigger WeChat.

592
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
You can do everything on WeChat.

593
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,280
You can buy things.

594
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,040
You can do so much more there also.

595
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,880
Yeah, Micro, unfortunately,
I hate to say it,

596
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,400
but when you do go to China
and you explore China and you see

597
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,600
some of the things, they're like,
Hey, it kind of takes you like, Wow,

598
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,960
I guess they are something
Alipay is one of theirs, I believe.

599
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,480
I think are them.

600
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,440
But when you go see some of the things
in China, you'll be amazed.

601
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,040
Now think about it, guys.

602
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,280
So we're talking about, you know, 1.3,

603
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,320
1.4 billion people using WeChat
every single day.

604
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,800
Do transactions
literally can be some guy at random guy

605
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,400
on the street selling you popcorn
and he has a QR code, doesn't take cash.

606
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,880
Right.

607
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,600
So, see, the world is really,
really, really changing.

608
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,240
It's growing at a pace
that's hard to keep up.

609
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,200
Probably.

610
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,640
I would say

611
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,920
90% of you didn't even know that that's
what's happening in China, Right?

612
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,160
Because we're so disconnected in one way.

613
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,680
But yet so many things.

614
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,640
You know, if you look at it,
it's changing at a very fast pace.

615
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,040
Now, recently, not too long ago,

616
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,360
I'm sure everyone is familiar
with cryptocurrency and everything else.

617
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,560
I'll be there, I believe

618
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,120
adopted cryptocurrency
or Bitcoin as a currency now, right?

619
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,920
So you see evolution.

620
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,000
We're coming to a very,
very different timings right now.

621
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,360
You know, the funny thing is

622
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,960
things that we would see in
cartoons are becoming reality now.

623
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,880
You know, back in the day there was a
there was a cartoon, I think, growing up.

624
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,560
Have you guys ever heard of The Jetsons,
by any chance?

625
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,200
That's in.

626
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah, exactly.
The flying car type of thing.

627
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:51,920
Okay.

628
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,960
I guess maybe I'm a little too old. Yeah.

629
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,200
So the Jets and right now
they have a flying car.

630
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,920
I think there was there was I think
few months ago there was Jane. His.

631
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,600
Yeah. My Michael. Yeah.

632
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,640
So yeah.

633
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,560
The flying cars you know they are
I don't know why we need flying cars

634
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,160
but they successfully actually

635
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,680
launched a car
that flew and landed and everything right.

636
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,320
I don't know if we're going to see that
in the next five, ten years.

637
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,760
I don't think there's a need for that.

638
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,240
But who am I to say anything like that
and not to duty big?

639
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,760
I guess we do, though, people.

640
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,280
But, you know, things are coming
at a very different pace or not.

641
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,880
Things are changing, changing, changing.

642
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,720
And if it all comes down to it,
it comes down to, you know,

643
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,120
some people think that there's
a problem in the market, so they come

644
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,920
and come up
with a different version of it to improve.

645
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,960
Soon people will go to Mars.

646
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,840
Yeah, that's very,
very possible and very possible.

647
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,360
Right.

648
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,040
So it's happening quite a bit, guys.

649
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,240
It's it's changing.

650
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,040
And all of these, if you look at it,
they're solving a problem.

651
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,480
Guys are either solving a problem or

652
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,360
they could be for different factors to
just want to make money or whatever it is.

653
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,280
It could be financial reason.

654
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,800
Well, whatever the reasoning is,
all this evolution of software

655
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,200
that you guys are seeing is first of all,
what big causes for that is Internet,

656
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,600
but also because people are not aware,
okay, the demand are changing.

657
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,640
You know, as someone mentioned already,
you know,

658
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,120
you can date people now through

659
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,440
I don't know, through apps right
before used to call people.

660
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,880
Now people have become socially awkward
and you can't even call

661
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,680
everyone just talks to text, you know,
But you know, things are changing.

662
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,240
The world is really changing in
so many ways.

663
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,320
Even changing our behaviors at time,
which I don't know.

664
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,520
It's a different conversation, though,
but still, you know, it's it's technology

665
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,160
can be a it can have a lot of advantages,
but it can also have,

666
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,720
you know, a curse is a curse
in one way as well to we're so addicted.

667
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,600
If you ever want to know about technology,
there's a really cool documentary on

668
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,080
on Netflix.

669
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,480
I believe I forgot what it's called,
something someone will say right now.

670
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,720
I'm sure something about social media
and everything, how much we use it.

671
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,600
So watch it.

672
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,680
Very good.

673
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,080
Someone probably will
put a name out there. It's

674
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,600
Does anyone know Social dilemma.

675
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,760
There you go. Yeah. There
you go. Watch that. Very cool.

676
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,560
Really cool.

677
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,840
Makes you think like, hey, how things are.

678
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,880
But but, you know,
we're seeing a lot of change, guys.

679
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,440
We're seeing a lot of change.

680
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,720
You know, 2018 now, sorry, 28, 29,

681
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,360
the App Store was built, you know, it
introduced a lot of different things.

682
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Do you guys have any idea
how many apps are released per month

683
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,280
and posted on Instagram?

684
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,520
Like 8000?

685
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,360
We're talking about 50,000
plus not not millions, but, you know,

686
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,560
50,000 apps easily at this
point are being released every month.

687
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,440
That's how much things
are coming out there. Right.

688
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,840
So we're seeing a major, major,
major shift right now

689
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,520
in in in in technology
and apps and everything.

690
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,360
But also, just to give you a few examples.

691
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,160
Right, let's let's go

692
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,120
I want to give you a very big picture,
which I'm going to connect towards.

693
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,560
Yeah.

694
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,680
What was, by the way, before Netflix,
what was the main big thing

695
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,760
out there to rent movies?

696
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,920
Blockbuster Raid.

697
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:22,960
Blockbuster was the Redbox, I believe,
still exist, but Blockbuster was,

698
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,440
you know, the chain that you you
whenever you want to watch movies,

699
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,400
you go there rent, Hollywood
videos, blockbuster, everything.

700
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,560
Look what happened to them.
Do they exist now?

701
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,360
Absolutely not. They're gone.

702
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,120
I think there was only one store left, but
I think they even closed that down, too.

703
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,040
Yeah, they closed that down.

704
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,440
So, you know, unfortunately, you know,
over time, you know, if a company is don't

705
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,480
adapt to the new changes,
they're gone, if you will look at it.

706
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,120
I know.

707
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,520
I hope I'm pronouncing Nokia right.

708
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,800
Someone calls in, someone say Nokia,
I mean Nokia, whatever the brand was.

709
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,160
But look how big they were.

710
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,840
Those were the phone makers, guys.

711
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,600
BlackBerry was the phone maker,
you know, that popped the last

712
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,800
not 20 years,
but let's say in early 2000 and such.

713
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,640
Those were the companies.
But look where they are now.

714
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,600
They don't exist anymore because
they adapt to that change in the time.

715
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,440
Kodak Yeah, a good example.

716
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,320
Kodak.

717
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,040
Kodak was a very big one when it came to,

718
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,040
I believe, or pictures and all that stuff.

719
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,120
SEAMANS There you go, you guys,
you guys understand what's going on?

720
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,600
We're talking about floppy disk.

721
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,440
You guys remember floppy disk?

722
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,160
They were floppy disks
very first time I remember

723
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,120
growing up using computer,
there was something called floppy disks

724
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,160
that that had like what,
one megabyte or two megabytes

725
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,320
or whatever was, three megabytes, barely
any memory.

726
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,080
Now what we have was crazy.

727
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,640
So a lot of things are changing
if we're seeing in this time

728
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,040
too much change is happening
and it's all happening

729
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,800
because of a need to improve.

730
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,600
And we're going at a very fast pace.

731
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,400
Internet has made things happen.

732
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,880
And also one one side effect of it,
you could say, is

733
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,080
because technology is changing so much,
we want more and more efficiency

734
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,560
and we want things at a speed of light,
almost like, you know, you want

735
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,640
food, you do Uber eat, you want to save
some money, go left or right.

736
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,520
Wait. So many things are happening, right?

737
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,400
Dialing phones.

738
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,120
Someone said that? Yeah,
Those are long gone right now. Right?

739
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,640
So so many things are changing
at this point.

740
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,360
It's a crazy thing.

741
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,800
But someone is behind it.
Someone is behind it.

742
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,320
There's a
there's a process behind all of this.

743
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,640
So let me give you another example.

744
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,960
Does anyone know
of one of the biggest companies

745
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,440
that is out there, how they started Uber?

746
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,840
Anyone know how they started?

747
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,640
Look, they changed the transportation
industry completely.

748
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,840
I wish I was

749
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,400
so Uber came out.

750
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,560
If you guys know the story,
you're not some weird guy of the guys

751
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,720
who were behind Uber.

752
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,320
We're kind of kind of rich, actually.

753
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,320
They were very rich.

754
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,320
Travis Kalanick,
one of the ousted SAE, was it the CEO?

755
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
I'm not sure, but the founder

756
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,600
no longer part of the company,
even though he was one of the founders.

757
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,160
But, you know,
him and his buddy were at a conference,

758
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,160
I believe, in in Paris, France,
and it was raining outside.

759
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,920
And when a conference ends, you know,
good luck getting a taxi back in the day.

760
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,520
Right.

761
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,480
Or Yellow cab

762
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,920
or any of those type of taxis right now,
of course, in France, something different.

763
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,160
But they had a hard time
catching a cab at that time.

764
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,880
You know, rich guys well, the people,
they will usually take a limousine, Right?

765
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,200
You know, that's how it works for them.

766
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,280
They decided or the idea came like, look,
this is crazy.

767
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,880
I can find a cab,
I can get a limo service.

768
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,880
What if through my phone,
I could basically get an a limousine

769
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,240
service to come out and pick us up while
we're drenching in rain, for example?

770
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,520
Right.
So the idea literally came from that.

771
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,840
No one probably thought about this
before, like, hey,

772
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,320
what if I could press a button?

773
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,960
Something comes.

774
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,720
But the idea literally came out in
two guys just stuck in rain.

775
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,560
And just think about what
if there was a better way of basically

776
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,560
getting from point A
to point B in a limo service.

777
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,320
Uber actually started as a limo service.

778
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,600
Guys.

779
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,400
It did not start off as a as,
you know, Uber X just pick on anyone

780
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,680
basically you want to it started off
as a limo service strictly for executives

781
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,680
people who could afford
basically they start off as a limo service

782
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,840
and then later on they transition
into Uber X and all the different one.

783
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,880
But they came out with the concept.

784
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,760
They made a contract
with basically limousine companies.

785
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
And hey, we created this app.

786
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,200
Whenever our customer wants it,
they download this.

787
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,080
Your limo service company
can go and pick these people up.

788
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,840
So that's how it started.

789
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,400
And of course, now look at it.

790
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,480
Uber and Lyft have completely changed

791
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,920
the entire industry of transportation
when we look at it.

792
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,040
Right. Destroyed the taxi market
basically.

793
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Before that you were stuck
somewhere, let's say 1 a.m.

794
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,320
or two.

795
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,400
GM Good, Like you can call it a yellow cab
or red cab,

796
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,760
but if someone should upgrade, if not,
you know, or while you're stuck there

797
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,840
now, doesn't really matter
as long as you have connection.

798
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,400
And hopefully Uber is you works
in the area, you can get it right away. So

799
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,880
then left stole the idea.

800
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,720
Well, I guess maybe I'm not really sure

801
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,680
they stole the idea
but but yes, similar competitors always.

802
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,520
Competition is always good by the way.

803
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,160
So that's how it started.

804
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,200
Now, one thing

805
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,920
one of the greatest thing about them is
Uber is they actually don't own anything.

806
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,240
They don't own the cars.

807
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,280
Then I think they're just connecting

808
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,000
the customers to the demand,
basically right to the app itself.

809
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,840
And you ask you and I can basically drive

810
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,640
the customers around
and basically make money

811
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,200
and they can take a car
and they don't own a product.

812
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,680
They don't own a product.

813
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,440
So it was a very ingenious idea

814
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,600
for a market that was, you know,
no one really thought about.

815
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,480
I don't even think
there was a demand for it,

816
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,640
but they created demand for that
something.

817
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,200
What is another company
that doesn't own a product

818
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,280
and that does serve
similarly, can anyone think of

819
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,400
Alibaba as one of them?

820
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,680
Absolutely.

821
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,120
But Airbnb, Airbnb doesn't own any hotels,
anything.

822
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,160
They destroyed the hospitality industry.

823
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,680
If you look at right,
anyone can rent out basically

824
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,960
any room through their platforms.

825
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,160
And yeah, make money.

826
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,080
And keep in mind they don't own
any products themselves, right?

827
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,640
Airbnb or Uber, they don't own the

828
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,400
LinkedIn.

829
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,480
Well, those are different examples.

830
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,920
Tory Yes, sure.

831
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,040
Care.com, Yes.

832
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,880
Yeah, that could be well,

833
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,960
Booking.com, we're going off a little bit,
but I'm thinking of big examples, right?

834
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,280
So Airbnb or Uber,
they don't own any product,

835
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,040
but at the same time
they are serving the purpose, right?

836
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,600
One is helping the transportation
industry,

837
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,920
the other one is basically helping
the hospitality industry.

838
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,320
Another one example someone said was,

839
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,440
you know, Alibaba, Alibaba
does the same exact thing.

840
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,240
They connecting manufacturers
to customers.

841
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,360
They don't own anything.
Remember this, guys?

842
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,000
Alibaba doesn't own anything.

843
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,640
They're the biggest out there.

844
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,800
You know, when it comes to, you know,
manufacture, connecting all of them.

845
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,720
You know, they're eBay.

846
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,680
That's similar to.

847
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,320
Yeah, but a little bit different example
in that sense.

848
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,520
But if you look at it, guys, there are
massive Amazon is not the same as Alibaba

849
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,600
because Amazon does own warehouses
and they own the products.

850
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,000
Is not the same thing though.

851
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,760
Does anyone know just a random fact
just to see

852
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,200
how much Alibaba Well, on a prime day,

853
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,560
how much do you guys think

854
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,720
Amazon makes on their special prime day
sale that they have

855
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,760
the one or two days they have or Cyber
Monday, whatever it's called?

856
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,000
How much do you think revenue wise,
Amazon makes in two days?

857
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,160
300 million? 500 million.

858
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,680
A lot of millions, Not millions, guys.

859
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,680
We're talking about Amazon.

860
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,240
I think last time I checked in 2020,

861
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,080
they made about $12 billion in two days.

862
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,640
That's what their sales were,
12 billion, 11 or 12 billion.

863
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,440
It probably is more now.

864
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,360
Now, what do you guys think
is four for Alibaba

865
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,920
in one day?

866
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,080
So they have something called 1111.

867
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,640
That's their
that's their big day when it comes to 11

868
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,640
W thing a lot more.

869
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,120
Someone is very close.

870
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,240
They make about $55 billion.

871
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,000
Who won the $55 billion thing?

872
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,600
Right.

873
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,520
And keep in mind, they don't own anything.

874
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,480
They're just connecting.

875
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,680
They're taking a cut.

876
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,760
So if you look at all of this,
if you look at all of this,

877
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,560
these guys saw a problem,
a need created a software.

878
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,520
And look,
you guys can be the next when I hear

879
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,280
if you think of some crazy idea
you have some venture money

880
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,480
you get a public out there.

881
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,840
You can be the next thing.

882
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,920
It's always solving a problem, right?

883
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,480
Think about it.

884
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,600
Before that,
what Alibaba did, it was amazing.

885
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,280
No one no one knew how to connect
with manufacturers.

886
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,760
Right. How to connect.

887
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:24,720
And basically, let's say
you get the product cheaper, guys.

888
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Everything, baby.

889
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,120
90% of the items see in Walmart

890
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,800
or anywhere
you go comes directly from China.

891
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,840
But that's that connection, right?

892
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,680
And that's why basically they mean
nowadays Shopify,

893
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,800
all these other businesses,
everything's coming out because people

894
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,160
have access to manufacturers,
you know, factories and everything.

895
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,680
I've been to China myself.

896
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,160
I've been to some of the factories,
I've seen how it works the right,

897
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,360
But it's crazy.

898
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:54,960
You can do all of that from just
from Alibaba.com and let's say like this.

899
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,120
And prior to that,
none of that existed, Right?

900
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,120
Someone came with that problem
and it connected the entire world.

901
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,080
Now we're looking at Alibaba
doing 50 billion plus in one day sale.

902
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,720
That's ridiculous. Right?
But that's how it works, though.

903
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,880
You know, someone comes with an idea,
they improve upon it and they re go boom,

904
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,640
They're AliExpress to the

905
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,240
same order are the Express and they have
two other ones as well to the same.

906
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,600
Jack Ma is the founder,
you could say, or majority stakeholder.

907
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,200
Yeah.

908
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,640
So at the end of the day, if you
look at it, they're all solving a problem.

909
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,520
That's basically all of all everyone's
basically doing right now.

910
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
Let's look at some
just some example right here.

911
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,760
Let me show you an example over email.

912
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,440
Think of this one.

913
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,040
Guess

914
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,200
how many works for Amazon Alibaba?

915
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,000
I'm probably sure a lot of them, right?

916
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,960
Look at this example.

917
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,160
Look, there was an email sent on September
seven,

918
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,480
22nd of 2017 to 1 of the owners of

919
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,760
Airbnb, not owner site co-founders.

920
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,520
Brian.

921
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,080
I thought of a way to make a few bucks
turning our place into designers

922
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,280
bed and breakfast,
offering young designers who come into

923
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,120
town to town
a place to crash during the 40

924
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,360
when complete with wireless internet,
a small space

925
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,040
sleeping mat, breakfast each morning,
blah, blah, blah, all of that.

926
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,480
This is just an idea, right,
that these two founders came up with.

927
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,520
Now, this idea came from the fact
that these guys are in Silicon Valley.

928
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,040
And a lot of times whenever there's
a conference in town, Right.

929
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,920
What happens, guys, is all the hotels
get booked out or let's say

930
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,920
big major holiday, let's say a Labor Day
or anything like that.

931
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,200
Good luck finding hotel rooms like,
you know, impossible to find.

932
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,720
And these guys are like, look, these guys,
a lot of the design doers

933
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,880
of some sort of probably UI UX convention
or something like that.

934
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,960
I don't know the inside details,
but you know,

935
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,240
the idea came because they couldn't
find any rooms available.

936
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,960
So they thought of what if we could
rent out our own room for someone?

937
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,920
There's a massive demand out there
and we can give them a place to crash.

938
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,280
You know, they can crash in pairs, bed
and breakfast type of thing.

939
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,600
Basically, the idea came from a problem
because there were not enough

940
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,560
hotel rooms available, Atika, because
there was a convention in the city.

941
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,640
I experienced this one time, two one time,
I think it was

942
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,840
I was in a different city
and it was Labor Day.

943
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,440
I did not book a hotel.

944
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,600
I had a hard time finding hotels.

945
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,080
I had to drive one hour away
just so I can get a hotel room right

946
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,120
somewhere far away.

947
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,800
So the idea came just like this, guys.

948
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,800
Someone found a problem and yet
came up with a solution through an app.

949
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,480
And there you go.
That's how Airbnb really started.

950
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,160
So you guys, tomorrow,
if you have a genius idea

951
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,160
and you know how to work it out,
then you could be the next Zuckerberg

952
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:47,040
or someone bigger.

953
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,840
Did you hear about the guys in New York?

954
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,800
Was renting out their vans for 100 bucks?

955
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,080
Pretty cool. Didn't know that

956
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,600
is also help to have someone bankroll
you. Yes.

957
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,440
That's where you go for the seed
funding and stuff like that.

958
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,840
Venture capital.

959
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,760
If the idea is good,
you'll get the money usually.

960
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,600
But yeah, if you look at again,
if you go back to all of this stuff,

961
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,640
you know,
it all comes from solving a problem.

962
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,440
So we've seen a lot of a lot of change
in the software industry

963
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,560
because of examples
like the ones I'm sharing with you guys.

964
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,680
And you've guys seen this all across.

965
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,720
You know, in the last 20 years.

966
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,800
You've seen everything is changing
just on a day to day basis.

967
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:31,840
I think about a year ago or year plus ago,
no one knew about what Tick Tock was.

968
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,080
It wasn't even that popular.

969
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,080
But now if you look at Tick Tock is
destroying Facebook and Instagram, right?

970
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,200
You see, even never thought
that someone could compete, Let's say

971
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,320
Instagram or Facebook
didn't really think it was possible,

972
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,600
but hey,
someone came with a better version.

973
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,280
Actually, you know, they came in.

974
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,800
Look at how it is now.

975
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,800
So, you know, it's it's crazy.

976
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,360
It's crazy how things are changing.

977
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,640
Let's look at some other technologies.

978
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,240
This, guys, 60 years ago,
this is a data processing division.

979
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,840
What is it?
That's a massive hard drive, guys.

980
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,800
You see right there, 60
or maybe this is more like 7080 years ago.

981
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,840
But this is what I IBM hard drive
really look like we're talking about

982
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,720
we're talking about 60 today.
How big is that?

983
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,280
If you had to have four people
just put it on to on a truck or whatever,

984
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,680
they're try to do it, but look at how much
the technology has changed.

985
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,920
And I'm sure that probably cost thousands

986
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,600
and thousands and thousands of dollars,
if not hundreds of thousand.

987
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,400
So one gigabyte capacity, I would say more
like one megabyte capacity of that,

988
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,440
then one gigabyte or not this broad

989
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,960
and this will probably have more like one
megabyte.

990
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,000
We're talking about the supercomputers.

991
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,560
Yeah. Now look at this one, guys.

992
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,920
30 years ago, a hard disk
that was ten megabytes

993
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,520
cost $3,398.

994
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,400
This is maybe, what, maybe 30 years ago?

995
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,360
Yeah, and look at right
next to it, a five to hour.

996
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,480
Goodbye. SanDisk right here.

997
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,440
So just looking at this stuff, you can see
that you're not in the hardware world.

998
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,040
It's changing quite a bit cost wise.

999
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,160
Everything nowadays
you have these SanDisk ones, little small

1000
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,480
flash drives
that can have a terabyte on there.

1001
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,520
And this thing right here
probably had maybe one megabyte, right.

1002
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,640
The size of data could store our
our phones itself stuff right here.

1003
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,320
These phones can hold

1004
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,440
millions of data, basically.

1005
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,600
So if we look at it,
it looks it's is changing quite a bit

1006
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,640
when it comes down to all these things
are changing at a very, very fast pace.

1007
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,600
If we really look at it and it's because
of, you know, our Internet

1008
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,600
and so someone coming up
with that solution

1009
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,200
thinking of a problem and coming up
with a solution, ingenious solutions.

1010
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,960
And here it is, though,
if we see right here

1011
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:06,120
and see, by the way, give me
let me give you another example.

1012
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:11,400
Just just because we were on here in the
early 2000, how did you guys send money?

1013
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,720
You guys remember

1014
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,360
or maybe early nineties when you wanted
to send money internationally?

1015
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,560
I like this one
because I use this Western Union, right?

1016
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,440
Western Union then came out PayPal

1017
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,200
and now we have what Venmo, we have
Cash app.

1018
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,000
We have so many resume.

1019
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,440
Yeah there's a lot of different one right?

1020
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,920
PayPal was one of the biggest changer
in the early 2000.

1021
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,400
Who does anyone know
who created PayPal by the way,

1022
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,680
or who was one of the founders?

1023
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,360
Elon Musk was one of the founders,

1024
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,160
and then Peter Thiel and a few other guys
came up with PayPal.

1025
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,640
Right.

1026
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,880
And look how much you changed.

1027
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,120
Not Elon has all sort,

1028
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,840
you know, been involved in other projects
that are pretty fascinating, too.

1029
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,000
One of the project guys,
everyone knows Tesla, for example.

1030
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,560
Right.

1031
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,520
By the way, he did not start Tesla,
the company itself.

1032
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,400
There were other people
who established the car company

1033
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,920
when he became a majority holder
into there.

1034
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,680
He basically took it to the next level,
but he did not invent the

1035
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,680
Tesla, by the way.

1036
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,880
He did not come up with the car
at at the very beginning.

1037
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,520
So just know this.
But also not just Tesla. Right.

1038
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,160
Look how much the before the you know,
keep in mind, guys,

1039
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,440
look at this one, this example. Right.

1040
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,760
20 years ago,
this technology was still available.

1041
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,560
Hydrogen cars were available, everything.

1042
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,800
But no one made it successful. Right.

1043
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:39,080
But when someone made a successful right
now, look how much changes are coming in

1044
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,560
2000, eight, 2000, nine or 2012,
when Tesla became more popular

1045
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,640
electric car, a lot of people,
you know, thought that

1046
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,440
it wasn't going to become the new thing.

1047
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:50,920
It wasn't going to take over.

1048
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,680
But now every company
is competing with Tesla just so they can

1049
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,760
come up with electric versions.

1050
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,840
Someone came up with a change,
which a lot of people at first doubted

1051
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,040
that change. Right.

1052
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,960
And you know what else is happening
right now?

1053
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,880
By 2025, I believe, and 2035

1054
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,880
in the United States,
all cars have to be electric.

1055
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,960
Did you guys know that
they're getting rid of of basically

1056
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,360
gasoline cars and in Europe
they're more strict by

1057
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,400
I believe if I'm correct, it's 2025

1058
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,160
and in the United States, it's 2035.

1059
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,440
So you see what's happening.

1060
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,880
Someone came up with a change.

1061
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,880
Not even government policies are changing.

1062
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,560
So many things are changing.

1063
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,480
But, you know, it's happening
for the better.

1064
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,800
But, you know, if you look at it,

1065
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:40,920
it was only just ten years
ago, it's maybe 2030 in Europe.

1066
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,120
Maybe. That's right.

1067
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,000
That was 2025, though,
but it's changing quite a bit.

1068
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,680
Now, another example, just because
we're talking about Elon in this point,

1069
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,680
all the other companies
that he had, that's very,

1070
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:54,800
very famous.

1071
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,960
Now, Space X, does anyone know what Space
X does?

1072
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,080
Solar what?
I think that's a field project.

1073
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,320
They have reusable rockets, right?

1074
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,360
Basically they came up with something
called reusable rockets.

1075
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,600
Now they filled a lot of times

1076
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,360
the guy almost went bankrupt
just trying to make it successful.

1077
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,040
But what is
what is the reusable rockets basically do?

1078
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,360
So let's say before
you wanted to send a satellite

1079
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,360
or something into space, right, Maci?

1080
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,480
I think the cost of doing that
would cost anywhere 600 to 800 million.

1081
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,200
That's how much you would cost
to send basically space into space, right.

1082
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,280
When it came to Tesla,
when it came to SpaceX s

1083
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,120
Space X, they made reusable rockets.

1084
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,160
They cut the cost down to 30 to 60 million

1085
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,480
and basically, you know, changed
the entire game of the space race.

1086
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,640
If you look at it, though.

1087
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,960
So they cut the cost
and they used the exact same,

1088
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,360
you know, rockets again land them.

1089
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,440
Of course, they failed.

1090
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,080
A lot of times you've

1091
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,920
probably seen a lot of videos online
where they failed so many times.

1092
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,040
But if you look at it, the

1093
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,240
you know, someone came up with that gene
no one believed.

1094
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,440
And when the cost if you look at the
before that were in the 600

1095
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,400
to 800 millions,
now we're talking about 30 to 60 million.

1096
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,280
Now they're winning
even more and more contracts.

1097
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:18,360
Now, there's also,
I believe there's origin by Jeff Bezos.

1098
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,560
He has a company, too.

1099
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,960
But you see someone coming up
with some change

1100
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,880
and that those changes
are really basically making a difference.

1101
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,560
And now it's happening
at a very fast pace.

1102
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,120
So we're

1103
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,840
we're part of this culture right now
where things are going to change fast.

1104
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,800
More technology's going to come fast.

1105
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,520
But we need to understand
what's behind all of this, though.

1106
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,160
But before we get into that, I'm
making my point here.

1107
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,280
Let's look at a few other examples.

1108
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,600
Look at this one, guys.
This is the craziest thing.

1109
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,200
And I think one of the biggest factor to
this is also because of Internet.

1110
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,600
This is a little old, outdated slide here.

1111
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,200
But I found this very interesting
number of years it took for each product

1112
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,960
to gain 50 million user, 68 years
it took for Ally.

1113
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,280
That's crazy, right?

1114
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,960
Telephone 50 will just go over, skip
some television 22

1115
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,120
computer took 14 years.

1116
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,640
Cell phone 12 years.

1117
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,720
iPod took four years, which is not bad
50 million.

1118
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,560
That means 50 million were sold.

1119
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,840
And then when you look at Facebook
three years

1120
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:23,400
and we look at Pokemon Go,
which came out in 2016,

1121
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,640
I believe it took 19 days
for 15 million people to get access.

1122
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,200
And I think of
that is because of this right here, guys,

1123
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,920
because of this phone right here.

1124
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,200
Great life changer.

1125
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,280
But look at the access
we're getting, guys.

1126
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:41,600
46 years for electricity
to reach 50 million and it took Hulk

1127
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,080
Mongo 19 days guys 19 days

1128
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,560
nowadays
if you are let's say think about this

1129
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,560
you can actually reach more
than 50 million.

1130
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,400
Now let's see your Cristiano Ronaldo,
right?

1131
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,560
He's the the most popular
what is the most popular Instagram figure?

1132
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,680
Right.
He has like 300 million followers, right.

1133
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,000
When he makes a post, let's say,
for example, millions of people are seeing

1134
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
exactly what he's selling or whatever
he's talking about.

1135
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,240
Right. This is technology, guys.

1136
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,840
That's what Instagram did right now
with the crazy followers he has, or Messi

1137
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,360
to anyone.

1138
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,480
Basically, teenagers crash the world.

1139
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,480
You can say that in some way,
but I digress.

1140
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,400
Kylie I don't know. Maybe.
But I think it's Ronaldo.

1141
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,440
I think he's the number one
when it comes to social media.

1142
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,720
But keep in mind, it's
300 million people access to him.

1143
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,720
Basically, he can sell the products.

1144
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,720
Kylie became a billionaire
from Instagram, right,

1145
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,720
because of the reach
the how much their reach is.

1146
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,840
So because of Internet
and because of these apps.

1147
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,040
This is what's happening ladies.

1148
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,080
I think there's a guy name
can be or something

1149
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,040
he makes this funny videos like this
like he does right?

1150
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,520
He has 100,000,001.

1151
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,200
I just keep up with some of this things,
but even I'm forgetting

1152
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:56,880
some of these things.

1153
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,720
This Gen Z crazy.

1154
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,120
You guys are a little bit too fast.

1155
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:06,840
I feel old compared to you guys
and keeping up with you.

1156
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,560
So technology changing. Changing?

1157
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,960
Yeah. He never speaks, right?

1158
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,080
Yeah. Good.
He never speaks. He has 100 million

1159
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,960
from 0 to 0.

1160
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,520
I visited a slide just so you can look at.

1161
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,760
This is a little older one too.

1162
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,520
I couldn't find the latest one.

1163
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,560
But in 2017,
let's triple this by the number.

1164
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,840
Let's say Amazon
sales were what, in every minute to 58?

1165
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,680
I'll probably put it a million
at this point with a tweet said

1166
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,920
about one about half a million
every minute.

1167
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:40,560
Skype calls were about 150,
maybe probably 300,000.

1168
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,240
Now, who knows?

1169
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,040
YouTube views or million views

1170
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:50,200
are watch probably at this point
since it's four year old, This this

1171
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,400
this picture is probably I would say
probably five, six or seven at this point.

1172
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,040
So as you can see, massive,
massive growth.

1173
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:04,080
Massive growth is happening
in all the sector of tech.

1174
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,800
When we look at especially apps
and things like that, you know,

1175
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,360
it's it's going crazy.

1176
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,440
So many things getting viral
and things like that.

1177
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,240
It's it's a make
it makes a huge difference.

1178
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,320
People can literally become superstars
overnight if their video becomes binary.

1179
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,160
I mean, things are really changing.

1180
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,160
No one really thought of these things
ten years ago, but now it's happening.

1181
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,160
It's happening.

1182
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:31,360
I mean, what's happening now
with even the cryptocurrency right now

1183
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,080
we're talking about,
you know, in the future, probably next

1184
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,280
five years.

1185
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,560
Sounds like something else. Okay.

1186
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:43,920
I'm not going to say that because anyway,
but let's say in the next five years,

1187
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,280
cryptocurrency will become a reality.

1188
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,400
I believe so At least some companies,
whether you agree,

1189
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,400
whether you don't agree.

1190
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,800
But even the way I mentioned your example
of WeChat, people in China use that.

1191
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,920
The same thing can become that, right.

1192
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,680
So if we look at it, it's
happening at a very, very, very fast pace.

1193
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,720
Now to keep up with all of this rate
in order

1194
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:10,920
to keep up with this exponential growth
we're talking about on the software side.

1195
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,440
Right. We must have some sort of system.

1196
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,800
Yeah, it is all the tech right now.

1197
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,640
We're just talking about tech in
of course.

1198
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,600
I mean, even in other industry,

1199
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,600
it's going to take an eternity
just to talk about it.

1200
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,160
But to keep up with all of this,
for example,

1201
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,480
we're talking just from the software
point of view,

1202
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,000
you see how much growth there is,
how much thing is going on.

1203
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,400
We need to have some sort of processes.

1204
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:38,040
You cannot just come up with the next next
Tik Tok app or tip top.

1205
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,920
Who knows, whatever the next thing
was going to be just like that.

1206
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,440
There must be some sort of standards,
some set of procedures

1207
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,200
that we need to follow.

1208
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:51,480
And now we're coming to the point
basically, and that process itself is

1209
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,320
when you want to make the next app,
let's say, for example,

1210
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,640
it's called software
development lifecycle.

1211
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,120
This is what we're coming to now.

1212
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,120
Now we're coming to the main
things, right?

1213
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,520
So it comes down to something
called the software development lifecycle.

1214
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,560
This is the structure
behind any successful app that comes out,

1215
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:14,320
any successful, you know, a next
big tech company that comes out

1216
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:17,520
that created a new official,
not an old offering.

1217
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,920
The there must be some sort of software.
Right.

1218
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:25,520
And without this without this structure,
you know, it's not really possible.

1219
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,680
It can it is possible. Sorry.

1220
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,240
But it will be more difficult. Right.

1221
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,360
So what were you going to get into now
is basically what is the world of software

1222
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,280
development lifecycle as you guys
are going to be part of this industry?

1223
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,800
Now, you guys could be working for
Amazon too tomorrow.

1224
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,920
You could work for Netflix,
you can work for any of these communities,

1225
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,400
mammoth companies
or maybe a start up tomorrow,

1226
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,760
but you will see
who are the people behind it.

1227
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,480
It's not just one person
who invents this crazy opportunity.

1228
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,840
It involves an entire team.

1229
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,400
It involves a process.

1230
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,920
Before I get in, before
I go into more of the technicals

1231
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,960
and start explaining to you
how this works, I'll give you some example

1232
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,080
from a different perspective on it
so you can kind of see a picture.

1233
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,480
Now, this is just a high level example.

1234
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,880
I'll give you two example.

1235
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,160
So let's say you want to build a house.

1236
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,080
I give this example every single time and
let's say you are a wealthy couple, okay?

1237
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,840
We are a wealthy couple

1238
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,160
and you have a lot of money
and you want to first

1239
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,920
make a decision, Do we buy a house
or do we build our dream house?

1240
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,080
Let's say you husband and wife
had this conversation.

1241
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:32,640
You know what?

1242
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,520
Where are you going to build our
dream house because we are filthy rich.

1243
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,800
We have 100 million in our account.
Whatever. Right.

1244
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,520
Let's say for the example.

1245
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:43,160
Okay, So you've decided
that you're going to build a house

1246
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,480
instead of buying a house, right.

1247
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,320
What do you think happens then? Right.

1248
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,080
You most likely will reach out to who?

1249
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,240
How do you let's say, for example,

1250
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,360
if you want to build a house,
who do you reach out to?

1251
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:58,680
Most likely,
probably some sort of construction company

1252
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,320
who has architects, engineers
and everything.

1253
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,600
Contractor, but
someone who can basically builders Right.

1254
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,400
Let's say hypothetically,
let's say you talk to the builders, right?

1255
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,760
Let's say you have a construction company
that has designers, everything, right?

1256
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,680
For example.

1257
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,600
So now you have that company,
okay, You have a meeting with them,

1258
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,120
you tell them, okay,
my dream house needs to have a pool

1259
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,040
and used to have a tennis court.

1260
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,880
It needs to have a 20 seed, let's say.

1261
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:26,360
Don't know.

1262
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,000
A movie
theater needs to have four garages,

1263
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,800
whatever you want, 20
rooms, blah, blah, blah.

1264
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,400
All the details you write right?

1265
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,280
Basically you would.

1266
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,600
We need to explain that to the builders
what you want them to build for you,

1267
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,560
right?
Let's say you're the wealthy couple.

1268
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,240
Let's say I'm Bill Gates tomorrow.

1269
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,680
You know, billions of dollars.

1270
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:45,760
That's exactly what I want.

1271
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,120
I want a house with this, this,
this amenities.

1272
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,480
Right? So think of your dream house,
whatever you want.

1273
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,800
Maybe you want a
I don't know, a racetrack, a house.

1274
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:57,120
I don't know. Whatever you want,
basically. Right.

1275
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,680
So you explain that to the let's say,
the construction company or the company

1276
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,000
that is going to build your your house,
for example, all the things that you want.

1277
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,440
Now, let's say you've done that part.

1278
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,600
You know,
you tell them all the house you want,

1279
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,960
you want indoor pool, outdoor pool,
whatever you want.

1280
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,600
Basically, let's say
you get all the requirements now.

1281
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,840
Now what basically the company will do is,
of course, you had the old shoe,

1282
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,880
the land, blah, blah, blah,
all the things.

1283
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,720
But most likely

1284
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,480
they'll show you a blueprint of what
the house will look like.

1285
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:27,880
Right.

1286
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,480
You see property, those,
you know, sketches are,

1287
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,280
you know, designers will work on it.
So mean things will happen.

1288
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,440
They'll come up with basically a blueprint
of what the house really looks like.

1289
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,600
We'll go over those details.

1290
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,640
Let's say you approve it, right?

1291
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,840
By the way, guys,
of course, there's more than that.

1292
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,800
There's permits, so many things out there.

1293
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,720
But just for the sake of this example,
right, you will,

1294
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,600
let's say, get a blueprint.

1295
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,840
Once you get a blueprint.

1296
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,320
Right.
If let's say everything is approved,

1297
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,480
everything is good to go,
what happens then?

1298
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,280
They go down to the construction
part, right?

1299
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,240
The building.

1300
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,120
Basically, builders will come
you all the construction work

1301
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,120
and they'll start putting the cement,
the foundation, everything right,

1302
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,320
blah, blah, blah.
Let's say it takes six months, right?

1303
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,520
So they start building the house Now after

1304
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,400
the house is built, let's say,
for example, everything is done.

1305
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,320
What do you think usually happens, Right.

1306
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,520
Of course is not checked off completely,
but what kind of things will happen?

1307
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,320
Let's see.

1308
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,560
It's it's built in.

1309
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,080
You're looking for you're
trying to finalize things, right?

1310
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,120
Probably tests, inspection rate.

1311
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,880
You will do an inspection,
inspector will come, you know.

1312
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,520
Okay, this is off.

1313
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,240
This is you know,
switches are not working, whatever it is.

1314
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:35,640
Right.

1315
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:39,360
They'll basically do the inspections
when the inspection is done.

1316
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,160
You know, good to go. Everything is good.

1317
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,600
You basically make the last payments,
everything, etc..

1318
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,320
And then most likely you'll go.

1319
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:51,400
And if something needs fixing
or it most likely will be fixed.

1320
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:51,840
Right.

1321
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,800
And then you basically the wealthy family
will most likely move in.

1322
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,920
Is that a typical process?

1323
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,120
Do you think that's how it typically works
without the finer details?

1324
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:05,160
Guys,
Do you guys think that's how it looks like

1325
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:05,920
typically? Right.

1326
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,320
That's basically the high level
of basically then divorce later.

1327
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,880
Hopefully that but yeah, it could happen.

1328
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,000
But yeah basically that's your

1329
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,120
your typical idea
of how a house could possibly be built.

1330
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,160
Right now
the same way, guys, the same exact way.

1331
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,760
If you look at it,

1332
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,360
softwares are built to
you see there's there's there is

1333
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,280
if you look at it,
software is built in the exact same way

1334
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,600
just with more different terms
and key terms.

1335
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,680
Now, when we apply to this
and I'll give you another example, right.

1336
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,880
I used to give this a

1337
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,400
I know this probably was okay,
I'll give you another example.

1338
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,760
I give his names Apple,
every time I try to relate to real life.

1339
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,640
Now I know, for example, Lamborghini

1340
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,880
used to call let's say,
a supercar company, right?

1341
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,520
Right now Lamborghini has SUV.

1342
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,160
Did you guys know that the
the Auris is the most popular SUV in

1343
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,240
right now
from the line of Lamborghini Supercars.

1344
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,760
Yeah that's the one but they were not
known for, let's say before SUV, right?

1345
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,800
They were absolutely not known for that.

1346
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,040
So let's say tomorrow Ferrari decides,
hey, you know what,

1347
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,880
The Lambo SUVs are selling crazy.

1348
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:19,160
Not Ferraris are not really known for,
you know,

1349
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,200
I don't know, trucks or anything like that
or SUV.

1350
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:22,760
Right.

1351
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,840
What do you think goes
through their mindset?

1352
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,400
Think about this now.

1353
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,680
Think of of a company massive company
they have never done

1354
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,320
basically, for example,
never built an SUV, a Ferrari SUV.

1355
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,240
They probably will do research right?

1356
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,040
Yeah. How can we do this better?

1357
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,760
They have to see, like if we built
tomorrow, let's say, for example,

1358
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,240
they will do the R&D. Yes, absolutely.

1359
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,360
If we build tomorrow, the Ferrari
SUV, are people going to be interested?

1360
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,880
Let's see this. Let's do a show of hand.

1361
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,800
Let's say you are filthy rich.

1362
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,000
Okay, Right now, just an example.

1363
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,400
Would you buy a Ferrari SUV or not
if it was available in the market?

1364
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,880
Okay, so a lot of no's.

1365
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,560
Okay, great.

1366
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,680
Some yes.

1367
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,000
Okay, fine.

1368
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,960
Maybe you got it.

1369
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,840
Let's let's take this most yes.
How about that?

1370
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,200
Let's just say
for the sake of the example, right?

1371
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,320
Let's say for the sake of example,
if you all said yes, it's

1372
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,720
like all everyone says yes, you know,
Ferrari, as you would be very nice.

1373
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,320
You know, Ferrari
is going to think about these things.

1374
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:31,080
Is there demand for what I'm building?

1375
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:35,160
If I'm going to come up with a new SUV,
which we never known for, Right.

1376
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:39,640
We've known for a two door red sporty car
that we've never even tackled.

1377
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,840
AC Is there going to be a demand for this?

1378
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,800
Okay, fine.

1379
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,640
Let's say this.

1380
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,200
If there's a demand for it,

1381
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,800
then they need to look at,
okay, is it going to be a four door?

1382
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,200
Is going to be a two door SUV?

1383
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,080
Is it going to have 600 horsepower?

1384
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,320
Is it going to have a thousand words rate?

1385
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,760
What kind of agent V, ten V8,
whatever it is

1386
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,480
they have to go through
all those different specifications.

1387
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,800
What the car needs to have. Right.

1388
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,840
Once they basically come up
with all the specs and everything.

1389
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,960
Okay, we're going to have the SUV
with the, I don't know, four doors.

1390
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,560
We're going to have the doors
open this way,

1391
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,280
that way, whatever they basically are,
whatever they're thinking, right?

1392
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,840
Then they basically go through that.

1393
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,160
The phase of it, Right.

1394
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,560
If you guys have seen

1395
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:25,920
maybe online videos, you've maybe seen,
you know, they will design it on paper,

1396
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,720
but also sometime you've seen that,
you know, they design it on clay.

1397
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,560
If you have ever seen that, a lot of times
they make a mock of in, let's say, clay

1398
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,520
and they start putting everything
just to kind of get

1399
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,640
feel of it right,
how it looks like and everything.

1400
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,240
So let's say they do the designing
and everything

1401
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,360
from their idea of going to the factory.

1402
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,520
Let's say design got approved
factory goes in all the parts,

1403
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,560
the assembly line,
everything gets put together.

1404
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,680
Everything basically there is
get bought easily and they do it right.

1405
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,160
So let's say the car gets assembled
what happens after that.

1406
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,920
Usually testing happens, right?

1407
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,320
They do the crash testing all the things,
everything if you look at it.

1408
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,840
So when they basically do all the testing,
everything is good.

1409
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:13,000
The cars that pass the test,
they end up basically in a in a showroom

1410
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,640
somewhere and maybe a Ferrari showroom
or somewhere else. Right.

1411
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:18,720
I'm sure there's more to it,
but just for the sake example,

1412
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,480
they end up over there, right?

1413
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,800
And then one of you lucky
people will basically buy this one day.

1414
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,240
Right?

1415
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,640
So if you look at it, similar process.

1416
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,560
Yeah. Then push it to the market. Right.

1417
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,800
So if you look at guys similar prices,
the way a house is built,

1418
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:35,240
the way a car is built,
everything goes through a cycle.

1419
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,400
If you look at it, it's a cycle.

1420
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,880
So Now it's connecting down to what in
it looks like.

1421
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,240
It's the exact same cycle.

1422
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:46,480
But now we're going to use different names
for it.

1423
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,040
We're going to use different,

1424
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,640
you know, we're going to call it
in a different way, basically.

1425
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,120
Right.

1426
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,200
So does it make sense
how a product is built?

1427
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,520
Are you guys getting the picture
of what it looks like?

1428
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,920
I just want to get it and see.

1429
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,960
Does it make sense
how I connected everything,

1430
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,960
how technology is changing everything.

1431
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,520
Okay, great.

1432
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,440
Great, great.

1433
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,040
Okay. It makes sense. Perfect. Perfect.

1434
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,600
I just want to make sure
you guys get the big picture.

1435
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,920
That's why I give you a lot of examples
at the beginning.

1436
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,080
See how technology changing
and what's behind that

1437
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,360
is. Deployment is one of

1438
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,480
the steps
in, as is not really a step though.

1439
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,360
But that happens
and I'll explain that later.

1440
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,320
Okay, so now what to do?

1441
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,520
When are we going to go into this?

1442
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:33,840
You have the big pictures
of how software is basically built, Right?

1443
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,560
So now let's break down these steps
planning analysis,

1444
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:41,160
design, implementation, testing,
integration and maintenance.

1445
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:45,720
Now, what we're going to do
is see what happens in each phase in

1446
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,840
when we look looking, when you're going
to be working tomorrow in a company,

1447
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,840
for example, who are going to be
the people you'll be working with

1448
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:56,200
and what is it like
basically how a software is built, right?

1449
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,240
So we're going to go into that
after the end of Mike.

1450
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,600
And then what's still your money from?

1451
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,160
Some companies will do maintenance,
some companies will not do,

1452
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,520
and I'll explain that a little bit later.
Okay.

1453
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,440
So first thing,
what happens is whenever a company

1454
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:13,120
wants to build a software, remember
there's there's two type of companies

1455
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,640
you need to understand in the tech world,
okay?

1456
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:20,240
Ones that build their own software,
basically, let's say

1457
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,920
let's say, for example,

1458
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,760
I don't know who can say Facebook
or let's say Google everything.

1459
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,720
They build their own softwares, right?
They build their own.

1460
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,520
So the company is building own products,
basically.

1461
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:33,960
Right?

1462
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,680
And then there are companies
that are basically

1463
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,280
another company builds
a software for them.

1464
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,840
For example, banks for example, they're in
the operation of running the banks.

1465
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,200
They don't make their apps
and things like that.

1466
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,360
They usually hire a big company,
Hey, build this software for me, right?

1467
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,120
So there's two ways to look at it.

1468
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,640
We're going to use an example
in the sense of

1469
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,960
of basically the company that hires
another big company and makes offers.

1470
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,240
If you guys have heard of Deloitte,
have you guys any one of these big, big,

1471
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,000
big shot companies,
consulting firms, Deloitte,

1472
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:14,360
Accenture CGI, I don't know who.

1473
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,640
Booz Allen, Massive
consulting firms, right.

1474
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,840
They don't have a product of their own,
but these are big companies basically

1475
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,120
who builds wind projects
and build something for another company.

1476
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,280
So let's say tomorrow, the government.

1477
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,440
The government is not in the business of,
let's say, making softwares, right?

1478
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,400
So they would need to hire a company
that's going to build something for them.

1479
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:35,880
Right.

1480
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,440
Of course, now big even hire
Google, let's say.

1481
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,160
But Google has their own projects.

1482
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,720
They'll work on their own. Right.

1483
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:46,560
So let's say, for example,
a company wants to build a software

1484
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,600
right of or let's say
a bank wants to build a software.

1485
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,480
They or they want a software,
they're not going to build it.

1486
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,680
Most likely
they're going to hire someone, right?

1487
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,520
They're going to basically hire
like Deloitte, Booz Allen or some company

1488
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,600
and pay them millions of dollars
Hey, built me this software basically.

1489
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,960
But what happens at the beginning,
right at the very beginning,

1490
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,240
that this is not where you and I testers

1491
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,240
developers involved
but very high up management people.

1492
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,080
What they do is something they do
something called a feasibility study.

1493
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,000
What they do is to figure

1494
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,440
out is there an adequate demand
for my product.

1495
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,760
That's a very important thing, guys.

1496
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,720
Is it marketable?

1497
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,520
Is this going to be let's
see if we build this software,

1498
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,560
if they decide to sell it later
on, is it going to be really successful?

1499
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,600
Are we going to make any money on this?

1500
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,640
Are we going to actually be successful?

1501
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:43,160
This is the very first part
that happens at the very beginning.

1502
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,200
The initial planning part
and a feasibility study

1503
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,640
happens at the beginning.

1504
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,880
Now, why do you guys think is important?

1505
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,160
What do you guys think?

1506
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,200
Do you guys think is this an important
aspect of when you're building

1507
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,280
a software, if there's an adequate
demand marketable or is it not?

1508
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,800
Is it a timely story as the

1509
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,680
studying
the market is very important, Yes.

1510
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,200
Yeah.

1511
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,920
You guys know, guys take a wild guess.

1512
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:15,120
What is the average?

1513
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:19,680
What percentage of startups fail
do you guys know?

1514
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,160
Let me ask you this question.

1515
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,720
New startups.

1516
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,680
Yes. Someone did some research.

1517
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,200
Good.

1518
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,000
90% 998.

1519
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,160
Thankfully not.

1520
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,280
But 90% of startups fail.

1521
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:37,360
So tomorrow you think you have the genius
idea of a new app?

1522
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,880
Let's for example, right?

1523
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,200
You think you have the greatest app
and everything.

1524
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,800
For example,

1525
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:46,040
you can fill in any of these category.

1526
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,120
You have to understand
this one saying this to you

1527
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,600
because I used to build apps,
by the way, for living.

1528
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:54,680
I used to put a lot of apps in around
2011, 2012,

1529
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,120
a lot of apps in the App Store.

1530
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,160
Then I got out of it.
It wasn't profitable.

1531
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,680
But to give you an idea, right,
a lot of startups feels

1532
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,840
because they think their idea
is the greatest.

1533
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,640
First of all, they first.

1534
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,880
Everyone thinks the idea is the greatest,

1535
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,080
but maybe the market doesn't really think
that way.

1536
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,320
Remember that You might think
your idea is awesome and great,

1537
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,440
but maybe someone
it might be great for you,

1538
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:23,520
but it might not be great for the majority
of the audience if you look right.

1539
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,720
The other thing is not just that,
is it marketable?

1540
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,480
Do you even have the budget?

1541
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,800
Can you market this?

1542
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,760
For example, the idea that you have?

1543
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:38,200
Are people really going to click on
the let's say on your app, for example,

1544
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,600
how to compete into that,
not just that the return of investment?

1545
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:47,480
Are we going to make any money on this
probability of achievement and success?

1546
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,840
If we look at all of this,
this is very, very important

1547
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,320
how you find out.

1548
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,080
There's a lot of different processes,
a lot of

1549
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,960
do they do surveys,
they do a lot of research,

1550
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,360
look at competitors,
so many things, a lot of research,

1551
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,120
a lot of companies, if you look at
they do research and develop R&D.

1552
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,760
They do this a lot of times
because for for a company

1553
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,800
to let's say I'll give you an example,

1554
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,200
Google Glass is right.

1555
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,360
You guys remember Google Glass out in 2009
or ten or something like that.

1556
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,720
We thought it would be a cool concept,
but it failed.

1557
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:23,040
Google came up with the Google glasses.

1558
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,240
No one wanted that thing. It
bombed. Right?

1559
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,600
Or even I think

1560
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,480
Snapchat came out spectacles or something.

1561
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,200
They failed to Facebook came up with
what's they.

1562
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,600
Facebook came out with a phone.

1563
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,840
They came out with the
phone. They didn't have it.

1564
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,880
Do not have any app for syntax.

1565
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:45,000
I don't have app for syntax.

1566
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,800
So if you look at even big companies,

1567
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,720
we're talking about billions
and billions of dollars companies fee.

1568
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,480
Yeah, they had a phone actually
Facebook came up with a Facebook phone.

1569
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,680
It looked horrible.

1570
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,920
It was ugly.

1571
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,880
Even evil Windows, Microsoft,
Microsoft came out with the Windows Phone,

1572
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:00,960
if you guys remember.

1573
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,760
But it failed. It failed in this category.

1574
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,480
If you look at in the very beginning,

1575
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,520
maybe their research was telling them
something else, but it didn't happen.

1576
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,880
So to understand this, guys, is
this is a very important part

1577
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:17,000
when you're trying to build a product or
let's say a company is hiring something,

1578
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:22,080
they have to do that feasibility study,
they have to do planning a lot of detail.

1579
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:22,680
The same thing.

1580
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,480
Like I said, if Ferrari is going to build
an SUV tomorrow, they got to see

1581
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,080
is there demand, Can we market, is
can we make money on this

1582
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,000
or is it going to succeed?

1583
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,040
Also, remember for for last ten years,
maybe now they're profitable.

1584
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,400
Uber was never profitable,
by the way, guys.

1585
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,520
Uber and Airbnb,
they became profitable afterwards.

1586
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,040
Long term vision, right?

1587
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,440
Return of investment
right there, long term.

1588
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:48,080
So it takes time.

1589
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,040
Guys,
You have to understand it takes time.

1590
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,360
And also companies have

1591
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,240
to make very tough decision
at the very beginning.

1592
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,800
Whatever product they're going to build
is their demand for this is or not.

1593
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,760
So that's why we see 90% of failed
because this is the part

1594
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,280
that they feel that not enough demand
for this market ability

1595
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,600
return on investment and also data
in some time, you know, executing well.

1596
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,000
Right.

1597
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,600
So we looking at this some keep in mind
someone who is trying to build the app

1598
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,320
and they don't do this part, the very
first part of SDLC they're doomed.

1599
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,480
They're doing from day one right.

1600
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:24,760
Okay now when this happens, right,
and that planning happen,

1601
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:28,080
let's see company A, hired company
B to build their software.

1602
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:31,720
So let's say company
A, The bank hired Deloitte right now.

1603
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,960
Right. Okay.
We're going to take you on this project.

1604
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,400
We did the research.

1605
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,280
We want this product built for us
or this app built for.

1606
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,680
Okay, great. That's awesome.

1607
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,520
Now what happens?

1608
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,360
Okay, well, let's see what happens
when this comes in life, right?

1609
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,800
Okay,
So now I need to basically what happens is

1610
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,520
from company, let's see
which, is the client, for example, Right.

1611
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,280
Who you building the software

1612
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,280
And they have, let's say Deloitte,
the company, they won millions of dollars.

1613
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,160
Let's say the project.

1614
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,520
They basically hired
to build this project.

1615
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,040
Okay.

1616
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,960
So there is an individual
that basically works directly

1617
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,160
between these two company A, company
B individuals called business analysts.

1618
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,040
Now, you are not going

1619
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,800
to become a business owners,
but you will be interacting with business.

1620
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,960
And these are some of the members
that you're going to be interacting with.

1621
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,680
What is their job?

1622
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:26,240
Basically, what their job is, is
talk to the client in this situation.

1623
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,800
Client is company

1624
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,880
who's paying millions of dollars
to Deloitte to build a software, right?

1625
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,360
So from Deloitte side,

1626
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,840
an individual called business

1627
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,120
analyst is going to go to Company A
and ask them, What do you want?

1628
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,200
I want a software that can do
blah, blah, blah.

1629
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,280
Like Sarah, the client might say, okay,
how do you want it?

1630
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:44,760
Right?

1631
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,400
This is what happens behind the picture.

1632
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,400
Now let's say the planning happens
now my team goes there

1633
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:53,440
and try to basically figure out
what's going on.

1634
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,920
So I'll give you an example.

1635
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,960
I used to work for Hewlett
Packard Enterprise.

1636
01:19:58,320 --> 01:19:59,200
Give me an example.

1637
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:04,200
Hewlett Packard have guys heard of HP?

1638
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:08,720
I'm hoping some of you have the computers
of HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

1639
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,880
So Hewlett Packard had a consulting side
just like Deloitte,

1640
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,920
even though they make laptops,
but they had another sector enterprise

1641
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,400
side of it which basically
built application for other companies.

1642
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,280
So I used to work Hewlett
Packard Enterprise and one of our project

1643
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,640
was to work with United State
Postal Service.

1644
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:33,320
They needed a new application
modernization of office, basically.

1645
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,800
So if you guys are local,
they're located in Sterling or Herndon.

1646
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:39,320
That's where I used to work.

1647
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,600
I used to work there, and our project
was with the government, right?

1648
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,400
So our project was with the government.

1649
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,360
Hewlett Packard Enterprise won
millions of dollars of project to build

1650
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,520
some software or update a software
for the United States Postal Service.

1651
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,680
The software itself was basically

1652
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,160
a management
tool for basically all the post office.

1653
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,600
If something broke down or something
like that, they can make a ticket

1654
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,280
there and vendors can build on it
and fix this

1655
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,720
issues at the post office.

1656
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,160
Basically that was a software, right?

1657
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,360
So to give you an example,
we used to from our end,

1658
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:15,120
basically if you guys are local,
you would know

1659
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,160
the headquarter for the United States
Postal Service is in Washington, D.C.

1660
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,880
They're in Farragut Square regard,
which when it is,

1661
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,800
but they're in Washington, D.C.

1662
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:28,520
So from HP, we had individuals
called business analysts every week

1663
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:31,440
or at the very beginning of the project,
they would travel to

1664
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,160
basically the headquarter
and have meetings there.

1665
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,800
And in those meetings
they would ask the client client is now

1666
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,120
basically the United States
Postal Service,

1667
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:45,120
which has been millions of dollars
to HP to build a software, Right.

1668
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,480
Pay millions of dollars basically to them.

1669
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:52,640
And from there and HP side,
we as someone would go a business

1670
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,320
and is whose job is to basically

1671
01:21:55,640 --> 01:22:00,000
get all the information right
and what I need to show you

1672
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,800
this this is what is
their job is to get all the requirements.

1673
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,960
The requirements are descriptions
of features,

1674
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,120
functionalities of the target system.

1675
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,840
This is very important to look at. It
functionalities.

1676
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,880
What do they want us to build?

1677
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,760
It basically can be is user expectation
from the software product

1678
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:22,880
what the client wants writing it down,
analyze it and document

1679
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:24,600
it is known as requirement gathering.

1680
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,000
So this individual, for example,
would go meet the clients

1681
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,040
and gather a lot of these requirements.

1682
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,000
Okay, By requirements we mean this.

1683
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,320
So let's say United States Postal Service
wanted this new application right?

1684
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:39,680
Let me see.

1685
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,640
Someone had a great business

1686
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:43,640
and I listen to these requirements
for clients in between chain.

1687
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,000
Yep. Absolutely I should. That's correct.

1688
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,160
So basically what they do,
their job is okay, you want this software?

1689
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,800
Okay. Okay, great.

1690
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,480
You want this software to be well.

1691
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:55,720
Do you want a log in functionality? Okay.

1692
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:56,840
Do you want log in function?

1693
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:01,480
Do you want to log in to be with Facebook
or do you want specific with Google?

1694
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,520
Whatever it is,

1695
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:07,560
do you want, let's say this software
to be open on Google Chrome only?

1696
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,240
Or is it, let's say, for example,

1697
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,480
mobile version of it?

1698
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,680
They could be asking things like, okay,

1699
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:17,040
how can we create new users?

1700
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:18,960
Okay, do you want users?

1701
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,080
Whatever the functionality is, right?

1702
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,400
What are the software needs to be built?

1703
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,200
Let's give you an easy example. Let's see.

1704
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,320
When Facebook was being built, right,
you had a log in first,

1705
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,960
then you had a story
come in, then you had a feed page.

1706
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,160
All of these are requirements
what Facebook wanted.

1707
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:38,720
So the same thing when basically
when it comes down to the beginning

1708
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:43,600
requirements are all the functionalities,
whatever you want to do.

1709
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,720
If you wanted to calculate one plus one is
do you have to tell?

1710
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,200
Basically, yeah,
I want this software to do this.

1711
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,360
I want this software to do this.

1712
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,160
You know, all those functionality,
all the features,

1713
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,200
what this software supposed to do.

1714
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:02,600
And that is the job of a business analyst
to write them down.

1715
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,560
Exactly.

1716
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:06,000
They make notes of all of this. Okay.
Whatever.

1717
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,800
They have their excel documents it take

1718
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,760
they speak back and forth
and take all of this information

1719
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:17,360
and they make it in a readable way
so that future team can work on it.

1720
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,560
Are we getting the picture
of how it works?

1721
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:24,160
Basically.

1722
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:24,840
Okay.

1723
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,600
Business Analyst
You will be working with them

1724
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,440
because they gets the requirement.

1725
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,240
Remember this,

1726
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,760
This is the most important part
and they're one of the most

1727
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,160
important people in your team.

1728
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,880
They're the one who basically writing down
all the information.

1729
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:39,360
Right.

1730
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,040
So let's look at more in detail

1731
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,800
what exactly a requirement
requirement done by B, Okay, that's fine.

1732
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,520
Talking to client, giving a go.

1733
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,720
So basically what they're trying to do is
and use the person

1734
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:53,640
that will be using this application
the most by end user we mean is, look,

1735
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,200
when we're talking about HP and post
office, right?

1736
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,720
We're talking
to, let's say the business people.

1737
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,240
But that's the headquarter, right.

1738
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:04,200
That's the corporate office.

1739
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,840
The postman doesn't work
at the corporate office.

1740
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,080
They work at all the other location.

1741
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,880
But end user would be the person

1742
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:15,080
who's actually using this software
at the post office, Right?

1743
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:18,840
Corporate office
is just giving you details, etc., etc..

1744
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:19,880
Stakeholders.

1745
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:23,080
Are people involved in this project
who have this thing?

1746
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,560
Industry analysts, meaning people
from the post office, Right.

1747
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,160
They're giving all these feedback,
collecting information from competitor

1748
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:31,920
is everything.

1749
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:35,280
Basically what this does is
what a requirement gathering.

1750
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,280
Yes, they will.

1751
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,760
They will talk to all the individuals.

1752
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,040
So let's say someone from from post
office, right.

1753
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,520
In the sense of, okay, how do you want?

1754
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:48,280
Because remember,
if if there's a business person from USPS

1755
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:51,480
giving all the details
and he's never been in a post office.

1756
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:51,960
Right.

1757
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,600
He's not the right person
to ask information for someone

1758
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,480
who you're building the software. Right?

1759
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,720
So there are different members
that will give the feedback.

1760
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:01,440
We want this.

1761
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:02,280
We want this

1762
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,160
because someone who

1763
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:07,160
is working on the post office using that
software will have more information.

1764
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,040
Remember, this will have more information
and more understanding

1765
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,800
what their software needs to be.

1766
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,480
So what what a business.

1767
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:18,640
And this they talk to all these
different people and basically get

1768
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,800
all the information, whatever they
whatever they want, all of that.

1769
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,000
Basically they got it.

1770
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,840
I'm going to go over one slide and then
I'm going to give you guys a quick break.

1771
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,560
Okay, guys, So

1772
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:33,640
do we understand that a business analyst
will talk to people, business people.

1773
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:35,880
They will talk to people from post office.

1774
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,320
Whoever their people are, doesn't matter.

1775
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,840
They will talk to them, gather,
pick their brain, you know, brainstorming.

1776
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,000
What do you guys want?
How do you want it to be?

1777
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,200
Give me all the details.

1778
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,040
Because remember this
based on this details,

1779
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,960
this software is going to be built.

1780
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,240
Whatever detail is not mentioned,
it's not going to be built.

1781
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:56,520
So it's very important for business

1782
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,360
analysts
to grab all of this information right.

1783
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,480
That's what they do.

1784
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:05,640
Now, sometimes this picture is a harsh
reality of what happens in i.t.

1785
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,120
Not to look at this picture.

1786
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,840
I recommend gathering it
as is very important.

1787
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,120
Why the business owners have to do a job
well, what the customer really wanted.

1788
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,760
This is just for example, right?

1789
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:21,160
And this happens a lot by way
how the customer explained it.

1790
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,320
A lot of times

1791
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:22,920
the customers

1792
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:26,040
don't know exactly what they want,
so they might have a clear picture,

1793
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,400
especially if their business people
who are not tech related,

1794
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,640
they definitely don't know
how the customer explained it,

1795
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,480
how the engineer is,
meaning how the developers developed it,

1796
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:40,320
how the project leader, meaning
project manager probably understood

1797
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,800
what is basically happening,
how the program eroded

1798
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,080
and what the customer really needed.

1799
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:49,680
This picture is very important
to understand this happens

1800
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,680
a lot in the very beginning, guys.

1801
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:53,920
It happens a lot.

1802
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,320
And trust me when I say this, when you
guys start working, you will see this

1803
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:59,400
what the customer wants.

1804
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,200
You might think he wants this,
he wants that.

1805
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,480
A lot of this, a lot of money gets
wasted on the so much thing happens.

1806
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:11,760
That's why the the best job
is the most important job business.

1807
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,600
And this job is very important
because if they can get all the

1808
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,560
requirements clear, where are you going
to end the building of this?

1809
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,440
We're going to end up building on this

1810
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,720
even though the customer
wants something like this.

1811
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,280
Right.

1812
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,960
So it's very important, though.

1813
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,560
Remember this, you will be working
with business families.

1814
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,040
They will be your colleagues,
your peer to peer. Right.

1815
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,960
You will be working. This is important.

1816
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:34,360
You know what they're doing now.

1817
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,600
What is the best way for the business
analysts to do their job?

1818
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,400
Actually know what?

1819
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,280
Let's take a break before I get into more.

1820
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,440
We have a lot more left.

1821
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,680
So let's take a quick 15 minute break.

1822
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:49,120
And guys, please do remind me
when we come back in 15 minutes,

1823
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:52,720
850 in 15 minutes or 849, that's fine.

1824
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,520
Let's get back.

1825
01:28:54,520 --> 01:29:00,920
Do remind me to start recording by the.

1826
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,920
All right, guys.
So take a quick 15 minute break.

1827
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:07,200
I'm going to pause the scene

1828
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:14,760
and hopefully get back.

1829
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:15,800
All right.

1830
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,600
Yes. Thank you for reminding.

1831
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,520
And it started there.

1832
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,400
I Saw someone said, let me see

1833
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,360
something.

1834
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:29,520
Someone said I was debating
whether to choose instead of be.

1835
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,560
If you're very good at writing
and communication is strong,

1836
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,440
being is the way to go in that.

1837
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:37,400
So that's what they do.

1838
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:42,880
They're very good at communication
and lots of writing.

1839
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:48,360
That's what business analysts really do.

1840
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,080
All right.

1841
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,120
Any questions before we continue?

1842
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:55,360
We do have some more to cover, of course,
but any questions,

1843
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:59,320
anything you wanted more examples
or anything as such?

1844
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,520
Please do ask right now.

1845
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,200
Are you okay?

1846
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,440
I am recording. Yes.

1847
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:07,520
Thank you.

1848
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,920
No, so far. Okay, Good. Good.

1849
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,160
I think

1850
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:12,920
this is

1851
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,320
pretty straightforward,
but these are very important concepts

1852
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,680
because it gives you the big

1853
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:21,360
pictures of how it works
and you will become part of this.

1854
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,200
All right.

1855
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,280
So let's continue, guys.

1856
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,800
So this picture, as you guys
see, it's very common.

1857
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,560
It happens all the time.

1858
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,720
Projects get delayed sometimes.

1859
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,240
They are.

1860
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,080
I'll give you example, Bobby, tomorrow.

1861
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,720
They're literally billions of dollars
of projects that have gone to waste

1862
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:39,840
because of bad requirements.

1863
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:46,520
Guys, literally it's it's going to be some
you can have a big problems

1864
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:50,400
if the requirements are not clear
when we start learning automation tools.

1865
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,520
Well you start learning coding

1866
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,360
first programing on the we can decide
we will start with Java.

1867
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:00,960
Once you learn programing quite a bit,
then you add on the automation to later

1868
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:01,960
step by step.

1869
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:05,960
So you
need coding before you get into that.

1870
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:10,080
So anyway, guys,
back to this picture, very,

1871
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,400
very important picture and very clear
that, you know, from outside

1872
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,440
you think all projects and everything
companies

1873
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,640
operate so efficiently and smooth,
but that's not really the case.

1874
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:22,840
A lot of times this happens.

1875
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,160
Developer might think that, okay,
I need to develop this, but

1876
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:31,160
when they really the client want something
else, it really does happen quite often

1877
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,280
it's it's okay

1878
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,520
it's not a perfect world
as it seem from the outside.

1879
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:40,400
A lot of things happen
when you go to a tech company.

1880
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:44,360
And like I said, business
analyst part is the most important

1881
01:31:44,360 --> 01:31:48,360
because they're the one interacting
with a client and it's their job

1882
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:52,400
to pick their brains, get all the ideas,
get all the functionalities

1883
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,480
they want because.

1884
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:55,760
Based on that, what's going to happen?

1885
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,280
Will this be a PowerPoint?

1886
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,600
Yes, All of these will be in canvas.

1887
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,480
That's correct.

1888
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,040
Okay. One.

1889
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,080
Now remember this.

1890
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:05,520
It's not important for you to know
all the details

1891
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,640
of a business, and it's because you're
not becoming a business analyst.

1892
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,440
But it's good to know how the

1893
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,920
process works
because you will be interacting with them.

1894
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:17,400
Now, what is a very good way of

1895
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:21,960
basically for a business analyst strictly
to gather requirements

1896
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:25,920
while they use something called
smart criteria, which basically

1897
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,520
means specific, measurable, attainable,
relevant time based,

1898
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:34,120
if they get their,
let's say, requirements in this manner,

1899
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,240
you know, they
they have a very good chance

1900
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,960
of getting solid requirements in later on

1901
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,520
answering all the questions
and needs of what the customer wants.

1902
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:48,880
So let's break down
what exactly is smart criteria.

1903
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,960
Let me see.

1904
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:53,320
Okay, So smart criteria, as you look at it
here.

1905
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:57,240
Clear, concise, correct, consistent,
verifiable and modifiable.

1906
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,560
But let's going to more
what is it by specific?

1907
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,080
It means it needs to be exact.

1908
01:33:03,080 --> 01:33:06,960
The the bar needs to ask
very important questions.

1909
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,960
Let's say if I go to buy a car,
should I provide details

1910
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,080
like car needs to be a four door
SUV backup, camera, etc., etc..

1911
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:14,520
Right.

1912
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:18,440
Authorized user with valid user name
pastor should be able to sign up or log

1913
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:19,280
in right now.

1914
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,800
Of course
more the technical one non-technical.

1915
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,200
What does that mean? Specific?

1916
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:28,520
Hey, can authorized user only be able to
log in or anyone can log into the system?

1917
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:28,960
Right.

1918
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,520
Very important questions
that a business owners needs to ask

1919
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:36,200
when they're building potential software
for for the client.

1920
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:37,360
Right. Measurable.

1921
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,320
What does that mean?

1922
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,640
If I click this button, the response time
should be less than 2 seconds.

1923
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,720
Wait a minute to.

1924
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:47,640
Get specifics how long it needs to react,
what exactly it needs to be.

1925
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,800
These are very, very

1926
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,840
detailed questions,

1927
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,680
but they're important for the software.

1928
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,080
What if you build a software
and let's say you click on something

1929
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:03,280
and it's let's say, I don't know, it takes
10 seconds to the job done or whatever.

1930
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,560
Right now that's going to be an issue,
don't you think? So

1931
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:11,320
that's going to be a major issue.

1932
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,880
Catalina, you did not miss much.

1933
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:18,800
I just went over into smart criteria,
basically, which is a process business

1934
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,280
and is used to gather requirement
in the better efficient way.

1935
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,280
If they do it this way, attainable.

1936
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,520
This is very important.

1937
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,280
Realistic should make sense.

1938
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:32,800
If the client wants you to build something
that is the technology is not even out

1939
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,760
there, you have to tell the client
that's not possible.

1940
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,000
Now, this is very important to understand.

1941
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,600
Why I see this, guys, is a lot of times
companies, especially the consulting work,

1942
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,160
they really greedy.

1943
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,080
Hey, this is the harsh reality.

1944
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,360
They've taken projects.

1945
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:50,000
Sometimes they think
they might even be able to build.

1946
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,760
But if someone offers, let's say,

1947
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,160
Hewlett-Packard
$10 million to build a software,

1948
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,520
they're not going to say no
to $10 million. Right.

1949
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,280
That happens a lot.

1950
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,480
That happens a lot.

1951
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:03,160
A good example would be, guys, are Obama,

1952
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,960
Obamacare, the healthcare.gov
that was launched

1953
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,840
in 2011 and 12,
that was a not realistic project, guys.

1954
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,240
It was rushed into it.

1955
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,960
They spend $1,000,000,000 and
they not even crashed on the first date.

1956
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:19,840
Does anyone know how many people
signed up on the first date?

1957
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:21,440
Anyone have any idea?

1958
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,560
Remember that the person that saw
the application

1959
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,200
cost was over $1 billion.

1960
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:32,640
200 people signed up.

1961
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,640
Less than ten guys.

1962
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:40,640
Less than ten people
signed up on to on the very first day.

1963
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,720
And that software costs over

1964
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,040
$1,000,000,000, not realistic, right?

1965
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,240
It wasn't something

1966
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:52,080
that's supposed to be built
that was yours in my taxpayers money.

1967
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,880
What it is,
that's basically where it goes.

1968
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,760
So so remember
these things are very important

1969
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,480
when the business and this is getting
all of this information

1970
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:05,360
realistic, how much time and money, for
example, building an entire application

1971
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:08,800
for scratch and delivering to find one
month is not realistic.

1972
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,640
That is very important.

1973
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:14,480
Realistic meaning, you know, they need
to give proper information to the client.

1974
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,200
Look,
this project is going to take five years.

1975
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,200
No, don't expect it in one month.

1976
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,840
It's just not possible. All in one year.

1977
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,240
It takes a lot of time.

1978
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:26,760
You know, first of all,
having the right talent, so many things.

1979
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:28,480
Remember, when you go to

1980
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,560
when you get into the tech world,
you're not just coding every day.

1981
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:32,640
You have meetings, guys.

1982
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:35,600
You interact with your business
analysts, you're dealing

1983
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:38,040
you know, you talk to them to understand
what's going on.

1984
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,040
You have other meetings,
You have you dealing with clients.

1985
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,080
You're not always working 40 hours
coding in front of.

1986
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:47,120
That's no, you have meetings,
have so many other things, right?

1987
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:50,920
So just to understand this, that, look,
they have to get very

1988
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:54,240
realistic requirements
and they have to make sure that,

1989
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:57,920
you know, you know,
whatever they're building is right.

1990
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,560
True story.

1991
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,160
When we were when I worked
for Hewlett Packard Enterprise,

1992
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:05,520
we got one of the project that we knew
was going to be fail from day one.

1993
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,920
But sales Hewlett-Packard was greedy.

1994
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,080
They took the project.

1995
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,160
The client wanted this project
in one year,

1996
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:14,160
and we knew right away
like, look, that's not possible.

1997
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,120
This is going to take three years easily.

1998
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:19,240
After one year,
they fired a lot of people.

1999
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,800
And yes, the project continued, went on.

2000
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,040
And of course, 10
million become 15 million, 20 million.

2001
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,640
So these type of things do happen, guys.

2002
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,680
And it's the job of the business

2003
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,760
analyst to make sure be transparent

2004
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:40,400
when basically getting these requirements
and when the client is basically,

2005
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:44,520
you know, saying unrealistic
things or technology they want to build.

2006
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,280
Not possible.

2007
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,400
They have to basically make sure
they let them know, okay, this

2008
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,120
now this is the right approach.

2009
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:55,880
There's a mean yeah all business analysts
go according to my criteria probably not

2010
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:59,400
absolutely not okay testable
a car test drive or should I be able

2011
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:03,960
to download the PDF file into a second
meaning it's working is functioning right.

2012
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,480
They they have to make sure it is

2013
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,120
something that they want is going to be
actually testable in that sense.

2014
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,720
So business analyst would use this
basically a smart criteria.

2015
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:16,440
Make sure they get the right requirement.

2016
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,600
Very detailed,
measurable, attainable, realistic

2017
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:22,480
and testable if they follow this approach.

2018
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,520
Most likely they're going to get very good
requirements and realistic ones

2019
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:30,320
that can be achieved right with the right
deadline, basically.

2020
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:31,440
Now, again,

2021
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,760
you're not becoming a business analyst,
but it's important to know what a business

2022
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:35,760
and is does

2023
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,360
because you will be interacting
with the business analyst quite a bit.

2024
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:40,720
Okay, now.

2025
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:45,120
Okay,
let's I thought there was a question.

2026
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,560
Let me see if there is any question.

2027
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,360
Any questions?

2028
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,400
No, it doesn't look like

2029
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,600
I know person wrote it.

2030
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,240
All right.

2031
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,480
So when does testing begin?

2032
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:59,640
Well, remember thing

2033
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,400
when you start on a project,
remember this.

2034
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:06,600
When you start on a project,
the business analyst is interacting with

2035
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:10,360
the clients, getting all the requirements,
the requirements come back in.

2036
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:12,480
Remember, you're part of this team.

2037
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,320
Software development
lifecycle consists of you as a tester,

2038
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:20,600
as a member rate business
analyst brought up all these requirements.

2039
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:24,600
Now you as a tester shouldn't

2040
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:29,200
assume all those requirements are correct
100% or.

2041
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,520
They didn't remember this as a test.

2042
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,200
Your job is to find loss

2043
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:37,640
in the system,
make sure or break the system.

2044
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:39,120
That's what you have to think.

2045
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:42,160
You have to think in a way you get to be
the most

2046
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:46,320
testers are the most experienced
with the application when it's built

2047
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:49,280
because they try so many different ways
to find issues.

2048
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,040
That's when you.

2049
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:54,360
So as a tester, we should never assume
that requirements are correct.

2050
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,320
We should never assume
that mistakes can be made.

2051
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:00,760
This is why testing should start
with testing

2052
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:04,080
the requirement against this
my criterion requirement characteristic.

2053
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:08,040
So what it means is that before
you actually do any let's

2054
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,600
coding and everything,
any testing you as a tester

2055
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,200
should always look
at basically the requirements

2056
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:20,240
and at the same time are kind of second
guessed them.

2057
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:25,360
We basically start testing
from the requirement but not actual

2058
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:29,360
trusting more like, you know, analyzing
the document and looking at angles.

2059
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:33,720
Well, you the
the client said this application

2060
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:37,600
needs to be working on Google Chrome,
but it doesn't say does

2061
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:41,760
it need to be working on, let's say,
I don't know, Internet Explorer or Firefox

2062
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:45,880
and other browsers to see that's something
what a testers can bring up

2063
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,160
and start breaking. Because remember this

2064
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:50,720
business and this

2065
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,200
client's human being,
they forget things basically.

2066
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:56,880
How many tests are in a project?
It depends.

2067
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,920
The small project, 1 to 2 large product,
three or four.

2068
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,240
It all depends.

2069
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,480
So when we basically
when someone asks you, when does testing

2070
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:07,480
begins, we actually start
testing the requirements.

2071
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,800
Because remember those requirements
that the business owners gather,

2072
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,600
they have to bring to the team, right?

2073
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,320
Developers? TESTER All of them.

2074
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,920
Okay. This is what the client wants
in those meetings.

2075
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:20,040
What your job as a tester
is basically to kind of

2076
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,880
kind of judge
these requirements and ask questions.

2077
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:28,720
If requirements up is wrong, it that we're
going to build the application wrong.

2078
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,840
The end result would be a disaster.

2079
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:33,040
And some satisfied customer.

2080
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,880
Remember, that's
what basically when the testers start

2081
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:39,360
basic basically being in work, we involved

2082
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:43,200
from the very beginning in this sense
we're involved as testers.

2083
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:47,040
When the clients are giving
requirements, business and a business ask

2084
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,720
to bring them to the team.

2085
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:52,400
We're involved in those meetings
going over the requirements to understand

2086
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:55,160
what because basically
the software needs to be built

2087
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:59,440
and you give you a feedback and analyze
the requirements

2088
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:03,240
at that time, making sure that, hey,
are we missing an angle?

2089
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,840
What about this should be doing this?

2090
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,240
What about beauty?

2091
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,960
Anything that you bring up in, let's see.

2092
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:09,240
It's not in the requirements.

2093
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,400
That's what the job of a business
analyst would be like.

2094
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,840
Okay, let me confirm with the client
if they want this or not.

2095
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:15,240
Right.

2096
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:21,320
So this is one we as testers
are doing basically non-coding testing.

2097
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:23,560
Basically,
verification is what we're doing.

2098
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:29,680
Does it make sense, guys?

2099
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,920
All right. It's perfect.

2100
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:38,840
So now after after the testing is done,
do you mean to double?

2101
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:42,720
I want to say I should have doubted,
but look at it from a different angle.

2102
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:44,240
Maybe they missed some points.

2103
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:47,280
Remember, business owners
might not think of 50 points

2104
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,000
way a tester does
because when you become a tester,

2105
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,120
you guys,
you do a lot of different things.

2106
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,520
You break the system, you try different
ways to find flaws, right?

2107
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:59,760
So you experience impacts
that you will develop over time.

2108
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:03,760
Are we more than what a business analyst
think They might not be thinking of

2109
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,040
this think the client
might not be thinking of this

2110
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:09,600
very specific way,
how a software needs to be working,

2111
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:13,160
but you as a tester
later on will know some of those things

2112
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:16,920
and you bring those details
up and question in the sentences like, huh

2113
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,120
maybe it can be do to thinking
outside the box.

2114
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:20,760
Absolutely.

2115
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,120
You know, giving a different angles,
looking at from different way

2116
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,880
of how they can be still flaws.

2117
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:29,520
Absolutely.

2118
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:32,400
You misremember
it is human beings make the application

2119
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,720
so their logic can still be there
but they they can be limited.

2120
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,520
If we do this where

2121
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:39,720
the testers are like

2122
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:42,880
detectives, that's the best way
to look at it and stuff like that.

2123
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:43,800
All right.

2124
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,560
So now let's say, for example,
the planning phases happen.

2125
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:50,440
You know, in that planning phase you saw
what business and is doing everything.

2126
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,280
What comes after the planning phase.

2127
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,600
Now, we have done all of this.

2128
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,000
We've done all the requirement.

2129
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:01,320
What do you think comes afterwards?

2130
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,800
Yes, the design phase.

2131
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,400
Okay.

2132
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:08,440
Now, this is the important phase of
basically bringing things slowly to life.

2133
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:09,000
Okay.

2134
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,400
Now, you as a as a tester,
you're not so much involved

2135
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:16,360
in this phase,
but basically who's involved here now?

2136
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:20,480
Here basically, when we talk about
the design phase, there's a lot of things

2137
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,520
that happen to OC architects, developers

2138
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:27,120
and individual called UI UX designers.

2139
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:31,320
You know, they're all involved
in what they're doing in the design phase.

2140
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,240
Well, I'll go to the next slide
so you can see they're basically

2141
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,240
understanding, okay, all first of all,

2142
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:42,120
we're going to build this software
in, let's say, Java or C++.

2143
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,120
They're basically understanding which
programing language are we going to use.

2144
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,440
Okay, how many servers do we need?

2145
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:51,240
Architects are going to decide this. Okay,
How many servers?

2146
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:54,680
What does that mean
is, let's say in the future, for example,

2147
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,480
this application
get a of volume of people.

2148
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:00,400
Can it hold the volume of people, Right.

2149
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:03,000
All the infrastructure related stuff.

2150
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,040
Okay.
Which database are we going to use. Right.

2151
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:08,240
Basically which,
which tools we're going to use.

2152
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:08,840
Okay.

2153
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,920
How it's going to be in the future
when the system becomes bigger.

2154
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:14,600
So now this is more technical details.

2155
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,440
What the architect

2156
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:20,800
and UI UX individuals,
they are the one basically designing this.

2157
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,800
They're trying to understand
how the system will be

2158
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:28,240
from the technical point
and, from the UI buy UI UI point.

2159
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:32,880
What it means is user
interface designer job is to make sure

2160
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,920
that the
the application looks nice and clean.

2161
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:40,160
So what they do, they make something
called wireframes, right?

2162
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,880
What is wireframes?

2163
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:45,320
Wireframes is basically
how the application is supposed to look.

2164
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:47,520
So it's a design, a mockup of it, right.

2165
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,640
How it is going to look when it goes from
one piece to another page,

2166
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:54,120
what the color will be, where the button
is going to be, all the thing.

2167
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:58,240
It's basically
the now the designer is going to do this

2168
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:01,800
UI, UX, this individual
who creates the interface.

2169
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:02,760
Absolutely.

2170
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:05,880
They are called UI UX user interface.

2171
01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:09,520
Basically they work and user experience
UI UX.

2172
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,840
You might have seen this title somewhere
there.

2173
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:14,480
Their job is to create the look and feel.

2174
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,080
Now this is very important.

2175
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:21,520
I'll give you an example which is easier
to use on iPhone or Android

2176
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,960
iPods, right?

2177
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:30,120
Very easy to use, for example,
very simple interface.

2178
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:32,280
Great people like it
because it's easy to use.

2179
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:36,200
Now when it becomes difficult, let's say,
for example, are you going to use it?

2180
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,880
Most likely not. Right.

2181
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:42,520
If the application is so difficult to use,
you have no idea what each button does

2182
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:45,440
you most like.
You're not going to use that application.

2183
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,360
You're going to have a bad experience
with that.

2184
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,120
So what?

2185
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:52,680
The job of a designer in the design
for you remember this in the design field,

2186
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:56,880
architect, developer, UI, UX people,
they all have different jobs

2187
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,440
within the design.

2188
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:02,680
Architects are basically understanding
how many servers we need, what language

2189
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:04,200
we're going to use, all this thing

2190
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:07,640
with conversation with a developer
and all this, the technical detail

2191
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:11,800
UI UX individual is coming up
with how it's going to look, which color

2192
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:14,000
going to the esthetic,
how it's going to look,

2193
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,400
is it going to be smooth to use
when it goes from one piece?

2194
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:19,720
They want to make sure the user experience
is nice and clean.

2195
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:24,720
It's easy to use if the application
is too complicated or is not having.

2196
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:27,960
So they basically mix
all the sketches and everything.

2197
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:32,000
They make the entire look and feel of
what the system is going to look like.

2198
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,760
Does it make sense
What happens in the design phase?

2199
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,840
Right. Pretty straightforward, right?

2200
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,040
Pretty straightforward.

2201
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,560
You as a tester, are you involved?

2202
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:49,000
You might attend the meetings,
but you don't have much of input in here

2203
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,720
because and keep in mind,
they're different people.

2204
01:47:51,720 --> 01:47:56,520
So now we know we met business analysts,
we kind of introduced you to architect

2205
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,560
what's really do
they basically are doing the

2206
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,040
the infrastructure related stuff
you might not interact with them

2207
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:05,160
remember this you will most likely
not interact with that developer

2208
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:08,600
we introduce UI
UX individual means introduced.

2209
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:12,720
We have introduced for people outside
of being tester right now there remember

2210
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:13,960
part of your team right now.

2211
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:17,000
So those guys are involved in design
phase right?

2212
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,640
And they're basically understanding what,
how the system is going

2213
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:24,240
to look and feel at the same time,
how it's going to perform in the future.

2214
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,320
Do we have the hardware,
do we have the right software?

2215
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:29,000
All those details happens in

2216
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:35,760
Asia.

2217
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,960
There are different softwares
they can use for scalability

2218
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:43,520
to see how much their grids, fake users
and things like that

2219
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,080
that can tell how much load volume
it can handle.

2220
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,120
So there are different softwares
out there.

2221
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:49,560
They can, of course,

2222
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:53,960
if they know big, the system is going
to be in the how many users going to use.

2223
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,840
They get more servers and things.

2224
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,080
And that's basically

2225
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:00,240
when they decide from the beginning
they know who they're building for.

2226
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:03,360
And the customer might tell them, let's
see how many users will be using it.

2227
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,040
Right? Let's say, for example.

2228
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:07,880
So in this design phase,
this is what happens now.

2229
01:49:07,880 --> 01:49:16,080
What do you think happens after the design
phase phase?

2230
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,880
There you go. Now we're talking, right?

2231
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,360
So we've done the planning phase.

2232
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:20,800
Now we have designed it.

2233
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,520
We come up with the blueprints.

2234
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:25,960
Now we're going to go in to the coding
development phase.

2235
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:29,280
Now, are you testers coding here or no?

2236
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,760
Yes or no?

2237
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:35,760
Yes. No, no, No. Okay. Or

2238
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:37,480
okay.

2239
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:40,320
Now, here in the development phase, yes.

2240
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:41,520
Remember this.

2241
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,360
You are not the one you will be coding.

2242
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,280
Yeah, but you're not coding to develop it.

2243
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,320
You're not the one in creating it.

2244
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:53,240
Software developer, programing, engineers,
whatever name you want to call it.

2245
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:56,280
Right. They're the one now building it.

2246
01:49:56,280 --> 01:50:01,440
They're going to use their language coding
skills to build whatever the UI is made.

2247
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:05,400
Let's say the pictures, graphics,
everything, the UI, UX person meets,

2248
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:08,400
they basically get that
and bring it to life, right?

2249
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,600
So they bring all those skeletons.

2250
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,960
Now they put them in the best way
to look at it.

2251
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,960
You have a skeleton. Okay?

2252
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,520
And you're putting the meat on it,
right? The muscles on it.

2253
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:19,560
That's
what the developers is basically doing.

2254
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,240
So they now bring it to life,

2255
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:25,080
they creating the database,
They're doing all the stuff right now.

2256
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:28,200
So this is where the developers do this.

2257
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:29,720
They do their coding everything.

2258
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:31,720
They check their code, everything is fine.

2259
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:34,560
They are involved in creating.

2260
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:38,400
So they are going to be
the one really focused on this part of it.

2261
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,520
Are you involved here? Not really.

2262
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,560
You work with developers, but.

2263
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:46,520
But remember this
you might do similar coding like that.

2264
01:50:46,520 --> 01:50:48,680
But remember we look for flaws.

2265
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:51,760
They create the system.
So same programing.

2266
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,920
Maybe the developer using Java as well do,

2267
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:56,440
and you as a tester
could be using Java as well.

2268
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:00,240
Same could you could possibly
look at their code and possibly understand

2269
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:01,320
what they've written.

2270
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:02,720
You could absolutely get that.

2271
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,120
You can to that point.

2272
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,600
But remember, they're building it.

2273
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:09,520
They're adding the UI part of it, pictures
and everything, making it to life.

2274
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,600
So their process is going to be
a little bit different.

2275
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,560
But this is what happens
in the development phase.

2276
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:18,000
Now, after this, of course, comes

2277
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,760
testing phase when something is developed,

2278
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,760
then we go into something called phase.

2279
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,400
This is where you guys come in now. Okay.

2280
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:30,280
Now, of course, verify
this system works and meet all the bills.

2281
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,240
Remember this. This is very important.

2282
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:36,480
Verify that the system works and meets
all the business

2283
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,800
requirements defined in the business
requirement Document.

2284
01:51:40,200 --> 01:51:43,840
Business requirement
document is what the business analysts

2285
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:48,480
created by getting all those requirements
and documenting it right.

2286
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:53,760
So now what the tester will do is
look at all of those requirements.

2287
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,080
The developer developer
created all those requirement,

2288
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:01,440
the functionalities,
and now you have to test all of them.

2289
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,800
Are all of those things.
What the customer want.

2290
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,360
Is it working or is it not working?

2291
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:08,800
If something is not working,
you find a flaw.

2292
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:11,040
You tell a developer, go ahead and fix it.

2293
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:11,760
That's what we do.

2294
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,080
Of course, some activities
which I won't go into right now.

2295
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:15,840
You write test

2296
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:19,920
cases, test plan, automate, log, defeat,
all this which we will cover later.

2297
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,920
But you know, I won't go into technical.

2298
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:24,480
The first point

2299
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,520
will be QA issue.

2300
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,360
You have meetings all the time.

2301
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:35,840
So you go over all of this, what
they're developing, maybe you get to see

2302
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,600
what they're working on. Absolutely.

2303
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:40,440
We'll get into that more of the meetings
and everything tomorrow

2304
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:44,280
so you get a better picture of you
get to see their work or not, etc..

2305
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:47,080
Okay. So now remember this.

2306
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:49,560
This is the last part.
This is the last part.

2307
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:50,680
Testing is the last part.

2308
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:52,680
Everything has been developed.

2309
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:56,160
You are giving the green light
or or the red light.

2310
01:52:56,160 --> 01:53:04,080
Basically, it's all comes down to you
guys.

2311
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:08,280
Allan, you question are blind testers
use it as in tester who goes in

2312
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:14,400
knowing
little to nothing about the product.

2313
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:17,040
There are some
sometimes the client itself,

2314
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,200
they might bring some people
to test it out.

2315
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,240
Sure.

2316
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:23,840
Who might not have nothing to do with it
sometimes, but usually not.

2317
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,600
It depends on the company's product.

2318
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:26,520
Let's say, for example.

2319
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:29,440
I think you mean like in your question.

2320
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,440
I think in the gaming industry

2321
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:35,480
they do something called beta testing
gamers before a big game comes out.

2322
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,600
They send it out to specific people,
Hey, test it out.

2323
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:39,200
So those type of things happen.

2324
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:41,040
But It depends on the company.

2325
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:43,040
I wouldn't

2326
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:45,960
say it's too much pressure on the testers
and a lot of times remember this.

2327
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:48,800
All this things are

2328
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:51,200
made in a way.

2329
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:53,520
It doesn't have a lot of bugs,
but it might have.

2330
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:57,080
But remember this when you start testing,
you figure out things very easy.

2331
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:00,240
That's Testing reports to their own team.

2332
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:02,560
They have their own management
and everything.

2333
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:04,440
They don't report to developers anything.

2334
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,120
They work with them. Remember,
there's a big pieces.

2335
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:09,120
We have business and it's
we have designers,

2336
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,160
we have developers and we have testers.

2337
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:14,160
We all work as a team within our testing.

2338
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:15,840
We have our own managers.

2339
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:18,240
We use, don't report to develop
or anything like that.

2340
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:21,120
You don't, you work with them.

2341
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,760
Yeah, you find the flaws
and then the developer.

2342
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,280
Absolutely. That's basically the way.

2343
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,320
Because now after basically

2344
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:32,160
the testing phase is done,
what happens is what we call production.

2345
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:34,160
That means when it goes live, right?

2346
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:38,000
This is the final phase of software
development lifecycle in this stage.

2347
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,280
If the software runs
smoothly on the system

2348
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,840
without any known flaws,
remember there's any known flaws.

2349
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:49,080
That means there could be flaws, but maybe
we haven't found then it is considered

2350
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:53,440
to be large before the project gets
launched into all previous phases.

2351
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:56,480
Must be company like requirement fulfills

2352
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:59,280
customer need Coding is complete
testing complete.

2353
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:02,640
This is basically mean
that it is ready to go live.

2354
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:05,400
So like for example guys Amazon.com.

2355
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:09,560
Amazon.com is massive website.

2356
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:10,160
Okay.

2357
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:12,480
They're doing testing and development
all the time,

2358
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:15,800
but you and I never get to see Amazon.com
down.

2359
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,240
Well, maybe.

2360
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:20,320
Let's see, it's down for a few seconds
because they're making some changes.

2361
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,800
Those are things happening.

2362
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:25,160
Deployment is going from yeah,
going to production, basically.

2363
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:26,680
That's my goal. That's what it is.

2364
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:30,360
So This is your software development life.

2365
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:31,720
Second, let's look at this.

2366
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:34,360
We had planning, analysis, design,

2367
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:38,720
implementation, testing and integration,
and then it goes to production.

2368
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:42,800
Sometimes some companies
will have maintenance right afterwards.

2369
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,120
They do. It all depends is a 5050.

2370
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,880
Some companies will just say okay,
we need one maintenance team now.

2371
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,160
The product has lunch to three people.

2372
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:52,240
Maximum will keep.

2373
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:54,240
And that's all usually very temporary.

2374
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:57,920
But the main thing is planning,
analysis, design, implementation,

2375
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,640
testing and integration.

2376
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:02,240
This is software development logic.

2377
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:06,360
This is the process,
what it takes to build a software.

2378
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:07,440
Now remember,

2379
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:11,480
there can be some different ways of doing
it, which we're going to cover right now.

2380
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:16,320
But this is the overall picture
of how a software is built.

2381
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:21,400
You interact with business analyst because
business analyst gets the requirement.

2382
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:22,920
Those are the most important thing.

2383
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:25,360
You will be working with them.

2384
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:29,000
Waterfall follows the exact same thing,
which I'll explain a little bit better.

2385
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,280
You have designers who makes the whole
look and feel of how it's going to look.

2386
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:35,520
Will you interact with them that much?

2387
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:36,520
Not so much.

2388
01:56:36,520 --> 01:56:39,440
Maybe at the beginning
they're more utilizing developers.

2389
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:42,120
You absolutely interact with them
because they're developing it.

2390
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:44,760
When you find the flaws,
you tell them to fix it right?

2391
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:49,320
So this is the entire process. Yes.

2392
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:52,120
Everything has to be completed
before you go out there, right?

2393
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:54,480
Everything one step at a time has to be.

2394
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,640
Remember, it's a team effort.

2395
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:58,640
It's a complete team effort.

2396
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:01,480
Every member has to participate,
participate.

2397
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:03,640
Are the steps reversible?

2398
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:05,280
Not really. Think about it this way.

2399
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:06,480
How can you test something

2400
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:09,120
if you haven't got it right,
if you haven't developed it?

2401
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:15,000
So not really.

2402
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:19,320
So there's a tester among the testers
team was a liaison between, you know

2403
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:22,440
you will be working with directly
with all the

2404
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:26,360
all the developers let's say tomorrow
something is assigned to you.

2405
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:27,720
Right. That was developed by some.

2406
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:30,960
Remember you could have four
different members in your team

2407
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:34,840
not one person is going to talk know
someone that developed, let's

2408
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:36,360
say the login page. Okay.

2409
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,520
The developer developed this.
I'm going to test this thing.

2410
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,520
I will communicate
right away to the developer.

2411
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,400
This doesn't work.

2412
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:45,120
I don't need to get permission
from another person.

2413
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:47,360
Hey, go ahead and talk to that. No,
not really.

2414
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,600
Developers and test you work hand in hand.

2415
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:52,480
Remember, you could be literally sitting
next to each other,

2416
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:54,960
meaning your cubicle
could be next to them. Right?

2417
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:59,840
So you don't need a special permission
to work usually in your group.

2418
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,760
Let's say if it's an office

2419
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:05,480
developer testers,
base business owners are in the same area.

2420
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:07,720
So your communication all the time.

2421
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:12,000
Software development
lifecycle is particularly these people.

2422
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,640
If feel like a developer, testers,
project manager, designer, you know

2423
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:20,840
all the specific members, they are the one
who are involved in all of them.

2424
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:22,600
We do not fix them.

2425
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,240
We don't fix the problems.

2426
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:28,080
We identify the problems, developer fixes
that.

2427
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:33,800
Remember that our job is strictly
to identify the flaws, nothing else.

2428
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:37,840
We never fix how the developer made
it, fix it.

2429
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:38,960
That's their job.

2430
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:43,240
Our job would be, let's say
you find a flaw, you tell the developer

2431
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:44,320
to fix it.

2432
01:58:44,720 --> 01:58:47,280
Developer fixes tells you, okay,
you can check my work.

2433
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,800
Okay, let me check it now. Doesn't work.

2434
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:51,560
Still go ahead and fix it back.

2435
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:53,480
That's basically how it works. Guys.

2436
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:56,400
Your job strictly identify the flaws.

2437
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:57,480
Nothing else.

2438
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:01,360
Can developers
and testers sometimes get into.

2439
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:02,640
Yes, that can happen.

2440
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:06,440
They can get in sometimes some arguments
and things like that

2441
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,800
because you're telling the developer,
Hey, your work is horrible,

2442
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:11,160
you need to fix this, right?

2443
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:12,320
So it can happen.

2444
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:14,280
But does it happen often? Not really.

2445
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:15,800
Quality control. Absolutely.

2446
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:17,960
You're the last one. Remember this, guys?

2447
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:20,040
Tomorrow Apple comes out with a iPhone.

2448
01:59:20,360 --> 01:59:24,320
And if things are not working
and you know there's a big problem, right?

2449
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:26,240
Customers are not going to buy it. Right.

2450
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:29,280
So testing is very important
and it's important

2451
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:32,760
in every single company

2452
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:36,320
is be able to finalize budget deadline
based on client can be

2453
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:38,640
does not finalize budget
anything like that

2454
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,840
that will be more on the management side
business.

2455
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,720
And remember we have superiors too
there's there's hierarchy in the team

2456
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:49,600
which we'll talk about in a little bit.

2457
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:52,440
What did I miss do
that makes any question by any chance?

2458
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:52,840
I don't know

2459
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:56,320
if I missed.

2460
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:58,200
Please do ask again.

2461
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:01,400
I think we're good for the next step,
next part.

2462
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:03,480
So I just want to make sure.

2463
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:04,520
Does it make sense, guys?

2464
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,400
Do you guys understand what software
development lifecycle is now,

2465
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:10,440
how it really works,
who the people are going to be.

2466
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:14,640
You will be working with test developers,
business analyst and all of that.

2467
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:16,800
Pretty straightforward, right?

2468
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:19,320
These are you a member of the tech world.

2469
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:23,480
These are the members behind our Instagram
and YouTube app.

2470
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:24,280
Whatever It is.

2471
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:30,560
They're all the one basically,
if you miss a miss,

2472
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:33,960
if you miss a miss a bug or something,
it happens.

2473
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,840
You're not going to get fired for that.

2474
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:37,000
You just have to be careful.

2475
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:43,320
That said, testers test the software.

2476
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:45,360
How about the heart rate? Are we?

2477
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:48,800
If you are the software side,
you don't really need to test.

2478
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:50,760
Yeah, there's some sort of end to end

2479
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:52,920
testing sometime,
but you won't be really doing that.

2480
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,600
You stick to your software part.

2481
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:56,520
All right.

2482
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:57,080
Okay.

2483
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:59,480
Now this is software development
lifecycle.

2484
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:03,000
All softwares are created
in this particular manner.

2485
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Can they be created without a phase? Sure.

2486
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,600
But you see, when do it in a team effort
way in the right way,

2487
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:14,600
you have most likely created a successful
product when you go to this trip.

2488
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:18,240
Now, what we're going to talk about
is another process

2489
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:20,840
that some companies follow.
This is important.

2490
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:25,840
It's the same software development
lifecycle, but on a day to day basis,

2491
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:30,640
some use a different tactic methodology
we call this

2492
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:34,040
and another company might use it
in a different way, basically.

2493
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:38,760
So there are two main methodologies
out there.

2494
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:42,240
I would call them more of the process
that companies uses.

2495
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:44,400
Let's say for example, government

2496
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:49,520
do all government agencies operate fast,
pace or not?

2497
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,440
Let's ask it.

2498
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:53,760
Let me ask you this are a small but

2499
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:56,240
very slow rate shoot extremely soon.

2500
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:57,840
I would definitely not call it fast.

2501
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:02,440
Maybe Zema,
maybe they are in Tucson, but not here.

2502
02:02:02,520 --> 02:02:04,120
I can tell you that

2503
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:08,160
usually if you look at the government
application or the agency,

2504
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:12,160
very slow pace rate, private sector, fast
boom, boom, boom, they're creating

2505
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:18,240
softwares, they're very fast right now
is because they follow a procedure,

2506
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:23,640
a methodology, basic,
a process of how they create, let's say,

2507
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:28,080
a software or whatever
they're trying to do in a particular way.

2508
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:32,400
So now what we're going to look at look,
look at this from this all of this

2509
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:36,120
consumption initiation design,
because it's the same SDLC,

2510
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:39,040
same exact thing for Agile and Waterfall.

2511
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:43,080
These are the two most popular processes
out there.

2512
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:44,400
Methodology, right?

2513
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:45,840
There are more there.

2514
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:49,520
We see there so many other ones out there,
but we're not going to talk about them.

2515
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:52,520
We're going to talk about specific
two methodologies

2516
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:56,360
that a lot of companies use,
either is waterfall or agile.

2517
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:59,880
A lot of private sector
agile government say

2518
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:03,640
waterfall, a very slow process waterfall.

2519
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:06,880
And you'll see now the difference between
which is which

2520
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:11,720
and what's the difference here?

2521
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:12,560
Is it happening

2522
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:16,120
that they release a software to the market
without testing or is it a must?

2523
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:18,360
Are majority companies

2524
02:03:20,600 --> 02:03:23,200
test their
software before they release it.

2525
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,720
Hey, you remember this?

2526
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:27,760
You can release a product without testing,
but it can be broken product.

2527
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
There's always flaws.

2528
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,480
Remember,
software is built by human beings.

2529
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:33,760
We make flaws,
maybe bad code or something, right?

2530
02:03:34,120 --> 02:03:35,880
So it is a must.

2531
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:40,160
If you want your software to be working
fine.

2532
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,880
Yeah. All right.

2533
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:45,640
So the two methodologies are waterfall
and agile.

2534
02:03:45,680 --> 02:03:47,200
What we're going to do,
we're going to cover

2535
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:51,440
Waterfall today, tomorrow
we're going to dip big, deep into Agile.

2536
02:03:51,720 --> 02:03:53,920
Agile is more on the private sector.

2537
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:55,920
A lot of companies use a private sector

2538
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:58,920
and it has more terminology
which I'll cover. But

2539
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,600
let me see if the question
you mentioned earlier about testing

2540
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:06,360
log in Bay, do we also test B like that
for security flaws?

2541
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:09,240
Yes there Allen there's different
type of test things out there.

2542
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:12,120
Remember,
you are more the front end testers.

2543
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:14,400
You will be working on the UI part of it.

2544
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:17,880
Everything there's there are penetration
tests are for example

2545
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:21,640
their job is completely different
they're are

2546
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:26,000
they need to know cybersecurity side
those are guys from the security side.

2547
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,920
So there's there are different
type of testers out there

2548
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:34,280
Is is it possible to test the software
by the developer?

2549
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:35,360
Absolutely.

2550
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:38,040
The developers also test what they make.

2551
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,440
They always test it out
to make sure it's working.

2552
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:44,080
But the thing is, remember, developer
is focusing on creating their mind.

2553
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:46,000
I think so many ways of breaking it.

2554
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:49,280
That's why you need second ISE
and another team to look at.

2555
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:49,760
Exactly.

2556
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:53,520
That's why they find all these problems
and things like that, you know,

2557
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,560
because the developer is more focused
on creating a

2558
02:04:56,720 --> 02:04:59,120
can they do the same job
of a test of the technique?

2559
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:02,920
You can, but a lot of times
they're not able to because mixing both

2560
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:10,840
can become a little bit challenging.

2561
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:12,440
I usually like that.

2562
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:15,720
That means they have bad, bad way
of creating software.

2563
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:17,080
They need updated most.

2564
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:20,200
Like you.

2565
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:21,920
Yes. ARENA We're going to go into that.

2566
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:23,800
You can do a lot of stuff in that.

2567
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:27,000
You can make changes in Agile,
not much in waterfall.

2568
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:31,080
So let's break down any
what are the advantages?

2569
02:05:31,240 --> 02:05:34,920
There's no I wouldn't say
there's disadvantages of SDLC.

2570
02:05:35,120 --> 02:05:38,120
That's just a process
are the advantages and disadvantages

2571
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:40,720
you will see in the implementation
part of it. Right?

2572
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:45,400
We understood how SDLC works,
how people implemented is

2573
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:49,080
either they do it in a waterfall way
or they do an agile way.

2574
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:53,520
Now we're going to see the pros
and cons of both. Why?

2575
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:56,520
Which one works better versus
which one doesn't work?

2576
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:57,920
Which is better for what?

2577
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:58,720
Basic grade.

2578
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:03,960
We're going to understand more of that.

2579
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:06,920
Does it make sense, guys?

2580
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:08,160
Can we move on to just

2581
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:12,160
the last concepts of Waterfall
and explain to you what waterfall is?

2582
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:13,040
Okay.

2583
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:16,560
A lot of the projects, by the way,
when it comes to government guys,

2584
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:21,080
a lot of them are using waterfall
because they're slow, right?

2585
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,440
They're very slow.

2586
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:24,000
They like to do it in a specific.

2587
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,080
Let me explain this to you exactly
like construction.

2588
02:06:27,080 --> 02:06:30,040
A waterfall methodology
is a sequential design process.

2589
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:33,200
Once a step has been completed,

2590
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:36,600
the developers can go back a previous step

2591
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:41,000
unless this crashed the whole project
and start from the beginning.

2592
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,720
This is very important.

2593
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:44,040
No room for error.

2594
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:48,320
So project outcome and plan
must be determined before starting it.

2595
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:51,680
What it means this guys in Waterfall
project.

2596
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:52,000
Right?

2597
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,200
Let's say a company is falling
waterfall methodology to a software.

2598
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,520
It's basically exactly like SDLC, right?

2599
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:03,560
What it means, guys, is
every step needs to be completed, right?

2600
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:04,680
So this means this way.

2601
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:06,800
Let's go back and look at this picture.

2602
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,680
So let's say planning and designing happen
requirements have been gathered

2603
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:13,560
everything
and you start working on the design side.

2604
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:17,240
Let's see in the meetings
or designing or implementation.

2605
02:07:17,240 --> 02:07:20,080
Coding for developer design
is things that, hey,

2606
02:07:20,440 --> 02:07:23,760
by the way,
I think we can design this better.

2607
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,280
There should be a requirement for this is,
Hey, a business analyst, can you

2608
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:27,800
check with

2609
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:32,880
the client
if they want, add this feature, etc.

2610
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:33,920
or something like that.

2611
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:36,840
Let's say
a new requirement came more later on.

2612
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,560
Let's say the developer or the designer
figure out something.

2613
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:40,800
Right now.

2614
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:44,480
This is a requirement, a functionality
change or something like that.

2615
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:49,080
In Waterfall, you cannot go back,
you cannot a new idea or new function.

2616
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:54,920
Once documentation business analyst did,
all the requirements is completed.

2617
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:57,240
There's no going back now, if you ask me.

2618
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:59,720
It's ridiculous, right?
Maybe something better could have.

2619
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:04,120
Maybe you could have all this with
the design is completely completed.

2620
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:05,400
Everything is approved.

2621
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:09,000
And when the developer comes to coding
and everything and you see that, hey,

2622
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:10,560
this design is ugly.

2623
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,520
I don't like it.

2624
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:14,000
This can be done in a better way.

2625
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,440
They go back and change it.

2626
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:19,160
In order for to change anything,
the entire project

2627
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:22,680
has to be finished.

2628
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:24,960
No, not alone.
I think you're getting confused.

2629
02:08:25,160 --> 02:08:29,080
When we find flaws in waterfall,
we can fix that.

2630
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:33,080
Flaws is different requirements,
very different functionalities.

2631
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:36,720
Remove that functionalities,
maybe adding other things.

2632
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:37,760
Let's say, for example.

2633
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:41,760
Oh well, maybe we can add a logging button
on this speech.

2634
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,400
Logging button could be working fine.

2635
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:46,680
Maybe a new idea
or new feature came, right?

2636
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:49,040
You can add that.

2637
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:51,800
But in Waterfall,
if the company is following waterfall

2638
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:55,160
methodology, you cannot do this
when it comes to testing.

2639
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:59,240
If you find bugs in when you are,
for example, doing a waterfall project.

2640
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:01,680
Absolutely. You can report it.
They're going to be fixed.

2641
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:05,320
But that's not fixing
that's not adding new requirements.

2642
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:06,200
Right? It's not.

2643
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:08,360
Cheating is just something
they do not work.

2644
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:10,160
You can absolutely fix that.

2645
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:12,840
There's no such thing as, you know,

2646
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:14,920
testers cannot find bugs in every day.

2647
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:17,280
No, no, absolutely not.

2648
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:20,520
That is one of the biggest disadvantage
of waterfall.

2649
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,400
And a lot of companies do this.

2650
02:09:22,400 --> 02:09:25,680
If you've seen a lot of this government
project that takes a long time,

2651
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:28,680
a lot of times
is because this is what it is.

2652
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:29,640
Think this, too.

2653
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:32,960
A lot of times government
projects are three or four year long

2654
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:36,120
and when the project is completed
after three or four years

2655
02:09:36,360 --> 02:09:39,000
and the customer
finally gets to see that project

2656
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:41,960
either is outdated
or there are things they don't like.

2657
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:43,960
And if they have to start
the entire project,

2658
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:46,920
there's a lot of contractual things,
a lot of different things.

2659
02:09:47,200 --> 02:09:50,040
So there are some big, big disadvantage.

2660
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:53,360
But when do you use It's still not bad.

2661
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:59,800
Remember when there is a clear picture of
product should be the one quality, right?

2662
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:00,840
This is very important.

2663
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:03,360
One quality and not speed.

2664
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:06,200
That means when you don't care,
just get it done.

2665
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:07,720
Just make sure it's working fine.

2666
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:08,240
I don't care.

2667
02:10:08,240 --> 02:10:12,240
It takes you ten years
and you have clear requirements

2668
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:14,760
when the client wants
in the scope of the problem.

2669
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:16,120
Once the project began.

2670
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:18,760
Well, here it's very, very, very

2671
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:22,520
that you have very clear requirements

2672
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:27,320
that mean the business end is better get
the right requirements from the beginning,

2673
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:31,880
because if you get or miss requirements,
you remember this, you cannot.

2674
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:34,480
Adams Later
on, that's one of the biggest things.

2675
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:38,720
Then the new government
comes in that happens sometimes.

2676
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:41,280
Do they? Absolutely.

2677
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:43,680
Why are they using this methodology?

2678
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,640
Great. A great point.

2679
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:46,800
The problem is this.

2680
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:51,000
Look, there's especially for
the government, I work for the government.

2681
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,000
So I can tell you this from my experience,
a lot of times in the government,

2682
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:56,640
there are a lot of incompetent people.

2683
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:58,760
I'll be very honest with you.

2684
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:01,720
What that means is
I'll give you an example.

2685
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:07,360
The management sometimes are not very tech
savvy or they're in government.

2686
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:08,800
They don't like change.

2687
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:11,080
Maybe you work for the government
and maybe you haven't.

2688
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:14,520
And if you've noticed in the past,
if you work with

2689
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:18,520
maybe worked in the government,
people work in a lot of this thing.

2690
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:20,560
They don't like this
or there's a lot of this. Right.

2691
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:23,640
And there are people
one thing you remember this in America,

2692
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:24,840
I'm not sure if applies.

2693
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:28,800
It was once you become a government
employee, good luck getting fired.

2694
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:30,120
You never get fired.

2695
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:32,400
It's impossible to get fired. Right.

2696
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:35,920
And there are a lot of people out there
who are not competent enough

2697
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:37,920
to be doing what they're doing.

2698
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:39,120
And they are the position.

2699
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:43,360
That's why a lot of the projects
are either over budget.

2700
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:47,560
So maybe why do you see
so so many other government agencies run?

2701
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:51,360
Horribly, because of the same way people
the people who are in control.

2702
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:54,040
There shouldn't be the one simply
that's what it is.

2703
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:58,040
They'll give you a very good example
when I work for you

2704
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:58,960
Packer Enterprises

2705
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:01,720
and the project that we won
for the United States Postal Service,

2706
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:04,720
the business individual who was in charge

2707
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:09,240
of the project from the government side
or the US side, this individual

2708
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:16,560
before him be in the
IT sector was a recruiter for the Marines.

2709
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:18,000
What does he know about it?

2710
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:20,440
What does he know?

2711
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:21,160
Anything.

2712
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:25,080
He was the guy who was recruiting people
from high school and college.

2713
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,720
Hey, come join the Marine,
Go in the army or something.

2714
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:28,200
Right.

2715
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:31,920
Does he have the right credentials
to be a business person?

2716
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:33,000
But not really.

2717
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,120
A lot of time favors things like that.

2718
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:37,440
Not saying it happens
all across the government,

2719
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:41,760
but a lot of times it's bad management
and they don't like change.

2720
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,040
They like things like this.

2721
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:46,720
I remember going to meetings
at the government's giving them

2722
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:48,920
suggestion,
Do this, this where they're like, Now

2723
02:12:49,160 --> 02:12:50,760
can we stick to the way we're doing?

2724
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:52,760
They don't like change.

2725
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:55,960
So a lot of times you could say
this is the management.

2726
02:12:56,160 --> 02:13:01,000
Slowly, the government is slowly changing,
but it's a long, long process.

2727
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:04,520
Just just look at your website, government
agency website.

2728
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:09,240
Go the old fashioned way, the DMV website
or all the IRS.

2729
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:12,240
You know, we never get our taxes on time.

2730
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:15,360
I got my taxes literally
after such a long time.

2731
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:20,800
Tax rate is very outdated and the people
working there are out there as well, too.

2732
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,760
All that, nothing wrong with that,
but they're not up to date.

2733
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:26,160
So a lot of times this is what happens.

2734
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:28,880
And there are a lot of issues
in the government.

2735
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:31,560
If you work in the government,
you definitely would not.

2736
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:35,760
And a lot of times
they're the one using waterfall.

2737
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:40,760
So a lot of problems it can be good for
for the company who wins the project.

2738
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:43,840
They can stretch it out for years
and years and get money

2739
02:13:43,840 --> 02:13:45,840
because government is a printing machine,
right?

2740
02:13:46,160 --> 02:13:48,080
You print dollars all the time.

2741
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:50,400
So it's good, but unfortunately bad.

2742
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:54,240
Management, so many things you can say.

2743
02:13:54,240 --> 02:13:55,640
So there's the answer.

2744
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:59,080
That's why some places still use waterfall

2745
02:13:59,320 --> 02:14:02,880
and it's still very popular amongst
especially government.

2746
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:05,720
But can it work? Absolutely.

2747
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:08,440
Waterfall
can work. It's easy to understand.

2748
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:09,080
Remember this?

2749
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:12,280
This model is simply easy
to understand, easy to manage.

2750
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:15,120
Each page has specific
deliverables and pricing.

2751
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:18,120
When when, when a phase is completed,
it's done.

2752
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:22,680
Is checkmark suitable
for a simple or smaller project?

2753
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:26,040
Waterfall model works
well for small project

2754
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:29,760
where requirements are very well
understood.

2755
02:14:29,760 --> 02:14:31,280
This is very important.

2756
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:36,120
That means if you have an idea,
a clear idea, it's okay to use waterfall.

2757
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:38,160
Trust me, you will see agile too.

2758
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:40,240
Agile has some pros and cons do.

2759
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:41,760
It's a step by step phase.

2760
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:44,720
The phase
our process and complete one at a time.

2761
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:46,480
Phases do not overlap.

2762
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:48,480
That means design is complete.

2763
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:49,760
Done. That's it.

2764
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,680
Maybe they'll fire the design afterwards.

2765
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:53,560
He doesn't have to do any work. Right.

2766
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:57,320
So it's important to understand
that it's not flawed.

2767
02:14:57,680 --> 02:15:00,280
It's not in, it's not perfect.

2768
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:01,680
It can work.

2769
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:05,440
But in certain circumstances,
only when you have clear

2770
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:08,880
picture simple project
and you have clear requirements.

2771
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:11,800
Very, very important to understand that.

2772
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,880
So not so horrible, but still horrible.

2773
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:16,640
I guess that's
is the best way to look at it.

2774
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:19,760
It depends on who's managing these
projects and everything. So

2775
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:22,960
let's look at some disadvantages.

2776
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:25,760
This disadvantage,
I think, are more obvious.

2777
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:30,520
Once a step is completed,
developers cannot go back to change.

2778
02:15:30,520 --> 02:15:32,240
Previous step and make changes.

2779
02:15:32,240 --> 02:15:35,360
It doesn't mean that, you know,
they cannot go fixed.

2780
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:36,560
Let's see

2781
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,640
something. That's a test.

2782
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:40,280
Your phone as a flaw.

2783
02:15:40,280 --> 02:15:43,560
No, it's
the initial functionality of that.

2784
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:45,120
They cannot change it

2785
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:48,600
if they want that change project
has to be completed later on.

2786
02:15:48,600 --> 02:15:51,960
It can be done again.

2787
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:56,800
Initial requirement Waterfall relies
heavily on initial requirement.

2788
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:59,840
The project is doomed
if requirements are not clear.

2789
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:03,560
Yes, remember guys, there are billions

2790
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:06,280
and billions of projects
that got wasted like this.

2791
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:10,360
I think one of the project was by Lockheed
Martin or IBM

2792
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:13,400
that took five years, $1.3 billion.

2793
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:18,120
And when the project got done after five
or six years, the technology was outdated.

2794
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,760
IBM got 1.5 were Lockheed Martin got 1.5,

2795
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:24,920
$1.3 billion, but project was wasted.

2796
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:26,240
So these are some of the things

2797
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:30,240
because remember this
the clients does not see the project or,

2798
02:16:30,240 --> 02:16:34,240
the application till it's completed
and that could take five years.

2799
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:36,680
They have no idea
what the hell you guys are building.

2800
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:38,400
Sure, they'll have some meetings,

2801
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:41,320
but they will have no idea
how the software looks.

2802
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:45,960
They can only make the changes and things
once everything is complete and then

2803
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:50,160
if they want to require mean changes,
they're going to pay extra for that.

2804
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,480
Now you're probably thinking,
why do people do that? Well,

2805
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:54,440
I have no idea.

2806
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:55,360
I have

2807
02:16:58,040 --> 02:17:00,520
one of those good point,
but they're still using it.

2808
02:17:00,520 --> 02:17:04,040
There's like I said, a lot of people,
like old fashioned people.

2809
02:17:04,040 --> 02:17:06,360
They're using the old fashioned
techniques.

2810
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:11,160
The government does this and that's why we
see sometime garmin's a little bit slow.

2811
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:12,480
Right.

2812
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:15,320
Okay. Does not allow
for requirement change.

2813
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:19,080
If a requirement errors found or remember
this, this is very key.

2814
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:22,400
If a requirement error, not a bug.

2815
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:23,080
Okay.

2816
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:26,600
If a requirement error is found or change
needs to be made,

2817
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:30,720
the profile of the whole project
has to restart from beginning.

2818
02:17:30,720 --> 02:17:34,440
That means a new functionality
they wanted or a functionality

2819
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:38,040
that they wanted us to build doesn't work
or something.

2820
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:41,280
Project has to be completed it regime.

2821
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:42,920
Then it can make the changes.

2822
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:46,480
Remember, bugs are different,
they are not requirements.

2823
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:50,040
Those are just whatever
the requirements are built into created.

2824
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:51,680
We're talking about strictly that.

2825
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:53,040
So don't confuse it.

2826
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:56,320
Yes, testers can find issues
and everything.

2827
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:59,120
They're losing money absolutely 100%.

2828
02:17:59,120 --> 02:18:03,480
They lose money only suitable
for small project and chemical. Yep.

2829
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:04,880
You guys will see.

2830
02:18:04,880 --> 02:18:09,840
Actually later on tomorrow I'll show you
some figures of how many projects fails.

2831
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:12,160
You will see exactly what percentage

2832
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:16,040
of them for no working product
until near completion.

2833
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:19,760
Again,
No working product until near completion.

2834
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:23,840
All the steps have to be independent
completely before

2835
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:26,080
the final product is delivered.

2836
02:18:26,080 --> 02:18:29,400
So that means nothing is fully working
to the very end.

2837
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:36,120
And the customer
only gets to see this at the very end.

2838
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:37,760
Why don't we fix the problem?

2839
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:41,000
Remember fixing the the the bugs.

2840
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:44,920
You do that when you
I guess you guys are for mixing this.

2841
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:47,280
The requirements are different.
Remember this.

2842
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:52,480
Let's say on a page there's a logging
button logging button at the top.

2843
02:18:52,480 --> 02:18:54,560
Right? Let's say it's not working.

2844
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:57,240
You tell the developer, fix that
he'll start, he'll fix it.

2845
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:59,840
But what if you decide, you realize, hey,

2846
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:02,480
the logging input
needs to be on another page?

2847
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:06,640
Now that is the same logging button,
but it needs to be on a different page.

2848
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,520
That means a requirement.

2849
02:19:08,520 --> 02:19:09,920
Change needs to happen, right?

2850
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,240
That is not being allowed in this.

2851
02:19:12,480 --> 02:19:18,400
That can only be allowed
when the entire project is done.

2852
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:22,840
Yes, there have a lot of these projects
have timeline and sometimes you see

2853
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:26,760
we rushed certain things at the end.

2854
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:31,120
All the client remember at the beginning
you have all the,

2855
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:35,000
you know, meetings and everything,
but they don't get to see the product

2856
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,080
fully functioning because we're not
delivering them the product

2857
02:19:38,440 --> 02:19:39,320
chunk by chunk.

2858
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:42,160
We give them the project
only when the entire thing is done.

2859
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:45,080
That's just contractually how it is.

2860
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:48,440
That's how their things are,
because they don't have a full picture.

2861
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:53,640
Only when things are done,
they get to see that.

2862
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:55,200
Oh, it's crazy, right?

2863
02:19:55,200 --> 02:19:57,960
So let's look at some of the disadvantage
a little bit more.

2864
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:00,600
Okay. So what happens with this?

2865
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:04,800
Imagine what some of the thing for
when the project starts to run out of time

2866
02:20:05,160 --> 02:20:08,160
and money testing is the only phase left.

2867
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:13,920
This mean good project are forced to cut
testing short and quality suffers.

2868
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:17,160
Remember
we are the last phase the testing.

2869
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:21,040
So when let's say the project is let's say
five years long and they spend

2870
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:25,040
one year on analysis,
one and a half year on design, two years

2871
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:30,040
on, let's say or let's say
one and a half year on development,

2872
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:34,200
now you're given six months for testing
and you have to finish the project

2873
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:35,400
in five years, let's say. Right?

2874
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:39,360
Not enough time,
money and everything is running short.

2875
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:40,320
You have to finish.

2876
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,360
This is what happens.

2877
02:20:41,360 --> 02:20:45,040
This is exactly happened.

2878
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:46,320
The requirements are not met.

2879
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:48,440
Do they have to start again?
Like will you project?

2880
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:52,760
What will happen is the project terminal
will most likely get delayed.

2881
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:57,120
So let's say if a five year project might
become five and a half year or six years,

2882
02:20:57,360 --> 02:20:59,720
they will complete the project. They will.

2883
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:01,760
Is it going to be a good quality project?

2884
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:05,600
Only when the customer interacts
with the system afterwards,

2885
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:09,600
then they'll find out
if it was a good product built or not.

2886
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:12,640
So you see here
this is what happens all the time.

2887
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:17,840
Secondly, because software isn't produced
until the end of the project, that means

2888
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:21,280
the entire thing is not fully functioning
until the end of the project.

2889
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:24,680
You never really know where you are
on waterfall.

2890
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:29,680
Probably the last 20% of the project
always seems to take 80% of the time

2891
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,800
because you might think that,
you know, quality might be a six month

2892
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:35,480
thing or testing
might be six months thing,

2893
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:42,400
but it might take longer,
it might take absolutely longer.

2894
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:43,840
I tell you, absolutely.

2895
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,960
A lot of projects like this has happened.

2896
02:21:46,200 --> 02:21:49,120
If a project she said,
if a project gets developed in five years,

2897
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:52,880
maybe the time it is is is out of date.

2898
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:55,440
Obviously it happens all the time, guys.

2899
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:57,000
It does happen.

2900
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:57,760
Unfortunately.

2901
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:00,680
That's why they say government
runs slow and government

2902
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:03,240
doesn't know what they're doing,
especially in the IT sector.

2903
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,960
It happens all the time.

2904
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:08,240
Project gets delayed,
so many things happen, budget gets cut

2905
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:11,280
and by the time things come, guys,
that's what we talked about.

2906
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:13,160
Evolution of technology, right?

2907
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:14,920
Technology is changing so fast.

2908
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:18,600
And if a project staying five years
and after five years, maybe that software

2909
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:23,520
is not even needed or maybe it is
too outdated, new things have come.

2910
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:27,240
Well, then they have to sign
another contract to build one again.

2911
02:22:27,520 --> 02:22:28,040
Right?

2912
02:22:28,040 --> 02:22:30,840
So these type of things do does absolutely

2913
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:37,200
happen.

2914
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,040
Does it make sense?

2915
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:49,840
So for any questions, anything, testers
kick in after everything is done.

2916
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:55,360
But remember, sometimes I've seen
this guys in in waterfall projects.

2917
02:22:55,360 --> 02:23:00,080
Sometimes what happens is sometimes
they don't even hire the testers.

2918
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:04,520
They might have one or two, but they hired
a bigger team later on in that project

2919
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:06,760
because what are they going to do
at the beginning?

2920
02:23:06,760 --> 02:23:08,840
Yes, there's some documentation
and things like that,

2921
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:11,080
but they'll be sitting there
and getting paid.

2922
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:13,360
It happens to but some time happens.

2923
02:23:13,640 --> 02:23:17,880
If you want job security,
you want everything like that.

2924
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:20,800
You know, boredom
a government is good to work for.

2925
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:22,120
You'll get your paycheck,

2926
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:25,600
you will never get fired and it's fine,
but it gets boring.

2927
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:27,600
It is outdated. They don't use.

2928
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:30,920
And not just that, guys, I don't know if
you guys have worked with the government,

2929
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:36,120
but a lot of the government agencies
use AI to give you a real example.

2930
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:38,640
They Internet Explorer nine or 11.

2931
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:43,840
Yes. In government projects you will see
no Google Chrome or things like that.

2932
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:45,040
You will see that

2933
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:48,560
there is a lot of problem
because to have changes and things

2934
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:52,240
like that, even to download a software,
let's say on a government computer,

2935
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:55,720
there's a lot of restriction,
a lot of people work and things like that.

2936
02:23:55,720 --> 02:24:01,480
It happens all the time.

2937
02:24:01,480 --> 02:24:02,760
So I got paid three months

2938
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:06,840
to on my last contract to sit around,
wait for my government issue laptop.

2939
02:24:07,160 --> 02:24:08,280
Yeah, it happens.

2940
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:09,360
Absolutely happens.

2941
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:09,920
Guys,

2942
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:14,040
I have worked on a project for for three
or four months where I didn't do anything.

2943
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:14,880
I just got paid.

2944
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:16,880
But that's how the government is
sometimes.

2945
02:24:16,880 --> 02:24:20,120
Like I didn't say
it took my security clearance.

2946
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:21,920
I one time took two months.

2947
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:24,280
I literally did not do anything
and they paid me.

2948
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:26,760
But that's their slow.

2949
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:27,600
I'm not going to say

2950
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:35,200
don't pay me the paycheck,
but that's how their profit process is.

2951
02:24:35,200 --> 02:24:39,920
Developers in you left wherever they were
eager and it's sometimes a dependent.

2952
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:40,880
They can be nice to

2953
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:46,560
so remember also government you know it's

2954
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:49,760
they're just outdated software's outdated

2955
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:52,880
getting done

2956
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:56,800
a lot of paperwork,
a lot of hierarchy things.

2957
02:24:56,800 --> 02:25:01,480
It's just I think all governments operate
like this, not just our government here.

2958
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:02,960
A whole across the globe.

2959
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:04,080
They're the same way.

2960
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:05,080
It's just how it is.

2961
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:07,480
And people in charge,
you know, you can't fire them, right?

2962
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:10,000
It's impossible to fire government
employees.

2963
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:12,600
You can just find
just like you're going to private sector

2964
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,520
firing someone in government.

2965
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:16,520
It's it's a pain.

2966
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:17,800
It's a big

2967
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:18,760
government.

2968
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:22,120
Does work for lazy people. Absolutely.

2969
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:24,480
Is it possible development team
without a test?

2970
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:26,400
Yes, it is possible.

2971
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:29,400
Technically, they can do manual testing,
but is it going to be

2972
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:31,520
an efficient Mustapha? Most likely not.

2973
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:38,040
Absolutely not.

2974
02:25:38,040 --> 02:25:40,200
Someone asked
who is involved in the maintenance base.

2975
02:25:40,360 --> 02:25:42,560
Maintenance phase
is not for every project,

2976
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:45,640
but maybe there's one developer,
one tester.

2977
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:49,680
Sometimes a company will keep that, Hey,
just give us some maintenance for next

2978
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:50,760
six months. Support.

2979
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:53,600
Usually how that works,
they're usually one tester

2980
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:58,640
or one developer
just to make sure everything is good.

2981
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:01,480
Government can be boring. Yes,
it can be boring.

2982
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:04,640
Just paychecks are good
in the sense of job security.

2983
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:06,240
That's the one thing you get.

2984
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:07,440
I know a lot of students.

2985
02:26:07,440 --> 02:26:10,040
I remember
when whenever in the past batches,

2986
02:26:10,800 --> 02:26:12,920
you know, tell them how government works
and everything

2987
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:16,080
when they work, they tell me,
Oh my God, Samir, you're absolutely right.

2988
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:18,680
Exactly what you taught us in
class is how it is.

2989
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:21,880
And surprisingly,
if you're in the Northern Virginia or D.C.

2990
02:26:21,880 --> 02:26:25,680
area, you guys locally most likely
will be working

2991
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:28,760
for government projects here.

2992
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:31,400
You will deal with that some more.

2993
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:32,320
Remember this

2994
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:36,000
manual testing is obsolete.

2995
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
No, absolutely not. Road mental test.

2996
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:39,120
It can never go away.

2997
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,280
It's always going to be there. Absolutely.

2998
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:42,200
Because you can't

2999
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:45,160
you can do things with manual testing
that you can't do with automation.

3000
02:26:45,560 --> 02:26:48,160
It's just
that it's not really a skill role.

3001
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:49,760
That's the only thing.

3002
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:50,160
I guess.

3003
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:52,840
A couple of more slides
left, guys, before we wrap up.

3004
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:54,000
Our first.

3005
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,240
But thirdly, I should say that
you've got to schedule risk

3006
02:26:57,480 --> 02:27:00,400
because you never know
if you're going to make it until the end.

3007
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:04,720
You've got technical risk because
you don't actually get test your design

3008
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:09,480
until the make project you got
and you've got product risk

3009
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:10,560
because don't even know

3010
02:27:10,560 --> 02:27:13,480
if you're building the right
until it's too late to make any changes.

3011
02:27:13,960 --> 02:27:18,720
That's what happens in waterfall
that unfortunately you have no idea.

3012
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:23,640
Remember guys, I said in the design phase
right in the design phase,

3013
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:27,880
the architects decide, okay, how much,
how many servers they need or what?

3014
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:31,360
Say what if we want to scale the system
and everything, you know, later on,

3015
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:35,480
to give you an example of this Amazon
get millions of customers every day.

3016
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:37,440
What if Amazon didn't think of, hey,

3017
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:39,600
next year
you might get 1 billion customer, right?

3018
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:41,000
Let's say for example

3019
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:44,960
if they don't have the right hardware
software for their they're screwed one one

3020
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:48,160
When triple the customers come right
their system is going to crash

3021
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:50,600
and it happens
sometimes you probably have seen some

3022
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:53,800
some website crash on let's say
Black Friday

3023
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:58,360
BestBuy.com Amazon they crash sometime
because everyone jumps on that.

3024
02:27:58,360 --> 02:27:58,960
Right?

3025
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:01,960
So those type of things happen
that those type of things

3026
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:06,520
are basically supposed
to be designed in the design phase.

3027
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:08,600
They make up the plans for that.

3028
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:11,040
But what in your waterfall project?

3029
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:14,720
What if you decided realized later
on, hey, the volume is increasing,

3030
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:16,680
what happens?

3031
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:17,400
The right?

3032
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:19,200
You can't really do anything over there.

3033
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:21,360
You can obviously go back
and add a requirement.

3034
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:23,160
Hey, add service you did.

3035
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:26,880
The project has to be done completely
and then you can add those things

3036
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:30,080
later on as a new contract
or a new new project.

3037
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:30,520
Basically

3038
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:34,680
upon.

3039
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:36,280
Yes, you will learn manual testing.

3040
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:38,560
Absolutely. Yes.

3041
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:40,160
Manual testing will teach you.

3042
02:28:40,160 --> 02:28:42,320
You'll be learning that
probably not next week.

3043
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:46,200
The following The manual testing
is important for this for entirety,

3044
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:49,360
and you need more manual
testing and automation both.

3045
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:50,080
You need to

3046
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:54,080
you basically are both guys.

3047
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:58,440
You will do probably 30%
manual, 70% automation.

3048
02:28:58,440 --> 02:29:04,000
You can be in the testing industry
without manual.

3049
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,960
How hard is it to do transition?

3050
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:10,480
We've had actually quite a few students
who have transitioned from

3051
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:13,320
testing to developers.

3052
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:14,080
It's not a hard

3053
02:29:14,080 --> 02:29:15,760
you just need to learn a little bit
more programing

3054
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:19,720
once you get into the field, work
for a couple of years or years or so,

3055
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:23,600
you can easily
you can easily actually transition

3056
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:28,520
that very doable.

3057
02:29:28,520 --> 02:29:30,960
Finally, and and finally, most important,

3058
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:33,240
it is just not a great way of handling
change.

3059
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:36,600
See, at the very end
you realize what really want.

3060
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:40,200
So this is for you guys
waterfall methodology.

3061
02:29:40,200 --> 02:29:42,120
Same thing when we look at basically

3062
02:29:44,640 --> 02:29:45,320
as the

3063
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:48,280
same SDLC process, but you cannot go back

3064
02:29:48,280 --> 02:29:51,960
and make any changes.

3065
02:29:51,960 --> 02:29:54,640
Who owns the risk?
The customer or the developer?

3066
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:58,720
You mean the risk of a project
augur failure?

3067
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:00,840
Or which one?

3068
02:30:00,840 --> 02:30:02,480
Can you elaborate on your question?

3069
02:30:02,480 --> 02:30:07,960
Well, the risk can be sometimes
look good question.

3070
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:13,440
What what can happen is in this situation,
the company can blame the government.

3071
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:15,760
Well, you didn't give me the requirements.

3072
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:17,960
We built exactly what you wanted, right?

3073
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:19,480
They can always do that.

3074
02:30:19,480 --> 02:30:20,920
They absolutely can do.

3075
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:24,240
Government basically
are going to lose the money in everything

3076
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:25,400
if you look at it. Why?

3077
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:29,520
Because at the end of it,
they're the one who tells you what I want.

3078
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,200
If you ask, build me

3079
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:34,720
a green car with this, this feature
and I give you all those features

3080
02:30:34,920 --> 02:30:38,640
later on, then you realize that hey,
I want this features in, etc.

3081
02:30:38,640 --> 02:30:41,200
I want this modification. Well,
you didn't give it to me.

3082
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:43,520
I just built what you wanted. Right?

3083
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:45,240
So the government is holding.

3084
02:30:45,240 --> 02:30:49,000
There is the the company that's building
the product is not going to say anything

3085
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,400
like that. They were like well,
this is what you guys paid.

3086
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:52,280
Is this what you want?

3087
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:55,760
If you approve those requirements
at the beginning, remember this,

3088
02:30:56,080 --> 02:31:00,440
those requirements in this part,
the government would approve, Right?

3089
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:02,280
I built you what you wanted.

3090
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:04,760
You don't think of those things.
That's not my fault, right?

3091
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,080
That's
what the company is going to say usually.

3092
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:09,640
Can they be a fly? Yes, they can be.

3093
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:12,480
If they had better team
members, better business,

3094
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:15,080
and maybe they could have given better
suggestions. Sure.

3095
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:16,880
But no company is going to say that.

3096
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:19,040
I give you a real example. HP

3097
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:20,480
took a

3098
02:31:20,480 --> 02:31:23,480
project that was supposed to really see
we internally,

3099
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:27,080
we talked about, hey, this is not possible
in one year, three years.

3100
02:31:27,080 --> 02:31:31,200
And we communicated this to the
the to the United States Postal Service.

3101
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:34,080
But they were, hey,
get it done in one year, one year later.

3102
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,800
Told you guys this already.

3103
02:31:35,800 --> 02:31:39,040
So, you know, company is the company
is not going to take that blame it all

3104
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:43,320
it was going to come back onto the
the people who approved the requirements

3105
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:47,080
which is eventually going to be at the end
if you look at is the government itself.

3106
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,680
They wanted that product we developed you.

3107
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:51,360
That product doesn't work too bad.

3108
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:53,640
That's what you wanted.
So comes down to that.

3109
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:58,600
And if you look at all of this,
this entire process is exactly like SDLC.

3110
02:31:58,600 --> 02:32:02,560
Just we cannot make the changes
if requirement is clear, check.

3111
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:04,360
Now, that said, design,

3112
02:32:04,360 --> 02:32:07,160
you cannot go back and make changes
because now you are in design.

3113
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:09,120
Some flaws in there.

3114
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:14,400
But still, who or who pays for this?

3115
02:32:14,920 --> 02:32:15,480
The change.

3116
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:20,760
If there's disagreement on contractually,
they might ask the company developing.

3117
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:21,920
They might ask for more,

3118
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:24,600
you know, probably money

3119
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:27,360
for if they want the changes
or they might be part of the contract.

3120
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:31,520
If any changes come after five years
or whatever, they can make.

3121
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:32,760
The change, it all depends.

3122
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:33,440
It all depends

3123
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:36,840
if those are final details, depending on
how the contracts are written.

3124
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:40,960
And that's something,
you know, you test are developers.

3125
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:43,360
We're not part of that
super upper management.

3126
02:32:43,360 --> 02:32:45,520
They're the one who try to

3127
02:32:46,480 --> 02:32:47,560
know SDLC

3128
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:51,280
is the entire based on SDLC
is the implementation.

3129
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:53,440
Remember, this software development
lifecycle

3130
02:32:53,440 --> 02:32:55,880
is how software is supposed to be built
right?

3131
02:32:55,880 --> 02:33:01,480
How you implement it, how you go day,
day about it, how you develop it is

3132
02:33:01,480 --> 02:33:06,320
the process is the methodology,
like waterfall and then agile.

3133
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:11,720
This is the same SDLC,
the same exact thing.

3134
02:33:11,720 --> 02:33:17,360
Yes, Waterfall and Agile are two different
because it's the way remember this

3135
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:19,560
software is

3136
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:22,560
built in the same format,
but you know, some

3137
02:33:22,840 --> 02:33:26,720
some methodology doesn't
want you to make changes, some can long.

3138
02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:28,840
It's the same process of how it's built.

3139
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:32,760
We're following the exact same,
some where the customer can give feedback,

3140
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:34,080
some can I get feedback.

3141
02:33:34,080 --> 02:33:35,520
Right. All those changes

3142
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:39,240
you're going to see tomorrow,
you will see the agile side of it.

3143
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:41,880
How that is more popular.

3144
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:43,080
Why A lot of

3145
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:47,520
sorry, private side.

3146
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:51,720
Private side uses agile versus
why they don't use waterfall.

3147
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:53,080
You see the advantage of there.

3148
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:57,480
There's some flaws there too,
but you see as far as why more popular,

3149
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:03,360
what you can do in that process versus
what you can do with it.

3150
02:34:03,360 --> 02:34:08,040
Let's say for example, in in Waterfall
and you make decision which one is better.

3151
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:10,760
Majority
private sector are going to be agile.

3152
02:34:11,240 --> 02:34:16,360
Yes, probably faster, absolutely way
faster than and customer interaction is.

3153
02:34:16,600 --> 02:34:19,200
You're going to be seeing
that in the Agile methodology.

3154
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:22,080
So you get to see all of that
more in the Agile.

3155
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:23,560
So it will explain that

3156
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:26,760
I don't want to go into today
because it'll be way too much information.

3157
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:31,320
There's a lot of different meetings
in that, a lot of different terminologies

3158
02:34:31,320 --> 02:34:34,920
in adults, so we'll cover all of that
tomorrow basically.

3159
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:37,800
But for today
this is what we have for today.

3160
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:39,240
That's tomorrow's class.

3161
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:44,160
Are any questions, anything
didn't make any sense, anything like that.

3162
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:45,960
If you have, please do ask.

3163
02:34:45,960 --> 02:34:48,960
I'll spend next 5 minutes answering that
and then we're good to go

3164
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:55,760
for your first class.

3165
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:57,040
All clear. Okay.

3166
02:34:57,040 --> 02:34:58,520
Someone asks if you upgrade.

3167
02:34:58,520 --> 02:35:03,480
This is do we need to follow all the other
fees in a small, smaller format?

3168
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:04,640
Kind of.

3169
02:35:04,880 --> 02:35:06,400
It depends, but kind of.

3170
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:08,520
You follow
all that if you want to make changes.

3171
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:10,560
All right.

3172
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:15,680
That is basically what Waterfall
and SDLC is guys today

3173
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:18,680
who are choosing which method.

3174
02:35:18,680 --> 02:35:19,760
Good question.

3175
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:22,400
You and I Tester
developers business analyst.

3176
02:35:22,960 --> 02:35:24,520
That's above our pay grade.

3177
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:26,280
That's
going to come to the top management.

3178
02:35:26,280 --> 02:35:30,240
They're the ones who basically decide that

3179
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:33,960
many people who know
Agile will talk mental.

3180
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:37,480
Just absolutely anyone and everyone can do
manual testing

3181
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:41,240
has their methodology, doesn't matter,
whether it's waterfall

3182
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:48,360
or whether it's agile,
it doesn't matter at all.

3183
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:49,520
All right.

3184
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:53,160
How you don't get tired of reading
comments like, Oh, I don't.

3185
02:35:53,160 --> 02:35:56,040
I've been doing this for so long.

3186
02:35:56,040 --> 02:35:58,880
I just I just want to make sure
that you guys understand this is

3187
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:02,120
these are important concepts, their theory
and everything.

3188
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:05,280
I just try to make it fun, you know,
because this

3189
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:07,920
this kind of stuff
can be a little bit boring if,

3190
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:11,360
if I don't get your interaction
and make you understand the big picture.

3191
02:36:11,360 --> 02:36:13,360
So I like doing this part.

3192
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:14,480
When we get to Java

3193
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:18,360
so when something does not work done,
instead we get out things like that.

3194
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:21,080
When things don't work,
you ask them in the support channel.

3195
02:36:21,360 --> 02:36:24,840
So when you do support or they ask
or you ask questions,

3196
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:26,480
our team members will help you out.

3197
02:36:27,960 --> 02:36:30,360
They can say thank you.

3198
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:31,080
That's

3199
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:33,960
And yet tomorrow,

3200
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:37,200
guys, we will get into online only.

3201
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:41,200
Yeah, they'll I'm sure they'll get on
with your resume and help you out.

3202
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:43,560
So if anything like that,
come don't worry.

3203
02:36:43,920 --> 02:36:46,040
The team was there any time.

3204
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:52,440
Let's say things are not working,
some will jump on there to help you out.

3205
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:54,840
Can you
can I recommend anything on this part?

3206
02:36:54,840 --> 02:36:56,680
You can. What?

3207
02:36:56,680 --> 02:37:01,800
Honestly, there's a lot of content
out there when it comes waterfall, Agile.

3208
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:03,600
It's all theory out there.

3209
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:09,120
You can there's not a specific one
I can recommend just look at for tomorrow

3210
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:12,560
because the more is a little bit
more deeper.

3211
02:37:13,680 --> 02:37:17,280
And so I would really appreciate
if you guys do look at some quick videos

3212
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:20,480
so you can understand some of the
terminology that has a lot of terminology

3213
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,040
should be done in general.

3214
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:24,160
We will give you instruction this year
for that.

3215
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:25,960
So Dawn will download Java.

3216
02:37:25,960 --> 02:37:27,840
Anything will give you the videos
for that.

3217
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:31,440
And I think by Thursday or something
and then you can do it

3218
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:33,880
guys, don't worry about all of that stuff.

3219
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:36,800
By the way,
if you haven't, let me see your site

3220
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:38,560
in one

3221
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:44,680
second.

3222
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:47,160
When it comes down to downloading
and things like that,

3223
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:50,120
let's do

3224
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,680
when the story here guys

3225
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:02,880
when you want those let's say
for example download videos

3226
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:08,400
and things of installation on YouTube,
go to syntax TV, just go there and guys

3227
02:38:08,760 --> 02:38:13,200
you will find some of those instruction,
but don't download anything at this point.

3228
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:14,040
You can do it.

3229
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:15,120
By the way you get there.

3230
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:17,080
You definitely can absolutely subscribe.

3231
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:19,480
We don't have too many,
so you can subscribe.

3232
02:38:19,480 --> 02:38:22,240
You will find some of the installation
and things like that over there

3233
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:27,360
and they'll share with you next actually
on Thursday, before your class starts,

3234
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:32,920
we'll give you all the instruction
in the world how you can do all this.

3235
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:35,720
Should I then install? Don't
do anything at this point. Not yet.

3236
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:38,880
Waterfall is a risk for tester.

3237
02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:39,960
Not enough time.

3238
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:43,320
I wouldn't really sure like you know
it can be risky,

3239
02:38:43,320 --> 02:38:46,680
but for you as a tester
you won't have to worry too much on that.

3240
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:50,520
But. All right.

3241
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:52,720
All right, guys. I think that's it.

3242
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:56,160
I believe I answered
all question on YouTube.

3243
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:56,720
Please do.

3244
02:38:56,720 --> 02:38:59,040
Just definitely check Agile tomorrow.

3245
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:00,160
I think that's give me a little bit more.

3246
02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:02,320
Can I work personally for a company
as a tester?

3247
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:04,880
You absolutely can

3248
02:39:08,280 --> 02:39:08,640
remember

3249
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:11,600
every company has tester,
so you definitely can.

3250
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:13,240
All right.

3251
02:39:13,240 --> 02:39:13,800
All right, then.

3252
02:39:13,800 --> 02:39:16,280
I guess we're good to go
first. Class one down.

3253
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:19,200
Many more to go.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

3254
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:20,400
Have a good night.

3255
02:39:20,400 --> 02:39:23,960
I'll upload these on canvas
and see you guys tomorrow for

3256
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,600
I just do a check, canvas, counter, see,
see what we're going to cover

3257
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:29,600
and just watch quick video.

3258
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:30,720
See tomorrow, guys.

3259
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:32,880
All right, have a going, guys. Take care.

3260
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:33,480
Thank you.

3261
02:39:33,480 --> 02:39:35,280
Thank you,
everyone for the participate in.

3262
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:36,440
We love that.

3263
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:37,160
Awesome.

3264
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:45,720
Thank you, guys.
