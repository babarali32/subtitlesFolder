1
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,720
All right, guys.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,200
Seems like we have enough people
to get started, Right?

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,800
So let's get started.

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,960
How is everybody doing, guys?

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,800
I hope everyone is doing good.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,880
Seems like there's a birthday.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,120
Okay, Stephanie,
Happy birthday from Syntax.

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,480
Right.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,840
So hope you get a good job

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,440
after this course.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
All right. I'm good. Thank you.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,560
I hope you guys are having fun with

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,920
what's called

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,720
was Selenium.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,320
Did we all complete the homework?

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:10,320
Guys?

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,480
I hope everyone completed their homework.

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,320
Right.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,840
Some people I got got some messages

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,160
where you guys can find one
element, right?

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,840
I think was covered.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,960
That's on review.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,680
Right? Yeah.
You guys had to use the X path.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,760
Yes, exactly. Okay.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,160
Okay, good.

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,800
I hope everyone

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,400
everyone had to look up what X path is.

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,960
What kind of what kind of X path you had.

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,800
We have right.

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,320
Okay, you guys Googled it.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
Okay, good.

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,760
All right.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,040
And I hope you guys assigned not.

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
I hope you guys were using the web element
objects.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,000
Right.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,760
Hopefully you guys didn't just use driver
that find elements.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,920
I hope you guys use the assigning method
that we have done

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,680
at the very end of the class.

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,560
Last time. Right.

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,600
So, all right, let's do a quick recap.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,920
Right.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,960
So what did we do last class, guys?

43
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:39,120
What did we learn about last class?

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,920
Okay, we talked about the locators.

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,240
Right.

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,160
Okay.

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
How many locators do we have, guys?

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,920
And so many.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,920
Okay, we got eight locators.

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,760
Right.

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,600
What kind of locators do we know about?

52
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
Well, I'd name

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:03,600
right.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,040
We have class names.

55
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,720
What else?

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,040
Web experts.

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,920
There we go.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,880
Selectors.

59
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,280
Right. Link tags, Partial link techs.
Right.

60
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,880
Okay, So how do we interact
with the locators, guys?

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,440
Where do we have to go
in order to see these locators?

62
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,800
We have to open up our Dom.

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,240
Right.

64
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,480
So how do I open the DOM guys

65
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,080
when it's a right

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,240
click on the left side, right

67
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,720
to right,

68
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,320
click on the application
and go to inspect.

69
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,800
Right. Okay, good.

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,080
All right.

71
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,720
What is in other words,
this Dom calls guys.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,640
What do we call it?

73
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,560
Source code.

74
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:05,840
Okay.

75
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,240
What else?

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,000
The whole.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,600
The whole Dom guys.

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,800
I mentioned it last time. There we go.

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,200
It's called developers tools.

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,760
Right? Or dev tools. Right.

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,520
Okay, good.

82
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,120
All right, So we
we said that there are eight locators.

83
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,760
Why do we need so many locators?

84
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:38,840
Guys?

85
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,480
Okay, so

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,240
some locators might have duplicate
values, right?

87
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,280
And the most important thing
is because not

88
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,280
all of the locators will be available
for us for this or that element

89
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,120
whenever we inspecting and whenever we try
to interact with this or that element.

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,480
Right.
Some of them can be dynamic. Exactly.

91
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,040
That's another reason that we can
we can have another option to use

92
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,600
different locators so that we can interact
with those elements.

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,200
Right.

94
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,280
And there is one more

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,600
one more reason why we need so many

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,640
locators, guys.

97
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,120
And you want anyone remember that?

98
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,320
So we said there is duplicate values,
right?

99
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,040
Developers might not provide
all the locators in their.

100
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,400
Some of those are only applicable, right,

101
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,560
for some locators.

102
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,720
Right. So

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,480
some of the locators may not be applicable
for all the elements.

104
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,200
Right.

105
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,440
So like link tax, a partial latex,
you can only use use it for links.

106
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,440
Right. Okay.

107
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,240
So what's the tag for the links, guys?

108
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,680
So if we have a

109
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,560
tag and we'll look at the HTML,
it's an eight tag, right?

110
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,840
What what do we call it?

111
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,080
Okay.

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,640
It's a hyperlink, right?

113
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,160
It's an anchor tag.

114
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,360
Right. Okay, good.

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
That is very good. Okay.

116
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,600
All right.

117
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,520
Okay, guys,
any questions from the last class?

118
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,000
Any questions on names?

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:45,440
IDs, class names, Link to any of those?

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,880
How do we use anchor tags?

121
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,600
We are going to be using them tomorrow,
guys.

122
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,080
Okay,
so today we're going to cover Xpress.

123
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,840
Tomorrow we're going to cover CC
selectors and attacks.

124
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,080
Can I cover?

125
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,200
Yeah, we are going into details today.

126
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,480
Okay.

127
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, cool.

128
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,640
All right.

129
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,240
So let's get started with X path.

130
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,520
Right?

131
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,520
So today we will be covering only X path
because there's a lot of things

132
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,440
that we need to do today
and some of these things may

133
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,360
may look a little bit

134
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,000
difficult.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,920
Right,

136
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,640
Because we will be typing these X passes

137
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,240
inside our DOM and then we will be
covering advanced X path as well.

138
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,280
So that's, that's going to be
a little bit difficult at first,

139
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,480
but then we'll get more practice on it
and it's going to be all good.

140
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,440
We will be comfortable with everything.

141
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,760
I won't be covering homework guys, okay.

142
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
Amazon should be covering the homeworks

143
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,960
or if you have any questions,
you will do it on review.

144
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,640
But I mostly try to do the new topics

145
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,640
and more,
and we'll do the reviews on those topics.

146
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,280
Okay.

147
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,080
But if you have any issues on homework,
try to reach out to your.

148
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
I'm pretty sure you have groups
right already.

149
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,360
So try to reach out to your group mates
or try to just post your issue

150
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,520
and just syntax support
and we will take a look at those.

151
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,320
Okay.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,760
All right.

153
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,240
So X path, guys.

154
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,840
Okay.

155
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,240
So we know that X path is one of the

156
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,600
one of the eight locators, right?

157
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,640
So why do we need X plus?

158
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,600
What do we know?

159
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,160
So I told you guys before to
to do some research.

160
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
Right. So let me see.

161
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,280
What do you guys know about X

162
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,120
or did anyone do any research on X path

163
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,960
if the others don't work?

164
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,280
We can use X path.

165
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,920
Okay, so there are two types
relative and excellent X.

166
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,160
That's good.

167
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,040
We can locate our elements.

168
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,840
We use X path.

169
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,600
Okay.

170
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,640
Okay.

171
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,880
Let me do this.

172
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,920
Why do we need

173
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,840
x path or c select selected?

174
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,240
Okay.

175
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,840
First of all, why we need it?

176
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:47,440
Because sometimes developers may not
provide all the locators in our HTML.

177
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,720
Right? So let's get this clear in here.

178
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Developers will not provide

179
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,000
all the

180
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,240
locators in HCM.

181
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,200
Right.

182
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,480
Okay, so what would be the second reason

183
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,880
why we need X path and c skies

184
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,960
whenever we object and not have idea.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,480
So we'll go for X path.

186
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,880
Okay.

187
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,560
Helps find elements more uniquely.

188
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,600
That is correct.

189
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,080
So single and double slashes.
That's very good.

190
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,760
So there's one really important point

191
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,480
with X Path and SAS guys,

192
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,760
it is that we need x breath and c assess

193
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,760
because we can locate elements

194
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,920
with give with any given attribute.

195
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Okay.

196
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,520
So before let's take a look here.

197
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,880
Let's say this using an textbox.

198
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,800
Okay.

199
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,600
So this user name textbox into you
has ID class tile type, right.

200
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
And name.

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,920
So from our locators
that we already covered in here,

202
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,160
we have name ID and class, right?

203
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,720
So there's three different

204
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,400
locators that we can use

205
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,640
by just having the Selenium library.

206
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,680
Right.

207
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,000
But if we use an X path in this case
and let's assume

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,160
that our element doesn't have neither name
nor ID nor class nothing,

209
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,800
it has just type, maybe just a placeholder
or a style, right?

210
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,240
It has a style in here.

211
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,720
So let's assume
that we only have type and style.

212
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,040
So in that case,
you can't be using any locators

213
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,480
like name ID or class or link text
or anything.

214
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,880
You have to go with CSS selector for X

215
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,960
because this will help us to use

216
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,240
or to identify any element
by any given attribute.

217
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,560
Okay, is that clear, guys?

218
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,880
And I hope we all know
what attribute is already

219
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:03,200
right?

220
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,120
Okay, good.

221
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
All right. So

222
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,360
let me put it here by using

223
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,200
X path

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,400
and C as a selector right

225
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,080
within identify elements

226
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,560
if any of them

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,080
actually

228
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,800
it will allow us to use type, correct?

229
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,240
Yes. So let's actually go to Facebook.

230
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,280
Let me inspect this page as well.

231
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,680
So let's see

232
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,760
here.

233
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,520
So we only have here

234
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,640
IDs, right?

235
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,880
So if we don't have any

236
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
what's called

237
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,360
any locators,
then we can use any of the attributes.

238
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:06,640
Right.

239
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,960
So the attributes, what's the
what's the color on the attributes in here

240
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,400
guys,
when we use the when we expect the page.

241
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:24,360
What's the color on attributes guys.

242
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,720
Yeah. Brownish or orange,
whatever it is. Right.

243
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,520
So any attribute that we can see
and we using X,

244
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,560
we should be able to use those. Okay.

245
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:33,960
All right.

246
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,080
But before we get to use and before

247
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,440
we start actually writing the X Path,

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,760
let's go ahead and answer this question.

249
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,800
What is an X plus?

250
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,920
Okay, So we know
besides that it is one of the locators.

251
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,440
And so what is X path?

252
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:12,800
Does?

253
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,840
Yep, it is a locator.

254
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,480
Besides that

255
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,080
includes attributes and its value.

256
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,880
Okay.

257
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:33,000
Anything else?

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,760
Anyone? You guys.

259
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,080
I thought you guys did a research. Now

260
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,600
it is.

261
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,680
There we go.

262
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,720
So X path is like a query language.

263
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,080
Okay, So that it helps us to identify

264
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,800
elements uniquely on the web page.

265
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,480
Right? So X plus

266
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,160
is like a

267
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,720
query

268
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,040
language,

269
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,520
which helps us to identify

270
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,800
elements

271
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,200
uniquely

272
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,520
on the web page.

273
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,800
All right.

274
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,160
Okay.

275
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,520
So now what
we are going to do, let's go back in here.

276
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,080
So now what I'm going to do is

277
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,320
let's talk about the types of the

278
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,160
let's talk about the types of the past us.

279
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,080
So the does is anyone familiar
with types of the X

280
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,720
but anyone did the research on this

281
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
query language is when

282
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,880
the language of writing
or finding some elements right?

283
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,440
Not only the elements it is,
it is a language

284
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,960
to consequently find something.

285
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,680
Okay, So if you heard about the databases,
you write a structured core language.

286
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,120
Okay, So you use structured query language
where you come,

287
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,000
where you start from the top,
you go one by one

288
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,880
and you can secretly find some answer,

289
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,640
okay, okay.

290
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,320
So the types are absolute and relative
X path is right.

291
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,920
So types of

292
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,200
X path in here.

293
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,440
So to do

294
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,680
absolute

295
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,640
X, right?

296
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,320
So okay, so we have two different

297
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,720
types, absolute and relative X, right?

298
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:22,600
So we'll go over the X path first and
then we will go over the relative X path.

299
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,760
Can you call query as a script.

300
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,320
Yes. You can do that. Yes.

301
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,000
Okay guys.

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,120
So in order for me
to identify the element by X path,

303
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,760
we have to write some,

304
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,880
some query language inside the DOM.

305
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,800
Okay, So what I'm going to do,

306
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,320
I'm going to press some buttons right
now, so please follow me

307
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,120
and there will be a text box
where I'm going to start typing my ex.

308
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,040
Okay,
So I'm going to go ahead and click on Mac.

309
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,120
You can go ahead and press command F

310
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,920
and on Windows you could do
control S okay.

311
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,440
That way you can see that
there is a text box

312
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,720
popping up in here
and you can see that you can,

313
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,280
you can

314
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,120
type some X path or selector or whatever
it is.

315
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,680
Okay, I hope everyone is on the same page.

316
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,280
I hope no one is confused right now.

317
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,680
What is going on

318
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,560
passive today?

319
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,400
What's going on, guys?

320
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,720
Everyone is tired
and everyone needs a vacation.

321
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,080
I guess.

322
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,920
Okay.

323
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,880
Long day.

324
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
All right, Hands on the keyboard.

325
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,440
Okay, good.

326
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,920
All right, guys.

327
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,560
So we have this selected
text box in here, right?

328
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,080
So that we can start writing our

329
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,840
X back.

330
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,520
Right?

331
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,360
So absolute X path or

332
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,000
it's also called a native X pass, right?

333
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,600
So it starts from the very bottom
of your HTML code.

334
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,040
Okay.

335
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,800
So when I say the very bottom,

336
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,360
it's going to be the edge HTML tag.

337
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,760
Okay.

338
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:27,000
So exactly from the root of this page
HTML document that we can see in here.

339
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,680
Okay, So absolute X plus, you has to go

340
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,760
step by step from the very, very top note.

341
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,720
Okay.

342
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,480
So if I go ahead

343
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
and put a single slash

344
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,360
and start typing h html, you can
you can see immediately

345
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,480
that this h HTML line

346
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,160
is getting highlighted with yellow.

347
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,400
Okay. So if I just typed in,

348
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,840
let me actually collapse this one.

349
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,560
So if I just type in H

350
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,960
for a slash and h html,
you can see that here.

351
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,400
This h HTML node is getting highlighted.

352
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,520
Okay.

353
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,160
So that means we highlighted
the whole frame

354
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,960
or the whole what's called

355
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,800
the whole web page in here.

356
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,480
So we are on Facebook right now.

357
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,000
We just highlighted this page. Okay.

358
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,000
So what if I want to move forward
right now?

359
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,040
Okay.

360
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,600
So if we look at our HTML right now,

361
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,760
so there's only a couple of lines
because I collapsed everything, right?

362
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,000
So if you look in here,
so there's second and third lines.

363
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,920
There's two more lines in here
which has head

364
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,320
and the body right.

365
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,320
So if you look at the head

366
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,640
and body, you can see there and little bit
shifted to the right then.

367
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:15,080
H HTML, what does it mean, guys?

368
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,960
And no one knows.

369
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,680
So these two in here,

370
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,360
these two are shifted to the right.

371
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,880
Okay, that's very good.

372
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,360
Kevin Yes, they are.

373
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,120
They are children. Exactly.

374
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,520
So that means that means that head
and body,

375
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,360
they are inside the HTML.

376
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,920
Okay.

377
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,960
So if you look

378
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,080
vertically, guys, so whenever

379
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,280
I open up the head right now,
you can see the matter.

380
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,960
The script is style.

381
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,200
They are shifted more to the right,
which means that

382
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,160
these all know are inside the head now.

383
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,640
Okay.

384
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,320
Is that clear, guys?

385
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,640
Any questions on that?

386
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,280
So if you look in here there's script,
there's div, there's div inside the div

387
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,760
because it's a little bit
shifted to the right look

388
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,960
exactly like one

389
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,880
block court,
one block of code inside the other.

390
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,600
Right.

391
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,080
And even even in Java guys,
whenever we start typing.

392
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,400
Right. So any code in here.

393
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,960
So if you look I have a main method
and then the actual code goes

394
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,160
inside,
it is shifted a little bit to the right.

395
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,080
This way we know that
this block of code is inside our method.

396
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,080
Okay. Pretty similar, right?

397
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,600
Pretty similar logic in here.

398
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,200
So. All right.

399
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,320
So if I want to move forward right

400
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,520
now, so we need to do it one by one.

401
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,560
Okay.

402
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,560
So if you if I put a forward slash
in, do head in here.

403
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,800
So now you can see that the head line over

404
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,440
there is getting highlighted

405
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,920
right.

406
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,960
They don't have to be. No,
they don't have to be shifted.

407
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,320
No, it's just a format.

408
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:17,640
Right.

409
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,920
So it's easier for us to read as

410
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,840
as whoever person as developers
or it automation people.

411
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,240
Right.

412
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,760
So if you are a technical person,
you need to format your code

413
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,040
so that it's readable, Right?

414
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,840
Okay.

415
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:39,080
So now, guys, I put after the symbol,
I put another slash and I go ahead and

416
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
typed in head in here and you can see that

417
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,480
this head note is getting highlighted.

418
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,280
Okay?

419
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,560
Nothing is getting highlighted in the
in the Web page because there's nothing

420
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,040
no, I don't think there is
any elements inside the head.

421
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,680
But I want to skip this head
and go to the body.

422
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,360
How would I do this? Guys?

423
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:12,560
Any guesses in here?

424
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:20,720
How would I go to the body
instead of head?

425
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,400
Why can I do slash and body in here, guys?

426
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,320
Why is this not working?

427
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,720
If I do a HTML slash head slash body,

428
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,600
why is this not working?

429
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,400
Double slash?

430
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,640
Not really.

431
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,000
It's different route.

432
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Okay.

433
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,800
Body is not inside of the head.

434
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,320
Absolutely right.

435
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,440
So guys, when I said that head

436
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,240
and body are inside the HTML

437
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,600
and here we go
in one by one, step by step.

438
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:02,960
Right?

439
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,080
So head is inside the HTML,
but body is not inside the head.

440
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,440
Right.

441
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:15,000
So what I need to do in here,
I need to delete this head in here

442
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,200
and just put h html and body.

443
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,520
So in this case, guys,
since we said that head

444
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,120
and body are children of the
h HTML, right.

445
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,040
What does head and body are to each other?

446
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:36,960
Guys, brothers

447
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,320
or in in other words, they are siblings.

448
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,960
Okay, so there are siblings.

449
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,720
That's very good.

450
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,440
Okay, So we will be coming to siblings
a little bit later.

451
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,160
But for now we have HTML as a parent
and then head and body

452
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,800
are siblings to each other.

453
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,080
Do they fight a lot? Not really.

454
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,120
Not at this moment.

455
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Okay, guys.

456
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,280
So seems like right now
they're understanding

457
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,440
each other pretty well.

458
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,320
Okay.

459
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,680
All right.

460
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,640
So so now we are in body, right?

461
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,160
So if I want to

462
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,800
if I want to, let's
go to the first division.

463
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,520
Right.

464
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,160
So if I want to go to the division guys,
what I need to do,

465
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,840
I just need to put as div, right.

466
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,080
And you can see that we're going
down, down

467
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,760
and we're going one by one

468
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,600
through each and every note.

469
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,840
Okay,
so if I open up this div and here we have

470
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,480
a lot of different things in here as well,
so I can do another division in here.

471
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,560
And again, if you open up this one,
there is another division so you can go

472
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,720
they've div so
it depends on what kind of tags you have.

473
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,360
Right.

474
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,800
So you go one by one through to the tags,

475
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,160
starting from the roots,
starting from the very top.

476
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,360
Okay, so this is how you construct
the absolute x path.

477
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,120
Okay.

478
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,880
So that's how the the absolute x backwards

479
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,640
relative x path works
a little bit different.

480
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,400
We'll come to this point right now.

481
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,120
Okay.

482
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,440
Any questions on this?

483
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,480
And one more thing.

484
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,600
One more thing, guys, before we move.

485
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,440
So absolute X path, guys,

486
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,280
it is not used very much and we will come

487
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,560
to the differences of absolute
and relative X path is a little bit later.

488
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,720
Okay.

489
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,520
So now let me just copy this.

490
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,560
So here absolute X plus

491
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,200
start

492
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,000
from the

493
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,560
starting note in H html

494
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,400
and we can say that it always starts

495
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,560
with a single slash.

496
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,160
Okay.

497
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,520
And then what I'm going to do,

498
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,520
let's give it an example here.

499
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,600
Is that in here?

500
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Okay, any questions, guys?

501
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:38,640
Any questions on excellent X file?

502
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,200
Okay, cool.

503
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:40,880
All right.

504
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,080
So now let's go to the

505
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,400
relative X five.

506
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,520
Okay.

507
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,640
So the relative X class is the most used,
I think,

508
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,480
locator.

509
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,160
If I'm not mistaken, after the item.

510
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,600
Okay.

511
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,440
What if you need this first,
but not the second?

512
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,280
Okay, That's a good question.

513
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,760
So let's go ahead and do this one.

514
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,320
Okay.

515
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,440
So let me close this one. Okay.

516
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,800
So let me

517
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,240
until this point.

518
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,600
Okay, So we are here.

519
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,800
So we have the first date, right?

520
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,480
And then the second date.

521
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,240
What if I want to go to the second one
and not the first one?

522
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,640
Guys, how would I do this?

523
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,800
Then we can use the indexing.

524
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,800
Okay, This is called indexing in Express.

525
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,480
Okay, So what I can do,
I can put the brackets in here, square

526
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,880
brackets, and put two in here,
and we can switch to the second division.

527
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,320
Okay,

528
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,880
so this is going

529
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,320
by index in here.

530
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,720
So it starts from zero.

531
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,880
That is correct.

532
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,760
But this is this is for x path.

533
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,240
For x, it's called going from indexes.

534
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,800
Okay.

535
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,080
It starts from one on x,

536
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,400
but usually when you code,
when you put the erase or any

537
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,520
what's called array list elements
right there

538
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,080
starts from zero.

539
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,480
All right. Okay.

540
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,240
So let's go back in here.

541
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,720
So now

542
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,800
so relative
x path is the mostly used after the ID.

543
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,760
Okay.

544
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,200
So there is a very good advantage
advantage for relative express

545
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,160
because for relative class,
you can start from any node of h HTML.

546
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,040
Okay.

547
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,240
So in absolute X path,

548
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,080
we have to start from the starting node,
which is h HTML, right?

549
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,200
So in relative X path,
you don't have to worry about it.

550
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,640
You have to you can start
from wherever you want to start.

551
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,560
Okay.
And I'll show you how to do this. Okay.

552
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,080
So let me put here starts from any node

553
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,360
in h HTML

554
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,960
and then what we can say it starts

555
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,520
starts with

556
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,240
double slash.

557
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,960
Okay.

558
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,480
So if you want to
if you want to write a relative X path,

559
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,000
you have to start with double slash,

560
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,960
right X path from the tag of our choice.

561
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,040
Exactly.

562
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,480
It's also complete of full X plus.

563
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,840
Yeah, it will be a complete x plus, but
it will call it what we call relative x.

564
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:02,840
Okay.

565
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,280
H html body needs to

566
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,040
that.

567
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,800
I'm not sure why that's happening.

568
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,960
Are you on the same page?

569
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,040
I hope you are on the same page.

570
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,880
Or you could share the screenshot
and we can see

571
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:26,720
we can take a look
why it's different in yours.

572
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,000
Okay. All right.

573
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,960
Okay, guys.

574
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,200
So now what I am going to do here

575
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,360
is let's start either

576
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,800
down side in using relative X path.

577
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Not really.

578
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,760
I don't think so, because the relative
x path is one of the really

579
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,600
versatile locators that you

580
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,400
can use while interacting
to locating the elements.

581
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,560
Okay.

582
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,200
That's why I said after the id

583
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,600
x path is the most used locator while

584
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,000
while interacting and running automation

585
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,520
we would mainly use
relative versus absolute.

586
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,640
Absolutely right. Yes, that is correct.

587
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,000
And I was going to come to that point
where we will discuss

588
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,480
about the advantages
and disadvantages of types of X.

589
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,560
So. Okay.

590
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,160
So all right, let's write our first

591
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,920
X path and here I'll give you the form
of the okay of the relative facts

592
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,960
path is pretty easy, but it might look
a little confusing at first, but

593
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,120
it's not when you when you practice
and when you get used to it.

594
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,920
Okay.

595
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,280
So let's throw the here syntax for

596
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,960
relative x path and here.

597
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,280
Okay.

598
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,720
So we said that you have to always start
with double slash.

599
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,200
Okay.

600
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,880
So I'm going to start with double slash
and here and what I will do is

601
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,320
I'll start with the tag
and any tag that I want.

602
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,480
Okay?

603
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,880
Or any tag name that belongs
to the element that I want to locate.

604
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,040
Okay.

605
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,400
So I'll start with the tag name
and then what

606
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,240
I'm going to do, I'm going to open
and close the square brackets.

607
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,400
Okay?

608
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,520
So and then I'll put an X sign

609
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,200
and I will start writing

610
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,320
that attribute that want to use.

611
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,680
Okay, style, class, name,
whatever you want to use.

612
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,800
Okay.

613
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,800
And then after I mentioned that,
then what I need to do,

614
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,680
I need to put an equal sign
single quotes in here,

615
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,960
and then inside the single quotes,
what I put,

616
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,920
I put the attribute value
that I am using right now.

617
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:53,600
Okay,

618
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,480
Attribute value.

619
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,600
Okay, So this is the syntax
for the relative x path

620
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:06,120
and now what we are going to do,
we're going to be writing some X stuff.

621
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,000
Okay? If this syntax is not clear, it's
okay.

622
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,600
I'm going to write
a relative X stuff in here right now

623
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,280
and then you can see how it actually
looks like.

624
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,440
Okay,

625
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,040
so like a complicated order in Starbucks.

626
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,240
Exactly.

627
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,320
Yeah. With all those milks and

628
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,680
splashes of vanilla and all that stuff.

629
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,920
Exactly. Yes.

630
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,400
Different attributes
you can use in reality.

631
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,640
Exactly.

632
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,480
There is no in not only in relative right.

633
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,840
And expanse
you can use any attribute you want to use.

634
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:53,560
Okay.

635
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:53,880
Okay.

636
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,120
Let me write one relative x path, guys,
and you can see how it's actually written.

637
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,560
Okay. All right.

638
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,040
So how do we start with our relative
X path, guys?

639
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,920
First of all, let me actually

640
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,120
we I want to locate this textbox.

641
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,120
The textbox for the email. Okay, guys.

642
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,440
So here what I'm going to do,

643
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,560
what do I start with?

644
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,200
If I want to write a relative,
what do I want to start in here with?

645
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,400
With a double slash.

646
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,520
Right? Exactly.

647
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,840
So I start with a double slash. Okay.

648
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,400
So now I know that this is my

649
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,240
this is my element, right?

650
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,600
What is the tag?

651
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,720
So this element, guys, it's input, Right?

652
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,440
Okay.

653
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,400
So what I'm going to do in here,
I'm going to put

654
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,480
input in here.

655
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,040
Okay. That's fine.

656
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,920
Let's go back and click on this thing.
Okay.

657
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,720
So input.

658
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,640
Okay.

659
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,480
So now what
I will do square brackets in here.

660
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,680
Open and close at sign. Guys.

661
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,240
I'm going to put an ad sign in here
so I can now here

662
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,080
after I put the side, I need to choose
which attribute I am going to use.

663
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,440
Okay, So, so
I'm going to come back to your question.

664
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,040
Okay. So let me finish this.
I'll explain it one more time.

665
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,000
Okay.

666
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,640
So attribute

667
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,680
which attribute do we want to go with?

668
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,400
So what kind of attribute
do we have in here, first of all of us.

669
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,800
So we see here type right

670
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,360
class and here name ID or place
holder, whatever.

671
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,080
Right?

672
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,280
So what I'm going to do

673
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,080
is let's pick
the ID, the easiest one for now, right?

674
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,160
So what I will do,
I put an ad sign in here, I'll go with ID

675
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,160
and then equals sign.

676
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:10,400
What is the value of my ID guys?

677
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,880
The value of my ID is email, right?

678
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,200
So if I do an email it will highlight
that exact element in here.

679
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,280
Okay.

680
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,640
So what I did
double slash tag name, right?

681
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,440
The attribute and the attribute value
that said guys,

682
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,680
okay, is this clear?

683
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,880
Guys, any questions on this? Copy this

684
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,560
and it's here.

685
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,680
There we go.

686
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,280
Okay, so now here, guys,

687
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,720
I want you to pay attention to one very,
very important thing.

688
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,760
Okay?

689
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,920
So whenever you're writing an X
path in here, what you want to do after

690
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,480
you wrote your path, after you have your

691
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,200
your element identified in the DOM, right?

692
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,280
What you want to do, you want to pay
attention to the very end of the textbox.

693
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,360
And every time you do that,
you have to make sure

694
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,480
you have one of one.

695
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
Okay.

696
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,480
So if you have one or two or one of three,
that means you didn't

697
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,080
identify your element uniquely.

698
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,160
Okay.

699
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,760
Whenever you have one of one only,
then it is clear that your your

700
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,240
your element or your x pass located

701
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,160
that element is uniquely
and there's no other match for that.

702
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,840
Okay. Exactly.

703
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,720
Because there there might be some
multiple attribute values

704
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,840
which are the same.

705
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,400
Right.

706
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,840
So that's why, guys, whenever you done
writing your express in here,

707
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,160
you have to make sure that it is
one of the one.

708
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,200
Okay.

709
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:12,040
Any questions, guys?

710
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,800
Yes. For the absolute is the same,
but we won't be using absolute

711
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,120
absolute X path at all.

712
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,640
Okay.

713
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,400
Because absolute
X path is very risky to use.

714
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:35,360
And I'll explain to you
a little bit later why.

715
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,760
One second.

716
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:49,480
But you see, Eugene,
that's exactly why we don't use the

717
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,640
that's one of the risks, why we don't use

718
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,200
absolute X path.

719
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,040
Okay.

720
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,600
All right, guys.

721
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,200
So now let's talk about why
we don't use the absolute next

722
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,120
path, guys.

723
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,400
So if I want to detect

724
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,160
or locate this element by using

725
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,840
by using the

726
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,400
absolute X path,

727
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,480
guys, what do I need to do
in order to get here?

728
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:31,080
Guys, too much, right?

729
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,240
So you need to start from h html,
you have to go to body,

730
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,800
then you have to go to other divisions.

731
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,440
Right?

732
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,640
There is a form, there is inputs,
there is all that stuff.

733
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,560
So your x path is going to be very long.

734
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,600
Okay, But

735
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,560
okay, you can use the absolute
X path in this case.

736
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,920
But what if, guys, what if your developer
makes any changes on the website

737
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,240
and he adds any division in here
between this and this one guys,

738
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,960
then what's going to happen to the fact
that you just created

739
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,480
guys?

740
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,560
Then it's going to mess up your X path.

741
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,040
It's not going to work at all
because you have to go back

742
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,640
to your code
and change that locator, right?

743
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,800
So that's one of the very big reasons why

744
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,960
people
actually don't use the absolute express.

745
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,920
Okay.

746
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,000
And it's really long
whenever you want to locate

747
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,160
and a different locate
any different elements inside.

748
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,200
Very different nodes. Okay.

749
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,960
So that's why it's really easy
for us to go with relative X path,

750
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,800
because you can go for any tag
you want, right?

751
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,920
You can start from any tag you want
or from any node if you want to start.

752
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,760
Okay. All right.

753
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,560
So where did I get input from?

754
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,120
It's from here, right? This is my element.

755
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,640
So whenever you go here,
click on this magic arrow.

756
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,040
Come back to your textbox.

757
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,360
You can see that each and every element
they have your

758
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,600
they have a tag name first, right?

759
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,160
So that's how you start your X path.

760
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,360
And I think set up asked
why double slash because relative express

761
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,680
always starts with double slash

762
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,080
tag for creating your account.

763
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,760
Okay, let's take a look at that.

764
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,120
Okay.

765
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,840
What's the tech for create
new account goes in here

766
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:43,320
say color.

767
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:52,800
It's an attack right?

768
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,880
So it's right here.

769
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,760
So we're having a tag
and then we have this button.

770
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,840
Okay.

771
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,400
All right.

772
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,720
So now actually, let's.

773
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,960
Let's do this.

774
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,680
Let's identify this element, guys.

775
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,360
Okay.

776
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,520
So there is one more really

777
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,080
what's called really big advantage
of relative express

778
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,520
that we can actually use
while locating the elements.

779
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,600
Okay.

780
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,520
So let's actually identify this. Okay.

781
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,200
So let me

782
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,120
remove this one. Okay.

783
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,240
So this is our element
that we want to interact with.

784
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,080
Okay.

785
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,720
How do we how do we start doing this?

786
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,760
Okay, so what do I need to start from

787
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,960
if I want to
if I want to write it relative, us

788
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,240
double slash

789
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,360
and then okay, my tag is a right.

790
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:55,080
So let's go back in here

791
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,320
and this is my element, right?

792
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,840
So my square

793
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:08,680
brackets right.

794
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,880
And then what can we use in here?

795
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,600
So if I use the class guys in here,
which one do we prefer to use in here?

796
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,800
Guys.

797
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,720
So there is class.

798
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,000
Okay.

799
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,120
ID okay
guys, we're talking about the ID here.

800
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,000
What did we what, what did we say
about these kind of ID values?

801
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,120
If ID has numeric values,

802
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,600
that's why it might be dynamic, right?

803
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,200
Same thing with a class, right?

804
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,320
So there is a couple of things.

805
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:50,600
Last in here, there is data test ID,
whatever it is.

806
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,320
Right?

807
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,280
And then there's role as a button in here.

808
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,640
What else do we have

809
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:03,560
in here, guys?

810
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,400
Okay, you used row.

811
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,240
That's fine.

812
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,640
What else do we have in here? Guys?

813
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,600
We besides, besides the attributes?

814
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,920
Do we have anything else in here?

815
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:19,120
Guys, we have a hyperlink.

816
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,160
Okay, this one.

817
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,240
Okay, what else?

818
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,520
We have a text, right?

819
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,440
So this is one of the biggest advantages
of X based.

820
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,200
So you can identify an element
by its text.

821
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,800
Okay, Here
we have a lot of mass in here, right?

822
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,120
So we have seems like it looks

823
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,360
like dynamic X,

824
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,760
I mean dynamic ID value or dynamic class
values, right?

825
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,240
So in order to be for us safe, right?

826
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,040
So rule and data ID, these are really,

827
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,320
really rare used attributes.

828
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,200
They might be removed in the future
by developers.

829
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,280
You never know about that. Okay.

830
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,800
So in order for us to be safe
in this case,

831
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,240
what we have on hand,
that might not change at all

832
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,080
in the future,
guys, is the text of this button.

833
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,360
Okay.

834
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,040
And you can see this
text button inside this a

835
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,720
okay, well, create new account.

836
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,640
What how would this change in the future

837
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,240
guys create new account is always create
new account.

838
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,640
Right? We're sign up.

839
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:38,160
Yes but it's I don't think it would change
really frequently, guys.

840
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,120
Okay.

841
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,960
When you
when something goes into production.

842
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,520
Guys, this is finalized.

843
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,480
Okay, This is finalized.

844
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,120
I think unless your client
is really forced to change it

845
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,320
and there should be a huge reason
to change the text or to change something

846
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,480
existing already
I'm talking about the buttons

847
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,400
or or the all the design of the

848
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,920
what's called off the web page. Okay.

849
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,720
When something goes to the production
guys, it's really rare

850
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,920
that you're going to be changing
existing things.

851
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,240
You can add more functionality
to the website, but it's really rare

852
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,400
that you will be changing
the existing small text or whatever it is.

853
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:31,800
Okay, unless the client is applied.

854
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,680
Yeah, exactly.

855
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,240
So, okay, so we have this text.

856
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,440
Okay, So what I'm going to do,
I started with double

857
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,640
slash attack square brackets, right?

858
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,800
So what I'm going to do now,
since we will be using text,

859
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,840
what I can do in here, in do text

860
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,360
and open and close parentheses,

861
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,320
what I'll do is equal to and then

862
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,800
single quotes in here

863
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,280
and I'm going to copy this text in here.

864
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,480
And what I will do, I'll just paste it
inside my single quotes.

865
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,080
Okay.

866
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,600
Is this unique?

867
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:25,400
Goes the
the element that I just identified.

868
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,840
Yes. Right. Because it's one of one.

869
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,560
So it's a valid relative path
which located

870
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,000
element uniquely.

871
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,520
So let me copy this

872
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,000
right.

873
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,560
And let's put it here.

874
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:53,000
Identifying elements by this text.

875
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,480
All right, There we go.

876
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,480
So you have a tag name,
You just put a text in there

877
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,240
and you put the actual text

878
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,480
inside the single codes.

879
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,080
No, we don't have an F sign.

880
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,960
Exactly. That's a very good catch.

881
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,120
Whenever you're using a text guys
inside your relative text,

882
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,920
you cannot use the X1.

883
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,720
Okay, So if I put and sign before text,
this is not going to work

884
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,920
because text is not an attribute, right?

885
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,800
So you put an act before the attribute.

886
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,560
Okay, guys, is that clear?

887
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,480
Any questions on anything we've done?

888
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,640
So far with X?

889
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:53,040
Pascal's?

890
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,760
The syntax for

891
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,720
text test or text

892
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,360
in the X path?

893
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,480
Yeah, for the text, yes.

894
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,240
So let me actually put the syntax in here.

895
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,040
So again, it's fine to copy this syntax.

896
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,040
So the tag name, right.

897
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,160
So here,
since we are identifying it by text,

898
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,880
you will be pasting in here
or inputting text without a net sign.

899
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:29,280
And then here just the text value of that
element.

900
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,120
Okay,

901
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,840
any questions,

902
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:43,880
guys?

903
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,080
I'll clear.

904
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:49,640
All right.

905
00:51:49,640 --> 00:52:00,480
So let me.

906
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,080
Okay, So now, guys, since

907
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,120
7:00.

908
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,880
So let's do a couple of more things
and then we'll get point.

909
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,320
Okay? All right.

910
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,120
So in Java, guys, I'm
pretty sure you remember

911
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,240
the string manipulation, right?

912
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,080
So whenever you have a condition
where you want to verify

913
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,360
or you want to put
a condition for verifying the

914
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:33,840
the string that has some partial values

915
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,680
equal to each other, what method

916
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:43,400
do you use, guys?

917
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,840
Line 25. No. Any tag name?

918
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,360
Any tag name guys. Okay.

919
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,240
It doesn't have to be an A, okay.

920
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,480
Any tag name because let's go ahead

921
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,040
and take a look at the log in in here.

922
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,480
Okay.

923
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,760
So now look,
the tag name is different for this one.

924
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:04,800
Okay?

925
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,280
But it still has the text.

926
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,120
Okay. So it doesn't have to be a tag.

927
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,960
Always.

928
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,600
Okay.

929
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:16,760
All right.

930
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,240
Let's see. Equals contains, right?

931
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,320
Because you looking for the partial value
of the

932
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,840
of the string.

933
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:30,960
Okay, so now in an X path, guys,

934
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,120
whenever you have a very long, very long

935
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,920
attribute value
or very long text that you want to

936
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:44,560
you don't want to really write everything
down in your express, there is a method

937
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,800
which you can use and express as well,
which is called contains.

938
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,920
That way what you can do, you can just get

939
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,040
the partial attribute value
and you can put it inside your X.

940
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,320
You don't have to put

941
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,480
the whole attribute value or

942
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,200
the whole text inside your X pass
so that it's not that long.

943
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:05,960
Okay.

944
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,800
So in here,
as you can see, this class value

945
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,960
limit to read this, this class
value is very long, right?

946
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,200
So what else do we have?

947
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,720
Let's actually identify
this textbox again.

948
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,240
Okay, let's use different

949
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,040
different attributes in here.

950
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,880
Okay.

951
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,440
All right.

952
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,720
So identifying, identifying

953
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,560
elements, using

954
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,920
tens method.

955
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,280
Okay.

956
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,720
So what I'm going to do in here,
double slash again, guys, tag name, right?

957
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,880
Square brackets, guys.

958
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,080
So now I will start typing

959
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,640
the actual method in here

960
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,000
and then we'll go through the attributes.

961
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,720
Okay.

962
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,720
So what I'm going to do and here
I'll start with typing in contains

963
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,800
and I will open and close the parentheses.

964
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,000
Okay.

965
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,360
Once I did that
inside the parentheses of contains method,

966
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,640
I'll start typing my attributes

967
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,040
at sign and attribute.

968
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,760
Okay.

969
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,200
So now here we don't use the equals sign.

970
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,440
What we do we're going to be doing comma.

971
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:31,600
Okay, comma
and then single quotes in here.

972
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,840
And what I will do, I will do partial

973
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,560
attributes.

974
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,280
So okay, so this
one is going to be a little bit confusing,

975
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,520
but whenever you get more practice,
you will get more comfortable on it.

976
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,760
Okay, double slash tag name contains
method.

977
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,160
You start inside the parentheses,
you start with the attribute,

978
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,640
and then instead of going with equal sign,
you'll go with comma

979
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,560
and then single quotes
and the partial attribute.

980
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,640
So it is harder by adding
instead of equals.

981
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,680
I'm not sure why
why this is made this way,

982
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,880
but it is probably

983
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,440
when you do contains
instead of doing equal sign, it's

984
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,440
it's getting it's
accepting two different arguments.

985
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,200
Okay.

986
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,200
So you're basically passing
two different arguments

987
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,440
in here as we did
when when we were doing set in

988
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,920
setting the property right,
in setting the property you pass where

989
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,520
what driver
you want to use comma and then what,

990
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,680
where your driver is located.

991
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,120
Right?

992
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,360
So this is probably the same way
they made it.

993
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,240
Inside this method.

994
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,360
You put the attribute comma,
and then the second

995
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,880
value you put is your partial attribute
found.

996
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:01,960
Okay.

997
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,880
All right.

998
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:19,560
Any questions
before we move forward, guys?

999
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,880
Now? Questions? All good.

1000
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,000
Okay.

1001
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,320
Yeah.

1002
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,480
It's like a constructor or just a
method was two parameters.

1003
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:28,960
All right.

1004
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,400
Okay, So now let's go back in here.

1005
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,040
So I want to identify this text box
for email or phone number.

1006
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,360
Okay, So where do I start with

1007
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,320
what I start with?

1008
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,440
Help me out, guys.

1009
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,680
What I need to do first
for relative express.

1010
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:47,680
There we go.

1011
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,720
So double slash input tag in here.

1012
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,520
All right,

1013
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,840
let's go back here.

1014
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,200
This is my input.

1015
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:01,480
So now, guys, since we set that
in Relative Express or any PATH,

1016
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,480
we can be we can use different any

1017
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,000
any of the executes right in here.

1018
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,520
What I want to use I want to use place

1019
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,320
actually.

1020
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,640
Okay. So you can see that
it's a bit longer

1021
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,640
the value it's a bit longer in here,
right.

1022
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,280
So let me use the placeholder
in this case.

1023
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,520
So square brackets in here, like

1024
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,960
what I need to do is

1025
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,480
I, I'm going, it has spaces.

1026
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,600
It's okay, It's okay.

1027
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,720
We'll figure it out. Okay.

1028
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,440
All right.

1029
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:45,240
So what I need to do in here is I'll start

1030
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:49,120
with my method,
which which is contains, right.

1031
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,280
So contains open
and closed the parentheses.

1032
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,600
Right.

1033
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,240
So inside the parentheses, what I need to

1034
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,400
specify is my attribute.

1035
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,440
Right. So side.

1036
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,960
So now I am using the place holder.

1037
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:05,760
Right.

1038
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,680
So what I'm going to do at same place
holder comma

1039
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,440
and then single quotes in here.

1040
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:18,480
So I need the partial value of this place.

1041
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,840
Holder Right.

1042
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,240
So what I can do is just
I can put an email in here

1043
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,760
and this will identify
my element is unique.

1044
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,880
Okay, Is this clear, guys?

1045
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:37,440
Any questions on this?

1046
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,080
Nice.

1047
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,040
Okay again guys, double slash tag

1048
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,720
name contains attribute

1049
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:51,400
and then attribute value.

1050
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,920
Oh yeah, absolutely. Guys,
you will have a lot of practice.

1051
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,120
Okay, guys,
I'll give you some homework. So

1052
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,440
you won't
be able to use ignore case in here.

1053
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:10,720
Now. Okay,

1054
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:21,880
so let me confidence that.

1055
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,760
Okay, there we go.

1056
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,600
So we have an

1057
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,720
example in here.

1058
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,840
Does uppercase and lowercase matter?

1059
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,200
Of course. Yes. Yes, guys, it is.

1060
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,320
It should be.

1061
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,280
Let's actually check in here.

1062
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,800
So it should be case sensitive. Right.

1063
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,280
So if I put e

1064
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,120
what's called
not the capital or lowercase in here,

1065
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,880
it's not going to identify my element.

1066
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:50,840
Okay.

1067
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,840
This should be uppercase.

1068
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,400
Why? Why is this working
if it's mail, guys,

1069
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:07,120
not email, but just male here?

1070
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:07,800
Exactly.

1071
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,600
Because it contains that sequence
anyways inside that value.

1072
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:13,720
Right.

1073
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,160
Okay. Nice

1074
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,880
as email and phone number.

1075
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:26,880
The reason I chose Placeholder
is to show you that we can use different

1076
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,120
different attributes than the locators.

1077
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,360
And because
the value of the placeholder is long,

1078
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:37,840
we don't want to use that long values.
Okay.

1079
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,320
So contains you usually use for the for
the elements that you want to shorten the

1080
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,400
the attribute values for elements.

1081
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:59,400
Okay.

1082
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:06,120
What do we do once we find the value
of those x path locator mean what do we do

1083
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:13,760
once we have the expats like this,
we will be going over the script, right?

1084
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,360
So after I explain you these
how we handle all these

1085
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,640
and what kind of methods
we have with X plus, we'll go ahead

1086
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,520
and do some automation on this.

1087
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,680
Okay?

1088
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,440
Can you use name? Yeah, absolutely.

1089
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,440
You can use name.

1090
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:36,600
Yeah.

1091
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:45,240
So can we use what kind of Java methods
are you talking about.

1092
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,000
Start

1093
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,080
with etc.. No.

1094
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:53,200
So this one is contains
is the same as in Java.

1095
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,240
Right.

1096
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,080
But we also have starts with which

1097
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:00,160
I am going to explain you right now.

1098
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:00,560
Okay.

1099
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,920
But starts with
is a little bit different than in Java.

1100
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,120
Okay but this is I, I talked about Java

1101
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:13,320
so that you guys know that it is
similar approach.

1102
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:19,360
Okay but they are these are different

1103
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,880
because you're writing this inside
the extract.

1104
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,200
This is not a Java code, right?

1105
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,520
So you're writing this inside the X
to locate the element

1106
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,040
to have an access to the HTML.

1107
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:36,440
All right.

1108
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,960
So there is one more thing that I want
to show you before the break, guys.

1109
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,440
So we talked about containers
and we also have in Java,

1110
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,760
this starts with okay, so

1111
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,880
starts

1112
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,960
with will

1113
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,640
identify

1114
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,360
the element

1115
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:08,240
with starting the partial self.

1116
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,040
Right.

1117
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:12,440
Okay.

1118
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,560
And then that we need to memorize
it would be okay.

1119
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,240
Sure.

1120
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,160
Okay so let's get through the

1121
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:26,520
through all the x path types
and what we can do with this and then

1122
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,840
I'll tell you which ones are really useful
during the automation.

1123
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,160
Okay.

1124
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,920
All right. So let's put the

1125
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,840
mic copy this.

1126
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,080
Let's put the syntax in here. Okay.

1127
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,560
So instead of just contains
what we will be doing,

1128
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,920
we will be using starts with

1129
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,080
starts.

1130
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,480
But here it's it's written differently
right starts

1131
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:00,360
dash words in here and then you can do

1132
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,920
partial

1133
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,440
starting attributes out.

1134
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:10,480
Right So it's pretty much the same thing
but we using a different method here.

1135
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,120
Okay, So let's go back in here, guys,

1136
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,840
and see

1137
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,480
what we can do

1138
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,960
is let's identify

1139
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,240
this this button, guys,
this is our button.

1140
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:37,520
So how do we want to identify this?

1141
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,680
Let's go step by step.

1142
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,440
Okay, let's let's finish starts with
and then we'll go to the ends with.

1143
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,280
Okay.

1144
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:46,960
All right.

1145
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,480
So here we have a button attribute, right?

1146
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,560
Double slash button

1147
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,160
button attribute in here.

1148
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,280
What do we want to use in here? Does

1149
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,720
let's see.

1150
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,800
You want to try using the class
and you want to

1151
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,960
because it has a very long value in here.

1152
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,080
And we can use starts with

1153
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,960
in here.

1154
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,080
Okay. So

1155
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,520
the square brackets in here

1156
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,160
then starts with right

1157
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,360
parentheses
and then inside the parentheses

1158
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,240
what I can do at class

1159
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:41,120
comma single quotes in here and let's to

1160
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,640
four to

1161
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,040
or after you, whatever it takes. Right.

1162
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,680
So I just chose the starting value

1163
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,160
of the class of the class attribute

1164
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,520
and it located my element

1165
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,400
and it located my element.

1166
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:02,040
Unique right is in this dynamic.

1167
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,160
That's a very good question. Yes.

1168
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,160
So since we have numeric stuff in here,
we can change, right?

1169
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,280
We don't want to use this, right?

1170
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,200
So let's go ahead and use a different one.

1171
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,520
Okay.

1172
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,560
So starts with what do we want to use
the guess test idea.

1173
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,080
Okay, let's use the data test idea.

1174
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:22,440
Right.

1175
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,280
So data the test ID

1176
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:30,200
and then the value would be let's do.

1177
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,040
All right.

1178
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,560
So if we use this, it is one of one.

1179
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,920
So that means this

1180
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,360
this X path is reliable and it is

1181
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,120
uniquely identified that element.

1182
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,280
Right.

1183
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,720
How can we write it using text?

1184
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,720
That's that was actually the next thing
that I was going to explain.

1185
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:52,360
Okay.

1186
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:57,640
So let me copy this and go here.

1187
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,240
Example.

1188
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,680
It's pasted in here, right?

1189
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,600
So now, guys,
so this button has a text as well, right?

1190
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,160
What we can do in here,

1191
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,560
the same way we identify the text

1192
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,880
we can identify with starts
with or contain.

1193
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,120
Okay.

1194
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,920
But instead of these attributes, guys,

1195
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,960
let me delete this attribute.

1196
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,640
What you can do,
you can simply put a text in here,

1197
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,840
open and close parentheses,
and then instead of broil

1198
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,520
since we using this starts with
you could just put

1199
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,840
LG the starting point of that text

1200
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,960
and this will locate your element as well.

1201
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:44,480
Okay.

1202
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,920
Any questions on this

1203
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,040
text?

1204
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,720
I think it
is a method, but I'm not sure it's 100%.

1205
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,000
If it's a method, it's an expression.

1206
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,680
Okay.

1207
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:07,440
To identify the element.

1208
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,600
If you can't locate, send us a screenshot.

1209
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:21,520
We need to see or expand.

1210
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,640
Why doesn't I like the text?

1211
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,760
Because it highlighted the actual the

1212
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,920
what's called

1213
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,600
the actual element in here.

1214
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,560
Okay, that's enough for us. Okay.

1215
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,560
It doesn't have to.

1216
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,920
It doesn't have to highlight
the whole thing

1217
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,680
as long as you have when it collapses,
as long as you have this located

1218
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:51,120
or highlight it, that's enough
for you to use in your selenium

1219
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,880
script.

1220
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,600
Okay.

1221
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,040
And the most important thing
that I said, guys, about the

1222
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,200
X path is when you have one of one,

1223
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,160
okay, sure.

1224
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,240
Here are the most files.

1225
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,800
Any questions before we

1226
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:20,240
move forward, guys?

1227
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,000
So make

1228
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,880
I'm not sure if Let me see.

1229
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:41,040
I'm not sure if we can make this bigger.

1230
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,440
Let me check if I can make it bigger.

1231
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,840
Guys, let's take a break. It's 816 already

1232
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:47,160
sick.

1233
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,800
A 15 minute break in here.

1234
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,760
And then what we can do,
we can continue from there.

1235
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,160
Okay.

1236
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,600
So we'll come back 830

1237
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:24,480
on the right.

1238
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,760
There shouldn't
be anything wrong with that X plus

1239
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:41,880
Comanche plus.

1240
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,200
Okay, let's try this.

1241
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,280
Let's see.

1242
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,240
There we go. Nice.

1243
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:50,640
Thank you.

1244
01:11:50,640 --> 01:12:01,680
They're well, they should be fine.

1245
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:05,760
Give us different
you know, these are the different values,

1246
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,040
right?

1247
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,800
These are different values.

1248
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:19,480
So the test that tests test
idea has a different value it.

1249
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,280
The text is different.

1250
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:31,040
And here, let's

1251
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:41,000
see a screenshot.

1252
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,120
Well, your your expert is wrong.

1253
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:48,120
It's not test it's text right
and then you'll

1254
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:53,000
log should be starting with the capital L

1255
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:02,360
and you put test in here it's text

1256
01:13:02,640 --> 01:25:22,320
I think you misspelled the.

1257
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,680
All right, guys, let's get back.

1258
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,680
I hope everyone is back or any

1259
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,560
and let's continue with our next class

1260
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,560
phase everyone back

1261
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,360
hopefully let's see how many people got

1262
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,360
open this.

1263
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:57,840
All right.

1264
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,600
So we covered the starts with right.

1265
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,520
We covered the contains methods.

1266
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,280
And now

1267
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,080
let's go ahead and talk about to end with

1268
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,680
okay so ends with it's

1269
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:16,920
it's not implemented in expats

1270
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,960
right now they removed it it was before

1271
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:23,760
there was a version

1272
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,120
one of expats there was ance with before

1273
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,080
and then they upgraded the x path
to version two.

1274
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:34,280
Now this method is not available.

1275
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:40,120
Okay, so let me put it in here.

1276
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:45,480
Was used in x 1.0

1277
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:51,160
and but we are using so any any

1278
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,240
what's called

1279
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:00,200
any browser right now is using path 2.0.

1280
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:00,600
Okay.

1281
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,760
So they removed
whoever is upgrading the X path

1282
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,600
as they remove the they remove s
with method from the x back to.

1283
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,880
So this method is not available right now.

1284
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,240
Okay.

1285
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:14,760
Using 2.0

1286
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,320
and this method is not

1287
01:27:22,160 --> 01:27:23,120
available.

1288
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:29,720
Okay Yes, it's better if you memorize.

1289
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:34,680
I mean you don't really have to memorize
the more the more you start using them,

1290
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:39,080
the better you get, the more comfortable
you get in using this.

1291
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,720
So you don't really have to memorize, but

1292
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,160
yeah, these things,
they need practice only.

1293
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,040
Okay,

1294
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:52,520
So for it
or there's no need for it anymore.

1295
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:53,800
There is.

1296
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,360
Oh, there is no need for this
because you can use contains.

1297
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:57,960
Right.

1298
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,800
So I don't know why they still keep
this starts with you can use contains for

1299
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:07,440
for the ending part
right or the beginning part or the middle.

1300
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,000
So it doesn't really matter
any part of the value.

1301
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:21,400
You can use it with contents right.

1302
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:24,040
So for this content
is pretty much the perfect use.

1303
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:24,800
Exactly. Yeah.

1304
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,880
I'm not sure why they keeping this starts
with in here in these cases.

1305
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:30,000
Okay.

1306
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,160
You can use contains in here

1307
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:36,120
in absolutely everywhere
because it's like a wild card right.

1308
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:40,360
So you can use this starting
with starting a partial value

1309
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:43,920
or the ending partial value
doesn't really matter.

1310
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,360
You just contains with that. Right?

1311
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,400
So but I'm not sure why

1312
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:52,320
they keeping this starts with
they can probably remove that as well.

1313
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,040
All right.

1314
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,240
So now, guys, let's talk about the

1315
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,000
the tag names in the

1316
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,320
in the HTML. Okay.

1317
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,760
So what they mean, what they stand for.

1318
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,640
Okay. So let's talk about that.

1319
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,360
So They

1320
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,800
a lot of

1321
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,240
what's called

1322
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,520
a lot of tag names that we saw
were div in here.

1323
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,000
Right.

1324
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,320
What do we know about div?

1325
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,760
Do we know what it stands for?

1326
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:30,120
Guys?

1327
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:32,680
Exactly. It's a division, right?
It's simple.

1328
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,480
So this is the division
of some part, right?

1329
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:40,200
So if you go here you can see that

1330
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,800
if I just hover over my mouse

1331
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:47,880
inside the HTML,
you can see this, this division covers

1332
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,920
the whole log in part where you

1333
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:56,040
where you enter email, password,
log in button, all of that.

1334
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:56,480
Right.

1335
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,080
So it's just basically containers.

1336
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,240
Exactly. Yes.

1337
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,280
So if there's a division,

1338
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:05,600
anyone know what IMG is?

1339
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,880
So pretty straightforward,
right? It's pretty

1340
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:09,440
easy.

1341
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,440
It's an image, right?

1342
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:15,080
So most of the time it is
an image or any symbol on the web page.

1343
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:15,920
Okay.

1344
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:21,080
What do we know about H?

1345
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,040
Anyone knows about H? Guys

1346
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,960
header write simple.

1347
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:35,040
It's a header.

1348
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:38,560
So most of the time
you will see a header in

1349
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,840
a in tables or in just, just any websites.

1350
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,160
Okay.

1351
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:47,160
So any, any header off the website.

1352
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:48,200
Right.

1353
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,960
So H1, H2.

1354
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,000
Exactly. Okay.

1355
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,480
So do we know what p stands for guys.

1356
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,080
Anyone notice p in

1357
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:03,720
any h html or when you inspected the page.

1358
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,280
Exactly.

1359
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,640
That's a paragraph, right? So

1360
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:12,080
paragraph, whenever you have

1361
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,200
a story or anything
like two or three sentences in there,

1362
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,240
the developers say they put it
usually inside the paragraph.

1363
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,680
Right. All right. So what about l I guess

1364
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,640
it's a list, right?

1365
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,000
So, exactly.

1366
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,720
So when you have different
different choices

1367
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,280
in there,
you can put them inside list, right?

1368
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:37,920
So that it last.

1369
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,680
Anyone knows what is U

1370
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:46,600
Allardyce.

1371
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,440
Just the UI.

1372
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:53,520
That's the it's not a URL right.

1373
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,600
Unless almost almost

1374
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:57,720
on the line.

1375
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,040
Not really.

1376
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,480
So l i is list

1377
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,840
u l is an ordered list.

1378
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:14,040
Okay.

1379
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:16,000
Unordered lists.

1380
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,640
Okay.

1381
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,840
And what about all L guys?

1382
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,200
So this one should be pretty
straightforward

1383
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,560
order list.

1384
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,960
Right? Okay.

1385
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:29,360
All right.

1386
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:33,120
So we have divisions,
we have images, we have headers, right?

1387
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:36,800
So and then we have order lists.

1388
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,640
We have an order list.
We just have less. Right?

1389
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,560
So there's different different tags

1390
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,200
in HCM.

1391
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,640
Okay.

1392
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:50,880
So now let's
go ahead and create a new package in here

1393
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:56,320
and do some automation here.

1394
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,920
Okay. So I created Class three package.

1395
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,640
And what I'm going to do,
I'm going to create a Java class.

1396
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:05,640
Okay? So

1397
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:08,200
that's

1398
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:17,240
the amount.

1399
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,840
All right. So we will be working.

1400
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:34,960
So let me get the main method,
get the main method in here,

1401
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,040
All right? Okay.

1402
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,280
So we will be working on this website.

1403
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:39,880
Okay.

1404
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:43,440
So we already worked on this,
but now what we going to do?

1405
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:47,040
We will be using X path all the way along.

1406
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,760
Okay.

1407
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,360
So for this example.

1408
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,680
So first of all,
what do we need to do guys?

1409
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:57,240
So we have a main method, we have a class
in here, What's our first step?

1410
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:00,520
We need to set the properties right?

1411
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:04,560
So system that set property

1412
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:08,720
and we have to pass
two different arguments in here.

1413
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,960
So one of them is web driver

1414
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,520
Chrome

1415
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,280
driver.

1416
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:19,320
And then the second one is where

1417
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:21,640
our chrome driver

1418
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:26,840
is located right.

1419
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:27,200
Okay.

1420
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,880
So after we set our properties,
what is our next step?

1421
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,600
So we need to launch the browser
now, right?

1422
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:36,640
So what I'm going to do,

1423
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:39,120
I'll have a web driver.

1424
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:43,080
Driver is equal to new

1425
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:47,640
chrome driver.

1426
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,360
All right.

1427
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:54,160
So now after we have the object
of the web drivers and now what we need to

1428
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:57,040
do, we need to navigate to the zero

1429
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,720
right driver yet.

1430
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:06,000
And what I will do let me set this.

1431
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,720
Okay.

1432
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,720
I hope you guys have this URL.

1433
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:15,840
Yeah.

1434
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,520
Anyone

1435
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,120
that marked.

1436
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:23,680
Okay, very good.

1437
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:27,560
I just send it as well.

1438
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,040
Okay.

1439
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:30,760
So we're going to be
navigating to this website

1440
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,480
and then so we know

1441
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,760
that we have to log in first.

1442
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:39,680
Okay.

1443
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:43,560
So I'm going to click
on this magic arrow in here

1444
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,120
and back here.

1445
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,560
Okay. So this is my element. Okay?

1446
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,920
So in order for me to start
with an X path, what do I need to do

1447
01:35:51,920 --> 01:36:00,960
first?

1448
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,440
Anyone know

1449
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,560
we need to go to

1450
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:17,200
we need to enable our selector box, right?

1451
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,320
So how do I do that?

1452
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:22,000
I ahead and do command s right.

1453
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,320
If you're using windows,
you do control F Okay,

1454
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:29,120
so now we'll start
with double slash, right?

1455
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:32,280
And we will start with input, right?

1456
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,120
Because this is our tag name.

1457
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:40,840
So now what do we want to use in here
guys?

1458
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,880
What do we want to use in here?

1459
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:48,200
Which attribute do we want to use?

1460
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:50,800
So we already have our tag name in here.

1461
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:53,880
I'll do a

1462
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:00,720
class.

1463
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,360
Let's see.

1464
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,960
Okay,
so let's go ahead and use class guys.

1465
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:07,080
So class is equal

1466
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:10,280
to single code and text.

1467
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,040
Okay? Okay.

1468
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,320
What identified our elements
is this element unique goes

1469
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:21,720
no. Right.

1470
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:26,880
So that means we cannot be using
that class attribute because we have

1471
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,000
two different elements right now. Okay.

1472
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,800
So in order for you guys to see this
second element.

1473
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:39,960
Okay, so we know that it identified
two different elements.

1474
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:44,440
So for us, I want to know what is the
second element that it located right now.

1475
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:48,720
So what I can do there is arrows in here
up and down.

1476
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:51,600
Okay, So you click on Search next,

1477
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:54,920
it's going to go to the next available
element.

1478
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,160
Okay.

1479
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:00,280
So you click on Arrow, back up,
it's going to the first element.

1480
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:02,800
So this is how you

1481
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,840
go through the elements

1482
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:08,280
that are located in here in your DOM.

1483
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,680
Okay,
so we have to have one of one in here.

1484
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,040
So what we need to
do is we need to change the

1485
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,320
okay, so I want to use ID

1486
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:23,680
in this case, but
I don't want to use the whole value of ID.

1487
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:25,120
Okay.

1488
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:30,120
So what do we want to use in here?

1489
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:34,000
We can use contains right?

1490
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,760
So let me delete this.

1491
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,120
Okay.

1492
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:39,360
So what I can do contains

1493
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,720
and then parentheses
inside the parentheses.

1494
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,160
What am going to do?

1495
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,280
I'm going to put add sun and ID

1496
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:50,760
right comma in here, single quotes

1497
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:54,000
and they're good for us.

1498
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:57,000
Is the last the last part, right.

1499
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,200
Which says username. Okay.

1500
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:03,120
So what we can do
is just put the username in here

1501
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:08,480
and it will identify all elements one one
and it is okay.

1502
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:12,400
So what I will do I will copy this X pass.

1503
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,960
Now I need to go back to our

1504
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,120
script.

1505
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,840
Right.

1506
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:23,080
So driver, start find element.

1507
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,000
Right.

1508
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,800
What am I finding it by now?

1509
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:29,400
What is the located that I'm using?

1510
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,080
Guys, I'm using an X path, right?

1511
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:35,400
So if you look in here
we have an option to use X path.

1512
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,800
So let's go ahead and put it here
and inside the parentheses,

1513
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,080
double quotes and insert our x path

1514
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,560
to close this.

1515
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,000
What do we need to do in here, guys?

1516
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,560
Do I have to perform an action

1517
01:39:51,560 --> 01:40:01,440
right away?

1518
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,840
What if I don't want to perform an action
right away?

1519
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:07,520
How can I do this?

1520
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,160
Not necessary. Okay.

1521
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,720
We need to store it inside the variable.

1522
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:13,560
Right?

1523
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:18,600
So whenever you find another event,
you are getting an element

1524
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:21,880
in return.

1525
01:40:21,880 --> 01:40:24,000
So the use name

1526
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,640
is equal to this.

1527
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:28,160
And then

1528
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,920
username

1529
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,720
send keys.

1530
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,680
So our username is tester, right?

1531
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,360
So this is our first element,

1532
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:41,040
right?

1533
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,200
So I, I input a username.

1534
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,240
So now it's time for us to go back

1535
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:50,000
and locate the password.

1536
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:54,360
Okay, let me delete this one.

1537
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:56,520
Okay. So now

1538
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,080
help me with identifying

1539
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,160
help with identifying

1540
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:05,080
the second element,
which is password textbox.

1541
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:08,040
So this is my element.

1542
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,280
What, where do I start with?

1543
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,440
So double slash and input, right?

1544
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:20,000
So which, which attribute

1545
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,040
do we want to use in this case, guys

1546
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:28,760
type.

1547
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:29,040
Right.

1548
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,160
We can use type because it's short
and we're using X class.

1549
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:35,120
We can, we can go ahead and use

1550
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:39,640
any different attributes for this element.

1551
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,400
Right?

1552
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:45,000
So X sign type here is equal

1553
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,680
to single quotes and password.

1554
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:51,720
Right?
There we go. So we have one off one.

1555
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:55,000
So that means we identify
this element uniquely.

1556
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,280
And I'm going to copy this,

1557
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,040
go back to my script

1558
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:07,440
and I will do web elements.

1559
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,320
Password

1560
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:13,280
Z, Perfect driver

1561
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:15,680
find element

1562
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,840
but X plus

1563
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:21,360
this this in here

1564
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:25,960
and then plus four.

1565
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:28,520
So keys it is test

1566
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,000
right?

1567
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:33,680
Okay.

1568
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:37,720
So there is one more thing
that I want to show you guys.

1569
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:42,400
Whenever you are using the
the existing methods

1570
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:46,560
like driver that find element right driver

1571
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,440
that find element,

1572
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,040
how do we know that we can get a web

1573
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:57,160
element in return? Dice

1574
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,400
or we could do driver dot get title guys

1575
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:06,240
how do we know that
we getting a string in return

1576
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:09,160
in this in this case

1577
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:12,840
anyone

1578
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:24,640
any ideas.

1579
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,320
Okay.

1580
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:28,400
So whenever we start using

1581
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,960
the methods right it shows us right away.

1582
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:35,720
So whenever I do find element in here,
it shows me

1583
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:38,840
the return type on the right side.

1584
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:43,440
Okay,
so you're getting a web element object.

1585
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:52,080
If it's void,
what are you getting in return, guys?

1586
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:56,640
If it's void, you're getting a string.

1587
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:59,400
If it's void,
we're not getting anything right.

1588
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:02,400
So there's no return. Okay, good.

1589
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:05,400
All right, so now it's time

1590
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:08,400
let's go back and click on this log in.

1591
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:10,640
Right.

1592
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:13,440
So from here,

1593
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:17,080
it's the log in.

1594
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:19,800
All right, So we have the same

1595
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:23,240
we have the same tag name, right?

1596
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:27,320
Double,
double, slash input, square brackets.

1597
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:36,240
What do we want to use in this case, guys?

1598
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:42,240
So we have ID class,
we have name type value type should work.

1599
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,120
We've used type before,
so let's use value.

1600
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:46,280
Okay.

1601
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,400
Let's
see if we can use value in this case.

1602
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:53,640
So assign value is equal to

1603
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:56,160
log in.

1604
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,600
There we go.

1605
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,640
One of one. It's unique, so it's good.

1606
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:03,840
So now what I'm going to do,
I'm going to copy this X path.

1607
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:06,760
We'll go back in here

1608
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,760
and I'll do web element

1609
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,440
log in button

1610
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,200
equal cool driver

1611
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,400
find element

1612
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:25,640
by Express and I'll paste this in here.

1613
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,760
So what kind of action
I would be performing on our log

1614
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:35,640
in button, log in button, not click.

1615
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:37,360
All right.

1616
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:40,120
So we have identified using our password
and log

1617
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:43,120
in button with the values in here.

1618
01:45:43,480 --> 01:45:44,320
All right.

1619
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:50,280
So let me go ahead and run this guy.

1620
01:45:50,280 --> 01:46:00,720
Let's see.

1621
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:05,320
It's fitting.

1622
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:07,960
There we go. So we use three X classes.

1623
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:11,800
We could send keys to username password,

1624
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:15,080
and we could click on the log in button.

1625
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:16,680
All right.

1626
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:20,080
So pretty easy and pretty straightforward.

1627
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:22,080
All right.

1628
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:25,280
Any questions on this, guys?

1629
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,640
All you can do is

1630
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:33,840
any questions on absolute

1631
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,600
and relative expects guys

1632
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,800
rights.

1633
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:00,000
Okay, So no questions. That's good.

1634
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,160
So it is a little bit

1635
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:06,840
confusing, guys, but

1636
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:11,720
we'll be practicing a lot
and we will get as much comfortable

1637
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:16,560
as possible by practicing these experts.

1638
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,560
Okay, So now, guys,

1639
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:22,920
we passed the absolute and relative
X path is in here.

1640
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:26,640
So now what I want to show you

1641
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:30,160
is the advanced X stuff that

1642
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:35,000
so this is going to be a little bit

1643
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:39,720
confusion in here probably,
but it's easy as well.

1644
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,320
Okay.

1645
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,480
So the

1646
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,320
okay anyone

1647
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:58,120
anyone did a research on advanced
X factors?

1648
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:01,200
Anyone know what advanced

1649
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:06,000
X path is on the

1650
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:14,760
if there's no selector that we need. Yes.

1651
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,080
So you can say that.

1652
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,560
Exactly. Yes.

1653
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,600
So most of the companies
guys in most of the company.

1654
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,040
So in my company, in my company we use

1655
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:29,000
you could use any different locator
you want.

1656
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,320
But in my company
mostly use IDs and experts.

1657
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:34,720
Okay.

1658
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:38,280
So if we don't have an I.D.,
our developers

1659
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:41,560
usually don't have a lot of different.

1660
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:46,280
Okay, So most of the time
where we need to use X, okay.

1661
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:51,920
Because X is very, very versatile
and very very convenient for us.

1662
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,120
Okay.

1663
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:56,240
Do companies dictate what to use?

1664
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:57,360
Some of them do.

1665
01:48:58,480 --> 01:48:59,960
Some companies do,

1666
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:04,440
especially when you go to the
if you land on a government project.

1667
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:05,640
Okay.

1668
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:09,000
Because they want they they want
they want the code

1669
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,680
according to their format,

1670
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:15,920
according all their structure
and all that stuff.

1671
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:16,800
Okay.

1672
01:49:16,920 --> 01:49:23,600
So but most of the most of the private
projects, they don't really care.

1673
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:26,880
They don't really care
as long as everything works.

1674
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:31,640
They don't mind using X path
or different different locators.

1675
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,600
Okay.

1676
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:36,360
I remember I think it was one of the guys

1677
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:39,880
that he was in one of the batches
he thought a job

1678
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:46,680
and I think he used something different
and I think he almost got fired for that.

1679
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:49,000
So I don't remember,
but usually doesn't happen.

1680
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:52,160
So don't get scared, okay?

1681
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,640
It doesn't usually happen.

1682
01:49:53,640 --> 01:49:59,280
It's if you if you if you start working
and they told you that

1683
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:03,440
this is a must and you don't do this,
then you have a problem.

1684
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:05,480
Okay.

1685
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:09,520
But if they don't say anything
about these kind of stuff, so you could

1686
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:10,920
you get to use anything.

1687
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:17,520
Okay.

1688
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:26,320
I work with Maven, correct? Yes.

1689
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:29,280
Training
and orientation are really, really

1690
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:31,800
important guys.

1691
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:35,680
Okay,
There is one more thing about absolute

1692
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:38,720
and relative expert
that I want to show you.

1693
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:39,360
Okay?

1694
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,480
So in absolute path, guys,

1695
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:44,640
so we talked about that.

1696
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:46,800
You need to start from the very,

1697
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,640
very starting note in HTML, right?

1698
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:55,480
So in relative expo,

1699
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:58,680
you can do

1700
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:03,120
you can start from note
and what you can do

1701
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,880
is going back and forth.

1702
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:10,680
Okay, So let's say
let's say we started on this note,

1703
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:14,320
we can jump to this back here
or you can jump

1704
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:17,280
you can jump from this note to here.

1705
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,560
It doesn't really matter.

1706
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:23,960
That's why relative X is very,
very versatile.

1707
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:24,520
Okay.

1708
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,640
So you can jump to the

1709
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:30,000
to the next note
or you can go to the previous note.

1710
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:32,400
Okay.
And I'm going to show you how to do this.

1711
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:35,400
But in absolute X path,
when you start from

1712
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:39,360
the very top, you
can you can only go forward.

1713
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,040
Is that clear, guys?

1714
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:43,920
Any questions?

1715
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:54,240
Let's.

1716
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:54,800
All right.

1717
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:58,760
So advanced X path us so advanced

1718
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:01,880
X path is

1719
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:05,360
is based on parent

1720
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:09,600
and child and also sibling relationships.

1721
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:10,440
Right.

1722
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:13,600
As we talked before
in the beginning of the class, we said

1723
01:52:13,600 --> 01:52:16,680
there is HTML
that is parent and then head and body.

1724
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:18,720
It's child children, right?

1725
01:52:18,720 --> 01:52:21,880
And then head and head and body

1726
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:25,480
will be siblings to each other.

1727
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:27,880
Okay. Yeah, there is ancestors as well.

1728
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:31,560
There's a lot of different, different
keywords and expect that you can use.

1729
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:35,160
Okay, so now let me put it here.

1730
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:38,240
Advanced X path is based

1731
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:44,000
on parent and child.

1732
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,760
Child and

1733
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,800
sibling

1734
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:51,480
relationships.

1735
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:54,200
Okay, So now

1736
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:57,600
let's start with the following siblings.

1737
01:52:57,880 --> 01:53:01,440
Okay, So

1738
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,800
identifying

1739
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:09,840
elements by

1740
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:14,520
following sibling.

1741
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,280
Okay, So I'm going to put a syntax again
in here.

1742
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:18,840
Okay.

1743
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:21,880
It's it's very similar to what we've done

1744
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:25,600
with relative X,
but it is considered as relative X path.

1745
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:27,560
But it's on top of that.

1746
01:53:27,560 --> 01:53:32,000
It's in no bid advance
than the usual express.

1747
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:33,960
Okay, so we have a tag name,

1748
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,960
double slash tag name

1749
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:42,040
square brackets attribute
and then the attribute value.

1750
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:46,440
But then after this,
what you want to do in here,

1751
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:48,800
you want to put a single slash

1752
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:52,400
you want to write down following

1753
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:59,080
sibling,
and then you put double column in here

1754
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:04,320
and then the tag name of the next
following symbol.

1755
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,560
Okay.

1756
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:10,760
So this
this is probably confusing right now,

1757
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:13,560
but let's go and see how this works.

1758
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:17,000
Okay.

1759
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,600
Let me go to one side.

1760
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:23,800
My choice, you guys

1761
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:26,840
know this one

1762
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:28,200
here.

1763
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:30,920
Have you worked on this application

1764
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:40,160
before this or no?

1765
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:44,600
Same value in two boxes?

1766
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:46,760
Not read this is.

1767
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:48,960
Yeah, it's about to get stuck. Exactly.

1768
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:50,200
Okay,

1769
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:52,760
this is okay.

1770
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:55,920
So this is the syntax
where you guys are going to be doing

1771
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,640
all the projects when you start
doing the framework and everything.

1772
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:01,440
Okay, so

1773
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,640
let's see

1774
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:11,120
if this was a fast or beautiful.

1775
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:15,000
Okay, let me find the first one.

1776
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Um, on set,

1777
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:33,680
you guys,

1778
01:55:33,680 --> 01:55:48,360
I forgot what the password was.

1779
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,760
Oh, you already done the project.

1780
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:52,240
If you guys have the

1781
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:58,000
the password for this, I will send it

1782
01:55:58,280 --> 01:56:02,240
because I'm not finding it right

1783
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:18,160
or the admin.

1784
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:20,200
Is that using it. Oh I think one second.

1785
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:23,160
I think the input the right one

1786
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:33,600
potentially the No.

1787
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:39,240
I headed somewhere once every once.

1788
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,720
Oh there we go. Yes.

1789
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:46,200
Thank you.

1790
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:49,320
I was missing one

1791
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:52,560
area.

1792
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:52,920
Okay.

1793
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,280
Thank you.

1794
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,760
Nice. Okay.

1795
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,800
All right, so we logged in and here.

1796
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,640
Okay, so I'm going to go

1797
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,560
to this page.

1798
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:04,080
Okay?

1799
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,680
And then what
I will do, I'm going to inspect.

1800
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:10,720
Okay, So now what I want

1801
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:15,520
to do, I want to

1802
01:57:16,840 --> 01:57:17,280
I want

1803
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:21,840
to identify.

1804
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,120
You don't have to, guys.

1805
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:23,560
You can.

1806
01:57:23,560 --> 01:57:25,320
You can follow me right now, okay?

1807
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:27,920
You don't have to log in right now.

1808
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:28,440
Okay.

1809
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:34,160
I think Jamal then is he sent
the password, but the username is admin.

1810
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:35,360
Okay.

1811
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:38,120
Username is admin with capital A

1812
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:42,000
we we have a passport and live chat,
so please use that if you want to log in.

1813
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,400
Okay, but

1814
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:46,080
just follow me for now.

1815
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:48,480
Okay. All right.

1816
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:52,920
So what I want to do, you can see here
there is a calendar

1817
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:55,880
symbol or image in here. Okay?

1818
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:57,280
So you can choose any date.

1819
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:01,240
So I want to do
I want to click on this small calendar.

1820
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:04,680
Okay, So

1821
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:07,840
but here I only have this.

1822
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:10,200
This is my element, right?

1823
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,920
I only have the class.

1824
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,800
I have the source.

1825
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:14,120
Right.

1826
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:16,240
And I have something different in there.

1827
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:17,160
Okay.

1828
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:20,280
So there's nothing that I can use
right now

1829
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:23,520
to locate this element directly.

1830
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:24,960
Okay.

1831
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:31,360
So what I will do in here,
I will need to use the advanced X back.

1832
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:34,320
Okay, So

1833
01:58:34,680 --> 01:58:37,680
let's go ahead and open up
our selector box in here.

1834
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:42,760
So now,
since we're using the following sibling,

1835
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:47,440
it means that I need to start
from the step before.

1836
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:50,520
Okay, so let me look at the

1837
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,800
at the sibling in here, which is input.

1838
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:55,160
Okay.

1839
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:59,160
So if you look at the input right now,
what does it have?

1840
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:04,480
Guys, can we can we locate this directly
without doing anything.

1841
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:06,840
Goes do does it have

1842
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:08,760
the locators that we

1843
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:15,200
can use in here.

1844
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,080
Yes. Right. Okay.

1845
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:21,720
So what I'm going to do in here,
I'm going to start with the input

1846
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,320
IDs unique.

1847
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:27,640
So what I'm going to do,
I'll start with the input tag.

1848
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:29,920
Okay. So a double slash.

1849
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:32,640
Okay, input.

1850
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:36,560
And then we said
we're going to be using ID, okay.

1851
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:39,280
Is equal to

1852
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:44,280
single quotes in here and let's see.

1853
01:59:44,280 --> 01:59:47,600
So calendar from date, right.

1854
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:50,040
So I'm going to post

1855
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:51,840
the value in here. Okay.

1856
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:56,520
So we have one of one what identified this
element uniquely, right.

1857
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:59,640
But this element is not our target

1858
02:00:00,080 --> 02:00:03,040
the next element is right.

1859
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:06,960
So what I will start doing in here,
I'll put a single slash

1860
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:11,200
and I'll start typing following that

1861
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,360
sibling double column

1862
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,080
and then the tag name

1863
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:19,800
that the element I'm looking has.

1864
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:20,720
Okay.

1865
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:23,600
So in this case we have I am g in here.

1866
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:27,160
So what I will do,
I'll just put IMG in here

1867
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:32,480
and you can see that identify
the next sibling of the calendar

1868
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:36,080
of this input element.

1869
02:00:36,720 --> 02:00:39,560
Okay. Is that clear, guys,

1870
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:40,560
Any questions?

1871
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:44,120
So I see there is question
why we need to use advanced X style.

1872
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:44,920
Okay.

1873
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:49,520
We use the advanced X path
when we cannot locate

1874
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:52,800
the element directly by a relative x box.

1875
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:54,040
Okay.

1876
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:57,120
So if you look in this on this element,

1877
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:00,240
it has only class,
but I don't think it's unique.

1878
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:01,320
Okay.

1879
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:03,280
If you use that class, I don't there

1880
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,400
they're probably two
or three elements in here.

1881
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:10,280
So you and you don't have other IDs, names
of different locators in here.

1882
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:11,720
Okay.

1883
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:15,240
So if you are using the following sibling,

1884
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:18,880
you need to start from the element
before that.

1885
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:20,520
Okay.

1886
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:25,080
So in this case, the element before
that is the input tag.

1887
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:28,560
And we can identify this by IP.

1888
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:29,280
Okay.

1889
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:33,520
So you identify this element by ID
and after that

1890
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:36,840
you go to your following sibling.

1891
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:40,800
Okay.

1892
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:44,320
A source would be unique,
but it might not.

1893
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:47,400
It's really long and you can

1894
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,000
you can use contains in this case,

1895
02:01:51,000 --> 02:02:00,480
but that might not be unique.

1896
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:04,160
What if sibling cannot
can also not be identified?

1897
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:08,280
Then we're going to go to parents
and ancestors and I'm going to explain you

1898
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:10,680
what's called a number.

1899
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:12,960
I explain you that in a little bit. Okay.

1900
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:15,320
So we go step by step.

1901
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:19,080
For now, let's understand
how the following sibling advanced

1902
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:21,120
X path works

1903
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:30,320
for following sibling path. Yes.

1904
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:34,320
Yes. After the following sibling,
you only need to use the tag name.

1905
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:40,800
Okay.

1906
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:45,160
Okay guys,
there is one more thing for X path. Yes.

1907
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:47,640
So you're saying you using

1908
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:50,640
you can use the indexing as well, right?

1909
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:55,360
So you can use indexing in some cases
whenever

1910
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:59,640
like it's not unique or anything.

1911
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:00,200
Right.

1912
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:03,480
So you can use indexing, but it's not that

1913
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:05,400
reliable.

1914
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:06,080
Okay.

1915
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:08,840
So try to avoid using indexing

1916
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:11,440
unless you are forced to use those.

1917
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:17,880
Okay.

1918
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:23,800
How to distinguish if it's unique or not.

1919
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:27,480
So how do we know if it is what you need?

1920
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:31,040
This element, this this one or the element

1921
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:35,400
that we just find out?

1922
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:36,360
How do you distinguish?

1923
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:38,760
You could just write a next path for this.

1924
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:41,640
Okay, So go ahead and write an X path for

1925
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,800
image class and this value

1926
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:59,520
and see if it's unique to.

1927
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:10,400
I said it might not be you.

1928
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:13,000
There is numbers.

1929
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,280
Yeah, that might be dynamic.

1930
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:15,720
Exactly. Yes.

1931
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:20,560
So, okay, guys,
the reason we're doing this,

1932
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:23,560
the reason we're doing this is because

1933
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:26,080
we want to learn the advanced X stuff.

1934
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:27,440
Okay?

1935
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:30,000
So that's why

1936
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,640
you can probably
you can probably identify this element

1937
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:37,160
with class attribute and class value.

1938
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:42,240
This is fine, but our purpose is to learn
how to use the advanced X back.

1939
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:46,440
Okay,
So let's focus on Advanced Express and

1940
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,160
what's called

1941
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:52,280
and use following siblings
for this example.

1942
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,800
Okay, So here

1943
02:04:56,440 --> 02:05:01,920
we are again
identifying the element before the one

1944
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:04,200
we want to actually identify.

1945
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:06,720
Okay, So we can see here it has ID.

1946
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:10,080
So these are most reliable ones, right?

1947
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:13,880
So we're going to use
this will identify that element

1948
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:18,480
and then we step over the following
sibling.

1949
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:19,280
Okay.

1950
02:05:23,480 --> 02:05:24,640
The class is not unique.

1951
02:05:24,640 --> 02:05:24,960
Okay.

1952
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:31,600
There you go.

1953
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:34,720
You're confused about the elements
we use this for.

1954
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:35,800
Which one?

1955
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:54,600
This one, the input one.

1956
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:59,280
So we using this to identify
the next element.

1957
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:00,440
Okay.

1958
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:01,120
All right, guys.

1959
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:03,280
So let me copy this.

1960
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,320
Where is this?

1961
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:08,640
Paste this in here.

1962
02:06:08,640 --> 02:06:11,760
Okay, Now let me go back.

1963
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:13,920
Let me delete this. Okay.

1964
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:17,600
If you were about to use
the relative extract,

1965
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:31,640
right for this image,
how would you write X Factor?

1966
02:06:31,640 --> 02:06:32,840
How would I start in here?

1967
02:06:34,440 --> 02:06:37,120
Okay, double slash image.

1968
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:38,200
Right.

1969
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:40,280
So you have

1970
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,520
you have a class, right?

1971
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:48,360
So let me use the class

1972
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:52,480
is equal to the date picker.

1973
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:54,400
Right. So.

1974
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:56,640
So this and paste it in

1975
02:06:57,040 --> 02:07:00,000
how many elements did I find out

1976
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:02,400
to. Right.

1977
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,960
So this is not unique

1978
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:07,040
and you don't want to use source
because it's too long, right?

1979
02:07:07,120 --> 02:07:10,360
Even if you do contains it might be not

1980
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:12,120
okay.

1981
02:07:12,240 --> 02:07:17,640
So it might find another element
with the same containing string in there.

1982
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:18,200
There you go.

1983
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:20,120
Source is not unique either.

1984
02:07:20,120 --> 02:07:22,320
Okay, that's good to know. Okay.

1985
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,440
So that's why.

1986
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:29,160
Now, guys, this element,
you can not locate this element

1987
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:32,840
by just writing a relative X plus.

1988
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:34,400
Okay?

1989
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:38,040
That's
why you need to write an advanced path

1990
02:07:38,160 --> 02:07:40,440
so that you can move through the notes.

1991
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:41,600
Okay.

1992
02:07:41,720 --> 02:07:46,640
If you move through the notes,
then you can identify that element unique.

1993
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:51,240
Okay, so in this case,
since we identifying this element.

1994
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:54,720
Okay, what I can do,

1995
02:07:54,720 --> 02:08:00,800
I can start with this input element
and then jump on this one

1996
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:05,320
because the previous element
that I am identifying it has ID

1997
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:10,560
and we already know that IDs
are most reliable and unique, right?

1998
02:08:10,920 --> 02:08:13,560
So we can use this ID

1999
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:16,880
and then jump onto the next sibling.

2000
02:08:17,800 --> 02:08:18,560
Okay.

2001
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:32,320
Any questions, guys?

2002
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:34,920
Sure. In case

2003
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,720
parents of child

2004
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,920
following knot, it's going to be now
it's going to be a little bit different.

2005
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:44,160
And we
we will be going through it right now.

2006
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:45,200
Okay.

2007
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:46,360
All right.

2008
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:48,840
So siblings are fine.

2009
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:51,200
So now let me go back here

2010
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:56,760
and let me put identifying elements
by preceding siblings.

2011
02:08:56,760 --> 02:09:07,800
Okay, guys, I didn't have a source for.

2012
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:10,560
You mean if it didn't have this s r c

2013
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,520
No, no, no, no.

2014
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:18,160
Guess.

2015
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:21,960
All right, so here's why we're not using

2016
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,040
neither class nor source in here.

2017
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:30,360
Guys, what's the reason?

2018
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:32,640
Because they are not unique.

2019
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:33,280
Right?

2020
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:37,320
But what we want to do,
we want to identify this element

2021
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:40,160
as unique as possible.

2022
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:40,680
Right?

2023
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:43,320
So that's why what I need to do,

2024
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:46,680
I need to identify the element before

2025
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,680
and then switch to the next one,

2026
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:52,880
because the the element that I want to

2027
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:58,440
I want to locate
it doesn't have any unique locators.

2028
02:09:59,120 --> 02:09:59,840
Okay?

2029
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:03,960
That's why I need to move
through the nodes inside my HTML.

2030
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:05,600
Okay.

2031
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:14,160
I hope this is clear now.

2032
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:19,680
All right, so let me copy this one.

2033
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:20,720
Place it in here.

2034
02:10:20,720 --> 02:10:24,480
So identifying elements
by preceding sibling.

2035
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:28,640
Okay,
so the same thing, double slash, right?

2036
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:31,520
Tag name attributes, attribute value.

2037
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:35,400
But then instead of following sibling,
what I need to do,

2038
02:10:35,720 --> 02:10:38,320
I need to go to my preceding symbol.

2039
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:43,000
Okay, so right now
we just went to the following sibling.

2040
02:10:43,440 --> 02:10:48,120
Okay, so now with the preceding sibling,
we will be going upwards

2041
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:50,800
or you could say backwards in the HTML.

2042
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:54,600
Okay, so let's go back,

2043
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:57,720
open up here, let's open Amazon

2044
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:04,520
Amazon.

2045
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:05,520
Amazon. Okay.

2046
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:07,880
So there's a lot of stuff going on in
here, right?

2047
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:20,840
So let's inspect this page.

2048
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:27,760
So let's do this.

2049
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,480
All right.

2050
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:30,840
Okay.

2051
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:34,120
So in this case, guys,
I think we can identify

2052
02:11:34,120 --> 02:11:37,800
this element by by using text.

2053
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:38,680
Okay.

2054
02:11:38,680 --> 02:11:43,040
But we will try to identify this
by using preceding siblings. So

2055
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:47,160
basically,

2056
02:11:47,160 --> 02:11:52,200
once, correct?

2057
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:54,080
Yes, exactly.

2058
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:57,800
So you're trying to find that unique one
and then move to

2059
02:11:57,800 --> 02:12:00,560
the one that is not unique. Correct.

2060
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:02,920
Not the locator, the element.

2061
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:03,600
Right.

2062
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:10,200
The element which is not unique.

2063
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:10,920
Okay, guys.

2064
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:14,320
So what I want to do, I want to identify

2065
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:18,240
this element, which is the return okay,

2066
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:21,360
so we know that there's one
way to do it with the text.

2067
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:22,320
Okay.

2068
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:27,840
But what I want to do in here,
I want to go to the to this one first,

2069
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:30,000
okay?

2070
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,520
And then jump to the previous one.

2071
02:12:33,080 --> 02:12:34,800
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

2072
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,640
Is it clear what I'm doing?

2073
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:44,120
Any questions?

2074
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:46,920
Okay, cool.
So where do we start in this case?

2075
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:51,960
So I want to identify this element
first and then go.

2076
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:52,600
Go back

2077
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:55,440
to the preceding sibling.

2078
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:56,280
And here

2079
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,760
I give you an example.

2080
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:07,520
Yes, this was an example, right?

2081
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:09,680
This in here

2082
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:13,560
that the first one that we did,
we're going for advanced X path

2083
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:16,760
because we cannot identify one element.

2084
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:20,600
What would the regular relative expect?

2085
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:25,400
Okay, in here,
how would you identify this element

2086
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:29,560
with the relative X by the source
attribute is not unique.

2087
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:32,520
The class attribute is not unique. Okay.

2088
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:36,240
So you have to move inside your HMO.

2089
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:39,360
Okay.

2090
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:40,080
All right.

2091
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:42,840
So here, let's identify the first element

2092
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:52,080
that we need to add here.

2093
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:54,840
How how would you identify this element,
guys,

2094
02:13:56,240 --> 02:13:58,480
by using what's OC?

2095
02:13:58,840 --> 02:14:01,160
So double slash

2096
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:06,720
span right then square brackets and here,

2097
02:14:08,080 --> 02:14:09,760
what am I using?

2098
02:14:10,160 --> 02:14:14,160
Can I use class here?

2099
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:21,520
Okay,
let's use class and see if this is unique.

2100
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:24,520
Okay, so let's use class

2101
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:28,240
is equal to

2102
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:35,000
let me copy this.

2103
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:35,800
Okay.

2104
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:38,160
Is this unique, guys?

2105
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:40,360
It's not unique, right?

2106
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:42,720
So it found three more elements in here.

2107
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:45,360
That means we won't be able to use class.

2108
02:14:45,600 --> 02:14:48,400
Okay, So what we can do in this case,

2109
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:51,200
we can use the text

2110
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:54,120
that this element has, Right?

2111
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:58,920
So I'll go and do text.

2112
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,000
Right.

2113
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:02,920
And then

2114
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:08,360
equal to this single quotes in here

2115
02:15:09,080 --> 02:15:11,680
and then and I think

2116
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:16,440
all this right now,
this one is unique, right?

2117
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:19,320
So we have this as unique one.

2118
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:22,960
Okay, So now but my purpose

2119
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:26,960
is to go to this path, right?

2120
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:29,360
So where am I going right now?

2121
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:32,360
I am moving to my preceding sibling

2122
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:35,240
from this span.

2123
02:15:35,560 --> 02:15:37,320
The taxes here

2124
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:42,800
and orders is a text.

2125
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:46,800
Okay, so now what
I will do, I'll put a single slash

2126
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:54,000
preceding sibling double column again.

2127
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:57,600
And then what is my preceding siblings?

2128
02:15:57,640 --> 02:16:03,000
Tag guys, the tag is span, right?

2129
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:08,360
So if I do span, it moves one up,
so it goes to my preceding sibling.

2130
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:12,680
So this will identify this as unique.

2131
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:13,920
Thank you.

2132
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:15,120
Yeah.

2133
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:17,760
You can use
you can use the text for return. Yes.

2134
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:20,600
I'm just doing this
so that we can preceding siblings.

2135
02:16:21,160 --> 02:16:22,000
Okay.

2136
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:31,080
You can use text for that.

2137
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:35,960
Copy this is

2138
02:16:36,040 --> 02:16:37,160
this is

2139
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:42,280
all right.

2140
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:46,080
One more time, guys.

2141
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:50,280
I'm starting from the next element.

2142
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:51,160
Right.

2143
02:16:51,160 --> 02:16:54,360
Which is the and orders element. Right.

2144
02:16:54,440 --> 02:16:57,480
So identify this by

2145
02:16:57,480 --> 02:16:59,520
let me actually this

2146
02:16:59,800 --> 02:17:02,840
I identified this element by its text

2147
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:06,600
and I want to move one sibling up.

2148
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:11,280
So what I will do,
I'll go with preceding siblings and the

2149
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:13,720
tag name.

2150
02:17:13,720 --> 02:17:16,560
Okay.

2151
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:20,040
How do you know that an order is text? So

2152
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:25,520
you can see this.

2153
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:27,080
It's inside the span.

2154
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:29,920
So this fan is open
Spanish closed in here.

2155
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:31,840
And you can see the text.

2156
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:36,680
Usually it's it's written in black font.

2157
02:17:37,080 --> 02:17:38,000
Okay.

2158
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,680
So that's
how you know that this is a text.

2159
02:17:42,680 --> 02:17:45,880
We use the unique
locator of one element up

2160
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:49,280
or down.

2161
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:50,240
Exactly. Yes.

2162
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:53,160
This is what we do. Right.

2163
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:58,880
All right, guys, any questions?

2164
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:01,960
Any questions on following and preceding

2165
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:22,760
siblings?

2166
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:24,960
Clear. Okay, good.

2167
02:18:24,960 --> 02:18:25,760
All right.

2168
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:29,680
So now let's move to the parents.

2169
02:18:30,480 --> 02:18:33,560
Okay.

2170
02:18:33,560 --> 02:18:35,680
So copy this

2171
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:39,760
piece by

2172
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,600
point.

2173
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:45,360
Okay.

2174
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:48,120
So this is going to be the same syntax,

2175
02:18:48,480 --> 02:18:51,760
but what we're going to do,
we're going to change the little, right?

2176
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:54,920
So it's not going to be preceding
sibling anymore.

2177
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:57,240
It's going to be parents.

2178
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:04,480
Right? Yes.

2179
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:06,480
I told you guys last week. Right.

2180
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:09,480
So it's going to be a little intense.
Okay.

2181
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:13,680
And know that it's a little bit confusing,
but you just need practice.

2182
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:14,520
Okay, guys.

2183
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:18,000
And it's all going to be all right.

2184
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:18,600
Okay.

2185
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:21,800
But here is tag name.

2186
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:22,840
But this is a

2187
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:24,520
parent.

2188
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:25,520
Tag me.

2189
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:28,200
Okay. All right.

2190
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:31,360
So now let's move here. Okay.

2191
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:34,080
So what if

2192
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:42,000
I want to identify this element's parent?

2193
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:44,360
What is my parent right now in this case?

2194
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:54,000
Guys, the tag, Right?

2195
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:56,360
So if you look in here.

2196
02:19:56,360 --> 02:19:58,680
So if I collapse this, right,

2197
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:02,800
if I collapse this,
you can see that they're gone.

2198
02:20:03,080 --> 02:20:06,960
So this the upper node,

2199
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:09,680
which is your element within,

2200
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:12,680
is going to be your parent.

2201
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:14,040
Okay. Yes, exactly.

2202
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:18,960
Span is inside a so here,
if I want to identify that element,

2203
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,680
what I can do is slash

2204
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:24,640
parent

2205
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:28,800
and then double colon again

2206
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:32,080
and the parent tag name is a right.

2207
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:36,520
If you do this,
then you can see that it is highlighting

2208
02:20:36,520 --> 02:20:39,520
that parent element.

2209
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:42,000
Okay.

2210
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,960
Any questions on this, guys?

2211
02:20:43,960 --> 02:20:53,400
Any confusion?

2212
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:56,920
Oh, good.

2213
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:57,400
Correct.

2214
02:20:57,400 --> 02:21:04,120
This is going from child to the parent.

2215
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:04,440
Okay.

2216
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:08,360
So if you want to go from parent
to the child, what you can do

2217
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:12,920
is remember that absolute expert
that's in absolute X spot.

2218
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:13,760
What are we doing?

2219
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:17,040
We're only moving forward, right?

2220
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:18,480
So you don't have to do anything.

2221
02:21:18,480 --> 02:21:22,200
You can just put a slash
and move to the next one.

2222
02:21:22,480 --> 02:21:24,920
So where is that?

2223
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:28,400
So in the first acts of with X back
when we were talking about it,

2224
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:33,240
so body
is what body is child of your HTML?

2225
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:34,920
Right.

2226
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:38,400
So this div is the child of your body.

2227
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:42,160
Okay,
so there's nothing like different keywords

2228
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:45,920
for moving from parent to the child
where if you want to move

2229
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:50,760
from child to the parent,
then you have to have an advanced X path.

2230
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:51,120
Okay?

2231
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:57,720
Each slash is a move forward.

2232
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:01,520
Absolutely right.

2233
02:22:01,520 --> 02:22:02,080
Okay.

2234
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:05,760
So let me

2235
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:09,600
copy this and

2236
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:12,760
things here.

2237
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:15,200
So now let me show you

2238
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:18,840
the one for ancestors.

2239
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:20,560
Okay?

2240
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:24,480
Copy.

2241
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:32,320
Yeah.

2242
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:36,040
Copy this as well.

2243
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:37,840
So it is exactly the same.

2244
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:41,920
But instead of going to the parent
tag name, you want to go

2245
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:49,240
answer in here
and the ancestor tag name in here.

2246
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:52,320
So what is considered to be ancestor guys?

2247
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:59,880
Does anyone have an idea?

2248
02:22:59,880 --> 02:23:01,920
So it's above the parent?

2249
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:03,640
Absolutely right.

2250
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:08,160
So if you see anything above the parent,
okay, that's going to be your ancestor.

2251
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:12,200
Okay, so grandfather, grand grandfather

2252
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:15,920
or whatever, is that So here,

2253
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:18,840
let me last this one.

2254
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:24,440
So for this span,
what can be our ancestor guys?

2255
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:28,560
So my tag,
if my eight tag is my parent, right?

2256
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:31,200
So it can

2257
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:35,160
be the div
in here or it can be the division here.

2258
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:35,840
Right.

2259
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:39,960
So let's actually go here.

2260
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:40,760
Okay.

2261
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:47,880
So in Facebook,
let's identify one of these.

2262
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:52,160
So okay.

2263
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:52,600
All right.

2264
02:23:52,600 --> 02:23:56,360
So let's do this, the email textbox.

2265
02:23:56,360 --> 02:24:02,520
And here let's, let's identify
this email textbox first.

2266
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:03,600
Okay.

2267
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:06,240
So double slash input

2268
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:09,920
and square brackets.

2269
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:12,240
You can use ID in here. That is fine.

2270
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:14,760
Is equal to

2271
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:17,800
email.

2272
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:19,920
Right. So now I have this.

2273
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:21,800
This is unique.

2274
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:34,080
So in here, what is my parent guys?

2275
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:34,720
My parents.

2276
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:37,680
My parent is the division, right?

2277
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:41,280
And my ancestor

2278
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:44,600
can be above my parent, right?

2279
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:49,160
So we have a div in here
and we also have the form.

2280
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:52,800
So what I can do in here I can do

2281
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:56,840
slash and

2282
02:24:56,840 --> 02:25:00,600
then ancestor double call.

2283
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:04,520
And again let's put a form in here
and you can see that

2284
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:09,640
it is going to highlight our ancestor
or anything

2285
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:15,000
with the form tag
which is above my parent.

2286
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:18,640
Okay, is this clear, guys, any questions

2287
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:19,560
on this

2288
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:25,280
Again, guys,

2289
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:30,120
anything above your parent in HTML

2290
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:33,160
will be considered as your ancestor?

2291
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:36,240
Okay,

2292
02:25:36,240 --> 02:25:39,640
so I'm just going to copy this back here.

2293
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:43,600
Is this here?

2294
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:47,720
Okay.

2295
02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:51,600
So now, guys.

2296
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:54,520
Exactly. All of us,
all of this are the same.

2297
02:25:54,520 --> 02:26:00,240
It's just up to you
how you want to move through the HTML.

2298
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:00,920
If you want to move

2299
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:04,760
forward to your sibling or
you want to move to the preceding sibling,

2300
02:26:04,760 --> 02:26:09,400
you want to move to the parent, it's
all up to the age, similarly all up to you

2301
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:12,120
how you want to identify your element.

2302
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:17,600
Okay, let's write a div.

2303
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:23,720
Okay, so let's do instead of form,
let's see a division. Enter.

2304
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:27,480
So instead of so if I do I ancestor as div

2305
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:33,160
it will identify the very first one,
the very one at the top.

2306
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:33,880
Okay.

2307
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:37,400
Because we said that your
ancestor will be considered

2308
02:26:38,400 --> 02:26:40,080
what's called

2309
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:42,560
above your parent.

2310
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,000
Okay.

2311
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,720
So that's why it will go as high,

2312
02:26:48,240 --> 02:27:00,520
as high as possible
to the first division, correct?

2313
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:00,920
Yeah.

2314
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:03,440
We are identifying the parent
and ancestors.

2315
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:04,080
Right.

2316
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:11,040
Or we could just put identifying elements.

2317
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:12,840
Elements, ancestors.

2318
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:18,040
All right.

2319
02:27:18,040 --> 02:27:30,120
And parents.

2320
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:34,640
So all the other divisions that you have,
they will be ancestors.

2321
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:39,280
But if you just put the in here
as ancestor,

2322
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:42,760
it will identify
the very first one at the top.

2323
02:27:43,880 --> 02:27:48,440
Okay.

2324
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:52,600
For the specific one,
you can use the indexing or just slash

2325
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:53,920
by slash, right?

2326
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:56,160
So can put another slash in the division.

2327
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:58,800
It will go on and go on.

2328
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:04,720
Okay.

2329
02:28:04,720 --> 02:28:07,080
Or you can do this. I don't know. Yeah.

2330
02:28:07,160 --> 02:28:09,560
If you do Div three, it's going

2331
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:12,240
to another way.

2332
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:18,200
Okay.

2333
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:19,600
Any questions? Class

2334
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:27,640
with this form?

2335
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:29,920
It's not them. We can go but exactly.

2336
02:28:29,960 --> 02:28:33,720
So first you need to go
and find out the element which is unique.

2337
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:38,080
And then from there,
which is really close to the element

2338
02:28:38,080 --> 02:28:41,000
that you want to find out
that you want to locate.

2339
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:44,080
And then going from there,

2340
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:47,640
if it's sibling or if it's parent,
whatever it is,

2341
02:28:47,960 --> 02:28:51,400
that way you can identify and use advance,

2342
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:55,920
okay.

2343
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:56,840
All right.

2344
02:28:56,840 --> 02:29:00,720
So let me show you

2345
02:29:02,040 --> 02:29:05,080
identifying elements by indexing.

2346
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:05,440
Okay.

2347
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:09,800
Now, so if we go actually here.

2348
02:29:09,960 --> 02:29:13,480
Okay, So we had two classes in here right?

2349
02:29:13,480 --> 02:29:18,680
So what we have is still I am g

2350
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:22,560
at class is equal to

2351
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:29,600
copy and paste in here.

2352
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:30,600
Right.

2353
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:33,240
Okay. All right, guys.

2354
02:29:33,240 --> 02:29:37,560
So here
we have two different elements, right?

2355
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:40,440
If you don't have an option to use

2356
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:43,880
preceding or following siblings

2357
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:48,480
or parents forms, ancestors,
anything like that,

2358
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:53,640
only then you can go and the indexing.

2359
02:29:54,360 --> 02:29:57,560
Okay, So if I do it here

2360
02:29:59,160 --> 02:30:00,760
and I put two in,

2361
02:30:00,760 --> 02:30:03,600
in between those square brackets,

2362
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:06,800
which element is going to identify

2363
02:30:06,800 --> 02:30:15,720
guys?

2364
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:20,320
Any thoughts?

2365
02:30:20,320 --> 02:30:23,760
So if I put two in here
would identify the second

2366
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:34,480
element?

2367
02:30:34,480 --> 02:30:38,480
No. Why?

2368
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:40,720
So let's do this. I put two in here.

2369
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:44,960
Why did it not identify?

2370
02:30:44,960 --> 02:30:54,880
It didn't actually
it didn't identify any elements.

2371
02:30:54,880 --> 02:30:56,360
What's wrong in here, guys?

2372
02:30:56,360 --> 02:31:02,160
Any thoughts?

2373
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:05,160
No tag. Okay, That's that.

2374
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:08,400
That's very close. Yes.

2375
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:12,120
What I do to identify the second

2376
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,240
the second calendar in here

2377
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:20,320
by using the index,

2378
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:24,400
because we're using an index in here
and it's not seems like it's not working

2379
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:33,440
at class two.

2380
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:38,560
Let's
let's see if this is going to work, too.

2381
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:40,080
This is not working.

2382
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:42,360
All right.

2383
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:43,480
Okay, let's see.

2384
02:31:43,480 --> 02:31:44,720
Image two.

2385
02:31:44,720 --> 02:31:49,560
Okay.

2386
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:53,880
Image two is not working, guys,

2387
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:59,880
any other thoughts?

2388
02:31:59,880 --> 02:32:08,440
See, they start from one.

2389
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:13,320
And here.

2390
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:18,800
Okay, guys, in here, what we need to do,
we need to go.

2391
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:22,240
So since like in here,
don't have a tag, right?

2392
02:32:22,240 --> 02:32:24,240
So that we can go to the second one.

2393
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:29,400
We need to get this whole element

2394
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:33,280
into the container here.

2395
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:37,520
Only then
we can identify the second element.

2396
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,360
So how I'm going to do this,
It's pretty easy.

2397
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:43,800
So I'm going to take this whole element

2398
02:32:46,400 --> 02:32:49,440
inside the parentheses
and what I'm going to do

2399
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:53,400
with the square brackets,
and I'm going to put two.

2400
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:57,080
Okay, So now I identify

2401
02:32:57,320 --> 02:33:01,440
the second calendar image on my page

2402
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:06,000
by getting the whole element
inside container

2403
02:33:06,520 --> 02:33:10,240
and then specifying its index.

2404
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:16,360
Okay, So before guys,

2405
02:33:16,400 --> 02:33:21,520
when we did this, where was this?

2406
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:27,400
Yeah, when we did this absolute X plus,
we can put two or three in here

2407
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:28,440
and this is going to work

2408
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:32,120
because it's going to look the data
for this third division only.

2409
02:33:33,080 --> 02:33:36,320
But here you getting the whole element

2410
02:33:36,800 --> 02:33:40,960
and you need to put it into the container
and then specify

2411
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:45,200
which element you're looking for.

2412
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:45,960
Okay.

2413
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:57,600
Any questions on this?

2414
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:59,520
Let's get back

2415
02:34:03,480 --> 02:34:05,680
identifying element

2416
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:11,520
by the area

2417
02:34:21,400 --> 02:34:24,960
you have, which is

2418
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:31,000
you mean the HTML code has bugs?

2419
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,600
Now, the HTML code will never
have a bug, right?

2420
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:34,760
Because

2421
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:37,920
this is how it's written and

2422
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:41,520
it's our job to locate the elements.

2423
02:34:41,880 --> 02:34:42,480
Okay.

2424
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:45,280
If you are talking
that you can see the element

2425
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:49,840
and you can not see in the HTML,
then it's a defect.

2426
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:52,680
So that's that's a different story.

2427
02:34:53,160 --> 02:34:56,520
But usually, guys,

2428
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:59,280
most of the time you won't be able

2429
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:02,320
won't have any problems in HTML, okay?

2430
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:04,040
And you can't really go

2431
02:35:04,040 --> 02:35:07,800
and complain to developers,
Hey, you didn't put ID for this element

2432
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:11,160
or you didn't put name for this element
because this is how they built it.

2433
02:35:11,360 --> 02:35:16,440
And our responsibility is to manipulate
everything inside that HTML.

2434
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:29,680
Okay.

2435
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:30,640
Yes, you are.

2436
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:34,640
We are doing this to check bugs.

2437
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:36,400
Absolutely right.

2438
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:39,960
But we're not checking the HTML for bugs,
guys.

2439
02:35:40,240 --> 02:35:44,520
We're checking the functionality
of the web page for.

2440
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:46,520
Okay, so this is two different things.

2441
02:35:46,880 --> 02:35:51,160
So if I click on log
in, you can see it in the HTML,

2442
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:54,760
but if I don't log in, that's a problem.

2443
02:35:55,360 --> 02:35:56,000
Okay.

2444
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,480
So that's the defect of the functionality.

2445
02:36:00,160 --> 02:36:02,120
Is that clear now, guys?

2446
02:36:02,120 --> 02:36:05,400
So we're not checking the HTML for bugs,

2447
02:36:05,640 --> 02:36:13,800
we're checking the functionality
of the web page for bugs.

2448
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:14,600
Okay.

2449
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:17,920
Your HTML is only

2450
02:36:18,080 --> 02:36:22,680
it only helps you to identify
and perform actions.

2451
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:26,320
So if those actions fail and you don't

2452
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:30,960
get the expected result,
only then it is a defect.

2453
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:35,520
So if you don't see an ID
for some elements, it's not a defect.

2454
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:36,080
Okay?

2455
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:39,280
So you just have to manipulate
and go back and forth.

2456
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:48,520
Use X path, different ways
to locate those elements.

2457
02:36:48,520 --> 02:36:49,240
Okay.

2458
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:54,240
Any other questions?

2459
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:57,720
And the website is not built by the HTML
only.

2460
02:36:57,720 --> 02:36:58,600
Exactly.

2461
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:01,640
The website is built by h html.

2462
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:05,280
I'm not sure if it's filled
with JavaScript or any other ones,

2463
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:09,840
but I'm assuming it's
the frontend is filled with JavaScript

2464
02:37:10,640 --> 02:37:13,760
and the design is for it made with c ss.

2465
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:14,480
Okay.

2466
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:18,520
So if you have frontend developer,
you're going to be using HTML, CSS

2467
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:22,880
and JavaScript or whatever you're using.

2468
02:37:23,520 --> 02:37:26,840
Okay, So JavaScript will build
your functionality.

2469
02:37:28,480 --> 02:37:31,640
H HTML will give you all the attributes.

2470
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:34,040
See us, we'll give you the styling.

2471
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:39,840
Okay,
This is how it works through the front.

2472
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:43,200
Is that clear, guys?

2473
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:47,400
Any questions?

2474
02:37:47,400 --> 02:37:53,560
So there was a lot of information
to today.

2475
02:37:53,560 --> 02:38:01,200
There's a lot of notes here.

2476
02:38:01,200 --> 02:38:11,280
Any other questions?

2477
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:13,880
Brian Fries Yes, exactly.

2478
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:19,160
Told you guys it's
going to be a little intense,

2479
02:38:19,160 --> 02:38:21,600
but tomorrow
we're going to have more fun, guys. Okay.

2480
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:24,600
I promise Tomorrow
we're going to have different topics

2481
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:31,920
and it's going to be more fun.

2482
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:35,760
All right.

2483
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:37,760
Yeah. I want you guys okay.

2484
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:41,080
Is it Asgard fun?

2485
02:38:41,080 --> 02:38:42,960
No, no, no. It's my, my, my fun.

2486
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:52,960
Okay, so it's going to be fun.

2487
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:53,920
Okay.

2488
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:59,520
All right, guys, any questions?

2489
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:01,560
We're going to have a pizza party.
I'm not sure, guys.

2490
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:02,560
I don't know

2491
02:39:05,160 --> 02:39:07,840
who's inviting where

2492
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:18,240
can you go back?

2493
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:20,960
Dying?
Not yet. Okay, just a little more. Okay.

2494
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:21,840
When I get.

2495
02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:24,800
Let me give you the homework and then.

2496
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:25,520
And then you can.

2497
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:29,560
That's fun.

2498
02:39:29,560 --> 02:39:32,400
Little Caesars on me. Sure, sure.

2499
02:39:32,400 --> 02:39:41,360
If you find a job in two weeks, then yes.

2500
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:43,440
Okay. This is recorded, guys, Just.

2501
02:39:43,440 --> 02:39:44,960
Just for information.

2502
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:45,640
Okay?

2503
02:39:45,640 --> 02:39:46,840
This is.

2504
02:39:46,840 --> 02:39:48,840
You can show it to me if.

2505
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:51,360
Michael,
if you find your job in two weeks,

2506
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:57,360
I'm getting you a pizza.

2507
02:39:57,360 --> 02:39:57,960
There you go.

2508
02:39:57,960 --> 02:40:08,560
What a motivation.

2509
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:10,200
Just Michael, though. Yeah.

2510
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:11,760
Okay. There you go.

2511
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:14,080
Class three recording. Exactly.

2512
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:18,000
Yes. Okay.

2513
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:21,920
Yes, I'll push the code
if there's no questions, guys.

2514
02:40:21,920 --> 02:40:24,160
Okay, Let me give you the homework.

2515
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:26,840
Okay.

2516
02:40:26,840 --> 02:40:30,080
I'm pretty sure you are excited
for the homework, right?

2517
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:32,040
Because we didn't really

2518
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:39,560
do much to do.

2519
02:40:39,560 --> 02:40:42,880
All right, So let me just.

2520
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:45,480
Students. All right.

2521
02:40:46,560 --> 02:40:50,480
So yesterday
was a lot of theoretical work.

2522
02:40:50,760 --> 02:40:54,960
As I said, I don't like this theoretical
stuff myself because it's pretty boring.

2523
02:40:54,960 --> 02:40:56,560
Okay, But,

2524
02:40:56,560 --> 02:41:01,080
well, we have to go through it first
so that we can start implementing stuff.

2525
02:41:01,080 --> 02:41:01,840
Okay.

2526
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:04,960
We use any unique locators?

2527
02:41:05,720 --> 02:41:06,600
Yeah, absolutely.

2528
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:10,080
Guys,
you can use any unique locator instead of.

2529
02:41:10,560 --> 02:41:15,160
Yes. Okay,

2530
02:41:15,160 --> 02:41:18,120
So let me tell you this.

2531
02:41:18,160 --> 02:41:20,320
Go in here

2532
02:41:21,360 --> 02:41:22,920
is here

2533
02:41:25,200 --> 02:41:26,920
o in your in the homework.

2534
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:27,520
No, no, no.

2535
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:32,880
In homework guys try to use X path.

2536
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:36,600
I want you to use that
as much as possible for this homework.

2537
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:38,040
Okay.

2538
02:41:38,040 --> 02:41:41,000
And guys,
I'm going to warn you for this homework.

2539
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,480
There is a trick for this homework.

2540
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:52,320
Okay, So let's
see if you can come up with ideas.

2541
02:41:52,320 --> 02:41:57,080
Okay, So what I want you to do
guys in here, so navigate to this side.

2542
02:41:57,080 --> 02:42:00,240
Okay? Click. Start practicing.

2543
02:42:01,920 --> 02:42:06,080
Okay, So I can start practicing.

2544
02:42:06,280 --> 02:42:09,360
This is going to open up, click on simple

2545
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:12,600
form demo.

2546
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:13,480
Okay,

2547
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:16,960
You click on simple form demo,

2548
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:21,240
you enter a message in here,
click on show message.

2549
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:24,680
You the browser.

2550
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:26,120
This will be easier, right?

2551
02:42:26,120 --> 02:42:28,680
Okay, let's see.

2552
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:32,400
Let's see.

2553
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:33,840
Okay, cool down. Yes, guys.

2554
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:38,440
So get a break.

2555
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:40,560
It is easy, but not with x path.

2556
02:42:40,560 --> 02:42:42,280
Okay, let's see, guys.

2557
02:42:42,280 --> 02:42:45,400
Let's see if you if you
if you have any stoppers in here.

2558
02:42:45,400 --> 02:42:46,200
Okay.

2559
02:42:46,200 --> 02:42:49,760
So I want there it should be
it should be a tricky task in here.

2560
02:42:50,240 --> 02:42:50,960
Okay.

2561
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:59,200
But let's see if you can overcome this
for tomorrow.

2562
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:00,000
Like, super easy.

2563
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,320
Yes, right.

2564
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:06,320
Would be would be super not easy.

2565
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:06,560
Yeah.

2566
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:10,320
I'll sent this homework
actually in the course announcements.

2567
02:43:10,400 --> 02:43:18,920
Okay.

2568
02:43:18,920 --> 02:43:19,400
There you go.

2569
02:43:19,400 --> 02:43:21,760
I just sent it to course
analysis of particular.

2570
02:43:22,160 --> 02:43:24,000
Okay.

2571
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,080
Does it, does it need idea.

2572
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:28,880
So No, no, no.
This it does give me that idea

2573
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:32,680
kind of rap battle.

2574
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:33,680
No I'm bad at that.

2575
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:39,000
Okay.

2576
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:40,200
I'm bad

2577
02:43:44,160 --> 02:43:45,080
notes here.

2578
02:43:45,080 --> 02:43:46,640
I'm going to push them right now. Okay.

2579
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:48,720
Right after the class.

2580
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:55,720
Okay, guys.

2581
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:56,280
All right.

2582
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:57,520
If there's no questions.

2583
02:43:57,520 --> 02:43:59,720
Yes, we can wrap it up. Guys.

2584
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:04,040
I'm pretty sure you guys are all tired.

2585
02:44:04,040 --> 02:44:06,840
If no questions, then we can wrap it up.

2586
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:11,640
Okay.

2587
02:44:11,640 --> 02:44:12,840
Thank you, guys.

2588
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:14,360
I hope

2589
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:17,600
you guys practice.

2590
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:18,040
Okay?

2591
02:44:18,040 --> 02:44:21,440
Please try to complete the homework

2592
02:44:21,440 --> 02:44:22,440
for tomorrow. Guys.

2593
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:25,920
For tomorrow,
please take a look at CCS selector

2594
02:44:26,680 --> 02:44:30,160
and please take a look at web element
commands.

2595
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:33,960
Okay.

2596
02:44:33,960 --> 02:44:36,400
Tomorrow is going to be more fun, guys.
I promise.

2597
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:38,400
Okay. It's not going to be like this
tomorrow.

2598
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:43,120
We'll have more implementation
and have more automated stuff.

2599
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:44,280
Okay.

2600
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:48,120
I am from Tajikistan. Yes.

2601
02:44:52,040 --> 02:44:55,080
All right.

2602
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:57,200
The commands
know there are different commands.

2603
02:44:57,200 --> 02:45:00,440
They are web element commands.

2604
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:04,360
All right, guys,

2605
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:05,680
have a good night.

2606
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:08,600
Stay safe and please keep practicing.

2607
02:45:08,680 --> 02:45:09,000
Okay?

2608
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:12,360
I'll push the code
right after in 5 minutes.

2609
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:15,120
Okay.

2610
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:16,560
All right.

2611
02:45:16,560 --> 02:45:17,400
Thanks, everybody.

2612
02:45:17,400 --> 02:45:20,520
Good night. And stay safe.

2613
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:22,920
Bye bye.
