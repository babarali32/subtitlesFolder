1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,960
All right.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,120
So yesterday
we have gone through a couple of concepts.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Today, we will do a quick recap
of all those concepts.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,560
Right.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,640
And as we can see, a lot of students

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,680
had some problems
understanding their data provider concept.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,560
So we will go through this data provider
concept once again.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,240
I gave you one task yesterday.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,720
We will start with that task.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,120
We will complete that
task for data provided.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,120
And then we do it again.

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,560
And then we will start our new topic
for today.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,960
Yeah. And right.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,040
So that homework
we are going to go through now.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,240
So liquid

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,120
take this homework
first from the announcing

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,720
and let me create

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:02:08,520
another package here.

20
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,960
This was their task maintenance.

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
What was the question basically is

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,160
we have to add one employee or

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,600
we have to add five employees in our h.r.

24
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,720
And this application. Right.

25
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,600
So now let's explore this functionality
first in the application manually,

26
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,200
and then we'll decide which approach
we need to go with.

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:40,800
Right.

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
And which approach would be the best to
implement the solution for this question.

29
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,680
Okay.

30
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,000
So it is always the best idea
to explore the application manually.

31
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,720
So what I'm going to do is to add

32
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,440
we have to log in with which
credential states to add a new employee.

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,040
Can I add new employee
with any credential logging?

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,000
No. Right.

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,040
We have to log in via admin.

36
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:25,640
So let me write admin.

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,360
Now, to add an employee,
what we have to do is

38
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,880
we have to go in the PIM option

39
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,040
add employee.

40
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,320
Correct.

41
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,880
Here.

42
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,760
Here are the parameters
which I need to pass is false to me.

43
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,200
Middle name,

44
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,040
last name, place and my native thing.

45
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,160
So firstname, lastname.

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,360
So things like.

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,520
And after this,

48
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,280
click here

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,680
username

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,480
password and confirm password.

51
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,480
How many states employ ID is something
which is given by default.

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
If we need to add manually

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,240
or automation, we have to clear it first
and then we have to add.

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,960
But for now we will going to pass
the false name last name

55
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,240
username, password and confirm password.

56
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,160
Correct.

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,600
How many police guys

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
I have to fill here to add one employee
five things.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,600
Right?

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,200
And then I have to click on save option.

61
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,200
That's one.

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,800
There's some. Correct.

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,600
So let's do it one by one. First

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,360
I have to log in.

65
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,040
I have to click on this name option.

66
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,040
After this name option,
I have to click on an employee

67
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,240
and inside an employee I have to ID

68
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,080
all of these be their data
related to this group.

69
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,840
So let's create this class first.

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,960
Now, when I have to add this access,
add five different employees and create

71
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,040
login credentials
by activating first name,

72
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,960
last name, username and password.

73
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,200
So five different employee values.

74
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,840
Yesterday we discussed one concept
How can we send

75
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,000
five different types of data in this task?

76
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,720
Which concept we have to use

77
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,160
data provider.

78
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
Correct.

79
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,760
So we are going to use this data provider
concept here

80
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,600
for data driven testing, obviously.

81
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,360
So let's start writing this test.

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,840
Guess what I'm going to write. It is

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,680
that driver

84
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,440
driver being late

85
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,160
after closed browser,
there is one more step.

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,840
All right.

87
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,400
What is that?

88
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,800
Can you please tell me

89
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,160
for sure

90
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,720
specify a group?

91
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,240
All right. So let's see.

92
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,080
This is this is the part of your smoke
testing, for example.

93
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,640
Right.

94
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,880
So we will going to execute it
from on best candidate

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,320
exam and fight.

96
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,080
Now, one by one,
we will do all these things

97
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,320
to implement a data provider
concept, Right?

98
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,360
Again, I'm
repeating their data for later concepts.

99
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,880
Right.

100
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,600
So this time, guys,
if you don't understand,

101
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
interrupt me, stop me
and ask the question.

102
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,600
Please don't take white.

103
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,480
Please ask the question
if you don't understand.

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Now, for five employees dates,

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,680
first thing for five employees,
what is the status?

106
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,720
What would be the size
of my data provider, which I need to

107
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:19,040
provide given?

108
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,040
Okay.

109
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,560
Then either because they are discussing
about data provider concept, right?

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,080
So we are not extending anything
as of now.

111
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
Yes. Started this
what I did in the data provider class.

112
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,040
Right.

113
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,080
I removed this.

114
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,640
Your part of data provider.

115
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,720
I removed your part of the condition,

116
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,000
enforced condition
and I extended common methods there.

117
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,120
Then someone posted that

118
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
we are not using this data provider
like this and complained.

119
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,920
So that's why right now
I am going forward, Right?

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,360
I'm going forward with this concept.

121
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,880
Okay.

122
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,040
And then after this,
I will tell you how we can improve

123
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,480
by using audio for your audience package.

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,760
Now, let's remember,

125
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,480
question is here,
if you go in the application,

126
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,400
this strict rules are mandatory, right?

127
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,800
So now see in this mandatory fields,
how many fields I have first name,

128
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,600
last name,

129
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,800
user name, password and confirm password.

130
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,920
How many things guys

131
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,640
I write and for

132
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,840
how many employees I have to define my
I have to define my any.

133
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,240
Now, what would be the length of my data
provider

134
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,680
fireplace.

135
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,520
Correct

136
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,400
plan how it would be five
four on what parameters you are staying

137
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,240
five four send me

138
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
this would be this should be five five.

139
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,360
Okay.

140
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,760
So let's implementation
now see guys I'm going to write here eight

141
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,920
data provided by because this is mine.

142
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,200
Yeah, exactly.

143
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,240
But these are the two different
fields, right?

144
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,080
So we have to parse this data
from two different things

145
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,280
because meetings are different.

146
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,360
At one time you will pass via one string,
which is string.

147
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,160
The string is password.

148
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,480
At one time
you are passing by than phone password.

149
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,160
All right.

150
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,120
Now let's consider this. Consider this.

151
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,280
If you have two different methods
where you are calling this situation.

152
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,520
Okay? Yes.

153
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,000
So here, how are you verifying
you're in which in which line you're

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,400
passing password and individual line
you're passing confirm password.

155
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,960
If you have two different methods,
what do you have to do?

156
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,480
Basically

157
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,040
in one method
where you are just entering the password,

158
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,160
When you have to send the string password
in another

159
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,920
method, you have to pass a string, confirm
password.

160
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,760
Right.

161
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,920
Even though the data is same,
but the fees are different, right?

162
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,680
So you should convey the different feeds
by different strings.

163
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,680
This is this.

164
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:53,720
These are the standards
of coding, correct?

165
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,600
Currently we have,
I think, everything in a single method,

166
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,280
everything we have.

167
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,480
I think enough single method.

168
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,520
So you are passing
five strings inside one field, Correct.

169
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:14,280
But but if you're passing.

170
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,680
Yeah, that's
what I'm trying to expand right now.

171
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,920
We are writing just one method,
so we are passing five.

172
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,080
Method five is printing a single method.

173
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,760
Now if you have five different methods,
like for example, first is into

174
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,640
the username, second is enter password
thirties, enter, confirm password.

175
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
Now in this particular function
video passing enter

176
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,880
confirm password
and you're passing a string password.

177
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,880
Right?

178
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,120
Is this correct with your passing
the famous enter

179
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,080
password
method is enter confirm password method.

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,720
These are against the standards.

181
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,160
Write in instead of username method.

182
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,200
You're passing the string username
into the password method of passing.

183
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
Enter password makes sense.

184
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,160
Enter confirm password method Your passing
Enter password or a string password.

185
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,760
Is it correct

186
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,360
that data

187
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,400
you are placing it
one place right beside the string?

188
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,640
The key
you are showing right your showing.

189
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,720
So if you are showing password

190
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,640
for confirm password
and confirm password for password.

191
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,920
So why does it make sense?

192
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,160
No, it doesn't make sense. Right.

193
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,720
That's why even though the data
is same in password and confirm password,

194
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,720
we have to take two keys here in the data
operator part.

195
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,400
It should be self explanatory.

196
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:55,440
You don't need to put efforts here.

197
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,840
All right, let me make it now.

198
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,720
The data provider part first.

199
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,840
So now tell me, guys, which parent class

200
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,440
we called yesterday.

201
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,040
Yeah. And it should be self
extended to make, right?

202
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,200
If you're passing one parameter,
then some password,

203
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,360
then the reader of your code
will understand that you're passing.

204
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
Confirm password. Be right.

205
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,480
But if the reader of your code
is your client or customer,

206
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,280
and if you show this code to your customer
and it says already there are two

207
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,120
methods, enter a password, be Vincent,
enter, confirm password details.

208
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,720
But in both this method
you're passing the data from same thing.

209
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,120
The string password.

210
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,440
The string password in both the methods.

211
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,040
How it works. Right?

212
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,720
How can you pass like this? Right.

213
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,320
There will be a question.

214
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,640
I'm not saying the data is different.
Data is same.

215
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,200
I know that.

216
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,040
Even I know.

217
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,920
But still we have to pass through
different parameters in two

218
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,040
different methods.

219
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,760
Then we will work on the framework, right?

220
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,240
That you will understand.

221
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,320
Therefore, each and every functionality
we write different methods

222
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,520
and there we parse differences
and different parameters

223
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,240
according to the method.

224
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,560
According to the function,
we pass different parameters.

225
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,640
All right, so we parsed the index object.

226
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,400
This is my pattern.

227
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,280
Static.

228
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,720
So I'm going to write this time.

229
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,240
My data provider name is and

230
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,120
employee data.

231
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Is this correct?

232
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,920
Now, the next thing is I'm going
to define my

233
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
utility. Right?

234
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,480
We have already discussed

235
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,480
Andre, if you want to use one parameter
you can use,

236
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,560
but then if you work in the framework,
it will be a problem for you.

237
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,200
If you work in the same industry,

238
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,440
they will not accept your same parameter
for multiple figs.

239
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,200
All right.

240
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
There is a meeting in the company.

241
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,840
Remember guys,
our technical architecture review meeting

242
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,040
in this meeting
and technical architecture review meeting,

243
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,240
if you pass this kind of parameters,
if you write your code again and again,

244
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,640
if there is a mismanagement in your code
writing, one

245
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,280
architect observes your entire framework
every quarter

246
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,720
after the completion of every quarter,
you have to go through this process.

247
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,760
Technical architecture review meeting.

248
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,200
There you will get this table points
that, Hey, you are passing in

249
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,480
the password string while you're passing.

250
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,000
This is not the machine, right?

251
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,040
Your key should be self-explanatory.

252
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,360
And if you think as a professional
that there are high chances

253
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,040
or there is a room for possible typo,
then why are you writing the code?

254
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,080
Right?

255
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,840
Technical architect will give you reviews
like this.

256
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,120
Getting my point
according to the standards.

257
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,400
According to the process, I'm
explaining the things

258
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
already, guys.

259
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,960
So now remember in yesterday's class

260
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,000
I told you back in data provider

261
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,120
we used to the editor correct

262
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,720
the students who they are

263
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,400
not getting to the error
we are using in our data provider.

264
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,680
So now I am going to define

265
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,520
this object as mine.

266
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,080
The data

267
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,840
new object.

268
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,480
Now what is the size of my error?

269
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,280
Because I have five employees
in five fields, so it would be five

270
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:04,520
five, correct.

271
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:11,040
Now when I say five five,
what does it mean?

272
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,800
Five rules and five columns.

273
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,000
Five rules and five columns. Right.

274
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,240
So who fill the data to fill the data?

275
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,400
Do we need to maintain the order or not?

276
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
Yes, we need to maintain the order.

277
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,000
Right, in order to add the employee.

278
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,560
So let me do it.

279
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,120
I'm going to write four data

280
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,200
in my

281
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,440
very first rule and in first column.

282
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,600
Right.

283
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,800
What is the first data?

284
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,200
I'm going to put based on

285
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,520
my first name,

286
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,200
not username, write

287
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,440
my first name.

288
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,880
So let's see, I'm
going to take the name as

289
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
this one.

290
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,960
Correct.

291
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,040
And then

292
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm going to write for my

293
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,280
first rule, second column, Right.

294
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,360
My first rule, second column.

295
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,800
I'm going to write the data
as a last name.

296
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,160
So last name.

297
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
The exam writing is simple.

298
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Last name one eighth.

299
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,560
I'm trying to just make this data simple.

300
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,960
So instead of this,
I'm going to write first name

301
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,440
one and last name one. Also

302
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
now in the same place.

303
00:18:44,160 --> 00:19:13,080
Let me just copy this from here.

304
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:20,760
What is the third thing is user name. All

305
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,440
right.

306
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,920
So I'm going to write user

307
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,800
and then password, right?

308
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,800
So I'm going to write user, name one

309
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,200
and this would be my

310
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,160
password.

311
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,680
We will write for everyone the same.

312
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,280
And then again, think

313
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,720
why you don't use the B?

314
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,800
Because, Andre, this is the simplest way
to explain to all the students, right?

315
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,040
First, when every study right now

316
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,680
your colleagues are having a problem
understanding this structure.

317
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,320
So I am trying to explain them
the simplest one first

318
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,000
and then we will talk about the advanced
version.

319
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,560
Okay.

320
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,040
Now, this is for just one employee
that we have edited the data.

321
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,800
Correct.

322
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,480
But how many employees we have to edit

323
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,360
for five employees.

324
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,400
So here I'm going to write as

325
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:42,120
one. Now this would be my

326
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,400
first name taking

327
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,760
not names like end user name,
taking password

328
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,880
and confirm
password is always seem correct

329
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
now for my third employee

330
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,720
already is.

331
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,760
First tell me why I started from zero

332
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,480
and it starts from zero.

333
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,760
Right? Index always starts from zero.

334
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,280
So this is my index, right?

335
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,520
This is my index.

336
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,200
Index means
first position zero means first position.

337
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,880
First means second position.

338
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,600
Right.

339
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,640
Someone adds this question.

340
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,200
That's why I reminded that part.

341
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,520
So this is my index.

342
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,920
This is not my position.

343
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,000
Index defines my position. Zero indexing.

344
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,920
It means first position

345
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,280
right on the right and the correct.

346
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,320
We are going on to the advanced part
there.

347
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,440
I will explain all of this.

348
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
Things don't worry about it. Right.

349
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,000
Like I said, after the fourth month,
if you'll see right,

350
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,600
these are the things then
obviously you are going to.

351
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,440
But still, my priority is to keep
everyone on the same page.

352
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,760
At least the stations priority is this.

353
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,800
So please try to understand
that this is the way.

354
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,400
First, I have to explain this to everyone.

355
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,600
When everyone is on the same page, then
we will talk about the advanced portion.

356
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:40,080
All right, fine.

357
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,000
So far for the fourth employee, that is

358
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,560
the strategy.

359
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,160
Angel.

360
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,960
Guys, tell me,
how many of you guys are okay

361
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,680
with this structure
or do you want me to go

362
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,600
with the advanced, the structure,
what Andre is talking about?

363
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,640
Are you guys comfortable
with this position right now?

364
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:10,160
What we are doing here?

365
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:18,840
All right, fine.

366
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,280
So now let's do it.

367
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,400
This one and in the framework
will follow their demands.

368
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,840
Okay.

369
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,680
All right.

370
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:41,040
Now, let's talk about the last one here.

371
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,200
So now

372
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,080
it says here for the fourth employee,

373
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,520
fifth employee

374
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,640
in the end dies In the end.

375
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,360
What I'm expecting from this proper
method from this data provider,

376
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,760
what I'm expecting in the

377
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,520
we have to take

378
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,720
their data into the fight.

379
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,680
So this is my data provider
ready with me for this employee data.

380
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,280
Correct.

381
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,040
Now now this is the time.

382
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,920
This is the time when we are going to use

383
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,520
our data provider in our actual method.

384
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,080
All right.

385
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,680
In that actual method,
we are going to use it.

386
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,120
So let's write the function

387
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,360
first.

388
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,160
We will write both precondition and post
condition inside this particular part.

389
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,280
And after this we will extend the property
from common methods.

390
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
All right.

391
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,080
Since couple of you guys
didn't understand the concept, right?

392
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,000
How we have used the data provider,
I'm going to use.

393
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,840
Yes, we can use the same data provider
for even all the methods, as long as all

394
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,800
the parameters are available
in those functions.

395
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,240
We can use that.

396
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,520
All right.

397
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,720
So guys, can we copy this?

398
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,920
Your precondition and post condition
from any other class?

399
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,000
Can we do that here

400
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,280
in this precondition, post condition,
applicable

401
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:33,000
or not?

402
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,840
Alright,

403
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,680
so let's take any precondition from

404
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,880
from here.

405
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,520
Right? This is not a precondition.

406
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,720
So I'm taking it from soft assertion to

407
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,080
you can take this precondition
from any class you want.

408
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,240
And here I am writing my precondition
right

409
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,280
after this
I am taking my post condition as well.

410
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
So I'm going to take my

411
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,520
post condition

412
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,080
in between this

413
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,040
I have to write my actual function.

414
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,400
So what are

415
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,840
what are the task I have to achieve first?

416
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,640
Chrome browser open.
It's added this application log in.

417
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,680
So navigation today you are at this point
we have already in our precondition

418
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,000
right here the main thing
what we have to do is add five different

419
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,520
employees and create log
in credentials by providing this data

420
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,760
correct.

421
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,840
So this is the functionality
we have to implement in our framework now.

422
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,600
So I'm going to write it.

423
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,200
Yes, we write this part

424
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,120
public, right?

425
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,960
It would be see

426
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,160
add employee method

427
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,720
first.

428
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,560
Now when I'm passing the data
from my data provider class,

429
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,280
then I'm passing the data
from my data provider class.

430
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
What is the first thing I have to do?

431
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:47,960
Send me this.

432
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,000
If I want to use my data provider
in my actual test here, right?

433
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,120
So to use my data provider in this
particular test, what I have to do,

434
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:07,160
do I need to add something here?

435
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,720
We have to write here

436
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,320
data provider,
right in the name of data provider.

437
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:21,680
So what is the name of my data provider?

438
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,040
It is an employee data, correct.

439
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,880
And then the next thing,
the next thing it says your test right

440
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,000
is specify group
for this particular test gets.

441
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,320
So to add employee right to an employee,
you are testing something

442
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,600
very first time in the application.

443
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,880
You are trying to add some employee
in your application.

444
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:54,240
Which category would it be?

445
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,080
Okay if you're trying to test
some functionality in your application?

446
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,480
First time, which category would it be?

447
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,800
Which kind of test you're performing?

448
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,840
Is it smoke? Is it regulation?

449
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:16,320
What kind of test it is it?

450
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,400
All right. Let me ask another question.

451
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,320
Adding the employee in the application,
Adding

452
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,680
the employee in the application,
is it a key functionality,

453
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:37,720
critical functionality,
important functionality or not?

454
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,840
It is important functionality.

455
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,160
For example,
you're working in the organization, right?

456
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,000
And some employee came, one
employee came and joined the company.

457
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,240
Right?

458
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,200
But if your software is not working
and you're not able to add

459
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,800
that particular employee,
how would you generate the employee ID?

460
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,880
How would you give them all the documents?

461
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,440
IT right.

462
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,840
So it is a showstopper.

463
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,920
It is a blocker
in your application, correct?

464
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,600
If it is a block it in your application,
you always have to make sure

465
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,560
you always have to make sure

466
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,560
that your key functionality of application
is always working.

467
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,200
And when you perform this type of this,
you call it smoke based,

468
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,800
where you just make sure that the key
functionalities of your application

469
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,880
is working fine even though you're
testing it first, correct.

470
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,520
So it should be a part of your smoke
testing.

471
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,520
Also, it can be a part of regression
testing as well, right?

472
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,000
So you can pass both smoke integration
in the same group.

473
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,320
It's not an issue at all, but right now
I'm passing only for smoke one

474
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,600
or if you want to pass it
in regression one,

475
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,320
you can pass this test for regression
one as well.

476
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,720
Right now let's take it for smoke one.

477
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,760
Now we will try to implement.

478
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,160
So to add the employee, to add the employer, what is the first thing we have to do?

479
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,600
We have to log in by adding credentials.

480
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:06,480
Correct.

481
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:06,920
All right.

482
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:20,800
So let's take the data for admin
credentials.

483
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,480
I'm taking this data again
from my self position.

484
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,040
You can take it from anywhere, right?

485
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,840
We have so many classes that we have
this data already available.

486
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:39,440
I have passed this data here. Now,

487
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,480
if I want to use my data provider,

488
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,840
if I want to use my data provider in my
this particular method,

489
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,920
what is the best way to use

490
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,160
all the data
which is coming from the data provider?

491
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,520
In my method, what I have to do here and

492
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,040
in terms of what

493
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,040
we have to parse
the parameter static, right?

494
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,200
We have to parse the parameter.

495
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,680
So is either meters does see it

496
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,360
passing the parameter.

497
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,280
All right.

498
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,960
So according to the order,
according to the order,

499
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,840
what would be the first thing
I have to pass in terms of parameter here

500
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,520
it is your first name.

501
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,240
Correct.

502
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,920
And the format of your first name
is a string.

503
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,960
That's why passing it string.

504
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,840
All right,

505
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,600
then that's taken.

506
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,160
Would be your

507
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,680
last name.

508
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,440
And then the third one would be your

509
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,840
user name.

510
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,560
Correct.

511
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
And then the fourth one would be your

512
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,040
password,

513
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,560
and fifth one will be your

514
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,640
ten form password.

515
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,440
These are the five strings.

516
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,040
Right?

517
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,840
Handle my data, which is coming from here
from this five six

518
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,840
for every single employee, the data
which is coming from these five fields.

519
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,920
My application,
my method will handle this data

520
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,360
by add these parameters,
and then I will use this parameters

521
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,880
in my method
to use my data for weight of class.

522
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,640
All right,
So now let's implement the functionality

523
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,120
again.

524
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,200
Someone sent the code for this same
employee up in button

525
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,320
and the employee option if you guys have.

526
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,800
Otherwise we will verify this code.

527
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,360
What do you think?

528
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,800
Should we go ahead and verify

529
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,840
this for this?

530
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:55,200
Open it.

531
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,440
So first thing is

532
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,040
first thing here, after this code,

533
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,160
we don't have to enable
or disable anything, right?

534
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,320
We don't have to select anything
from here.

535
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,680
The status because we are simply opening
the five things

536
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,720
and clicking one save button.

537
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,680
So user password, user name,

538
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,000
checkbox state.

539
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,400
I hope this one is for checkbox.

540
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,000
Correct

541
00:35:31,800 --> 00:36:09,160
me this despite my

542
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,600
so the idea is correct.

543
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,000
Right?

544
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,040
We are using my check log in.

545
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,160
We are clicking on this point.

546
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,400
Now let's check whether we are passing
the correct spring or not.

547
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,040
This is my confirmed password,
which I have to pass

548
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,440
in my data here.

549
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,240
Point.

550
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,880
Now, I'm not writing.

551
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,320
I'm not providing any value in terms
of keys such as web element, user name.

552
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,560
I'm simply clicking, identifying
and then I'm simply clicking on the member

553
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,760
guys button task is available
here, which you have seen.

554
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,080
It says

555
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,640
Verify it employ

556
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,640
has been added successfully
and take the screenshot

557
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,120
right?

558
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,760
It says verify employee has been added
successfully and take the screenshot.

559
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,400
How would you verify?

560
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,200
Take a screenshot is something
we will learn in our framework.

561
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,880
Fine, but tell me how we can verify

562
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,640
that employee has been aged successfully.

563
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,960
How are you verifying this point?

564
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:27,560
Dates.

565
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:38,920
Any idea?

566
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,040
Right.
You're taking the created name? Fine.

567
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,840
So let's do it right.

568
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,320
Let's do it.

569
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,800
I'm just trying to pass some normal data.

570
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,000
Right?

571
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,760
Some raw data.

572
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,240
Yet my username would be say test 20101

573
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,720
password would be my each H&M 1 to 3

574
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:09,720
and then confirm password would be my.

575
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,760
Now when I click here on same option,
right when I click, you know

576
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,040
what happened?

577
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:43,760
Which questions?

578
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,080
Fine.

579
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,080
So now

580
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,800
if I go on prem and then an employee

581
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,680
after clicking here on an employee,
I will Right.

582
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,280
See test 0101

583
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,720
And my last name

584
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,040
would be state test last,

585
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,440
but it should be its first

586
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,960
the next year

587
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,480
my password

588
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,560
would be the 1 to 3

589
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,080
in confirm password.

590
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,200
Now if I click on this same option

591
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,240
employee, I exist

592
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:42,080
24 right.

593
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,600
Okay.

594
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,960
So let's take this post.

595
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Write the verify the employee option.

596
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,680
Right. Did a step we see before that.

597
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,000
Let's try to add five data because I'm
not sure whether it will take the data.

598
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,760
Again, it can say the same thing
that employed exist because every time,

599
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,400
even if I refresh, I'm
getting the same employee idea

600
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:02,680
a year.

601
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,040
Also, it was the same here.

602
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,960
Also it is the same.

603
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,480
Let me try just one more time.

604
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,680
Otherwise we will execute our step first,

605
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,320
not first,

606
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,520
and then accessible 39 one C2

607
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,520
Fine.

608
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,880
So here on this page it is redirecting us
on this particular page.

609
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,960
Couple of things right?

610
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,160
This is the free
and your false name and last name.

611
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,600
You can verify

612
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,680
all because in the question online,
if you'll see here in the question.

613
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,440
Right,

614
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,080
it is a five different

615
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,720
employee's right why passing
false name, last name, username, password,

616
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,720
income, bump password
since this field is already selected.

617
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,520
That's why we are not enable
or making a disabled.

618
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,640
We are not entering any employer
ID right the employee.

619
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,880
It is also free which is already there

620
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,560
and we are not adding them with
the name is but right.

621
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,320
So things
which are given here in the question,

622
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,040
we are just trying to get those things
correct.

623
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,440
Now you will be on this personal details
page.

624
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,200
So multiple points
from which you can verify dates.

625
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,760
Tell me the first thing is you can take
this one, the test post and last test.

626
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,640
What is this?

627
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,160
Your first name
and your last name appears on this page.

628
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,040
First verification checkpoint.

629
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,680
Second thing first, no details.

630
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,720
Heading page, Right.

631
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,160
This is also validation checkpoint.

632
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,720
Now like on this year one,

633
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,800
he took this one

634
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,920
create a name, text
this one the first name and the last name.

635
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,280
Correct.

636
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:18,880
Fine.

637
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,520
So now we will take this one

638
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,200
because this code you guys already have,
this is one validation checkpoint.

639
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,440
We will take this one.

640
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,880
So you will be heading to validation
checkpoint.

641
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,840
Great for your page.

642
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,240
So let's take this one
anyways, what you can see for this one.

643
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:44,280
Let me inspect this element first.

644
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,640
If I go here and select
this particular one,

645
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,360
tell me guys, what is the best way

646
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:58,040
to find this locator?

647
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,160
Because I don't have class,
I don't have name, I don't have I.D.,

648
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,680
I don't have any anchor date for the link
fixed, right?

649
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,200
I don't have any value.

650
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,000
The only thing
which I can see here is what?

651
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,440
Yes, I have fixed.

652
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,520
Now, let me ask let me check your access
knowledge as well.

653
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,760
If I want to execute my script

654
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,840
and I want to use locator, why this?

655
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,040
It means system selector cannot verify

656
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:32,880
beyond

657
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,800
that because when you are clicking on
same button,

658
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,520
your application is redirecting
your personal details page right?

659
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,520
If your I.D.

660
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,280
already exists,
it will never read your navigator.

661
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,840
The first thing you can split
it is the only successful scenario

662
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,600
when you're coming on the personal,
you can switch. Right?

663
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,360
And another point is because the
first one, everyone has this code, right?

664
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,680
So that's why
I'm trying to give them another validation

665
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,440
check point.

666
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,440
Getting my point.

667
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,960
So now tell me

668
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,720
in my case, can I find this locator?

669
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,960
I see a select

670
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,560
right because the asset selector doesn't

671
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:29,040
allow us to find a locator via text.

672
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,360
Andrey Again, I'm repeating my point.

673
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,920
This is the code everyone has.

674
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm trying to give them new code.

675
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,480
I'm trying to give them more validation
check point.

676
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,400
This is enough,
but it doesn't make sense. Right?

677
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,000
To copy the code and then if you want to
write this code, let me read this quote.

678
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,200
Then we are not going to verify
another locator.

679
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,280
That's fine.

680
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,200
I'm trying to explain something else.

681
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,480
Guys.

682
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,760
Do you want to write the previous code
or do you want to create a new code?

683
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,920
What do you want, guys?

684
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,480
Andrew You can use that code, right?

685
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,120
I will put that one as well.

686
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,360
I will put this one as well.

687
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,840
Both the verification and validation
check points I will keep.

688
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,800
All right.

689
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,760
Now, fine.

690
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,680
So let's see. See is this selector right?

691
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,280
This selector doesn't allow you
to find any locator via text menu.

692
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,000
So you have to go with only one option.

693
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,280
Which option is back, but correct.

694
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,720
You can find this locator X, but then how
we can rate the spot for this base,

695
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,520
double slash.

696
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,800
When I say double slash,
it is my absolute reality.

697
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
One customer is spot. Which one is this

698
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,480
big double

699
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:03,160
slash?

700
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,400
It is relative expatriate.

701
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,560
And then my big name right?

702
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:13,080
Can I use start
also a streak also instead of beginning.

703
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,800
Right.

704
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,640
And then since we are writing text
so we are not going to rate it right.

705
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,640
We are simply writing fixed parenthesis,

706
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,200
open and close and then my text value.

707
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,800
So my text menu is

708
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:29,680
correct.

709
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,960
Now it gives you two places,
personal details here,

710
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,480
personal details
here, right to place as it is here.

711
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,160
Also here. Also,

712
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,640
if I want to take this one right.

713
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,440
And if I want to take this one,
let's set this one the heading.

714
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,600
What if I want to take
so what I have to pass in this

715
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:55,760
case, as of now, the locator
which I'm having here,

716
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:07,440
will it work?

717
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,280
10 minutes

718
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,240
now. See, for

719
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,840
I'm going to pause the index.

720
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,560
I'm going to pause the index. Right.

721
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,560
So if I pass the index value here
next to the first,

722
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,520
then it will take only this one.

723
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,240
And if I want to take the second one,
then this one.

724
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,920
Right, this one.

725
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,560
Now. Now, let me tell you,
the previous concept was on that

726
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,400
he was talking about, Right.

727
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,080
This is the export
we have found for personal details.

728
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,600
If I go and take this one right,

729
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,080
this one you'll see from this ID profile
pick.

730
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,200
This is very simple to identify.

731
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,120
Can you see?

732
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,400
It is very simple.

733
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,040
If I am copying this part right,
I can take it.

734
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,280
What I see is a selector as well.

735
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,840
What is the short form of taking the ID
from a selector full stop or hash?

736
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,920
What is the short form
in C selected A protected

737
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,440
right, the

738
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,400
tag name hash and the value of this.

739
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,800
It means for this instance forward
your ID correct

740
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,440
in csv selector

741
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,880
now here because there was no scope
selector.

742
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,440
The main point of identifying
this locator was to tell you

743
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,040
that if you come across a situation
in your website

744
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,840
where you do not have a new tag
which can help you in identifying the

745
00:48:54,840 --> 00:49:00,120
locator YRC as the selector all the way
spotless in name class or something.

746
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,000
In that case, you can pick your text.

747
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:03,800
Well, you

748
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,160
so that there is verification checkpoint.

749
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:12,480
Right?

750
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,600
Right now
we are verifying where the user ID or not.

751
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,920
We are not taking the data.

752
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,600
We have parsed again
the question required and

753
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,720
here we are not taking whatever the data.

754
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,640
We have paused in the same data,
reflecting give or not,

755
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,240
we are just checking
after adding the employee

756
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,400
we are on this page are not
we are able to add the employee

757
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,600
or not the point you're talking about,
I can totally understand.

758
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,640
Yeah.

759
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,440
That is your point of opinion, right?

760
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,480
I can't see anything in this. Right.

761
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,520
I completely agree with you.

762
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,120
No issues are gone.

763
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,720
So that is right.

764
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,000
I think in our discussion on this point.

765
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And let's go ahead and go one thing.

766
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:05,280
What don't he had said
let's take that code.

767
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,440
This is the code his talking about.

768
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,560
Okay, fine.

769
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:24,720
After clicking on this button, I'm

770
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,520
going to put this assert quote right now
here.

771
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,880
This is false name is string. Right?

772
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,960
So I'm going to pass my false name
because my string is this

773
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,680
and last name is my last name.

774
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,040
It. The previous coordinates,
which you already have everyone.

775
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,440
Right. I'm also using the same code.

776
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,200
I'm not using the new one.

777
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,560
All right?

778
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,840
I just showed how we can identify multiple

779
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,760
verification and validation
check points from your screen.

780
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,760
Okay, now,

781
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,160
now the point is yet again, don't miss.

782
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,480
The point is, why are we using this code?

783
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,680
We are using this code to use our data
to right.

784
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,680
Again,
I'm repeating the main intention is to add

785
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,040
five employees
using our data provider concept.

786
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,200
So this is the data provided that we have.
Right?

787
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,320
So let's go ahead and execute this code.

788
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,560
We have three condition.

789
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:26,280
We have forced condition VI data provider
ready with us and we have our method.

790
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,000
We have passed the five user name, right?

791
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,080
Fine.

792
00:51:31,200 --> 00:52:03,280
Let's execute this code base.

793
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,040
Then eventually I will show.

794
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,800
Don't worry, I will give you enough time
to write the code.

795
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,040
I will give you enough time
to explain as well and understand this.

796
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,120
Don't worry about it.

797
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,360
I'm just showing you right now
how this things work here.

798
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,240
All right.

799
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,960
So right now, remember,
I am executing this from my class itself.

800
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,280
I am not using it from test. And why?

801
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,800
Because after this normal execution,
I will show this from test.

802
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,640
And you take simple as that.

803
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,280
Okay.

804
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,280
From both the parts because still
the grouping part is left right.

805
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,720
We didn't implement
this group in our first part.

806
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:54,920
Remember this point?

807
00:52:54,920 --> 00:53:02,400
No, it is working fine.

808
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,360
This button is already
there and the application

809
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,280
Now if
you guys this is your first name too.

810
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,080
Last name do.

811
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,360
It means more data for second employee,
right?

812
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,040
That's why I give this data like this
a user name exist.

813
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,560
That is the problem we are getting here.

814
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,840
The user name exist.

815
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,680
So where it is failing,
it is failing on your which part.

816
00:53:41,960 --> 00:54:03,240
After clicking on
save on the right Nicholas.

817
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,120
Now this is for third iteration.

818
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,040
The data for the third employee.

819
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:15,200
It is going to edit.

820
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,280
Also my question is to Andy.

821
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,720
If my best guess is failing
and if it is same here.

822
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,320
Right? The user idea already exist.

823
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,240
Where is this person?

824
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,120
Physical speech.
Show me in the application.

825
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,880
No uses.

826
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,840
It will be displayed.

827
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,080
In any case, it is not coming here right

828
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,800
this is
a unique feature of the application.

829
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,040
When we explore the application manually,
we come across this functionality

830
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,200
that in general
I am going to implement this.

831
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,760
I'm going to implement
this on a database, right?

832
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,560
The database is the best way.

833
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,560
So what we will do this time,
then we provide the user name,

834
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,120
we will give the current date.

835
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,200
For example 10172021.

836
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,920
Right. Like this
I will give the user name.

837
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,440
This will be the unique one

838
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,680
for the fifth employee.

839
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,280
Right.

840
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,960
But the main point is the main
point is what we are able to add.

841
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,320
Five employees.

842
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,160
We are able to pause the data
for five employees from our data provider,

843
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:28,080
plus connect

844
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,240
Jan three.

845
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,640
I got your point. I go to your point.
That's what I am saying.

846
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,640
This is the second level of verification
and validation check point

847
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,440
that you are verifying that
whatever the post name and the last name

848
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,760
you have positive from your test, right?

849
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,720
Whether the same false name
and last name is visible on the screen

850
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,280
after adding the employee or not,
this is what you are verifying.

851
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,280
Am I right?

852
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,320
This is what you are doing

853
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,480
now. You
see, every single test is fake bit.

854
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,480
It is failing
because of this data is not available.

855
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,440
The verification check points.

856
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,480
If you see profile pic edge one

857
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,720
if you go here

858
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,280
created name is not available. Why?

859
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,920
Because it says your user ID

860
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,440
you can verify either of them.

861
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,480
Right. The one you need to verify.

862
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,760
You can take this one also.

863
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,320
There is no problem with this one.

864
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,800
Again, I am saying there is no problem
with this one.

865
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,720
The intention was to give you
one more validation check point.

866
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:33,520
Right.

867
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,400
One more validation check point.

868
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,360
Now let's skip right.

869
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,640
It gives this part in the code
and then they try to change their data.

870
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,120
This time it says user name already exist.

871
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,520
So which user name
we should put in this case?

872
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,200
Names so that it can work

873
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,880
like this, right.

874
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,560
So we can take one

875
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,440
right.

876
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,960
Or maybe bring it up on

877
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,200
or let's say

878
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,400
10172021 current date.

879
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,600
And here for this user name, 22

880
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,520
for the part 123

881
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,480
for fourth one, it should be 24.

882
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,120
And for 51 it should be 25.

883
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,960
Right. Five user names.

884
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,920
This must be unique.

885
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,800
Now, the next part,
which I'm going to do, is

886
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,640
this is a part of my smoke.

887
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,280
All right? This is the part of my smoke.

888
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,760
So I am going to execute this time
for my test due to take symbol part.

889
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,560
So let me go there.

890
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:55,800
I have defined groups.

891
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,360
Yes, there you go.

892
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,160
This is our groups available. Right.

893
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,120
And here

894
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,240
this test.

895
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,440
Do we really need this test?

896
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:13,080
As of now, the regression one,
do we need this part?

897
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:19,320
As of now, students use their

898
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:23,840
right.

899
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:32,320
So can we remove this part from our test
and or take someone?

900
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,320
We can remove it. Right.

901
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,720
So let me remove it. Now

902
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,240
I want to include only those to get this
to get

903
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,040
this belong to particular group
that is smoke.

904
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,000
All right, fine.

905
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,600
Then let me do one thing.

906
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,840
Let me first picture this one.

907
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,240
So I'm going to write this in

908
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,760
for the victim

909
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,240
and I'm going to clear

910
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,680
a new one

911
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,440
from my class

912
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:34,920
point.

913
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,280
So this is my class, right?

914
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:48,240
I want to execute this particular class
here. Yes.

915
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,760
So that's why I created the new one.

916
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,760
Okay. I created the new test.

917
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,800
And you take some of here
and now which group I want to execute.

918
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,920
So I'm going to take that group from here.

919
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,320
The group name, which is smoke. Right.

920
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,640
So let me take this group from
here and I'm going to write

921
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,160
this group name

922
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,640
so far

923
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:16,920
in this test
and do not symbol when I mention my

924
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,320
class right along with the package

925
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,600
and my group name Smoke,

926
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,440
which I took from here.

927
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,520
Do you guys have any question

928
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:30,160
so far?

929
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,480
Any question in this course then we

930
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,320
the one who was asking
about the save button.

931
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,680
So here you can see in line number 87
we are clicking on

932
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:53,280
save button as one.

933
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,120
Are you passing a You have to make sure
that you're passing like this.

934
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:00,600
This index should be like this
group is equal to in double course

935
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,680
you have to pass your group name,
for example, smoke

936
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,880
or regression in double quotes. Right.

937
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:11,320
And if you're passing it correctly
here like this with your request,

938
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,960
remember, I have seen sometimes
the students are passing it here.

939
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,800
In the method name

940
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,320
you don't have to pass it in the method
name, you have to pass it here.

941
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,120
And then when you pass it
to go into your test and you take symbol

942
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,120
and here
you have to write that one tag inside run,

943
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,920
include the name of your group.

944
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,000
So they should be the same
based groups run

945
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,720
and which group you want to run,
so you will provide the name smoke, right?

946
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,440
As include

947
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,720
the one your

948
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,400
you pass the name right in your method
instead of the request, correct?

949
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,080
Yeah, right.

950
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,760
I have seen so many things.
That's why it took so many students.

951
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,080
But that is common
when you try to practice,

952
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,120
when you try to learn something new,
you always make mistake.

953
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,120
It is fine.

954
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,400
But guys, tell me so far,
this data driven data provider concept,

955
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,920
is there anyone in the class right
who didn't understand

956
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,360
and will want me to go ahead once again
and explain this data provider?

957
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,680
Is there anyone

958
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,640
like I'm already in my exemplify like

959
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:39,480
this?

960
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,160
Yeah.

961
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,000
If I make I just observe.

962
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,800
So there is
shall we go ahead and execute this code

963
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,800
Now we have changed our data.

964
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,920
We have changed our data.

965
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,200
If you'll see in our

966
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,920
class right here, if you see

967
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:04,520
I have this username
so this time my username must be unique.

968
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,800
And then here also, right, we're passing
the data.

969
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:12,000
We're providing complete assertion
it's been now let's execute

970
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:59,080
a trauma test and do not submit.

971
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,600
Maybe you are passing the data
from that point.

972
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,800
Remember utils class.

973
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,200
That's
why you're extending some common methods.

974
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,360
Might be

975
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,840
again username exist.

976
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,320
This is weird.

977
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,440
We was the unique username
but again it exist

978
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,400
if someone has already executed
with this data.

979
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,560
I'm also thinking the same.

980
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,960
If you guys have executed
someone has executed right with the data

981
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,040
which we are using here,
please let us know so that we can use

982
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:57,720
the another data.

983
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,240
Yeah, someone must've executed it. See,

984
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,720
when we're adding the data here,

985
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:10,360
someone is already doing this.

986
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,160
But that's fine.

987
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:18,560
That's fine.

988
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:37,800
Now see, we are passing the data.

989
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,960
Yeah, I already did it. And that's

990
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,240
why I'm not putting this condition
in post condition from that class.

991
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,280
So therefore, the data provider

992
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,960
complete concept of data
provider will be available in this class.

993
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,120
All right.

994
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,280
That's why intentionally
I took this work in the class

995
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,120
so that everyone can get benefited
from this class.

996
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,200
And yesterday also when I did, I confirmed

997
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,760
with every student that already
you have this quote, everyone said yes.

998
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,440
Then only I did it.

999
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,480
Otherwise I would not have done that part.

1000
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,360
But that's fine. I got it.

1001
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,440
I learned that lesson yesterday
and I will not do that

1002
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:37,280
once again.

1003
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,160
Yes, Yes.

1004
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,160
We have to use this code.

1005
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:45,400
Correct.

1006
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,600
I forgot about putting the data
provider in test barometers.

1007
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,320
Okay.

1008
01:06:50,320 --> 01:07:15,160
Like I can understand that.

1009
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,160
All right, so now,

1010
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:24,800
because someone stole our data from here,
that's why our code are getting failed

1011
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,040
because someone is already
using our user name.

1012
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,440
Right.

1013
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,640
But the point was the point was,
we are going to verify this.

1014
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,160
Do you guys want me to once again change
this data and then execute it once again?

1015
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:55,760
Do you guys want me to do this?

1016
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,640
All right.

1017
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:59,680
So now the most important question

1018
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,200
in this part in this.

1019
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:03,760
Yeah.

1020
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,680
And a like I said, right, we will learn
the screenshot taking a screenshot method.

1021
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,360
We've been done in the framework.
All right.

1022
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,080
So that's why verification part
was included here

1023
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,120
and this part is not included.

1024
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,240
We will learn this in our coming lectures.

1025
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:34,080
How we can take the screenshot
with list next.

1026
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,480
Yes, I'm
I'm going to show you this code now.

1027
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,960
98. You'll see here
I have started from here.

1028
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:45,120
So now now tell me, guys, is there anyone
is there anyone from this school?

1029
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:45,840
Right.

1030
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:49,520
The code which I have written
inside of my class, my precondition,

1031
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:55,520
my data provider,
my actual test in my post condition.

1032
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,720
This is the code we have written today.

1033
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,360
Is that anyone with me?

1034
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,280
Is this something in this code?

1035
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,640
If yes, then better

1036
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,440
we should use Selenium did

1037
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:17,240
not test integrate selenium grade and

1038
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,200
Alia which code you want me to show
which part of this class

1039
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:38,360
I need?

1040
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,200
All right.

1041
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:44,640
Now, when everyone is done with code
writing, is there anyone who still has

1042
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,320
any confusion this data all the way to
how are we using it?

1043
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,600
Why we are using to the editor,
How are we going to provide this data

1044
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,880
the way the name in our method,
How are handling this in the parameters?

1045
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,000
Any question,
any questions related to this?

1046
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,840
When I'm committing this code and
the repository, I'm asking this question.

1047
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:19,480
So you guys know

1048
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:26,080
you're having the fresh Cortana.

1049
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,640
Mike,
can you please send this your screenshot

1050
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,960
so that I can see where you're getting
the mistake?

1051
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:41,720
Actually, I should I we will.

1052
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,760
We will learn that
I will show you right in the framework.

1053
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,600
The next topic is that framework.

1054
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:54,480
Now, after the break,
we are going to start a framework portion.

1055
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:54,920
Actually,

1056
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,840
I was supposed to start the framework
in the beginning of the class, but then

1057
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,400
again, Nicolas, I know that.

1058
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,440
But now this is the time to club
everything

1059
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:22,280
together.

1060
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,320
Can you show me the code in your name?

1061
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,560
Number 81 Plus.

1062
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,400
Can you show me the code?

1063
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:39,280
Line number 81?

1064
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,760
Yeah, right.

1065
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,520
So, guys,

1066
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,400
let's take a break
for, say, 14, 20 minutes.

1067
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,800
Sorry. Right. Alright.

1068
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,440
This is all
what ever the things that we have learned

1069
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,720
that was the part of our testing basics.

1070
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:05,120
Now, from here, from this point,
we will be proceeding the world's

1071
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:10,160
understanding and creating our first test
in G framework.

1072
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,400
All right.

1073
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,840
Before going on to take part,
before going to start the explanation

1074
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,040
for testing D framework, this is the time
when we have to recap the topics.

1075
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,360
This is the time
when we have to understand

1076
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:30,280
and we have to realize that whatever
their topics, we understood so far,

1077
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,560
are we actually got those topics
or not understood those topics or not?

1078
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,400
All right.

1079
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,600
Yeah, Mike, I can understand after this
session, right.

1080
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:47,160
I will remove your attitude
and we troubleshoot that.

1081
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,120
So it's the one topic
which I can see that most of you guys

1082
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:55,360
are having a problem
or had a problem with was data provider.

1083
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:08,080
Now data provider is good.

1084
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,160
Andrey And for you guys, is it

1085
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:17,000
good now?

1086
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,160
All right now before this topic

1087
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,640
before data provided right
there were a couple of topics

1088
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,000
generally I can

1089
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,880
totally understand
because this is a configuration file

1090
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:34,000
and there are so many configurations
we generally make in this one file rate.

1091
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:38,640
So sometimes it leads to further confusion
whether we are dealing with packages

1092
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,560
or we are dealing with list notice
or we are dealing with groups or classes

1093
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,200
or methods.

1094
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:46,680
So many things inside one class
or even execution,

1095
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,680
multiple text,
every single thing in one class.

1096
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:55,400
That's why I think you are having some
issues with test and do not act similarly,

1097
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:59,040
not when data provided is correct
when data provider is fine.

1098
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,960
Right. Let's talk about this next slide.

1099
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,920
Yesterday we worked on laziness.

1100
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:05,600
Right.

1101
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,640
Which in this nurse interface
we implemented

1102
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:19,200
experience.

1103
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,480
Yesterday we worked on this nurse, right.

1104
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:26,520
So which listener interface
we implemented in our in business class.

1105
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:31,520
In this class we implemented yes,
I tested this, not this one.

1106
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,600
We implemented this.

1107
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,120
I tested this interface. Right.

1108
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,840
And we provided the body of this method,

1109
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,080
the definition of these functions
according to our own requirement.

1110
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:47,640
Right. In that part. In that part.

1111
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,080
Do you guys have any issue,
the part of listener how we implemented

1112
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,280
those are steps, how we had implemented
those methods, how we had provided

1113
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,600
the body of those matters.

1114
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,560
Any question in that part? Listeners

1115
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,760
No questions.

1116
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,800
Great. No, no.

1117
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,040
For this precondition in a post condition

1118
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,120
we had to use this config and drivers.

1119
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:23,440
So the Europeans package,
we used this tool,

1120
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:29,480
we will be going through these two
packages again in our framework as well.

1121
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,560
Alright.

1122
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,920
So even like said yesterday, also,
even if you have any questions

1123
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:39,400
in this portion, right, don't worry,
we will go through this configuration,

1124
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,280
We will go through this your way
of creating our framework as well.

1125
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,320
So still, if you guys have any question
in these two parts

1126
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,920
specifically I'm talking about config
and utils, right?

1127
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:54,480
These issues will be solved and resolved
in your framework portion, right?

1128
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,600
Because these two packages
will be the part of your framework

1129
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:15,000
and that's what everyone.

1130
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,040
All right. So now

1131
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,560
let's to start

1132
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,560
right our new journey with framework.

1133
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,680
The conclusion of all the point

1134
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,800
the conclusion of all the point
the common point.

1135
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:30,480
Right.

1136
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,320
The one station that the one concept
that we were looking for

1137
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,480
from the very first day is your framework.

1138
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,760
This is something unique or interesting.

1139
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:46,440
I'm repeating once again,
guys, you are a bridge, your java.

1140
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,320
Okay, you are averaging selenium.

1141
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,080
Okay.

1142
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,240
You are just average
or above average in testing G.

1143
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,640
Okay, but when you talk about framework,

1144
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:06,240
you have to be an expert on this point.

1145
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,280
You must know

1146
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,400
you, you must know how

1147
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:14,800
how this framework books in your project.

1148
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,200
Alright you must know all the in
and out of this framework.

1149
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,840
If you are writing any code inside

1150
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:26,080
any class, you must know
why are we rating.

1151
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,000
Alright.

1152
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,280
So that's why I'm saying this is
a completely fresh beginning, right.

1153
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,240
So try to get every single thing.

1154
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,560
I will try to explain the things
as low as possible.

1155
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:42,120
I will try to write everything
from scratch and I will tell you

1156
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,600
about the most about the intention behind
writing that particular

1157
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,480
method, particular class
or particular concept in framework.

1158
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:55,880
Okay, so I need your complete attention
for these two weeks of

1159
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:01,280
we will be learning on this 20 framework
as well is a cucumber playback.

1160
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,000
All right, basics.

1161
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,040
We are done. Basics are already gone.

1162
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,480
Whether it is Java or it is the minimum
or it is just and it's done now.

1163
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,120
The framework new beginning.

1164
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,160
Alright, so let's start with the framework

1165
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,320
in this session today we will discuss

1166
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,760
towards the very first thing
what framework is.

1167
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,560
I'm saying framework is important.

1168
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,960
You have to be an expert of the framework.

1169
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,120
Not now, not now.

1170
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,760
I will tell you
when the time comes. Right.

1171
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:40,480
So for right now we need to understand
what framework is and then when we start,

1172
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:47,480
right, when we go for the implementation
then I then you open your project.

1173
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,360
All right?

1174
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:54,640
So when I am seeing you have to be
an expert of your framework.

1175
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,360
You should know all that in and out
so what is framework?

1176
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,600
What is framework?

1177
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:08,960
This is the main question.

1178
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,840
Yes. Yes.

1179
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,560
And provide

1180
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,400
the same framework, the same framework
you will be using for that project.

1181
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,120
Correct.

1182
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,200
And not only your project, right.

1183
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,880
When you go in any organization,
when you work for any explicit project,

1184
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:28,160
the very first thing to remember, guys,
there are always two scenarios, right?

1185
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,760
When you will get a job,
you will be a nice distinct.

1186
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:33,040
Either you

1187
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,320
will join the organization or the team

1188
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:39,080
is already having an existing setup,
right?

1189
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,560
Of the framework of the project
and everything there.

1190
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:47,600
They will ask you to understand
any not their own framework, right?

1191
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,280
And then you have to write your code
in their own framework.

1192
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,880
Correct. This is one scenario.

1193
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:58,160
And then that scenario is
let's say you join one organization

1194
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,440
and they have just introduced
the automation in their project,

1195
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,880
right? In their project.

1196
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:10,080
So now in this case,
you will be the driver of this show.

1197
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:16,440
What you have to do is you have to create
own framework there, right?

1198
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,400
And that framework
everyone will use to write their code.

1199
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,240
That's why it is very important to learn

1200
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:30,400
how to create framework from scratch.

1201
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,520
All right.

1202
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,840
In both cases, you need basic foundation,
extremely strong.

1203
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:39,000
You need your understanding,

1204
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
conceptual understanding of framework,
extremely hard.

1205
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,080
All right.

1206
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,600
That's why I'm saying when it comes
to the explanation of framework,

1207
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:52,040
you should be expert of it.

1208
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,840
And that's the overview
why we need this framework.

1209
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,200
Right.
And what is the importance of framework

1210
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:02,360
like.

1211
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,240
So now then we guys, then I said,
what is framework?

1212
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:11,400
What do you understand
by this word framework?

1213
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,320
Static in any interview doesn't matter
which interview you're attending, right?

1214
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,480
In any interview, every single interview,

1215
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:23,040
there will be questions on framework,
that is for sure.

1216
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,320
Every single interview, what we ask.

1217
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,200
Can you tell me something about
your framework which you are using right.

1218
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,320
How your framework works?

1219
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:35,040
What are the

1220
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,200
modifications
you have done in your framework?

1221
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,600
What are the changes
you have made in your framework

1222
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,760
how you have contributed in improving
the performance of your framework?

1223
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,680
These type of questions they ask
in the interviews Selected Framework.

1224
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,000
There
you must explain how your framework works,

1225
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,920
how you have contributed in the framework,
how you are dealing with the framework,

1226
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,080
how you're adding the clauses
in the framework, every single thing.

1227
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,800
It's all about the structure.

1228
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,200
Okay, They will go and we will see
all these things in detail.

1229
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:12,000
Right now, remember one thing
when I see what is framework it is simply

1230
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:17,160
an organized structure, I'm giving you
a very, very simple definition, right?

1231
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,520
Organized folder structure.

1232
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:25,680
It allows you to write your code
in a systematic way, right?

1233
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:30,120
Yet it says this thing framework
is a set of guidelines

1234
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:35,400
or rules used for creating
and designing your best guesses.

1235
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:37,520
These

1236
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,800
guidelines could include coding standards.

1237
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,280
Now remember, I was just talking
about coding a standard straight.

1238
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:48,240
You should call every single method
for every single functionality.

1239
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,720
You should have separate
methods, should have object repository.

1240
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,320
So these are coding standards.

1241
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:56,000
I will tell you in detail
what all these things are.

1242
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:00,200
Then there's data handling
methods, repository

1243
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:05,040
processes.

1244
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:09,640
I will upload bits of framework,
slide right in the canvas

1245
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:14,760
word you and then you will be having
this complete by all every single slide

1246
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:22,040
you will be having in your canvas
right up to the station.

1247
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,880
And for a simple definition, yes,
I will write inside code.

1248
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:27,400
Don't worry for simple notes.

1249
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,200
Obviously we will take notes, start
the file, print, but don't worry about it

1250
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,520
or information
on how to access external resources.

1251
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:39,120
Now let's understand one situation.

1252
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,320
Let me give you one daytime scenario.

1253
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,640
Let's see.

1254
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:46,320
Anna, Polina, Black and Mike,

1255
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,760
you four guys
got a job in the same organization, right?

1256
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,480
Luckily you
for all you all four are working.

1257
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,040
You all four
are working on the same project right

1258
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:01,320
now. If your

1259
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:05,480
manager says, Hey Mike, go ahead
and write the code for log in Zanetti,

1260
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,800
write for the log in page
for the log in page.

1261
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,880
Mike is accountable to write the code.

1262
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,280
At the same time he gave the task

1263
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,760
to blank that you have to write the code
on profile settings page.

1264
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,320
Understand is this.

1265
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,520
Understand
what I'm trying to explain here?

1266
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,160
Write for Olena Dashboard page.

1267
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:30,000
She is accountable to write the code
for dashboard page and for Anna.

1268
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,600
Right?

1269
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,680
You have to write the code for aid
and might be

1270
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,280
right for different guys,
for different modules.

1271
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,360
But single application

1272
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,200
Now if you do not have

1273
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,680
a framework, right,
for different pages, right.

1274
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:51,480
We call them page,
we call them modules, write different. Now

1275
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,760
if we do not have a framework,

1276
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,760
Mike will write the code in his own style.

1277
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,440
Black will write his code
in his own phone,

1278
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,680
or then I will write his code
in his own style

1279
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,360
and I will write a report
in his own state.

1280
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:15,840
In our own state, Correct.

1281
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,120
What is the problem here?

1282
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:22,360
What is the problem when your lead,
when your architect, when your manager

1283
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,800
reviews your code? Right.

1284
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,560
He or she will get confused.

1285
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:29,920
Right.

1286
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:34,840
Because there is no consistency
in the code.

1287
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:36,600
There is no consistency. Right.

1288
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,720
You are calling the methods
in your own way.

1289
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:42,680
Someone else is calling the methods
in her own way or in his own right.

1290
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,920
But the data would
that the user of the code is just one

1291
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,640
and he is reviewing
four different types of code.

1292
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,520
I think my point

1293
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:52,440
makes sense

1294
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:57,640
guys. Now.

1295
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:01,880
Now to keep everyone
to keep everyone on the same page.

1296
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:06,440
What is the best way if your manager
or if your says,

1297
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,600
Hey Mike,
you have to write this code like this

1298
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,640
and then you have to write this code
like this?

1299
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,200
Olena You have to write this code
like this in black.

1300
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,320
You have to write this particular module
like this,

1301
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,960
how much information
you will remember in your mind

1302
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,480
if this is everything,
if he explains everything, just 5%

1303
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,200
or 10% information,
really hard to remember everything.

1304
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,520
Correct.

1305
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:33,120
So we need one reliable source, right?

1306
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:37,280
We need one reliable source
that can restrict everyone

1307
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:39,720
that can define the rules.

1308
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,720
A specific set of rules for everyone that,

1309
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,880
you must follow the guidelines
to write the code.

1310
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,480
Right. So we need one structure.

1311
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,360
We need one consistent platform
that everyone can trade the code

1312
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,400
while following

1313
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:59,520
the same set of rules and guidelines
so that everyone can be on the same page.

1314
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,080
This is a specific set of rules.

1315
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,480
This is structure.

1316
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:07,120
This particular part
we call it as a theme. But

1317
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,840
the spirit everyone

1318
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,880
settings and kind of

1319
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,760
okay, so now,

1320
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,320
now when you have one framework in place

1321
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:43,120
right
when you have one framework in place,

1322
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:48,160
your framework means, Hey,
I have precondition for this application.

1323
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,560
It doesn't matter whether you're working
log in part, you have to navigate

1324
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,040
to the URL first
or you're working on dashboard page.

1325
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,800
You have to perform navigation
first, right?

1326
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,640
Or you're working on an employee page

1327
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,480
or you're working on profile
settings to go on any other page.

1328
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:10,560
Right inside application falls,
you'll need to go ahead,

1329
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,920
launch your browser and maybe get to
you want to correct.

1330
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,680
So now for all this, for people,
for all of you, for

1331
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,760
everyone you don't need to write.

1332
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:22,360
Not everyone has to read this.

1333
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,240
The condition, forced conditions.

1334
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,680
What might we do?

1335
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:29,760
Make the right precondition
and post condition inside config folder.

1336
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,560
Right inside.

1337
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:35,040
Say your configuration common metrics
right inside your utils

1338
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,040
indexing in your utils folder.

1339
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,400
You write this method
you can make it into the repository

1340
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,040
when you commit it into the repository.

1341
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:47,160
What Olena and I will do,
they will simply extends

1342
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:50,520
this common method in there,
the respective modules

1343
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:54,800
in their respective classes,
and they will write their code

1344
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,960
related to their respective modules
in the same precondition

1345
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:02,520
and post condition
will work for all this for people

1346
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,320
called reusability.

1347
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,040
One wrote this code.

1348
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:10,560
Now for people and using this code. Right?

1349
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:23,760
Isn't it time saving for everyone?

1350
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,480
Right, guys, things are clear.

1351
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,320
I hope you're able
to visualize the things.

1352
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:37,400
What I'm trying to extend right now.

1353
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:40,080
Great.

1354
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,400
No, Now the next thing.

1355
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,200
Now the next thing.

1356
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,360
Let's see.

1357
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:50,520
Mike wants to write
the code in some ls folder, right?

1358
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,600
Or if he wants to write the code,
he might take some other approach.

1359
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,920
And then I want to write the code
in some other folder inside one.

1360
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,200
Fight every single thing. Right.

1361
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,240
Then it will be again problematic

1362
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:06,800
because one is writing in another way,
another is writing in another be.

1363
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:10,760
Your framework says all four of you guys

1364
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:14,080
will write your code
in this particular folder.

1365
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,440
Now, inside your framework,

1366
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,040
if your framework says you have to write
this code in this particular folder,

1367
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,400
now, you're not allowed to write your code
outside that folder.

1368
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:25,200
Right now.

1369
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:30,120
What is important is what is the main page
of this in a particular folder

1370
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,360
makes it Currently
you four are working in your team.

1371
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,080
Write the model Eugene,
Elisabeth and Jamal.

1372
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:39,360
These three also join your team.

1373
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:39,920
Okay.

1374
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,040
Now your seven members in your team right

1375
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,680
for starting four.

1376
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,720
Everything is understandable, right?

1377
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:48,960
For all of you guys.

1378
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,520
For four of you,
everything is understandable.

1379
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,720
Well, because you guys are dealing
with this framework, right?

1380
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,480
But for these three new people.

1381
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,200
Right.

1382
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,000
What is the important point?

1383
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,160
The important point is anyone from
you can tell to these three guys, hey,

1384
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:07,520
we are using this particular
framework, right?

1385
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,160
If you want to write something, don't
follow your standards.

1386
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,360
Follow the standards of this framework.

1387
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,600
We are writing the code.

1388
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,320
In this particular folder
you have to write the code.

1389
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:21,040
You are supposed to write the code
in the same format now for them all.

1390
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,480
So it is very easy to write.

1391
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:26,400
They will just take the framework,
they will understand.

1392
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:26,760
All right.

1393
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,560
Mike was talking

1394
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:30,640
about this particular folder,
so we have to write this things in this

1395
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:31,320
particular form.

1396
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,320
Now the efforts are going minimum.

1397
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,840
The efforts are reduced, right.

1398
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,080
But the explanation is going higher.

1399
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,280
Getting my point
because framework is self-explanatory.

1400
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:49,040
It is defining the set of rules,
the guidelines you guys are following.

1401
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:52,480
You are telling everyone else
to follow the same things, right?

1402
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,920
So now everyone is following.

1403
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,680
Everyone is on the same page.

1404
01:31:55,680 --> 01:32:14,240
Isn't it easy to maintain the code
in this case now?

1405
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,960
Now the next point,

1406
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:22,120
you have 100 classes, you have hundred
functions, you have one request.

1407
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,920
Didn't take 500 different modules.

1408
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:25,760
Right.

1409
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:30,800
But if you have broken the structure now,
if you have a property, the structure

1410
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,880
and you know, all of my test cases
are available in one folder, quite test.

1411
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,840
I'm just giving an example. Right.

1412
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,120
You have one for you that point fix test

1413
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:43,880
and all of your test cases
available inside this one folder.

1414
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:45,640
In this

1415
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,760
folder also you have six classes, right?

1416
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:53,200
And let's sit and execute code
for the eight employee page.

1417
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,760
Now she knows that I have written
this code inside of my test package.

1418
01:32:58,120 --> 01:33:02,400
Inside this package I have one class,
I have written my code this write,

1419
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:03,680
you have written this

1420
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:07,120
everything inside this particular class,
inside this particular package.

1421
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:08,800
You are on holiday.

1422
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,320
You're on vacation. Right.

1423
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,720
And Olena is trying to execute
the entire piece of code.

1424
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:14,640
Right?

1425
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,920
Obviously,
she will also execute your code is.

1426
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:20,400
But she is not going to do this,
that she will execute her piece of code

1427
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,760
and not yours. Right.

1428
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:26,920
She will execute the entire project
that this time, if she come across

1429
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:32,520
an error in your editor employee page,
she doesn't have to for the entire thing.

1430
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,400
But what she will do
is she will open the test package.

1431
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,960
She will go and say Bashford class. Right.

1432
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,080
And she will be able to fix the code.

1433
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,240
She will be to fix this script.

1434
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:42,680
Right?

1435
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:46,280
Isn't it time saving and very easy
to identify the errors

1436
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:52,440
in the framework?

1437
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,440
Guys, understanding
what I'm trying to explain.

1438
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:55,600
Right.

1439
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:58,680
So easy to maintain if error comes

1440
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:02,440
it would be very easy to identify
and spot the error.

1441
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:03,120
Right.

1442
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,520
You don't need to

1443
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:08,920
go through the entire framework and check
every single folder in every single file.

1444
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:10,280
You don't need to do that.

1445
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,720
Just go inside the specific location
and you will find the

1446
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,840
code reusability.

1447
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:17,880
Another point

1448
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:22,320
like I get to give one example, very basic
example of launching the browser,

1449
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:25,560
navigating to role
and closing the browser.

1450
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,520
Right.

1451
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:30,600
One person is writing,
the remaining six are using the same code

1452
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,840
code reusability for the entire project.

1453
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,120
Just one precondition is working in
one condition is working

1454
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,680
so it doesn't matter
if you have 100 or 1000 classes.

1455
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,280
The same precondition
will work throughout.

1456
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,960
And also

1457
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,800
these are the advantage they just have
talking about the framework.

1458
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,600
What is framework?

1459
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,520
I already told you Now see

1460
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:56,680
in the framework in the framework,

1461
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:01,120
another feature
we can create methods for reading,

1462
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:06,600
writing from external data
sources, validation, reporting, etc.

1463
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,600
and can place it
in such a way that you need.

1464
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:12,240
Other projects can also use it.

1465
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:13,720
It saves efforts time.

1466
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:17,040
Of course, many of the company
remember guys want wanted

1467
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,040
for what?

1468
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,800
Everything in it is business.

1469
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,640
Everything is business.

1470
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:31,640
Client your customer, your management
is polite with you all the time.

1471
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,000
You're delivering

1472
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,840
in their time, you're delivering

1473
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:38,920
according to their expectations.

1474
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:39,720
Then never.

1475
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:43,560
They never, ever
appreciate the things that is time taking

1476
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:47,040
because time
is directly proportional to money.

1477
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,080
They are investing in the project.

1478
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,840
If you are taking more time,
they have to pay more money.

1479
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:57,040
They will never appreciate any
any approach, which is I'm thinking right.

1480
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:01,200
So if there is a confusion to remove
that confusion from the framework,

1481
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,160
you need time.

1482
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:05,160
And if you need time,
you will get paid for their time.

1483
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:06,680
And who is going to pay?

1484
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,400
Your customer will going to pay.

1485
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:13,440
So what they need,
they need time saving solution.

1486
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:17,240
They need something because
which is very straightforward, right?

1487
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:21,600
Which is very easy to understand,
Which is very easy to implement. Why?

1488
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,600
Because if these things are easy
to implement, then it is less time

1489
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,320
consuming.

1490
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:30,640
And if it is less time consuming,
there will be less money.

1491
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:31,640
Right?

1492
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:36,360
So every single thing in the industry,
whether your senior management,

1493
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:41,400
your customer, your client, your project,
everything is just business.

1494
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:44,760
Make sure, guys
keep this thing very clear in your mind.

1495
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,880
I'm telling you this things
from my experience, right?

1496
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:52,120
I have dealt with over 28 clients
in my career so far in.

1497
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:55,800
This last eight years,
I have delivered over 28 projects.

1498
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,440
I know all this.

1499
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:04,080
28 were more inclined towards money,
towards business, not towards invoice.

1500
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,320
This is the bitter truth of the industry.

1501
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,560
So keep this point in your mind.

1502
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,480
All right?

1503
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,760
When we are going into the advanced

1504
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,400
concept,
I'm giving you the reality of the market.

1505
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:15,480
Alright?

1506
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:20,280
So we have to be very specific
on this part because we have to come up

1507
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:24,400
with the solutions
which are more favorable to the customers.

1508
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,520
Not sometimes you have to implement
the concepts in the framework

1509
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:32,000
which are not favorable to you
since these concepts are favorable

1510
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,880
to your customer,
then your client you have to do it

1511
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,760
even though it
doesn't matter whether you like it or not.

1512
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:43,240
Your customer is asking your client
is asking, your management is asking.

1513
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:48,240
So you have to implement them, correct?

1514
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:49,440
Mike Correct.

1515
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,640
My company used to say the same thing
earlier.

1516
01:37:51,840 --> 01:38:01,680
Now this job, because we realized,

1517
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:06,720
all right,

1518
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:10,240
now let's follow suit for the

1519
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:18,240
why we need a framework.

1520
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,440
Yesterday, remember I told you one

1521
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,160
when we are passing their data, username,

1522
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:28,120
password, first name, last name, right.

1523
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,320
Or even the part of five.

1524
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,720
We should not pass anything hard

1525
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:37,680
coded correct.

1526
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:38,680
Everything.

1527
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,280
Everything should be parameterized.

1528
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,320
Okay.

1529
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:47,760
From different components, from different
components, from different parameters.

1530
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:54,000
You have to parse this data
in terms of keys, in terms of parameters.

1531
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,680
Framework allows you to implement
the functionality, build it,

1532
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:03,080
make sure that you're not passing
any data coding.

1533
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:07,040
That's why
we need framework for thing, right?

1534
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:08,400
So like anything,

1535
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,360
you need one

1536
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:13,600
place,
you need one place in your framework.

1537
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:17,360
In that place,
what you will say, Hey, my framework,

1538
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,920
I'm going to execute my fit
as to give this

1539
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:23,880
in my ten test cases.

1540
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:29,920
If six are passed and four are filled,
I need the report for this fix

1541
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,960
and this for even
it is passed only when it is finished.

1542
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,400
I need the screenshot for all this point.

1543
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:39,560
I need detailed report of all this thing
and I need all of these things

1544
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:40,920
at one place.

1545
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:45,000
So your framework allows you to implement
this functionality as

1546
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:58,160
clear.

1547
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:00,440
Now that those things,

1548
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:04,160
even when we are learning this system,
when we were learning this, this stingy

1549
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,520
right learning this
just basic this stingy basically

1550
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,080
we were executing everything
from right click

1551
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:16,760
or even what we were doing
we were having multiple right.

1552
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:20,480
We use to execute multiple tests
and you don't accidents, right.

1553
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:22,440
If you

1554
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:26,440
observe this point is then
do you want similar testing to detect?

1555
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:30,280
Similarly is small, but similarly creation
protects them in so many things.

1556
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:35,400
Right now
your framework allows you to execute

1557
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,880
all of these same insight
from just one point.

1558
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,560
You need to execute your script
from one point only.

1559
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,520
It means your entire
length of your framework

1560
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:49,440
will be driven
from just one execution point.

1561
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:50,280
Right?

1562
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:54,120
You need to change everything
at one place, and everything will change

1563
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,240
automatically throughout your project.

1564
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:03,520
That kind of structure
we can make inside of the.

1565
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,920
Yes, I'm going to

1566
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,760
put all of these reasons we need.

1567
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:17,200
Our framework is clear to everyone. Now.

1568
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:22,160
The next thing is when I see a report,
right when I see the report

1569
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,760
in our framework, the can be customized

1570
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,400
right according to your own requirement.

1571
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:30,720
If you

1572
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:34,600
remember yesterday,
I told you that we are going to implement

1573
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:37,440
the one interface
that is my best listener.

1574
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:39,200
Correct?

1575
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,880
We implement this interface.

1576
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:43,320
I test the listener.

1577
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,960
Why are we using interface?

1578
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:49,600
Because they can provide the body
and the definition

1579
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:53,120
of the method or the function
according to our own required of me.

1580
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:54,120
Right.

1581
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:58,480
So now, if my requirement
is to just get some raw information, fine.

1582
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,440
I can give that information

1583
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:03,800
raw instructions
and I will get more information my report.

1584
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:08,520
But if I need a screenshot,
if I need a result

1585
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:12,720
of the particular method,
if I need the name of particular test

1586
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:16,440
along with this screenshot, can I do this
customization in my framework?

1587
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,600
So the answer is yes.

1588
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:23,440
I can customize my report
according to my own required is. But.

1589
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:41,680
All right.

1590
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:42,480
All right

1591
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:45,720
guys. So far clear to everyone.

1592
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:47,400
I'm not getting proper responses.

1593
01:42:47,400 --> 01:43:04,160
That's why I'm asking.

1594
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:05,080
All right.

1595
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:16,440
Now, let's proceed for that.

1596
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:17,320
All right.

1597
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,920
Now, what all are
the characteristics of one frame?

1598
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:22,800
What we should know?

1599
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,080
So these are the characteristics, right?

1600
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,480
We should understand

1601
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:29,960
the remember.

1602
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:34,960
One thing.

1603
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,680
Remember one thing, guys,
whenever we talk about framework, right.

1604
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:42,640
That agenda that intention

1605
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:46,920
behind creating any framework
is to give this framework.

1606
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,360
If we are giving this framework

1607
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:51,920
to any new employee,
any new joiner of the team, right

1608
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:55,680
he or
she must be able to start contributing.

1609
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,000
When I say contributing,

1610
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:01,120
it means writing the code
as early as possible with minimal

1611
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:04,920
understanding, with minimal guidance
and with no setup

1612
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:09,320
by because that is already available
in the framework you are giving

1613
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:13,600
a working product, you're giving a working
framework to anyone.

1614
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:18,040
Now you also don't want to spend much time
on the explanation

1615
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,840
part, on the clarity part.

1616
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:23,560
So in the framework itself,
if you will see we are keeping this thing

1617
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:24,840
in the repository,

1618
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:28,880
this thing in this repository,
and the documentation is also available

1619
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,720
for this particular framework,
which is what we call onboarding document.

1620
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,480
Right?

1621
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:37,280
So there he or she can get complete
knowledge of the framework

1622
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,080
with minimal guidance
and he or she can start

1623
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:44,120
contributing at the earliest
in the framework in the project.

1624
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:45,720
Right.

1625
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:49,320
So you have to develop your framework
in such a way

1626
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,960
that it should provide this one. Pages.

1627
01:44:52,320 --> 01:45:00,480
This is the first characteristic
of your framework.

1628
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,560
We are going on day point. We are going on

1629
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,840
now. The second is first,
let's talk about project

1630
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,680
and then we will talk about
make fun independent.

1631
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,000
All right.

1632
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,800
It must not be project independent.

1633
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,440
What does it mean, guys?

1634
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:19,360
It must not be project dependent.

1635
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:31,720
Any idea? Yes.

1636
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:36,240
Let's it Mike Baleno and

1637
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:40,760
what was the fourth one?

1638
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:43,160
Nor I think like black.

1639
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:44,840
Black. Yeah.

1640
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:47,400
So these four guys, these four guys,

1641
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:51,120
they were working in one project, right?

1642
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:54,480
These four guys were working
in Msme Company.

1643
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,400
Right in Amazon.

1644
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:57,480
Company Ltd said they guys were working on

1645
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:00,520
what is the name of Project

1646
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,080
Alexa, right?

1647
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:08,160
You four were working on Alexa, now

1648
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,280
Anna and Black shortlisted

1649
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:16,480
for another Project.

1650
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:21,040
You got shortlisted because you guys are
working right with the innovative approach

1651
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:24,600
and they knew the people like you,
so they shortlisted of you.

1652
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:30,000
Now you both are going to join another
project that is Amazon Prime video, right?

1653
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,240
The one project is Alexa.

1654
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:36,120
Mike is is still in the Alexa one
and is still in the Alexa,

1655
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,360
but you both are going there

1656
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:42,160
with Amazon Prime video.

1657
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:44,680
Again, you guys have to use

1658
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:48,160
automation that you have to automate
this particular software.

1659
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:50,520
Amazon Prime video,
the entire web application

1660
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:54,120
you have to automate now on Suddenly
and in Black.

1661
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,320
If you guys are joining
this particular new project,

1662
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,800
are you guys supposed to create framework
from scratch?

1663
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:11,320
There?

1664
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:12,480
Please make sure right.

1665
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:18,600
What I am trying to explain here,
please pay attention on this point.

1666
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:20,280
No right.

1667
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:22,920
You should not create the framework
from this connect. Why?

1668
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,640
Because you already put efforts

1669
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:28,680
on creating that framework
in your previous project.

1670
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:29,320
Right?

1671
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:32,840
So what you have to do
this time is you will take the basic

1672
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:35,600
framework skeleton
from the previous project.

1673
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:38,400
Right? From the previous project here.

1674
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:41,680
This time what you need to change
gesture is that you are in

1675
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:44,640
the administration's

1676
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:48,360
right changed the locators
according to your new application

1677
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,760
and your same logging script
will work. You

1678
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:55,760
the your framework will work here because

1679
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,200
log in pages log in page right locators.

1680
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:03,800
You just need to change
functionality is you are going to change.

1681
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:06,880
Yes you are going to change that you are.

1682
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,840
And so application will change, right?

1683
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:12,600
Because the instructions are seen,
the data is different.

1684
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:17,240
So instead of creating the new framework
from the switch on any other project,

1685
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,600
what you can simply do is
you can pick the project,

1686
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:23,280
you can take the framework from,
your previous project,

1687
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:27,400
and you can do a little bit
of modification in this to use

1688
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:28,960
for your new project.

1689
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:32,920
That's what we call
Project Independent framework.

1690
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:36,680
This is the second characteristics
that you must create

1691
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:39,360
a framework which is project independent.

1692
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:45,880
All right.

1693
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:49,960
Hilal
basically architect most of the times.

1694
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:52,320
But if studies on senior position.

1695
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:56,200
So yes, testers
also, for example, I have created

1696
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,960
sleeping works, right?

1697
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,800
And these particular books
I've used in 22 or 23 different projects.

1698
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,400
So obviously I spent a lot time
in creating the framework

1699
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:14,480
right in my earlier days,
like two and a half years back

1700
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,440
then, I promoted to that position
as a deputy manager

1701
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:21,000
and then after that,

1702
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:25,040
if anyone comes from any other project,
did him as, do we have any framework?

1703
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,840
I said, Yes, the framework ready?

1704
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:31,040
Go ahead, use this framework and modify
it according to your requirement.

1705
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:31,840
This framework work.

1706
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,800
So in my entire company
now we have a team of 2500 employees

1707
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,160
in my company right
across 14 different locations.

1708
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:44,600
We have a team of 2500 employees
and these employees out of them,

1709
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:49,240
I would say 15, 1600 employees
are working on this 2725 project.

1710
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:55,640
Everyone is using those frameworks now.

1711
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:57,680
So I it's a private one.

1712
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,160
Yeah, it's a secured one.

1713
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,600
All right.

1714
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:05,560
So guys, remember
when your framework is very flexible,

1715
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:09,760
when your framework is highly independent
of any project?

1716
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:16,160
Right in the beginning,
then you can use your framework anywhere.

1717
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:20,200
And this is the best approach
to create any framework from scratch.

1718
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,880
It should be highly customizable
right there?

1719
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:25,720
At some point,
this is what we can use everywhere,

1720
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,960
correct?

1721
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,600
These things are making sense now.

1722
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:34,640
What are the characteristics of framework
and why we should have

1723
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:42,040
this characteristics?

1724
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:45,800
All right, Let's go ahead.

1725
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:49,680
It should be reusable
and easy to manage and maintain.

1726
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:51,200
All right.

1727
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,480
I told you about the maintenance.

1728
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:54,440
What is maintenance?

1729
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:57,400
Basically,
when you're executing your script,

1730
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:02,000
let's say five days to get this,
three are frame rate

1731
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:06,480
when you're working to fix these, three
when you are working

1732
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:09,960
to remove the errors from your three test
kits, this right,

1733
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:14,560
this is what we call
maintenance of your script, right?

1734
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,240
Right now,

1735
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:15,760
because you're

1736
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:19,040
working on a very small level,
then you will be working on a high level.

1737
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:24,760
Then you have to execute 2000 test
cases, 2500 test cases every day right.

1738
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:28,360
Then you will be getting errors
in, let's say 500 test,

1739
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,480
get this fixed and big test,
get this there.

1740
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:34,120
You have to spend your days
just to fix your script.

1741
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:35,920
It is what we call efforts.

1742
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,280
We are putting efforts.

1743
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:39,640
We are investing in the maintenance of

1744
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:52,680
here. All

1745
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,160
right. It should be usable.

1746
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,160
So why reusable?

1747
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:01,840
Because if I want to click
on 1000 elements in my application

1748
01:52:02,240 --> 01:52:07,320
or if I want to send the data, it
1000 plays in my application every time.

1749
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,840
I cannot write that,
I would not find the element by not

1750
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:13,280
saying the keys and then pass some data,

1751
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:17,640
I need one function
and that function will perform this turn

1752
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:21,160
because operation it
1000 places code reusability.

1753
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,360
If I take one place, execute every man.

1754
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:28,880
This will be the part of your team, right?

1755
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,560
Which we are going to obviously implement
in your framework.

1756
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:34,560
Okay.

1757
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:39,520
Another important feature,
if I just disclose this point.

1758
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,680
All right, then flow should be very clear.

1759
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:44,720
When I say no should be very clear.

1760
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:49,720
It means the basic definition of framework
is it should be easily understandable.

1761
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,080
All right.

1762
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:53,200
Your framework
can not be like a rocket science.

1763
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:56,840
It should be like not rocket science
where you have to solve so many questions

1764
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:00,480
just to understand a simple folder,
structure and organized manner.

1765
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:07,880
Why we are organizing the structure,
why we are organizing

1766
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:12,120
the structure based VBA for providing
this particular sequence right.

1767
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:14,560
The proper manner structure.

1768
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:17,720
Because we need easiness to understand
defeat.

1769
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,920
We need easily understandable part.

1770
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,520
That's why we are doing it right.

1771
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:26,760
So your flow of frameworks
be very easy and understandable

1772
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:31,360
and it should be very clear so that one
can understand it with minimal efforts

1773
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:43,200
clear.

1774
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:44,040
All right.

1775
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:49,120
Now another point is, let's see again,
I'm taking the same example

1776
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:52,960
why I'm taking this
the life examples, guys, because it might

1777
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:58,200
what I personally think is this type of
examples makes your explanation very easy.

1778
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:58,840
Right.

1779
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:03,600
And you guys can also relate to the things
Let's say I'm talking about Black

1780
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:06,600
Mike Olena and Anna.

1781
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:10,200
These four guys are working in one team

1782
01:54:10,200 --> 01:54:14,880
now. Their proper understanding
of programing, their knowledge

1783
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,800
about programing and their skills,
about the automation testing

1784
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:22,200
are same among for this guy
among these four guys

1785
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:32,840
or it is different.

1786
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:36,640
Different, right.

1787
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:40,000
I'm giving you one very basic
example, right?

1788
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:42,480
It is a different train in your class.

1789
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:43,720
In your class.

1790
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:48,120
When I explain something,
some people get it very easy, right?

1791
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:50,320
Like a motor, very smoothly.

1792
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:54,520
Some people find it hard to understand
that topic, right?

1793
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:55,440
I'm not telling.

1794
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,720
I'm not saying
they guys are taking time or something.

1795
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:01,320
I'm just trying to give you an example
that everyone

1796
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:05,520
everyone
is not having the same kind of potential.

1797
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,720
Right.

1798
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:10,440
So what is the practical approach
in this scenario?

1799
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:15,600
As a tutor, as an instructor,
as a teacher, this is my responsibility

1800
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:20,320
to make sure that everyone, one
can understand the thing in the same way,

1801
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:25,200
correct?

1802
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:26,080
Correct. Don't always

1803
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:30,400
similarly.

1804
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:33,640
Similarly, Ben Black, Anna

1805
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:37,440
Olena and Mike are working in one team

1806
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,040
for, one project and they have one
framework work with them.

1807
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:42,800
It is not necessity.

1808
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:45,840
They all these four people will be able

1809
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,160
to understand the framework
right At the same time,

1810
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,680
my group like will understand
everything in just 30 minutes.

1811
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:54,600
Might be analytic.

1812
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:55,600
One day it might be

1813
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:59,720
black will take or Mike will take one week
or might be in just one hour.

1814
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:00,720
Right.

1815
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,080
It might be different
because it varies according to people.

1816
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:05,200
Correct.

1817
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,720
So now what is the of good framework?

1818
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:11,520
The definition of good framework is

1819
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:14,120
the definition of good framework is

1820
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:18,240
it can be understandable from everyone.

1821
01:56:19,120 --> 01:56:21,200
It can be understandable from everyone.

1822
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:26,160
So even not only intelligent a step,
but also in everyday

1823
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:30,000
automation
is to start contributing at the earliest.

1824
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,680
Alright,
they can also understand the things

1825
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:36,600
and they can also use this
framework in the earliest

1826
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:38,880
days.

1827
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:40,560
Are you able to connecting the dots?

1828
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:43,680
What I explained from the example
of your class and from the example

1829
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:51,720
of framework, correct?

1830
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:53,680
Why I'm extending this point?

1831
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:58,840
Because sometimes what people think is
whenever they hear this word framework,

1832
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:02,520
they always think we need something
like Pascal's law

1833
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:07,480
or some Laplace equation,
something like that, or rocket science.

1834
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:12,000
No, this framework must be very easy.

1835
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,240
You framework must be very flexible
so that everyone can understand it.

1836
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:19,680
We are giving this product
to our teammates

1837
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:24,280
to make their life easy,
not to make their life more hectic.

1838
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:30,880
Correct? No.

1839
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:34,800
Next point,
it should not contain hardcoded values.

1840
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,320
I already explained this point.

1841
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:39,280
If you guys focus, if you guys remember

1842
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:44,160
in your framework,
you should not pass anything hardcoded.

1843
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:44,920
Correct.

1844
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,720
I'm not only talking about your username
and password anywhere,

1845
01:57:49,360 --> 01:57:53,560
even if you're passing files,
but it should not be hardcoded.

1846
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:56,760
Let me show you this.

1847
01:57:56,760 --> 01:57:58,240
Yesterday.

1848
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:01,520
Yesterday when you were talking
about this portion inside you

1849
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,360
utils

1850
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:11,080
in your common metrics.

1851
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:11,800
Right.

1852
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:15,000
We have positive this part

1853
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,880
is this but hardcoded

1854
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:27,000
what it is normal can be.

1855
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,720
It is hardcoded.

1856
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:31,400
Right

1857
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:36,280
now your framework says
it should not contain hardcoded values.

1858
01:58:36,280 --> 01:58:39,720
If the means look,
we are not going to pass

1859
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:43,240
even your this file path hardcoded right.

1860
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:47,680
We will parameterized this crazy
how they knew that nobody's it

1861
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:51,160
now it be easily extendable.

1862
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:52,440
What does it mean?

1863
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:53,280
Let's see.

1864
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:56,440
Today in your application
you have log in page logout

1865
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:59,600
page dashboard page item by page.

1866
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:02,960
So don't create your framework
in such a way that it supports

1867
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:06,240
only for application or only
for the modules of one application.

1868
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:09,480
You never know what the model thinks
right.

1869
01:59:09,480 --> 01:59:12,120
Tomorrow,
maybe you have to add transactions page,

1870
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:14,600
maybe you have to add some

1871
01:59:14,600 --> 01:59:17,800
of spending page,
but you will be having so many products

1872
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:21,120
or you will be having profile
settings, page or different page,

1873
01:59:21,120 --> 01:59:23,760
or you will be having monetization
page, right?

1874
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:27,680
It could be any kind of integration
that can be done in your application.

1875
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:32,760
You to design your framework
in such a way that it will support

1876
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,880
and it can be extended according
to the requirement in future as well.

1877
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:39,840
Again,
flexibility of your framework is make it

1878
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:45,000
great and then answer to your question.

1879
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:45,800
And it's not.

1880
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:47,760
It should be platform independent.

1881
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,920
What does it mean?
It should be independent.

1882
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:51,360
It means

1883
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:54,440
someone is using Linux,

1884
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:56,680
someone is using Mac,

1885
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:58,760
someone is using your Windows.

1886
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:00,960
Right now.

1887
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,560
You can't restrict your client list.

1888
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:06,440
Say you are writing every single thing
in your windows machine.

1889
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,960
You gave your code to your client.

1890
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,600
Your client to execute this code,
but he is using Mac machine.

1891
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,480
Your framework should work in such a way.

1892
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:21,920
This same piece of code
should work in Windows machine as well.

1893
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:25,760
The same piece of work should work in
same piece of code.

1894
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:28,840
Should work in your Mac machine. Is

1895
02:00:28,840 --> 02:00:31,360
it should be made from independent.

1896
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:46,640
Got it.

1897
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:48,160
Yes, correct. And it's getting

1898
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:53,800
so far

1899
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:58,080
based in this explanation,
any question, whatever

1900
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:09,840
the things I expect, any question in this.

1901
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:21,360
Andre, you there?

1902
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:24,000
Okay, guys,
I hope I'm explaining slowly. Right.

1903
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:37,120
And you guys are understanding.

1904
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:38,200
All right.

1905
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,200
So now

1906
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:43,520
let's talk about another important point,
right?

1907
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:48,080
We are putting a lot of efforts
in strengthening what this framework.

1908
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:49,160
Right?

1909
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:51,760
We are putting a lot of efforts
in understanding

1910
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:53,320
what are the connectors sticks.

1911
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:55,680
One framework should have. Right?

1912
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:58,560
We are trying to make everyone's life
easier.

1913
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:00,200
Everything is fine.

1914
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,000
But what

1915
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:06,240
for me, every single one is my favorite.

1916
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:12,840
Every single one.

1917
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:14,600
And for me it is very good, right?

1918
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:17,800
If I'm getting the company right,
it is very good for me.

1919
02:02:17,800 --> 02:02:20,120
It's already one I improve.

1920
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,600
It is very good for me.

1921
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:24,920
I am also learning, like I say,
that we all are learning right?

1922
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:29,280
And the learning is ongoing process
till the time you take your last breath.

1923
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:30,280
Right?

1924
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:39,320
So you should always learn from everyone.

1925
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:42,040
Yes, I'm ready.
Whatever the things, I'm extending things.

1926
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:45,640
This is a part of giving that
clarity right.

1927
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:49,240
This is a part of your clarity.

1928
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,160
That's why I'm trying to explain.

1929
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:55,800
And from the next slide,
if you'll see from here, I will implement

1930
02:02:55,800 --> 02:03:01,560
and extend it the same time.

1931
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:05,640
Now, what are the benefits
before even stepping

1932
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:07,560
into the creation of your framework?

1933
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:10,560
What are the benefits
we will get once we have this framework?

1934
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:13,640
These are the things
we need to understand.

1935
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:17,400
If you're utilizing any framework
for your automation testing,

1936
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:21,920
the first thing, what it will do is by
your company is investing

1937
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:25,520
while your client is investing
this much amount for creating the frame.

1938
02:03:25,520 --> 02:03:27,360
But they can also

1939
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:30,880
ask you to write one normal synonym
plus the way you're writing right now.

1940
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:34,160
And then you can simply execute
your script, right?

1941
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:35,600
You can do that.

1942
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:39,520
Why they're investing this much of time
and allowing you to execute

1943
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:43,360
and create this framework
because it will increase

1944
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:46,240
your overall speed of writing

1945
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:50,440
once you have the complete clarity
and set of rules that everything

1946
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:53,520
it will improve,
increase the productivity of your team.

1947
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:56,640
Right? So let's say if you are writing

1948
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:00,960
five test cases, for example, in one day
without framework,

1949
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:05,160
and if you can understand this framework,
if you understood this framework

1950
02:04:05,160 --> 02:04:08,800
correctly, you can create
maybe six or seven test cases in one day.

1951
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:09,800
Right?

1952
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,160
Or maybe let's talk about more practical

1953
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:17,280
for your writing pretest, because this
in a day often ending the framework,

1954
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,440
understanding you're able
to write like this because this

1955
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:24,000
now just don't look at this to test
to get this thing. Why?

1956
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:27,000
Because your team is having
how many members black

1957
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:31,080
your name is having how many members

1958
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:39,200
know Jamal who also joined up some time.

1959
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:41,480
Right. Same kind of.

1960
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:47,160
So now if one guy is writing five
this script in three main for two,

1961
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:51,120
four, seven people,
how many scripts are going increase

1962
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:58,680
14 scripts every day, increasing

1963
02:04:58,680 --> 02:05:02,520
14 test cases increased every day
because of this framework.

1964
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:03,120
Right.

1965
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:07,560
And let's talk about the bigger scenario
where you have 5000 best guesses, right?

1966
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:10,120
These 14 steps, Right.

1967
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:13,040
This 14 test is in place.
These are a bonus.

1968
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:15,000
This is just a bonus for one day.

1969
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,800
So just to multiply five days in a week,
20 days in a month.

1970
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:19,720
Right.

1971
02:05:19,720 --> 02:05:23,080
And then to 40 days in your year
in one year

1972
02:05:23,240 --> 02:05:28,520
to 40 days multiplied by 1424 and break
and then the mini 40.

1973
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:29,400
So it means how much?

1974
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:34,240
1000 to 400 to get this
you can save in one year

1975
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,920
getting my point

1976
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:44,320
not sure like about it

1977
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,640
right so that's how your framework

1978
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:51,400
give you lot of benefits in the longer run
right there so whenever you see

1979
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:55,240
a long term project right video
see so many scenarios.

1980
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:58,000
I know one client or CVS.

1981
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
CVS health care is a client, right?

1982
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,040
CVS is a one health care company
in the US,

1983
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:06,960
right.

1984
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:10,320
I'm just giving you one very small
example, guys, from my experience,

1985
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:16,760
because I've worked with CVS right
in my 2017, I think four years back,

1986
02:06:16,760 --> 02:06:20,560
just to parse data,
just to parse their data.

1987
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:24,000
This data
in the framework, in the framework,

1988
02:06:24,440 --> 02:06:27,440
can you guys even imagine
how many Excel files they're

1989
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:35,800
using in the framework, how many files
we are using to parse the data

1990
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:39,960
and Andre

1991
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:45,600
Black, Mike, how many test,
how many Excel file we're using?

1992
02:06:45,600 --> 02:06:46,440
Just one.

1993
02:06:46,440 --> 02:06:51,640
Correct.

1994
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:56,280
They are using a 179 Excel files

1995
02:06:56,280 --> 02:07:00,400
just to pass this data.

1996
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:02,760
179 Excel files.

1997
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:07,120
I was blown away
when I looked at their framework

1998
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:12,680
and then said this to my I said, okay,
this is going to be very difficult part

1999
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:18,600
for you now,
and you have to cross this bridge to 879

2000
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:22,760
files.

2001
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:24,840
Yeah, my contact.

2002
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:28,080
So now you can imagine why
I'm giving this example, because if you're

2003
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:33,000
passing 170 main Excel file
just to pass data, how many test cases

2004
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:37,920
they have in their framework,
in their application to execute minimum

2005
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:41,680
5000, minimum
seven or 8000 or 10,000 test to this

2006
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,000
in this much long project,
in this much big project, when you have a

2007
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:51,280
lot of 80, a lot of scope of automation
testing framework helps you a lot.

2008
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:51,960
In this case

2009
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,320
sense

2010
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:02,880
right now.

2011
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:04,640
The second thing is your maintenance.

2012
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:09,040
Maintenance cost goes down,
it reduces your maintenance cost, right?

2013
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:12,840
Because when you have a complete
organized structure,

2014
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:17,160
then you are more likely
to write your code in a single shot.

2015
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:19,400
It means with minimal errors. Right.

2016
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:23,520
And if you are writing your code
with minimal errors, with minimal issues,

2017
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:25,560
then the maintenance will go down.

2018
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:29,040
So obviously that cost company
will be building on

2019
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:35,280
the maintenance will go down
automatically right.

2020
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:39,040
No more escalations connect

2021
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:42,400
than minimal manual intervention.

2022
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:44,680
Right. This is the main point.

2023
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:47,880
If I ask this team Black or Lena

2024
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:51,920
and Mike Jamal, let's take two more guys.

2025
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:57,040
Oxana and Andrey,
you have your nine guys right in the team.

2026
02:08:57,400 --> 02:09:01,080
If I asked you to execute
all the test systems manually,

2027
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:07,040
your nine people, how much time we think
to execute 5000 test kits as many of

2028
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,280
you have to put it

2029
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:21,480
in one folder.

2030
02:09:21,480 --> 02:09:22,080
All right. Okay.

2031
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,560
So it is what I am thinking
process, right?

2032
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:27,400
It is a time ticking activity,
but the same thing

2033
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:30,920
if you're doing in the automation,
you have selenium set up with you

2034
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,720
and you're executing everything
by automation, right?

2035
02:09:34,160 --> 02:09:38,400
What this
what we do instead of this nine days, know

2036
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:42,000
how many people you need
to execute this script just to one.

2037
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:42,960
Right?

2038
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:46,320
And this one guy
also will put how much efforts

2039
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:50,160
he or she just needs to execute
one combined.

2040
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:51,000
Right.

2041
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,080
And once you execute one command,
it will execute all of your script,

2042
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:57,120
all of your test cases in a single shot

2043
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:59,880
because your framework
will take care of everything.

2044
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:02,880
It will generate the report,
it will take the screenshot,

2045
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:06,080
it will execute your things,
it will verify and validate

2046
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:08,360
all the verification validation
check points.

2047
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:10,640
You will get the consolidated report.

2048
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:12,480
In the end, it means what?

2049
02:10:12,480 --> 02:10:15,720
Minimal manual intervention Clear

2050
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:19,920
and then maximum based coverage.

2051
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:23,320
Obviously, when you're writing the code,
you're providing more verification

2052
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:24,720
and validation checkpoints.

2053
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:29,160
And every single time, every single time,
it might be possible

2054
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:32,520
that if I give this task to black or then
I and Andre, they hey,

2055
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:37,840
on this particular page or dashboard page,
I have 25 verification check points.

2056
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:38,640
Right?

2057
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:42,840
And if Andre is testing this
25 verification check points or validation

2058
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:47,440
check points manually, he is more likely
to with one or two or three.

2059
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:48,280
Right?

2060
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:49,600
Because we all are humans.

2061
02:10:49,600 --> 02:10:51,920
We can make mistakes, make sense.

2062
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:54,920
But if you put this 25 verification
in validation

2063
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:58,760
check points in your automation script,
how many verification

2064
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:02,520
and validation checkpoints
your automation is scripts will forget

2065
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:05,280
or will miss

2066
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:11,920
no one?

2067
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:12,920
Nothing, right?

2068
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:16,920
It will benefit and verify
all the all the mentioned

2069
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:20,720
verification validation check points
because a scripts can never go wrong.

2070
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:25,600
Whatever the code you have mentioned,
it will definitely execute.

2071
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:26,280
Right.

2072
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:30,120
So if Andre and Blake comes and say,
Hey, I've executed these things

2073
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:33,880
manually and everything is working
exceptionally fine, right?

2074
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:37,400
Your manager has a lot of faith in you
guys. Now

2075
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:41,600
he give a green signal that, all right,
deploy this grid onto the production.

2076
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:43,800
You vibe.

2077
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:44,800
You guys, you both

2078
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:47,800
guys missed at least three or four
verification validation

2079
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,680
check points and there was a problem
in those check points.

2080
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:54,400
Now, if your developers are deployed
the code onto the production,

2081
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:59,360
some or someone else
identified that loophole in the system

2082
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:07,200
or is responsible them.

2083
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:09,920
Right testers are accountable to answer

2084
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:14,440
right by because they have missed now
and same time

2085
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:17,560
the maximum test coverage rate
the test code.

2086
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:19,680
It is both down by

2087
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:23,520
because you are not giving
the complete coverage to the requirement

2088
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:26,840
that if Vladimir was something else
and you be delivered below,

2089
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:30,720
then the requirement below
the expectations, this coverage goes down.

2090
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:31,720
Right.

2091
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:35,960
But when it comes to automation
it gives you maximum test coverage.

2092
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,600
This is the another benefit
of using test automation framework.

2093
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:42,000
Make sense

2094
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:52,480
case.

2095
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:52,880
Okay.

2096
02:12:53,160 --> 02:12:57,320
Now the another point
is the usability of code, right?

2097
02:12:58,200 --> 02:13:01,520
When we talk about visibility,
it means I gave you this example

2098
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:03,000
all the little three nights, right?

2099
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,880
So I hope you know,
what is the usability code

2100
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:10,000
once use every bit
this is simply code usability.

2101
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:13,160
That's what we did yesterday
when we were learning

2102
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:17,440
our test, in part by the mistakes
where we have used this precondition

2103
02:13:17,560 --> 02:13:32,880
and post condition,
all the places correct.

2104
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,280
All right, fine.

2105
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:38,760
So now, now let's proceed further.

2106
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:43,320
And this is the time to understand
how are we going to implement,

2107
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:46,680
how are we going to implement
every single thing from here?

2108
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:49,840
All right,
Let's do the things practically more,

2109
02:13:49,840 --> 02:14:27,520
practically more.

2110
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:31,200
All right, fine, Guys, please let me know
once you're able to see my screen

2111
02:14:38,720 --> 02:14:40,920
of framework is project based.

2112
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:42,960
What does it mean?

2113
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:46,200
I mean, we have to
we have to create a framework

2114
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:51,960
which is project
defining Project Independent.

2115
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:52,760
All right.

2116
02:14:52,760 --> 02:14:53,960
So now

2117
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:59,120
some of the important ingredients,
some of the important ingredient side,

2118
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:01,480
the vital ingredients we have right

2119
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:04,600
to create a theme.

2120
02:15:04,600 --> 02:15:19,320
But what are these vital ingredients
we need first, programing language,

2121
02:15:19,800 --> 02:15:20,600
correct.

2122
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:24,560
Which programing language
we are using based

2123
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:29,880
on Java

2124
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:38,800
Python, RB

2125
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:44,760
components.

2126
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:49,720
Now we are going to work on our texture

2127
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:53,160
and this application.

2128
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:56,520
All right.

2129
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:57,280
Yes, Yes.

2130
02:15:57,280 --> 02:16:00,120
I'm telling you,
it's it's out in this application.

2131
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:03,800
Remember, whenever we work on framework,
we should keep this things in mind.

2132
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:09,200
Great selection of tools and technologies
according to the project.

2133
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:12,200
Right? According to the project.

2134
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:17,040
So now, right now, right now,
when I'm going to create this framework

2135
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:20,560
from scratch, what are the things
I should have first in place?

2136
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:22,800
That's what I'm trying to identify.

2137
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,680
So this thing, it's animate application

2138
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:31,040
is what kind of application?

2139
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:34,280
I mean, it is mobile application,
it is benefits, correct?

2140
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:37,320
This is my web based application, right.

2141
02:16:37,640 --> 02:16:42,880
So to automate web based application,
which tool I have to use

2142
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:47,280
web automation tool.

2143
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:56,600
Right.

2144
02:16:56,600 --> 02:16:58,000
We have

2145
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,520
an Indian, correct.

2146
02:17:05,520 --> 02:17:08,520
Now, Now one thing.

2147
02:17:09,080 --> 02:17:10,280
Second thing.

2148
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:11,480
Third thing.

2149
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:14,800
We observed a couple of loopholes

2150
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:20,120
in the Selenium alone, Selenium
can't do every single thing, right.

2151
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:23,120
So we did one integration here.

2152
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:28,920
What was that for additional features,

2153
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:29,480
Right?

2154
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:36,440
So integration, what we had is

2155
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:38,280
yes, correct.

2156
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:39,320
To be used.

2157
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:39,960
What.

2158
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:42,840
Speak up guys. You're correct.

2159
02:17:42,840 --> 02:17:44,800
You're saying correct. Right.

2160
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:46,240
And stingy.

2161
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:47,560
Right

2162
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:52,440
now. Yes.

2163
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:53,960
Now let's see.

2164
02:17:53,960 --> 02:17:56,320
And I turned to Mike and say, hey, Mike,

2165
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:59,520
you have written this code

2166
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:01,680
condition enforcement mission for log in.

2167
02:18:01,680 --> 02:18:05,360
Mike says, yes, because I'm almost done
with my log in scenario.

2168
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:08,520
And I said, all right,
I'm going to work on an employee.

2169
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:12,320
So I was busy today
in identifying the locate storm

2170
02:18:12,320 --> 02:18:15,680
dashboard page from Pimp
B from an employee page.

2171
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,320
But then I realized that you already
logged on to log into functionality.

2172
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:23,000
So do you have a pre-condition
enforced condition?

2173
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:25,440
Mike says, Yes, I have.

2174
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:27,880
And I said, All right, same to me.

2175
02:18:27,880 --> 02:18:29,520
What Mike would do in that case

2176
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:31,200
will.

2177
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:40,040
Mike, send it in the slack. Yes.

2178
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:43,200
Because if he sends this in the slack
right, then

2179
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:46,760
he will get escalation from the clean

2180
02:18:46,760 --> 02:18:48,000
water escalation.

2181
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,640
Your code should never be
can never be shared.

2182
02:18:51,640 --> 02:18:55,960
It must not be shared to any any channel
anywhere.

2183
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:00,200
Right.

2184
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:04,200
You can't even share your code
in the document to remember.

2185
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:06,760
Guys, the code is very sensitive data.

2186
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:11,200
You have to keep your code
in the client environment.

2187
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:13,680
In the customer environment,
that is very important.

2188
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:16,000
Remember, guys, this are the

2189
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,600
parts of your professionalism
you have to understand store.

2190
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:22,280
You have to keep your code in your

2191
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:27,920
login control.

2192
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:28,760
Correct.

2193
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:35,640
So which one we are using?

2194
02:19:35,640 --> 02:19:38,680
Got GitHub.

2195
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:43,080
Yeah, we are using GitHub.

2196
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:44,080
Correct. Banks.

2197
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:47,760
And now in this case
when that comes in, ask to Mike,

2198
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:49,200
am I going to give me the code?

2199
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:51,800
Mike will say,
all right, I'm going to commit to it.

2200
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:53,760
I completely understood ready. So

2201
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:56,760
I'm going to commit in the GitHub.

2202
02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:59,840
You can take the updated code from there,
just pull this code

2203
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:01,320
and then everything will be.

2204
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:03,800
Is everything shared in GitHub
open for everyone?

2205
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,120
No, it should not be open for everyone.

2206
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:10,520
Dave The access that has access
will be given to only the team members,

2207
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:13,520
so only team members can access
to that particular project.

2208
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:17,320
Not everyone.

2209
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:20,240
For example,
I gave just one example right here.

2210
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:24,000
Take Mike 40 black and Anna got promoted

2211
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,120
and they got another project,
Amazon Prime Video.

2212
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:31,880
So now till this point of time, right
when they are working in the

2213
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:36,000
in this Alexa project,
they are having the access of this right.

2214
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:39,680
But once they leave
this project officially, once they left

2215
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:43,680
and they joined another project,
then the access will be taken back

2216
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,360
from these two guys instead, whoever is
the new team will take the access back.

2217
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:51,480
Now, even
their guys cannot access the repository.

2218
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:53,400
They guys can not access the code.

2219
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:55,000
They have to commit the code.

2220
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,320
And there is a document
called photo Document.

2221
02:20:57,320 --> 02:20:58,320
Photo escapes for

2222
02:21:00,400 --> 02:21:00,920
auto.

2223
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:06,160
It means hand over, take over document
because the point games I'm extending,

2224
02:21:06,160 --> 02:21:09,960
you hand over take over documents
they have to make right.

2225
02:21:09,960 --> 02:21:14,080
And then they have to say, all right,
we are leaving the team officially.

2226
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:17,040
This is the code
we have completed in the repository.

2227
02:21:17,160 --> 02:21:21,600
We have handed over everything to this
reporting or this consenting person.

2228
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:23,240
And now we are leaving the team.

2229
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:27,480
Once they leave the team and the left,
the exits will be taken back

2230
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:35,480
again.

2231
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:36,560
All right, guys.

2232
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:39,360
So what Mike will do with this code?

2233
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,400
Indeed, what is in control?

2234
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:43,520
So we need another part
that is GitHub, right, guys?

2235
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:46,440
And then we need this structure.

2236
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:48,240
We were talking about the structure,
right?

2237
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:50,240
So We need one,

2238
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:52,680
basically. Right.

2239
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:55,760
We need one. Brings it back to is

2240
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,160
Marvin.

2241
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:59,880
Why we need this tool?

2242
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:05,640
Because we need to make our project
highly flexible, highly customizable,

2243
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:08,000
highly adaptable project

2244
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:11,960
platform,
independent, every single thing, right?

2245
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:14,240
We should not pass anything hardcoded.

2246
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:18,360
So we need to achieve all of this
features in our framework.

2247
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:19,480
We need

2248
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:23,000
basic tools and that big is your maven.

2249
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:27,880
All right? Yes.

2250
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:31,440
Yes. From today onwards,
Maven is the backbone for everything.

2251
02:22:32,040 --> 02:22:34,120
We will deal with Maven.

2252
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:37,720
Forget about the project,
about the normal classes and everything.

2253
02:22:38,120 --> 02:22:41,200
We will create
every single thing in seven project.

2254
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:45,600
So these are the things Java, Selenium,
extended GitHub maven.

2255
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:48,240
We need most important thing

2256
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:02,120
are you going to implement, right?

2257
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:06,600
You are going to implement
all of this things integrate

2258
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:18,520
all of the things in your idea
that is intelligent.

2259
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:24,160
So these are the things, these are
the things we are going to implement.

2260
02:23:24,480 --> 02:23:29,920
All right.

2261
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:33,320
Nor I can totally understand
since the topic is very crucial, right?

2262
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:35,520
I don't want any destruction.

2263
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:38,960
These just 5 minutes
and then you can go on a break.

2264
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:43,720
Alright.

2265
02:23:43,720 --> 02:23:44,800
All right.

2266
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:47,080
An idea or That's what I was thinking.

2267
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:51,720
But since they guys are expecting break
so that's why I said this.

2268
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:52,360
All right.

2269
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:56,000
So now this intelligent by trait
insight intelligent we

2270
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,160
Java, Selenium, extended
GitHub, everything.

2271
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:01,840
Alright so let's get started from here

2272
02:24:03,080 --> 02:24:05,480
you'll see here Java test and selenium

2273
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:09,000
get in there And these are the five things
I was talking about, right.

2274
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:13,560
I gave you the example
also why we need these five things.

2275
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:14,640
All right,

2276
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:18,520
now let's first understand what is this 11

2277
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:24,240
build automation and management
tool, right?

2278
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:29,680
But it allows developers

2279
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:33,000
to create a project
using form and plugins.

2280
02:24:33,240 --> 02:24:35,800
Now, when I say BOM,
there are two types of bom.

2281
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:36,960
I think they do, right?

2282
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:41,160
We need to understand
these two things and plugins right now.

2283
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:43,400
First, let's create this project right?

2284
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:48,000
And after creation of the project
I will explain every single point

2285
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:52,040
here.

2286
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:56,560
Well, all right.

2287
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:58,360
Shall we start

2288
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:00,600
already?

2289
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:05,920
Everyone with

2290
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:10,640
now, many of you guys
didn't find my video helpful.

2291
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:14,520
So now let's start from here
this is our previous framework, right?

2292
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:17,360
This is our previous part.

2293
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:18,360
Then automate testing.

2294
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:21,600
Now click on file

2295
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:25,840
mill.

2296
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:28,480
So click on file

2297
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:47,760
new and then click on

2298
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:57,120
Project.

2299
02:25:57,120 --> 02:25:59,400
These guys go to watch it.

2300
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:00,000
Right.

2301
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,680
Subscribe also so
that you can get upcoming videos as well.

2302
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:07,080
They're fine.

2303
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:08,680
No, no.

2304
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:12,000
The next thing is next thing
when you are on this screen

2305
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:15,000
because we are not going to deal

2306
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:18,120
with Java project anymore anymore

2307
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:22,680
we have to deal with which one?

2308
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:23,040
Yeah.

2309
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:32,680
Did you do it?

2310
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:33,600
Jamal?

2311
02:26:34,440 --> 02:26:39,240
Thank you so much, guys. No.

2312
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:46,720
Did you do it?

2313
02:26:46,720 --> 02:26:48,520
All right, fine.

2314
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:58,160
I will post some more code videos now.

2315
02:26:58,160 --> 02:26:59,400
All right, guys.

2316
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:01,120
Now see here

2317
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:04,120
that I respect that.

2318
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:06,400
Now here we have to select one.

2319
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:07,600
Correct?

2320
02:27:08,680 --> 02:27:18,360
We have to select seven.

2321
02:27:18,360 --> 02:27:20,760
Great, great. Select the one.

2322
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:25,560
These is the part
when it says loading of type list

2323
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:28,680
lytic load,

2324
02:27:28,680 --> 02:27:30,920
but we don't have to do anything from here

2325
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:34,040
by because what is this obj type?

2326
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:37,360
Basically this arch type is right.

2327
02:27:37,360 --> 02:27:40,200
It provides you a template.

2328
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:40,920
It provides.

2329
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:42,320
These are the

2330
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:43,760
similar templates.

2331
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:45,520
What kind of templates?

2332
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:51,720
For example, there are some predefined
functionality you need or developers need?

2333
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:57,080
So most of the times when developers
work right and they create a project from,

2334
02:27:57,080 --> 02:28:00,920
they need some specific arch type
from here according to their requirement

2335
02:28:01,200 --> 02:28:03,080
because they need to build
the application,

2336
02:28:03,080 --> 02:28:06,520
they need to develop the application,
they need to write the code.

2337
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:07,080
Right?

2338
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:10,280
So we are not very specific
on selecting the arch type.

2339
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:13,400
What we will do is right,

2340
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:16,040
because if I have selected
this checkbox clear

2341
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:19,800
arch type by default it will give us two

2342
02:28:20,360 --> 02:28:24,760
because you my you must have created
any project in the past project entry

2343
02:28:25,480 --> 02:28:28,560
and if you had created any project
in Anaya,

2344
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:32,880
then these words are to write
your debut as an object.

2345
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:35,560
These are the by default are shape.
You got.

2346
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:38,680
So next time
when you try to create new project right

2347
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:41,160
by default
it will give you these two options.

2348
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:44,440
And when you select this checkbox,
it will select these two

2349
02:28:44,440 --> 02:28:51,240
by default.

2350
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:51,840
All right.

2351
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:54,320
So now I'm not going to select anyone,
right?

2352
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:56,040
Let it give.

2353
02:28:56,040 --> 02:28:58,640
Which one will you create from arch type?

2354
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:00,840
Is everyone on the same screen with me

2355
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:02,760
when I select

2356
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:14,360
this checkbox?

2357
02:29:14,360 --> 02:29:15,120
Great.

2358
02:29:15,560 --> 02:29:20,760
Now the next thing is click on next.

2359
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:23,560
It is asking for the name,
the project name.

2360
02:29:24,760 --> 02:29:26,800
So let's say our project name is

2361
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:49,000
correct.

2362
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:51,160
Destiny Framework match thing.

2363
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:54,520
Alright, now this is not enough.

2364
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:57,120
This is not enough seeing here.

2365
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,760
See it is asking for group I.D.

2366
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:02,440
and 80

2367
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:05,080
black.

2368
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:07,960
We just. We just selected the checkbox.

2369
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:15,360
We just selected the checkbox.

2370
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:16,720
All right, so now here.

2371
02:30:16,720 --> 02:30:19,840
What is this group
and what is this artifact I.D.?

2372
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:21,640
So let me give you a one
very good example.

2373
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:24,800
But remember, remember when you talk

2374
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:26,840
about this group and artifact ID,

2375
02:30:28,080 --> 02:30:30,720
you guys are working, right?

2376
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:32,520
Let's see.

2377
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:37,640
Black or Nina and N Mike,
they guys are working in Amazon.

2378
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:41,320
This group ID is the name of your company

2379
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:45,960
organization or even in the organization.

2380
02:30:46,200 --> 02:30:51,440
If you have several department and you are
working in that particular department,

2381
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:55,560
you need to give the name inside
here of the company name

2382
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:57,400
all of their department name.

2383
02:30:57,400 --> 02:31:01,360
So for example,
even or do talk or conduct.

2384
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:04,480
So for example, you guys are working
for your Amazon, right?

2385
02:31:04,480 --> 02:31:06,640
Or here we are working for which one

2386
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:14,840
syntax.

2387
02:31:15,160 --> 02:31:17,760
Got it. So I'm keeping it syntax.

2388
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:21,000
You can separate anything,
whatever you want to do.

2389
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:23,960
Now, this artifact ID

2390
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:28,560
this artifact ID
is the name of your project.

2391
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:31,720
For example, in Amazon, if Mike Olin and

2392
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:36,440
and and Blank,
they are working on Alexa, right?

2393
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:39,160
So that IP factory would be Alexa

2394
02:31:39,560 --> 02:31:42,920
if blank and and is working on Amazon
Prime video,

2395
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:48,040
then their identity would be APB,
Amazon Prime video like this.

2396
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:48,960
Or it could be anything.

2397
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:53,480
It's correct so com dots
and because this is my organization name

2398
02:31:54,040 --> 02:31:57,400
or even if you're working, let's say
I'm working in e-commerce department

2399
02:31:57,400 --> 02:32:01,680
enterprise Quality Solutions, the business
my department in my company

2400
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:04,920
so I would write
com dot equals department.

2401
02:32:05,560 --> 02:32:08,640
Similarly you guys can write
your department or company name

2402
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:10,240
and here the project name.

2403
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:12,360
So my project is it's out of

2404
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:13,800
order.

2405
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:16,360
You can write in this simple one
which I in this right

2406
02:32:17,320 --> 02:32:21,000
there is no criteria
for guest density or something so

2407
02:32:22,280 --> 02:32:23,040
simple

2408
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:28,000
so far in
providing the name of the project group.

2409
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:30,120
And I think that maybe.

2410
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:33,120
Do you guys have any confusion
or any question

2411
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:34,360
in this one

2412
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:50,240
so far clear everyone.

2413
02:32:50,240 --> 02:32:51,000
All right.

2414
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,760
So let's go ahead and click on finish,

2415
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:56,400
click, finish.

2416
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:59,880
It will ask you
where would you like to open the project?

2417
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:02,480
So just select a new window.
We need fresh instance.

2418
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:17,520
So there is a new window.

2419
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:18,640
There you go.

2420
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:22,280
You got this structure?

2421
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:29,000
No, we don't need to open anything.

2422
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:35,200
So my default setting is it always opens
in the new broad browser or new window.

2423
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:52,800
So is it opening the new window like this?

2424
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:55,400
All right, great. Then it's fine now.

2425
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:59,800
Now, if you see the very first thing
here is by default,

2426
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:01,640
it is giving one instruction here.

2427
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:05,480
If you see right by default
it is giving me one structure.

2428
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:10,360
Then if I'm going inside,
it is giving me men and post

2429
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:13,160
to different packages.

2430
02:34:13,160 --> 02:34:15,520
It is giving me right inside main.

2431
02:34:15,520 --> 02:34:17,600
It is giving me java and resources.

2432
02:34:17,880 --> 02:34:20,560
Inside it is giving me Java.

2433
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:26,640
Can everyone see this?

2434
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:27,840
That's fine.

2435
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:29,600
As of now, it is fine.

2436
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:34,200
Let's see.

2437
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:36,360
Okay, so everyone can see it, right?

2438
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:40,880
Main interest
if you It's light green Java salad.

2439
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:42,640
Green Java. Okay. All right.

2440
02:34:42,640 --> 02:34:53,360
This is just because it belongs
to a different back text. My.

2441
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:56,720
All right, so now, guys, if you see why,

2442
02:34:57,200 --> 02:35:02,280
why we have this main interest
optional unit two, you need to select

2443
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:05,320
once again this MAVEN project
and then you will get many testable

2444
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:09,040
because identity should come main
and this table should come.

2445
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:15,360
So by here if you see by
we have main interest, can somebody guess

2446
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:18,440
why is it so?

2447
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:22,160
Because the developers of the memory tool
right must have part of it.

2448
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:27,120
That's why they gave you two different.

2449
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:30,200
Yes, exactly. The main folders.

2450
02:35:30,520 --> 02:35:34,440
We didn't really use this main folder
to develop the application.

2451
02:35:34,440 --> 02:35:38,040
The code B right just for the development
of the application.

2452
02:35:38,040 --> 02:35:40,240
We write this code in main folder.

2453
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:44,560
In the code
we tried to best the application.

2454
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:49,000
We keep that code and we write the code
inside the best folder.

2455
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:55,080
Correct.

2456
02:35:55,080 --> 02:35:58,400
So where are we going to write
every single thing in main

2457
02:35:58,400 --> 02:35:59,880
or interest

2458
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:09,560
interest folder?

2459
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:11,320
Let's close this bar.

2460
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:14,160
We will deal only with this one.

2461
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:23,320
Okay.

2462
02:36:23,320 --> 02:36:28,440
All your convert symbol is not any sort of
see it is a part of your project.

2463
02:36:28,760 --> 02:36:32,400
If it was inside your inside, your idea
it is RC.

2464
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:34,760
It would have come when you open data.

2465
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:37,120
See, it is not coming
under these equations.

2466
02:36:37,160 --> 02:36:39,160
It is a part of your framework.

2467
02:36:39,160 --> 02:36:42,360
So it doesn't it doesn't matter
whether it appears here or it appears

2468
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:45,840
it is fine, right.

2469
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,800
So meant that it is a no no.

2470
02:36:47,800 --> 02:36:50,240
So now simply right click on it.

2471
02:36:50,240 --> 02:36:52,560
And if you want to delete, go ahead.

2472
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:54,280
We will believe this.

2473
02:36:54,280 --> 02:36:56,240
No more confusion in our project

2474
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:03,760
main folder
we didn't really use to keep the code.

2475
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:06,640
We generally write
to develop the application.

2476
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:10,560
All right,
so many developers use min folder

2477
02:37:11,160 --> 02:37:13,560
as a tester, as an automation engineer.

2478
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:20,760
We don't use it, but it.

2479
02:37:20,760 --> 02:37:22,760
Yeah, that's kind of it.

2480
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:24,000
That's fine.

2481
02:37:24,960 --> 02:37:27,080
So now so far, any confusion,

2482
02:37:27,080 --> 02:37:36,720
guys?

2483
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:37,440
Great.

2484
02:37:37,560 --> 02:37:41,760
Now let's come here
on to the explanation part.

2485
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:45,880
It says it allows the developer
to create project using page object

2486
02:37:45,880 --> 02:37:49,840
models and plugins,
and it helps to build project

2487
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:53,000
dependency and documentation.

2488
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:57,680
Maven allows the developer
to automate the process of creation

2489
02:37:57,680 --> 02:38:01,720
of initial folder structure,
performing the compilation and testing

2490
02:38:01,720 --> 02:38:04,880
and the package and the deployment
of the final product pipeline.

2491
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:08,280
Now you see the main important

2492
02:38:08,280 --> 02:38:11,400
point is the main important point is

2493
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:17,400
great.

2494
02:38:17,400 --> 02:38:18,200
Mike.

2495
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:24,280
Now here, see, this is my simplified.

2496
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:26,360
Yes, correct.

2497
02:38:26,360 --> 02:38:32,040
Correct.

2498
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:36,160
Now this is my vertex admin file
and in this form

2499
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,360
and if you observe the group already,

2500
02:38:39,400 --> 02:38:42,960
which I did, is available here
as my company name,

2501
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:46,560
this is article, this is my project name

2502
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:49,640
and this is the Virgin
by default from MAVEN

2503
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:52,720
that is 1.0 snapshot

2504
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:59,640
clear, clear

2505
02:38:59,880 --> 02:39:09,040
to everyone.

2506
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:10,960
Okay, fine.

2507
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:14,280
Do you want me to go
a bit further with the extension

2508
02:39:14,280 --> 02:39:25,680
or you guys need a break?

2509
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:30,480
You Great.

2510
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:34,280
First time
students are asking to continue.

2511
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:35,600
That's great.

2512
02:39:36,200 --> 02:39:50,280
All right, now.

2513
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:51,120
All right,

2514
02:39:52,720 --> 02:39:54,800
now. Here, here.

2515
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:59,560
The most the most important concept
I'm going to explain now right?

2516
02:39:59,560 --> 02:40:01,880
So please pay complete attention here.

2517
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:05,440
I'm saying here is so far,

2518
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:09,760
we did the job files, correct.

2519
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:13,360
Now, when we added the job files,
how did we do it?

2520
02:40:13,800 --> 02:40:18,600
We have added all the jobs manually.

2521
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:18,960
Correct.

2522
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:24,080
Now, when

2523
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:27,600
I say I date the data files manually,

2524
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:31,560
then what is the issue with adding
the job files manually?

2525
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:34,680
Remember I was telling one,
I was giving one

2526
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:38,160
example
and I came to Mike and ask, Hey, can I?

2527
02:40:38,160 --> 02:40:40,200
Your code and Mike's is all right.

2528
02:40:40,200 --> 02:40:42,400
I'm going to commit this code
in the repository.

2529
02:40:42,680 --> 02:40:44,920
Go ahead and take this code from there.

2530
02:40:45,440 --> 02:40:47,080
Right, Fine.

2531
02:40:47,080 --> 02:40:51,000
You have added all the files
manually in your project.

2532
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:52,800
Understandable.

2533
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:57,880
But Mike has added
the jobs in his machine right.

2534
02:40:57,880 --> 02:41:01,120
So where are the job files?

2535
02:41:01,120 --> 02:41:01,640
Where are that?

2536
02:41:01,640 --> 02:41:04,200
You are actually in the machine itself.

2537
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:06,080
All right,

2538
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:08,800
let me open framework.

2539
02:41:08,800 --> 02:41:10,680
Right. This one. Right.

2540
02:41:10,680 --> 02:41:12,720
And if I go here inside of my

2541
02:41:14,360 --> 02:41:15,800
project structure,

2542
02:41:15,800 --> 02:41:18,200
these are the jobs behind it correct.

2543
02:41:19,040 --> 02:41:20,800
That is Indian. The Selenium gets the

2544
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:26,120
if you'll see it is giving me this fact

2545
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:29,480
and me
this part belongs to my local machine

2546
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:31,160
or not

2547
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:36,560
local machine.

2548
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:37,200
Right.

2549
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:40,200
But what we said in the framework
being said,

2550
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:44,240
our framework should be platform
independent.

2551
02:41:44,520 --> 02:41:49,080
Correct.

2552
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:55,160
Now if you commit this code
in the repository and in this updated code

2553
02:41:55,160 --> 02:42:00,160
or take the pull of code in a machine,
will she be able to follow this?

2554
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:03,880
Will she be able to find this
particular jobs in her machine this way?

2555
02:42:04,320 --> 02:42:09,120
Well,
this is going to work on her machine.

2556
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:11,000
No, it will not work.

2557
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:15,480
Why? Because jobs were available
in someone else's machine, right?

2558
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:19,080
The bot belongs to someone else's,
not her machine.

2559
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:22,320
What she has to do in this case,
she has to.

2560
02:42:22,560 --> 02:42:26,680
She has to download all the data files
once again in her machine

2561
02:42:26,680 --> 02:42:28,440
to make this project working

2562
02:42:29,480 --> 02:42:30,200
correctly.

2563
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:35,160
The same issue, let's say are
you have 20 members in your team, right?

2564
02:42:35,160 --> 02:42:37,880
The same issue exists
for all the team members.

2565
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:44,800
So is it the right approach
to add the jobs manually in the project?

2566
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:47,760
Not right in this case.

2567
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:53,560
In this case, Maven says
you don't need to add anything manually.

2568
02:42:53,720 --> 02:42:54,760
You just do one thing.

2569
02:42:54,760 --> 02:42:56,800
You don't even need to add jobs.

2570
02:42:57,720 --> 02:42:59,520
You don't even need to a job to find out.

2571
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:05,160
What you can do is you can simply add
the dependency of your job in my file.

2572
02:43:05,320 --> 02:43:10,240
And then what I will do basically is
I will add all the dependencies

2573
02:43:10,240 --> 02:43:14,720
and the libraries for that particular job,
and then I will integrate

2574
02:43:14,720 --> 02:43:18,760
all this things in your project, all only

2575
02:43:19,800 --> 02:43:20,720
getting my point.

2576
02:43:20,720 --> 02:43:23,920
So which file
which by this date we are going to add

2577
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:26,840
all these job files,
we are going to add this dependencies.

2578
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:29,800
We need one
backbone of the project, right?

2579
02:43:29,880 --> 02:43:32,120
We need the Indian. Exactly.

2580
02:43:32,120 --> 02:43:35,480
The Indian have here
The backbone we have of the project

2581
02:43:35,480 --> 02:43:38,520
is bomb dot x email configuration file.

2582
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:41,600
You can consider this longer
email configuration

2583
02:43:41,600 --> 02:43:44,000
file as the backbone of your project.

2584
02:43:44,680 --> 02:43:49,000
Remember we were talking about best and do
detect similar file in earlier classes.

2585
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:49,440
Right?

2586
02:43:49,440 --> 02:43:54,480
So we were seeing this distant symbol
is a configuration file now, but this time

2587
02:43:54,560 --> 02:43:57,840
we are not going to deal with this
then do not accessible fight anymore.

2588
02:43:58,040 --> 02:44:00,600
We are going to deal with 1.75

2589
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:02,560
correct correct

2590
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:12,720
grade.

2591
02:44:12,720 --> 02:44:13,400
All right.

2592
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:15,600
So now, now let's go ahead

2593
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:19,480
and add the dependencies informed X
and build file first.

2594
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:22,600
And then I will tell you how this bonded
accessible

2595
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:25,240
file books right there.

2596
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:29,840
So to add the dependency guys,
tell me is the very first dependency

2597
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:38,120
we need to add, right?

2598
02:44:38,200 --> 02:44:39,720
The very first one. Right.

2599
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:42,760
So if you go through here,
if you here right

2600
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:47,000
it will tell you this diagram, Radio Java,
we already have it.

2601
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,080
I think they do with selenium.

2602
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:51,840
We need this synergy right.

2603
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:56,120
So let's go ahead and do it one by one.

2604
02:44:56,120 --> 02:44:56,840
Yes, yes, yes.

2605
02:44:56,840 --> 02:44:58,400
I will tell you this also, don't worry.

2606
02:44:58,400 --> 02:45:00,440
It is it is in pipeline.

2607
02:45:00,480 --> 02:45:02,800
Don't worry about
it. All right. Everything

2608
02:45:04,040 --> 02:45:07,080
now, I came here

2609
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:11,520
on the memory deposit right

2610
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:14,000
in this memory repository.

2611
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,560
I will write for selenium post.

2612
02:45:16,960 --> 02:45:18,520
I'm going to write

2613
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:21,360
spinning.

2614
02:45:21,360 --> 02:45:21,760
Right.

2615
02:45:21,760 --> 02:45:24,840
Open the memory repository
and type selenium.

2616
02:45:25,400 --> 02:45:27,720
Everyone, please do it.

2617
02:45:27,720 --> 02:45:31,480
Because the very first thing, what I need
is I need the dependency of Selenium.

2618
02:45:31,480 --> 02:45:40,960
Correct.

2619
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:43,560
It gives you this
first option, Selenium Java.

2620
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:47,600
If this all in the 912 reasons

2621
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:50,880
bothered about this
we are looking for this selenium Java.

2622
02:45:51,400 --> 02:46:01,080
Is everyone on the same page with me.

2623
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:06,280
Then click on this selenium java.

2624
02:46:06,280 --> 02:46:08,120
Now when you come inside this

2625
02:46:08,120 --> 02:46:12,320
you will see all the virgins available
right the way we did in testing.

2626
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:12,720
Great.

2627
02:46:12,720 --> 02:46:16,680
We have seen all divergence available
and we can select anyone from it.

2628
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:20,720
So let's take the most straightforward
one 395 downloads.

2629
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:24,480
I can see you suggest 395 for this one.

2630
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:25,800
So I'm going to take this one.

2631
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:29,360
Remember, you can take any one from here,
anyone from here.

2632
02:46:29,360 --> 02:46:33,080
But I'm going to take this one because
I can see number of downloads yet are more

2633
02:46:34,240 --> 02:46:34,920
trustworthy.

2634
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:37,120
One the stable one, the compatible one.

2635
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:39,480
I'm going to take what you can take
any one

2636
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:41,520
click on it.

2637
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:44,640
3.141

2638
02:46:44,680 --> 02:46:48,680
are not actually the current ones
are the latest ones,

2639
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:51,640
but sometimes even I've experienced this
there.

2640
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:56,120
Sometimes if you use the latest
there might be some compatibility issue.

2641
02:46:56,120 --> 02:46:59,160
Might be I'm not seeing that.

2642
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:02,160
So that's why I'm thinking
which is most number of downloads. Why?

2643
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:05,800
Because obviously it is working in
so many machines.

2644
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:12,440
That's my most number most number of guys,
you know, downloading this one, correct.

2645
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:14,960
So now everyone is on this page

2646
02:47:25,720 --> 02:47:27,760
earlier be used to download this jar.

2647
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:30,600
Right.
I need to be used for download this jar.

2648
02:47:30,640 --> 02:47:32,960
Now things are changed.

2649
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:35,280
We are not going to add any job.

2650
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:39,520
What are we going to do is you'll see
it says you have my one project.

2651
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:44,040
I say Yes, I have met and project it says,
All right then add this dependance,

2652
02:47:44,880 --> 02:47:47,160
so just copy this dependency from here

2653
02:47:48,240 --> 02:47:48,720
in this

2654
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:52,120
maverick tab
you will see this dependency here right.

2655
02:47:52,120 --> 02:47:54,520
So just copy this dependency from here.

2656
02:47:55,840 --> 02:47:57,920
Go into your project

2657
02:47:57,920 --> 02:48:01,800
and here you have to add this dependency.

2658
02:48:01,800 --> 02:48:05,000
Now, when I add this dependency,
it is giving me the error, right?

2659
02:48:05,360 --> 02:48:07,760
Because it should be followed by

2660
02:48:09,480 --> 02:48:11,240
dependencies.

2661
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:12,560
Why dependencies?

2662
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:14,560
Because of this the I'm going to add

2663
02:48:15,360 --> 02:48:17,520
my people dependency, right?

2664
02:48:17,560 --> 02:48:20,080
Not one dependency right now.

2665
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:22,000
I did one dependency.

2666
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,680
After some time
I will add one more dependency

2667
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:28,160
then one more dependency,
then one more dependency like this.

2668
02:48:28,160 --> 02:48:28,640
Right.

2669
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:31,640
So all these dependencies come one

2670
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:40,400
because dependency.

2671
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:45,240
Now when you guys do it right,
if you guys see the red icon

2672
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:49,920
right there or any error, right
click on the project, reload from here

2673
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:52,640
or just simply restart your intelligence,

2674
02:48:53,200 --> 02:48:56,240
it will work.

2675
02:48:56,240 --> 02:48:59,280
So far
we have added the selenium dependency,

2676
02:48:59,640 --> 02:49:04,400
correct.

2677
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:08,720
Now, another advantage I can tell you
when you are downloading the jar files

2678
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:13,520
right before going through these methods
and repository repository,

2679
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:16,200
what you were doing,
you were searching for test

2680
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:20,160
and did your files in some other location
you were searching for.

2681
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:20,640
Selenium.

2682
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:24,680
Java is in some other location you are
searching for any other data files.

2683
02:49:24,680 --> 02:49:27,600
Mix it up what your comments
or IO in any other location.

2684
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:28,120
Right.

2685
02:49:28,280 --> 02:49:29,320
Your methods is.

2686
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:31,360
I have a central repository.

2687
02:49:31,360 --> 02:49:35,360
You can find selenium best in Apache
all months io

2688
02:49:35,360 --> 02:49:37,560
every single thing in one place.

2689
02:49:38,480 --> 02:49:40,560
So it is kind of super shop, right?

2690
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:41,240
Super market.

2691
02:49:41,240 --> 02:49:44,080
Then you will find every single thing
that right.

2692
02:49:44,360 --> 02:49:45,920
So now this time.

2693
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:50,680
Now this time we don't have to go
and added jobs manually

2694
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:53,720
And then we come across a problem
that hey, I waited for jobs

2695
02:49:53,800 --> 02:49:56,960
or five jobs or six just no one.

2696
02:49:57,040 --> 02:50:01,200
We take care of everything and we take
care of every single thing on its own.

2697
02:50:01,440 --> 02:50:20,800
All right.

2698
02:50:20,800 --> 02:50:29,400
All right, guys. So

2699
02:50:30,480 --> 02:50:33,800
the first dependency we have added now.

2700
02:50:34,440 --> 02:50:36,440
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

2701
02:50:36,440 --> 02:50:40,280
Do what you have to do is basically
you have to reload your project from

2702
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:43,800
intelligent later from this

2703
02:50:43,800 --> 02:50:48,520
or after this,
even if it exist, to simply close your up

2704
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:55,840
intelligent and restarted.

2705
02:50:55,840 --> 02:50:58,920
Now here if you said right
it says group ID

2706
02:50:59,160 --> 02:51:03,120
and I think that today in this dependency
and you see today's group ID

2707
02:51:03,440 --> 02:51:06,200
and I think that remember we also give

2708
02:51:06,200 --> 02:51:09,200
group ID here.

2709
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:11,600
Can you see the similarity

2710
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:15,120
VI because it says
which organization it belongs to.

2711
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:18,840
So organization is all two thirds
and in HQ, Right.

2712
02:51:19,240 --> 02:51:20,120
Which organization?

2713
02:51:20,120 --> 02:51:21,600
Selenium HQ.

2714
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:25,440
This is the organization
and artifact ideas of the project.

2715
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:26,360
So which is the project?

2716
02:51:26,360 --> 02:51:28,600
It's a selenium Java, right?

2717
02:51:28,920 --> 02:51:30,320
It might be a selenium

2718
02:51:31,400 --> 02:51:33,440
Python made this an indium ruby.

2719
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:35,760
Selenium for selenium shell.

2720
02:51:35,960 --> 02:51:37,760
Different projects. Right.

2721
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:39,720
So it is giving gifts in Indian Java.

2722
02:51:39,720 --> 02:51:49,800
So that's why this is Project Clear.

2723
02:51:49,800 --> 02:52:00,640
All we can see.

2724
02:52:00,640 --> 02:52:04,280
So when you read the project right
before the project, you must have missed

2725
02:52:04,280 --> 02:52:09,600
something in your code base shape that.

2726
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:12,400
All right. So now this is the version
I'm taking, right?

2727
02:52:12,480 --> 02:52:16,440
If you change this login, it will give you
the updated login is not issue.

2728
02:52:16,880 --> 02:52:24,760
All right.

2729
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:28,600
All right.

2730
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:29,880
So now

2731
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:33,800
now, if you'll see, I didn't add.

2732
02:52:33,960 --> 02:52:35,280
Just do one thing right.

2733
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:39,680
Just do one thing right
click maven and reload a project.

2734
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:41,120
Do this right.

2735
02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:43,920
Click on your file
maven and reload project.

2736
02:52:44,960 --> 02:52:48,400
When you click on Reload project,
what it will do after this,

2737
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:51,640
you will see here
inside your external libraries.

2738
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:56,880
It will add all this filename, just
it will add all the selenium jars.

2739
02:52:57,160 --> 02:52:58,200
See everyone

2740
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:01,200
without even

2741
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:05,040
adding any doubt,
without even adding any doubt to find

2742
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:08,240
it gives you all the added
all the job here

2743
02:53:12,840 --> 02:53:15,760
them all and agree you guys did.

2744
02:53:15,960 --> 02:53:21,560
I'm not getting any replies from you, but

2745
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:30,240
great note that I know you need a break

2746
02:53:31,720 --> 02:53:32,280
point.

2747
02:53:33,280 --> 02:53:35,760
So this is just the one we have.

2748
02:53:35,960 --> 02:53:36,720
Correct?

2749
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:38,920
Just one we have.

2750
02:53:38,920 --> 02:53:41,160
Now let's talk about the another one.

2751
02:53:41,160 --> 02:53:45,000
Tell me, guys,
what else we have added in our framework.

2752
02:53:45,360 --> 02:53:45,960
What else?

2753
02:53:45,960 --> 02:53:55,800
EDIT When we were working with this
engine with John,

2754
02:53:55,800 --> 02:54:02,480
the first is just integer, correct.

2755
02:54:02,480 --> 02:54:04,960
So let's take the standard post.

2756
02:54:04,960 --> 02:54:07,920
I will go here again, very easy approach.

2757
02:54:08,240 --> 02:54:09,440
Right. This

2758
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:13,280
right the same platform supermarket search

2759
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:18,880
the first option
it is giving me test in place subject.

2760
02:54:18,880 --> 02:54:26,840
And once everyone is here
please let me know.

2761
02:54:26,840 --> 02:54:30,240
Yeah and we will use that
also we will use git commander also.

2762
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:33,800
So now when you click passenger here,
right

2763
02:54:34,400 --> 02:54:38,680
when you click on test and here it is
giving you all of these options

2764
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:41,960
synergistic
anyone I'm going to take the most number

2765
02:54:42,040 --> 02:54:49,720
downloads 7.1.0.

2766
02:54:49,720 --> 02:54:50,480
But it

2767
02:54:55,520 --> 02:54:55,920
is copy

2768
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:58,320
this one from seven again
as our dependency

2769
02:54:59,880 --> 02:55:02,280
and when you copy from here

2770
02:55:02,920 --> 02:55:18,120
simply paste it here.

2771
02:55:18,120 --> 02:55:23,200
All right
you came here, Jamal right inside this ten

2772
02:55:23,520 --> 02:55:25,960
you selected this 7.1.0.

2773
02:55:26,520 --> 02:55:27,960
Okay.

2774
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:29,960
Invited 7.1.0.

2775
02:55:29,960 --> 02:55:34,680
Go into this maven tab and from here
then just copy this.

2776
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:35,720
Right.

2777
02:55:35,720 --> 02:55:37,880
And then you copy this

2778
02:55:38,240 --> 02:55:48,040
based to 40.

2779
02:55:48,040 --> 02:55:51,360
And now the next thing is about you

2780
02:55:51,720 --> 02:55:53,920
take the Apache boy with you.

2781
02:55:54,400 --> 02:55:57,080
So again, we will go here.

2782
02:55:57,080 --> 02:55:58,000
Why Apache boy?

2783
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:18,080
That's why we need a bunch of help, right?

2784
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:20,000
To access the files. Right.

2785
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,680
We will going to pass their data. Right.

2786
02:56:22,840 --> 02:56:26,680
So to read that data,
we need these Apache boy

2787
02:56:26,880 --> 02:56:29,560
so that I can read my data
from my Excel flight.

2788
02:56:30,400 --> 02:56:34,200
So I'm going to write up
my chip boy, and I will for it

2789
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:38,400
to search for this Apache boy.

2790
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:45,120
And you will see here a bunch of boy.

2791
02:56:45,120 --> 02:56:48,080
Right? Let's take the Apache.

2792
02:56:48,080 --> 02:56:50,240
Well, I think this one,

2793
02:56:50,920 --> 02:56:52,680
if we go, then check the Virgin.

2794
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:56,400
4.1.2.

2795
02:56:56,400 --> 02:56:57,560
Find this one.

2796
02:56:57,560 --> 02:57:01,760
So guys, from here,
when you get these two options right,

2797
02:57:01,800 --> 02:57:04,960
when you get these two options, select
the second one.

2798
02:57:04,960 --> 02:57:09,200
Apache point API based on OPC and or X7
females.

2799
02:57:09,600 --> 02:57:12,840
Right.

2800
02:57:12,840 --> 02:57:14,200
Select this.

2801
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:16,640
And here, let's

2802
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:19,440
see again most number of downloads
I can see 367

2803
02:57:19,840 --> 02:57:22,400
So just take this 141.2

2804
02:57:22,760 --> 02:57:25,520
and here you will get this boy

2805
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:29,040
or eczema and you get this dependency.

2806
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:32,080
Every one.

2807
02:57:32,080 --> 02:57:39,440
Just copy this dependency guys, copy this

2808
02:57:39,880 --> 02:57:44,080
and simply paste it here.

2809
02:57:44,080 --> 02:57:47,640
So I pasted 31 also

2810
02:57:54,120 --> 02:57:54,920
got it.

2811
02:57:54,920 --> 02:58:01,160
Every one.

2812
02:58:01,160 --> 02:58:03,640
Now, now let's take another one.

2813
02:58:04,080 --> 02:58:05,400
I'm going to take four

2814
02:58:06,480 --> 02:58:07,200
comments.

2815
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:09,560
I know why we need this comments.

2816
02:58:09,560 --> 02:58:10,800
I always

2817
02:58:12,440 --> 02:58:14,920
Apache comments I why we need you guys.

2818
02:58:14,960 --> 02:58:15,680
Tell me

2819
02:58:29,400 --> 02:58:31,480
guys, we need it again.

2820
02:58:31,480 --> 02:58:33,520
Again, I'm saying screenshots.

2821
02:58:33,600 --> 02:58:36,800
No, we need it again
to deal with the data fights.

2822
02:58:37,280 --> 02:58:39,240
All right.

2823
02:58:39,240 --> 02:58:44,880
So let me go ahead and take this
most number of downloads, 2414.

2824
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:48,880
This 12.8.0 correct.

2825
02:58:48,880 --> 02:58:49,440
Right.

2826
02:58:49,440 --> 02:58:53,360
You have to deal with the data files
to deal with what you have to do.

2827
02:58:53,560 --> 02:58:54,560
You have to close it.

2828
02:58:54,560 --> 02:58:56,680
You have to open it.
All of these things. Correct.

2829
02:58:57,240 --> 02:58:59,280
So just take this dependency.

2830
02:58:59,280 --> 02:59:02,120
2.8.0 is the virgin.

2831
02:59:02,120 --> 02:59:03,600
Copy this

2832
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:06,720
and simply

2833
02:59:08,880 --> 02:59:12,840
paste it in your project.

2834
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:15,040
So far we added four deployments. It's

2835
02:59:22,040 --> 02:59:22,920
how many of you guys

2836
02:59:22,920 --> 02:59:48,000
are done with this?

2837
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:51,840
Everyone is done great.

2838
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:55,280
Now, when you are done with this,
just to implement.

2839
02:59:55,280 --> 02:59:58,800
If your external libraries
are not updated,

2840
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:02,280
right click on your symbol.

2841
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:02,880
Going to

2842
03:00:03,960 --> 03:00:04,560
go into

2843
03:00:04,560 --> 03:00:08,800
seven and reload your project.

2844
03:00:08,800 --> 03:00:13,080
When you reload your project, it says
resolving dependencies for our project.

2845
03:00:13,320 --> 03:00:13,960
Right?

2846
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:17,520
And now here, if you'll see

2847
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:20,280
if you see it added all your Apache part

2848
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:25,160
right on your comments iReport,
write your test and you pass.

2849
03:00:25,640 --> 03:00:29,040
If you open this test and you will see
all of these things by default

2850
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:33,000
without even adding single jar fight,

2851
03:00:33,160 --> 03:00:36,880
you have all the dependencies
for all the jars.

2852
03:00:36,880 --> 03:00:43,400
Then you you have now this, then you have
now Apache Boy, you have no comments.

2853
03:00:43,400 --> 03:00:52,440
I hope you have no correct.

2854
03:00:52,440 --> 03:00:53,080
Is it correct?

2855
03:00:53,080 --> 03:01:04,200
Only one.

2856
03:01:04,200 --> 03:01:05,960
Great. All right.

2857
03:01:05,960 --> 03:01:09,360
So before going on a break,
let's consider next understand

2858
03:01:09,360 --> 03:01:12,960
the last concept I like

2859
03:01:13,360 --> 03:01:15,880
you guys
and I think you guys might think that.

2860
03:01:15,880 --> 03:01:16,400
All right.

2861
03:01:17,760 --> 03:01:18,880
Even if we have.

2862
03:01:18,880 --> 03:01:19,320
Right.

2863
03:01:19,320 --> 03:01:22,920
Even if we have this chance
here, right in our project.

2864
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:24,360
Right.

2865
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:27,240
Whatever the jobs
we have available yet in our project.

2866
03:01:27,960 --> 03:01:31,280
But still, these jobs, when we see right.

2867
03:01:31,760 --> 03:01:37,800
These jobs are available
in my machine or not,

2868
03:01:37,800 --> 03:01:40,120
these jobs are available in my machine
only.

2869
03:01:40,360 --> 03:01:41,160
Correct.

2870
03:01:42,080 --> 03:01:44,080
Currently this is intelligent.

2871
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:59,600
It is available here.

2872
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:01,840
What about web drivers? Chrome, Firefox?

2873
03:02:02,520 --> 03:02:04,160
For that I have a very good answer.

2874
03:02:04,160 --> 03:02:06,320
Right. I may give you

2875
03:02:07,280 --> 03:02:08,520
that concept.

2876
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:09,480
Right.

2877
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:11,880
We are not going to deal with drivers
anymore.

2878
03:02:12,120 --> 03:02:14,960
No more dirty
if I no more compatibility issue.

2879
03:02:15,640 --> 03:02:17,880
Don't worry about it. Don't give this.

2880
03:02:18,240 --> 03:02:19,040
You did

2881
03:02:20,760 --> 03:02:24,360
a double sided waiting for the right.

2882
03:02:24,360 --> 03:02:24,920
All right.

2883
03:02:24,920 --> 03:02:27,680
No more chrome grown driver, dirty XY,

2884
03:02:28,040 --> 03:02:30,680
no more Firefox driver, Dirty XY.

2885
03:02:30,840 --> 03:02:34,000
No more driver for Uber,
no more pipe related

2886
03:02:34,520 --> 03:02:36,920
chrome driver executable does not exist.

2887
03:02:36,960 --> 03:02:44,840
Nothing.

2888
03:02:44,840 --> 03:02:47,120
Right.
We will see that part also. Don't worry.

2889
03:02:47,800 --> 03:02:50,040
Now. Now this is that time.

2890
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:52,080
Don't understand the concept right?

2891
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:53,880
The last concept of before the break.

2892
03:02:55,080 --> 03:02:57,600
Yeah, because why did we learn it?

2893
03:02:57,600 --> 03:02:59,000
Very important question.

2894
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:02,280
You should learn this
because it is not necessary.

2895
03:03:02,280 --> 03:03:07,280
Every time that your client asks you
to create a framework from scratch.

2896
03:03:07,280 --> 03:03:07,800
Right?

2897
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:12,440
Or ask you to work only in the frame,
but there might be the requirement,

2898
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:15,360
then you have to work on a simple class.

2899
03:03:15,360 --> 03:03:17,280
This video project is so small,

2900
03:03:17,280 --> 03:03:20,920
so there you have to pass
the part of your driver in that way.

2901
03:03:21,320 --> 03:03:34,400
That's why we gave you that option right?

2902
03:03:34,400 --> 03:03:35,440
All right.

2903
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:37,440
So now

2904
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:42,200
now let me tell you

2905
03:03:42,200 --> 03:03:48,360
how this things work.

2906
03:03:48,360 --> 03:03:49,520
Let's say

2907
03:03:50,520 --> 03:03:53,040
let's see.

2908
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:55,880
This is the part which I'm trying
to explain to you here right now.

2909
03:03:55,920 --> 03:04:00,960
Okay.

2910
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:02,360
This is my machine, right?

2911
03:04:02,360 --> 03:04:07,760
So I am seeing local computer right?

2912
03:04:07,760 --> 03:04:08,680
My local machine.

2913
03:04:10,440 --> 03:04:12,640
I have my

2914
03:04:12,880 --> 03:04:15,720
intelligent yet correct.

2915
03:04:15,720 --> 03:04:19,560
And inside of my intelligent, I have one

2916
03:04:19,560 --> 03:04:20,280
project

2917
03:04:24,120 --> 03:04:24,960
database.

2918
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:28,320
And here I'm having inside my MAVEN

2919
03:04:28,320 --> 03:04:35,040
project on the.

2920
03:04:35,040 --> 03:04:36,320
Is it correct?

2921
03:04:37,560 --> 03:04:39,120
This is the setup I'm telling you

2922
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:41,960
for my local machine. Now,

2923
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:48,360
when I see the tape on symbol,
I need dependencies for selenium.

2924
03:04:48,480 --> 03:04:51,960
What it means is I have

2925
03:04:58,960 --> 03:05:02,520
never since
I have my own central repository

2926
03:05:05,920 --> 03:05:08,400
right.

2927
03:05:08,400 --> 03:05:12,720
What we have Maven
since I have one MAVEN central repository.

2928
03:05:13,360 --> 03:05:13,960
Right.

2929
03:05:14,240 --> 03:05:17,160
When you provide the dependencies
it means what

2930
03:05:18,240 --> 03:05:20,480
if from here form is the name,

2931
03:05:20,480 --> 03:05:23,640
the dependency and it is taking the jobs.

2932
03:05:24,240 --> 03:05:29,360
So for example, policies for selenium,
it will give you one cloud

2933
03:05:29,840 --> 03:05:33,200
like this, not cloud
actually it will give you one block

2934
03:05:33,640 --> 03:05:36,280
where all the selenium related jobs will

2935
03:05:37,560 --> 03:05:41,520
You are sending the request in terms of

2936
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:42,960
dependency.

2937
03:05:42,960 --> 03:05:46,680
It is giving you
all the jobs related to your dependency.

2938
03:05:47,440 --> 03:05:49,720
Similarly, similarly,

2939
03:05:49,720 --> 03:05:53,040
the another one is available
for test engine.

2940
03:05:53,760 --> 03:05:55,920
You are sending the request
for dependency.

2941
03:05:56,160 --> 03:05:59,280
It is giving you
that jobs of the dependency, right?

2942
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:01,920
That's how it is working. Now.

2943
03:06:02,480 --> 03:06:06,560
The most important point
when Mike runs this one vertex

2944
03:06:06,560 --> 03:06:10,120
and it will return all the jobs in Mike's
machine

2945
03:06:11,400 --> 03:06:14,680
when, when and now runs
it will returns the job

2946
03:06:14,800 --> 03:06:17,680
and as machine everyone runs,
everyone get the jobs.

2947
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,200
But the main point is by

2948
03:06:21,160 --> 03:06:23,440
all the jobs will be stored

2949
03:06:23,440 --> 03:06:26,360
in the same location in everyone's
machine.

2950
03:06:27,600 --> 03:06:30,880
How? Let me show you when this come right.

2951
03:06:31,320 --> 03:06:33,400
They comes here in dart

2952
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:35,720
and all that.

2953
03:06:35,720 --> 03:06:40,480
It is automatically generated
for importing everyone so machine

2954
03:06:40,720 --> 03:06:43,840
when you deal with this MAVEN project now

2955
03:06:43,840 --> 03:06:46,400
let me show you here in my machine also

2956
03:06:47,320 --> 03:06:49,480
if you go in my C part

2957
03:06:50,400 --> 03:06:53,160
users inside of my users

2958
03:06:53,160 --> 03:06:57,160
if you go under my name
you'll see one bottom two folder here.

2959
03:06:57,160 --> 03:06:57,760
Can you see

2960
03:07:03,160 --> 03:07:04,760
right if you open

2961
03:07:04,760 --> 03:07:07,640
it here, it says this is the repository.

2962
03:07:08,680 --> 03:07:10,680
If You open the repository, you will see

2963
03:07:10,680 --> 03:07:14,800
all of the job files
available here for your project

2964
03:07:15,680 --> 03:07:20,000
right? Yes.

2965
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:24,240
Yes. The job to find selected location,
no issues at all

2966
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:26,600
because you are not concerned about local
anything.

2967
03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:29,040
Right. You Are not anything dealing.

2968
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:32,040
You're not dealing with anything
which is not local state.

2969
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:33,840
No more problems about the jobs.

2970
03:07:33,840 --> 03:07:35,800
No more problems about the location.

2971
03:07:35,800 --> 03:07:37,640
Nothing. Everything.

2972
03:07:37,640 --> 03:07:39,480
Everything is customizable.

2973
03:07:39,480 --> 03:07:43,680
Everything can be done
only via only my MAVEN project.

2974
03:07:43,680 --> 03:07:44,240
Right.

2975
03:07:44,240 --> 03:07:47,600
So by default, all of the jobs
will be stored at one place.

2976
03:07:47,600 --> 03:07:50,080
And then you push this,
go to the repository.

2977
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:55,280
And if someone else will get this code,
it will automatically download

2978
03:07:55,280 --> 03:07:59,760
all the jobs in the same project,
work on any of the machine, right?

2979
03:07:59,760 --> 03:08:03,720
Without even interpreting
and giving any errors about the dependency

2980
03:08:03,960 --> 03:08:07,880
and the locations of John Place clear.

2981
03:08:07,880 --> 03:08:36,600
How this MAVEN project wants everyone.

2982
03:08:36,600 --> 03:08:37,080
All right.

2983
03:08:38,160 --> 03:08:38,680
Okay, guys.

2984
03:08:38,680 --> 03:08:41,720
So let's take a break, right,
At least for 15 minutes,

2985
03:08:41,720 --> 03:08:47,480
because I need a break now.

2986
03:08:47,480 --> 03:08:48,120
All right.

2987
03:08:48,120 --> 03:08:51,920
And disconnect after the 15 minutes.

2988
03:08:52,400 --> 03:08:55,440
I even also I also made solar energy now.

2989
03:08:57,080 --> 03:08:57,840
All right.

2990
03:08:57,960 --> 03:09:01,960
So let's take a break for
I think 15 minutes is more than fine.

2991
03:09:02,920 --> 03:09:05,320
So now now if you see

2992
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:09,320
we have basic structure
ready with this, Correct?

2993
03:09:11,280 --> 03:09:13,160
Just a basic structure

2994
03:09:13,160 --> 03:09:16,080
and we have added this
dependency state here

2995
03:09:18,800 --> 03:09:19,880
on our base.

2996
03:09:23,840 --> 03:09:26,880
Now, when we have added
all the dependencies,

2997
03:09:26,880 --> 03:09:29,880
when we have these
dependencies installed in our system,

2998
03:09:31,240 --> 03:09:33,480
that is also fine.

2999
03:09:33,480 --> 03:09:36,080
Next thing is
we have to understand one thing

3000
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:39,760
when we are dealing
with the automation process,

3001
03:09:40,120 --> 03:09:44,160
when we are going to write the code
for the automation, right?

3002
03:09:44,520 --> 03:09:47,840
So here are we going to write only code

3003
03:09:49,400 --> 03:09:50,880
or we going to write both

3004
03:09:50,880 --> 03:10:03,840
Java in Java.

3005
03:10:03,840 --> 03:10:07,800
My point is
when we are writing some code, right?

3006
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:11,760
So for example,
we are passing the data, right?

3007
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:14,240
We will pass the data
from some excise file,

3008
03:10:14,880 --> 03:10:17,560
we will pass the property
from some by zip file.

3009
03:10:17,880 --> 03:10:22,240
We will do all other stuff like this,
passing the locators, other thing.

3010
03:10:22,480 --> 03:10:26,640
So some of this code,
some of this code belong to Java.

3011
03:10:27,640 --> 03:10:30,360
Some of these files belong to non Java.

3012
03:10:30,920 --> 03:10:33,480
I remember yesterday we used

3013
03:10:33,480 --> 03:10:36,640
config dot properties file,

3014
03:10:36,640 --> 03:10:37,280
right?

3015
03:10:37,280 --> 03:10:41,680
So that configured properties
file was a part of like Java

3016
03:10:41,680 --> 03:10:43,360
or non java

3017
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:47,920
non java.

3018
03:10:47,920 --> 03:10:48,640
Right.

3019
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:54,720
So here when I say we are going to
do everything only with this.

3020
03:10:54,720 --> 03:10:57,800
So inside this I have Java, all right.

3021
03:10:57,800 --> 03:11:00,840
So I can keep all of my java stuff inside
java.

3022
03:11:01,400 --> 03:11:03,120
What about non Java.

3023
03:11:03,120 --> 03:11:04,440
Do I have anything.

3024
03:11:04,440 --> 03:11:10,920
A non java.

3025
03:11:10,920 --> 03:11:12,360
No. Right.

3026
03:11:12,360 --> 03:11:14,360
So for non java.

3027
03:11:14,560 --> 03:11:19,320
For non dharma
we have to one folder called resources.

3028
03:11:20,240 --> 03:11:24,080
What we have to do
we have to add one folder called resources

3029
03:11:24,360 --> 03:11:26,760
from there from test.

3030
03:11:26,760 --> 03:11:29,240
So to do this simply right click

3031
03:11:30,360 --> 03:11:34,240
new and here select this, then

3032
03:11:35,840 --> 03:11:40,080
select this then increase from here.

3033
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:45,680
All right.

3034
03:11:45,680 --> 03:11:48,960
And when you selected
just to give the name

3035
03:11:51,240 --> 03:11:56,840
resources.

3036
03:11:56,840 --> 03:11:59,480
All right

3037
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:01,680
now if you see I have Java

3038
03:12:02,640 --> 03:12:05,840
and I have resources, right.

3039
03:12:06,240 --> 03:12:11,120
I will keep all of my non
Java stuff in resources

3040
03:12:11,120 --> 03:12:15,040
and I will keep all of my Java stuff
in Java

3041
03:12:15,720 --> 03:12:25,640
clear.

3042
03:12:25,640 --> 03:12:25,920
Clear.

3043
03:12:25,920 --> 03:12:27,200
So Firebase

3044
03:12:33,280 --> 03:12:36,720
Great. Now

3045
03:12:38,640 --> 03:12:39,480
tell me one thing.

3046
03:12:39,480 --> 03:12:44,400
What was the very first thing
we identified and we implemented yesterday

3047
03:12:45,640 --> 03:12:48,720
when it comes to resources
for should, right

3048
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,960
when it comes
to creating the framework portion.

3049
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:55,560
So the very first thing is
we will not pass

3050
03:12:55,560 --> 03:12:58,840
anything hardcoded, correct? Yes.

3051
03:12:59,080 --> 03:13:04,080
So the basic configuration
we need to pass in our framework,

3052
03:13:04,440 --> 03:13:08,680
we need to pass it from one place
from which we can pass it.

3053
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:12,120
We can pass it from dot properties file.

3054
03:13:12,360 --> 03:13:17,040
So which properties file it is configured
properties fine, because all the portion

3055
03:13:17,040 --> 03:13:21,040
related to configuration
will be available in my property.

3056
03:13:21,960 --> 03:13:28,960
Correct.

3057
03:13:28,960 --> 03:13:31,560
Right. So just do one thing.

3058
03:13:31,560 --> 03:13:34,320
Take this configured properties from there

3059
03:13:34,800 --> 03:13:39,120
from your previous project,
because if we keep writing those parts

3060
03:13:39,320 --> 03:13:44,440
right, creating if you want, we can create
from separate a from as well.

3061
03:13:44,440 --> 03:13:47,800
I don't have any issue,
but since we have already done

3062
03:13:47,960 --> 03:13:51,040
with this confident properties,
can we take it from

3063
03:13:51,040 --> 03:14:06,000
our previous project?

3064
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:07,560
Does everyone have that?

3065
03:14:07,560 --> 03:14:12,120
Everyone has this one, this file
config folder configured properties.

3066
03:14:12,120 --> 03:14:17,160
Let me show you which one
I'm talking about.

3067
03:14:17,160 --> 03:14:21,120
The other people see in this config
right here in this country

3068
03:14:21,120 --> 03:14:24,880
you are seeing these configured
properties, correct?

3069
03:14:24,880 --> 03:14:35,040
Everyone is doing this, so just copy this,

3070
03:14:36,800 --> 03:14:38,640
copy this file.

3071
03:14:38,880 --> 03:14:40,880
Right. Come here

3072
03:14:40,920 --> 03:14:42,360
in your project.

3073
03:14:42,360 --> 03:14:42,920
Okay.

3074
03:14:43,040 --> 03:14:45,320
Just Create another directory here called

3075
03:14:46,280 --> 03:14:47,760
config.

3076
03:14:48,600 --> 03:14:49,640
Yes. No.

3077
03:14:49,640 --> 03:14:53,640
Inside this create
one config and inside config.

3078
03:14:53,640 --> 03:14:56,760
Right. This content dot properties. Right.

3079
03:14:57,080 --> 03:15:00,600
Because today we have one
the properties file for configuration.

3080
03:15:00,880 --> 03:15:01,320
The model.

3081
03:15:01,320 --> 03:15:03,960
Maybe we will be having multiple
configuration.

3082
03:15:03,960 --> 03:15:04,760
Right?

3083
03:15:05,400 --> 03:15:09,000
So for multiple configurations
we will be having multiple dot properties.

3084
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:09,560
Right.

3085
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:12,200
So it would be good
if we have one config folder

3086
03:15:12,600 --> 03:15:16,320
and inside this config you can simply say

3087
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:18,360
come on, what happened

3088
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:23,640
simply based on your configured
properties.

3089
03:15:23,640 --> 03:15:24,280
Right.

3090
03:15:25,080 --> 03:15:30,040
Can you see
I haven't considered properties yet.

3091
03:15:30,040 --> 03:15:32,960
This is the data
I'm having in my contract properties.

3092
03:15:32,960 --> 03:15:33,440
Right

3093
03:15:51,200 --> 03:15:53,400
up on

3094
03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:55,200
from your previous project.

3095
03:15:55,200 --> 03:15:59,280
If you take the pull from my code
right in the repository,

3096
03:15:59,560 --> 03:16:03,080
you will get this configured properties
like in your previous

3097
03:16:03,080 --> 03:16:06,080
project, the basics of test in great.

3098
03:16:06,120 --> 03:16:06,960
You will get that

3099
03:16:24,760 --> 03:16:25,840
and then which

3100
03:16:25,840 --> 03:16:38,840
which problem.

3101
03:16:38,840 --> 03:16:39,720
All right.

3102
03:16:39,720 --> 03:16:42,240
So you can do just one thing, right?

3103
03:16:42,240 --> 03:16:44,600
Create one folder here.

3104
03:16:44,760 --> 03:16:47,320
When you create the folder right click

3105
03:16:48,240 --> 03:16:50,280
going to nil, right.

3106
03:16:50,760 --> 03:16:51,400
You have to go.

3107
03:16:51,400 --> 03:16:56,360
And when you click on file and then write
your config type properties,

3108
03:16:57,240 --> 03:17:00,720
when you write configured properties,
it will create this file here

3109
03:17:01,040 --> 03:17:04,120
and then simply paste this data.

3110
03:17:04,120 --> 03:17:07,480
If you want,
I can paste this to values in your life.

3111
03:17:07,480 --> 03:17:14,240
Questions here.

3112
03:17:14,240 --> 03:17:15,160
There you go.

3113
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:18,200
So these are the values, right?

3114
03:17:18,200 --> 03:17:22,320
These are the values
you write in your configured properties.

3115
03:17:23,120 --> 03:17:27,400
Now, is it easy for every one?

3116
03:17:27,400 --> 03:17:29,960
And so I'm just right
click on your config folder.

3117
03:17:30,720 --> 03:17:36,240
Right click,
go into new select file, right configured

3118
03:17:36,880 --> 03:17:41,800
the way I can be configured properties
and then it will be available here.

3119
03:17:42,360 --> 03:17:46,760
That data which I shared, you can simply
paste this data inside, this type

3120
03:17:57,240 --> 03:17:57,760
and I is

3121
03:17:57,760 --> 03:18:02,840
working now.

3122
03:18:02,840 --> 03:18:05,840
So as on you have to do it right,
you have to create this folder.

3123
03:18:05,880 --> 03:18:11,160
We all have created this folder
just now, guys,

3124
03:18:11,160 --> 03:18:23,520
we have created this or not.

3125
03:18:23,520 --> 03:18:25,240
All right, great.

3126
03:18:25,240 --> 03:18:27,560
Now, now

3127
03:18:28,200 --> 03:18:30,800
to read this confident Properties file

3128
03:18:33,040 --> 03:18:33,840
here I missed.

3129
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:34,560
Fine.

3130
03:18:34,560 --> 03:18:37,960
So inside the resources,
right inside the resources

3131
03:18:38,440 --> 03:18:42,720
from your previous project version,
if you go into your previous project,

3132
03:18:42,720 --> 03:18:45,480
just copy this configured properties file.

3133
03:18:45,880 --> 03:18:48,720
Right And then simply create

3134
03:18:48,720 --> 03:18:52,320
one folder name
configured one directory, configure

3135
03:18:52,640 --> 03:18:58,800
and then pasted inside this confidence
properties.

3136
03:18:58,800 --> 03:19:09,200
Now what it wanted.

3137
03:19:09,200 --> 03:19:11,320
All right, thank you,

3138
03:19:11,320 --> 03:19:11,960
guys.

3139
03:19:11,960 --> 03:19:14,040
So far, everyone reached in this point

3140
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:26,760
now after these to read this file

3141
03:19:26,760 --> 03:19:29,760
now see this is what we call
framework distribution

3142
03:19:30,800 --> 03:19:34,440
because is my non
java I kept it inside non java

3143
03:19:35,400 --> 03:19:36,840
but to read it

3144
03:19:36,840 --> 03:19:40,760
to read this particular part
I need java function

3145
03:19:40,760 --> 03:19:41,720
or not

3146
03:19:47,920 --> 03:19:49,360
we need java function.

3147
03:19:49,360 --> 03:19:51,440
So that is java code. Right.

3148
03:19:51,440 --> 03:19:52,840
So where there we will right there.

3149
03:19:52,840 --> 03:19:55,200
Java code which can read these properties.

3150
03:19:55,560 --> 03:19:58,240
Remember we had one class yesterday,
we created one

3151
03:19:58,240 --> 03:20:00,840
class called configured property
configurator.

3152
03:20:01,440 --> 03:20:02,040
Right.

3153
03:20:02,280 --> 03:20:04,200
So configuration Reader.

3154
03:20:04,200 --> 03:20:07,560
Yes. Inside of Java we have two right now.

3155
03:20:07,560 --> 03:20:11,600
Tell me which package we abused,
which package

3156
03:20:11,600 --> 03:20:16,120
we have used to keep that particular file.

3157
03:20:16,120 --> 03:20:19,800
This particular configuration
reader class is a part

3158
03:20:19,800 --> 03:20:22,520
of which tool
it is a part of which concept.

3159
03:20:22,920 --> 03:20:24,560
It is a utility.

3160
03:20:24,560 --> 03:20:26,640
Correct.

3161
03:20:26,640 --> 03:20:29,400
Exactly where it belongs to utils.

3162
03:20:30,440 --> 03:20:32,640
So to create this now

3163
03:20:33,240 --> 03:20:35,560
now observing
close nigga is what I'm going to do.

3164
03:20:35,760 --> 03:20:38,000
Right click on java nil

3165
03:20:38,640 --> 03:20:41,080
and select package this time.

3166
03:20:41,080 --> 03:20:43,320
No directly select package.

3167
03:20:43,320 --> 03:20:45,200
It says package not any previously

3168
03:20:46,240 --> 03:20:48,280
so select package

3169
03:20:48,280 --> 03:20:50,400
and inside this package give the name

3170
03:20:50,640 --> 03:20:53,640
same units.

3171
03:20:53,640 --> 03:20:55,760
This is my package

3172
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:15,600
now now inside utils.

3173
03:21:16,200 --> 03:21:17,520
Inside utils.

3174
03:21:17,520 --> 03:21:20,240
I had classes yesterday.

3175
03:21:20,240 --> 03:21:30,480
What are those two classes?

3176
03:21:30,480 --> 03:21:32,720
The first one is common methods.

3177
03:21:32,720 --> 03:21:33,920
Alright.

3178
03:21:34,520 --> 03:21:34,920
Common.

3179
03:21:34,920 --> 03:21:37,440
And what was the second one?

3180
03:21:37,440 --> 03:21:38,160
Configuration.

3181
03:21:38,160 --> 03:21:41,320
But correct.

3182
03:21:41,520 --> 03:21:42,360
All right.

3183
03:21:42,560 --> 03:21:46,760
So do you want me to write
every single line of code of config reader

3184
03:21:46,760 --> 03:21:50,120
in common methods
or simply can copy these classes

3185
03:21:50,120 --> 03:21:52,400
from our previous project

3186
03:21:57,360 --> 03:21:58,560
right up to the programs?

3187
03:21:58,560 --> 03:21:59,720
That's what I'm asking.

3188
03:21:59,720 --> 03:22:02,920
What do you guys think we should copy
from there or we should write

3189
03:22:06,360 --> 03:22:07,000
Nobody.

3190
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:09,840
And now what I will do, basically

3191
03:22:09,840 --> 03:22:13,040
we will send the code
what we have inside this, right?

3192
03:22:13,200 --> 03:22:15,440
And then you can simply create
let's let's do it.

3193
03:22:15,440 --> 03:22:21,720
Let's do what I will do, basically,
and I will create this from here.

3194
03:22:21,720 --> 03:22:23,400
I will create it from here.

3195
03:22:23,400 --> 03:22:26,400
And then the code inside this
I will twist here

3196
03:22:26,400 --> 03:22:29,120
and I will send in the chart
also so that you can also best.

3197
03:22:29,280 --> 03:22:32,400
Alright, so let's do right click here,

3198
03:22:33,920 --> 03:22:36,240
right click new in Java class.

3199
03:22:36,920 --> 03:22:40,680
So my first Java class is

3200
03:22:41,280 --> 03:22:42,960
Common methods,

3201
03:22:43,200 --> 03:22:43,960
correct?

3202
03:22:44,200 --> 03:22:45,760
This is my first Java class.

3203
03:22:45,760 --> 03:22:48,160
I see common methods

3204
03:22:48,440 --> 03:22:50,240
right click and create your common

3205
03:22:50,240 --> 03:23:01,440
methods.

3206
03:23:01,440 --> 03:23:08,080
Already this now.

3207
03:23:08,720 --> 03:23:12,200
Now let's take the content of this common
methods.

3208
03:23:12,720 --> 03:23:15,480
Take the content,
this common method from previous class.

3209
03:23:16,320 --> 03:23:19,080
So in my project I had this common

3210
03:23:19,080 --> 03:23:22,440
method right?

3211
03:23:22,440 --> 03:23:25,360
I will copy this code of my common
method from here.

3212
03:23:25,800 --> 03:23:26,320
Right.

3213
03:23:26,320 --> 03:23:30,480
This is my code.

3214
03:23:30,480 --> 03:23:33,600
I'm copying this court from here

3215
03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:37,200
and I will paste this code here
as well in our life.

3216
03:23:37,200 --> 03:23:38,400
Questions

3217
03:23:40,640 --> 03:23:42,280
use this code and

3218
03:23:42,720 --> 03:23:44,520
others also wants to use this code

3219
03:23:44,520 --> 03:23:48,960
and paste this code here.

3220
03:23:48,960 --> 03:23:50,040
Posting

3221
03:23:54,160 --> 03:23:56,720
it is giving me the error
for configurator. Why?

3222
03:23:56,840 --> 03:23:59,040
Because I didn't use any configurator
so far.

3223
03:23:59,280 --> 03:24:02,160
Correct.

3224
03:24:02,160 --> 03:24:04,480
Now this is their time.

3225
03:24:04,480 --> 03:24:07,560
This is the time to copy the configurator.

3226
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:09,320
So that is my configurator.

3227
03:24:10,320 --> 03:24:11,720
This Is my configurator.

3228
03:24:11,720 --> 03:24:13,920
Let me open. Right.

3229
03:24:13,920 --> 03:24:15,960
And I will simply copy this code

3230
03:24:16,360 --> 03:24:18,800
configurator, copy this file

3231
03:24:19,880 --> 03:24:22,760
and, pasted it

3232
03:24:30,560 --> 03:24:32,360
by now.

3233
03:24:32,360 --> 03:24:35,200
Whatever the code
I have inside this configurator,

3234
03:24:36,120 --> 03:24:38,480
I am copying this

3235
03:24:44,280 --> 03:24:46,080
instinctively

3236
03:24:49,080 --> 03:24:50,280
anyways.

3237
03:24:50,840 --> 03:24:52,280
So far.

3238
03:24:52,440 --> 03:24:53,480
So far.

3239
03:24:53,480 --> 03:25:12,840
Which point you guys have reached.

3240
03:25:12,840 --> 03:25:14,880
I'll wait for this.

3241
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:16,400
Wait for this.

3242
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:18,400
Wait for this.

3243
03:25:18,400 --> 03:25:20,760
You are going to get on the same point
as you. Great.

3244
03:25:20,960 --> 03:25:25,680
Now now open all of you
your common methods every month.

3245
03:25:25,680 --> 03:25:27,880
Open the common methods

3246
03:25:42,360 --> 03:25:43,200
already

3247
03:25:44,120 --> 03:25:47,800
and then you can simply create this class
configurator

3248
03:25:48,120 --> 03:25:52,400
and then paste the code
our check right into my questions.

3249
03:25:52,680 --> 03:25:55,440
So all the code is available here?

3250
03:25:55,440 --> 03:25:56,400
Yeah. Do it.

3251
03:25:56,400 --> 03:26:05,680
Really should take your time.

3252
03:26:05,680 --> 03:26:07,680
Or I should. What is the error?

3253
03:26:07,680 --> 03:26:08,680
Mebane is a builder.

3254
03:26:08,680 --> 03:26:10,560
Two years later. Automation.

3255
03:26:10,560 --> 03:26:11,800
That's what this category

3256
03:26:17,800 --> 03:26:18,000
said.

3257
03:26:18,120 --> 03:26:19,080
What is the error?

3258
03:26:19,080 --> 03:26:20,840
These two mistakes

3259
03:26:31,360 --> 03:26:36,120
you need to check in your configurator
right?

3260
03:26:36,120 --> 03:26:40,320
When you're trying to call this redo
the properties and get property value.

3261
03:26:40,360 --> 03:26:41,560
White is not coding here.

3262
03:26:41,560 --> 03:26:44,280
Property check that

3263
03:26:44,600 --> 03:26:46,800
when you go in your configure check.

3264
03:26:46,800 --> 03:26:50,760
These are public first thing
whether you are able to access it or not

3265
03:26:51,040 --> 03:26:54,600
and your properties is also a static

3266
03:26:54,600 --> 03:26:54,840
check.

3267
03:26:54,840 --> 03:27:25,280
This part.

3268
03:27:25,280 --> 03:27:28,600
If everything is exactly like mine,
then why it is giving you

3269
03:27:28,600 --> 03:27:40,360
the error.

3270
03:27:40,360 --> 03:27:43,120
All right. On

3271
03:27:49,280 --> 03:28:19,120
the property.

3272
03:28:19,120 --> 03:28:21,960
Oh, it says rename reference.

3273
03:28:22,680 --> 03:28:25,160
I don't see any reason because I'm

3274
03:28:25,160 --> 03:28:28,280
just taking this
because see, this method never used.

3275
03:28:28,280 --> 03:28:29,680
It isn't great, right?

3276
03:28:29,680 --> 03:28:40,880
Gradients never used up.

3277
03:28:41,200 --> 03:28:42,160
Nobody is.

3278
03:28:42,160 --> 03:28:43,920
You can put this in the support. Right.

3279
03:28:43,920 --> 03:28:46,480
And more awesome
is there right to help in that case

3280
03:28:46,480 --> 03:28:49,600
and otherwise I will take care of this
after the session quickly

3281
03:28:52,360 --> 03:28:52,920
if it

3282
03:28:52,920 --> 03:28:55,880
if you can resolve it via dynamic,
you can also dynamic.

3283
03:28:55,880 --> 03:28:56,920
No issues.

3284
03:28:57,440 --> 03:29:00,120
All right, guys.

3285
03:29:00,120 --> 03:29:05,880
So far, everyone on this page.

3286
03:29:05,880 --> 03:29:09,640
Now, tell me,
how many of you guys got the error

3287
03:29:10,800 --> 03:29:12,520
when you were trying to execute?

3288
03:29:12,520 --> 03:29:14,040
You might you might have been trying

3289
03:29:14,040 --> 03:29:18,520
to execute your script in selenium
and you were getting the driver

3290
03:29:18,520 --> 03:29:24,000
executable does not exist because the path
you provide of your drivers.

3291
03:29:24,240 --> 03:29:28,600
Sometimes it is not able to identify
your driver or the exit.

3292
03:29:29,360 --> 03:29:32,040
How many of you guys get this error?

3293
03:29:32,040 --> 03:29:32,560
Quite

3294
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:38,320
right

3295
03:29:45,280 --> 03:29:45,640
guys.

3296
03:29:45,640 --> 03:29:47,040
Focus. Focus on this point.

3297
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:50,240
What I'm trying to explain,
this is something very crucial okay,

3298
03:29:51,120 --> 03:29:53,040
so I'm just trying to extend
some situation.

3299
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:56,880
Now see in this code
we are going to make some changes now.

3300
03:29:57,240 --> 03:30:01,360
First thing stick anything.

3301
03:30:01,360 --> 03:30:03,080
Even though
if you're not getting this error,

3302
03:30:03,080 --> 03:30:07,320
your browser,
your web driver is right on base now.

3303
03:30:08,280 --> 03:30:10,440
Right now, I'm using my conversion.

3304
03:30:10,440 --> 03:30:11,680
Let's see,

3305
03:30:12,720 --> 03:30:15,120
my conversion right now I'm having is

3306
03:30:17,040 --> 03:30:19,800
nine people, right?

3307
03:30:19,800 --> 03:30:23,440
And I'm using my chrome driver,
which is compatible to 94.

3308
03:30:23,440 --> 03:30:28,360
So currently it is working fine
in case I got automatically update

3309
03:30:28,360 --> 03:30:32,120
micro browser to 95 or to 96.

3310
03:30:32,480 --> 03:30:36,320
And what if my call driver
is not compatible

3311
03:30:36,440 --> 03:30:40,920
to execute my stream with Google driver
Chrome browser 95.

3312
03:30:40,920 --> 03:30:42,240
What would happen?

3313
03:30:42,720 --> 03:30:45,000
My script will fail

3314
03:30:46,560 --> 03:30:51,720
right?

3315
03:30:51,720 --> 03:30:55,760
My script will fail.

3316
03:30:55,760 --> 03:30:57,880
Right? So that's what it is
I'm trying to explain.

3317
03:30:57,880 --> 03:30:59,680
That's what I'm trying to explain.

3318
03:30:59,680 --> 03:31:03,360
So now I think a couple of
you guys are busy in writing the code.

3319
03:31:03,720 --> 03:31:05,520
So guys, please pay attention here.

3320
03:31:05,520 --> 03:31:08,120
Stop writing everything,
because this is something

3321
03:31:08,120 --> 03:31:11,160
we are going to discuss,
which is very important.

3322
03:31:11,920 --> 03:31:17,120
Okay,
So now in case also your script will fail

3323
03:31:17,600 --> 03:31:21,560
if your browser or your driver not exist,
the script will fail.

3324
03:31:21,960 --> 03:31:26,280
If you have grown driver or driver
opener driver i.e.

3325
03:31:26,640 --> 03:31:29,960
driver, so many driver
file in your project, right?

3326
03:31:30,240 --> 03:31:33,280
It will make your code bulkier, right?

3327
03:31:33,600 --> 03:31:36,760
It will the size occupy unnecessary space.

3328
03:31:37,160 --> 03:31:40,680
What we will do,
we will tell all of these things

3329
03:31:40,880 --> 03:31:44,120
to one tool that hey, go ahead.

3330
03:31:44,120 --> 03:31:46,520
If I want to execute my script on call,

3331
03:31:47,280 --> 03:31:49,640
I'm not going to provide any chrome
driver part.

3332
03:31:49,680 --> 03:31:51,960
I'm not going to provide any driver
or taxi.

3333
03:31:52,120 --> 03:31:54,240
I'm not going to provide any browser.

3334
03:31:54,240 --> 03:31:56,840
You are you are accountable, right?

3335
03:31:57,000 --> 03:31:58,800
You are answerable to me.

3336
03:31:58,800 --> 03:32:00,720
How you have executed.

3337
03:32:00,720 --> 03:32:05,400
You have to execute my script on Chrome,
Firefox, on opera, on eight.

3338
03:32:05,720 --> 03:32:09,600
At the same time, I'm not going to give
any composer Adobe XD.

3339
03:32:09,600 --> 03:32:12,520
I'm not going to give any driver,
any browser, anything.

3340
03:32:12,920 --> 03:32:13,880
Right.

3341
03:32:13,880 --> 03:32:16,560
That concept vehicle web

3342
03:32:16,960 --> 03:32:20,840
driver manager.

3343
03:32:20,840 --> 03:32:21,960
It means work.

3344
03:32:21,960 --> 03:32:25,560
Once we add this web driver,
manage it in a framework.

3345
03:32:25,920 --> 03:32:31,400
We don't need this fast.

3346
03:32:31,400 --> 03:32:33,840
We don't need this anymore.

3347
03:32:33,840 --> 03:32:34,480
Okay?

3348
03:32:34,600 --> 03:32:37,080
We don't need driver folder anymore.

3349
03:32:37,360 --> 03:32:40,560
We don't need this cool driver
or to see anymore.

3350
03:32:40,720 --> 03:32:51,280
All right, guys.

3351
03:32:51,720 --> 03:32:55,600
So to add Web
driver to manage it in our project.

3352
03:32:55,920 --> 03:33:01,280
Right To add this driver manager
in our project, what we have to do is

3353
03:33:02,440 --> 03:33:04,680
again, we have to go in our super shop

3354
03:33:06,600 --> 03:33:09,600
and you have to write that driver manager

3355
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:12,120
without space, but you have to write

3356
03:33:13,480 --> 03:33:19,200
this driver manager without such funding,

3357
03:33:19,200 --> 03:33:23,400
the first option you will get
is the driver manager, Bonnie Garcia.

3358
03:33:23,400 --> 03:33:28,120
This one,

3359
03:33:28,120 --> 03:33:33,800
like, like this we have driver manager
for Bonnie Garcia, right?

3360
03:33:33,840 --> 03:33:35,920
This one.

3361
03:33:35,920 --> 03:33:37,920
Everyone got this

3362
03:33:49,080 --> 03:33:51,280
plus and Slash.

3363
03:33:51,480 --> 03:33:52,440
What does it mean?

3364
03:33:52,440 --> 03:33:58,560
Yes. Well, all right,

3365
03:33:59,960 --> 03:34:04,360
so now I'm going to click on this
this driver manager.

3366
03:34:04,360 --> 03:34:04,680
Okay.

3367
03:34:04,680 --> 03:34:07,400
The first link, the first thing
you guys have to click here,

3368
03:34:07,960 --> 03:34:11,440
Web driver manager.

3369
03:34:11,440 --> 03:34:15,320
When you come inside this web driver
manager part right

3370
03:34:15,840 --> 03:34:18,720
in this load, Driver manager, you'll see

3371
03:34:18,720 --> 03:34:20,440
you have to

3372
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:23,720
again
let's take the most number of downloads

3373
03:34:23,720 --> 03:34:27,240
takes three, six, four, 23, 24, 63.

3374
03:34:27,240 --> 03:34:31,320
I got 3.8.1 guys you can take you 15.0.3.

3375
03:34:31,320 --> 03:34:33,840
It's completely up to you. Right?

3376
03:34:34,000 --> 03:34:38,200
You can use anyone since I'm
going with this one because

3377
03:34:39,320 --> 03:34:41,160
ranking matters.

3378
03:34:41,360 --> 03:34:42,600
Click on it.

3379
03:34:43,920 --> 03:34:46,080
Click on it again.

3380
03:34:46,080 --> 03:34:50,600
We have to ag dependency
right of this baby driver manager.

3381
03:34:51,360 --> 03:34:54,520
Copy it.

3382
03:34:54,520 --> 03:34:57,160
Go back to your project.

3383
03:34:57,200 --> 03:34:59,880
Go in politics similar

3384
03:35:00,040 --> 03:35:02,680
in your dependency.

3385
03:35:03,160 --> 03:35:05,440
Add this dependency to simply this

3386
03:35:12,120 --> 03:35:14,160
coordinate be one way

3387
03:35:14,200 --> 03:35:16,680
driver manage your partner's

3388
03:35:28,240 --> 03:35:31,200
again right click on maven

3389
03:35:31,200 --> 03:35:33,480
right click Maven

3390
03:35:34,840 --> 03:35:47,880
reload project.

3391
03:35:47,880 --> 03:35:50,440
So far everyone is done

3392
03:35:58,800 --> 03:35:59,320
that.

3393
03:36:00,120 --> 03:36:02,280
Now let's come back here.

3394
03:36:02,880 --> 03:36:04,200
Come back here.

3395
03:36:04,200 --> 03:36:07,560
I'm saying I don't this line.

3396
03:36:07,960 --> 03:36:08,680
Let me come in.

3397
03:36:08,680 --> 03:36:09,600
Get out

3398
03:36:13,560 --> 03:36:15,720
then if I'm seeing I don't need this line.

3399
03:36:15,720 --> 03:36:18,520
So who is going to open my chrome
driver then?

3400
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:21,240
This is the question.

3401
03:36:21,240 --> 03:36:24,320
So you have to write here

3402
03:36:27,480 --> 03:36:29,520
baby Driver manager

3403
03:36:30,520 --> 03:36:31,360
Right.

3404
03:36:31,800 --> 03:36:34,800
And when you click here, Dot can you see

3405
03:36:35,600 --> 03:36:40,520
Chrome Driver Edge Driver
Firefox Driver I'm a driver opener.

3406
03:36:40,520 --> 03:36:44,520
Driver Synonym in driver, standalone,
everything right?

3407
03:36:44,520 --> 03:36:46,960
So let's say
I'm going to take Chrome Driver

3408
03:36:48,120 --> 03:36:49,440
Chrome driver

3409
03:36:49,440 --> 03:36:52,800
dot setup.

3410
03:36:52,800 --> 03:36:54,200
That's it.

3411
03:36:54,480 --> 03:36:56,560
When you say cool driver setup, what web

3412
03:36:56,560 --> 03:36:58,960
driver manager will do

3413
03:36:59,640 --> 03:37:03,960
it will set up Chrome driver
Dougherty, XY, which is compatible

3414
03:37:03,960 --> 03:37:07,480
to your current browser picture
Z compatibility.

3415
03:37:08,000 --> 03:37:13,320
It will open the browser
and it will execute your stack.

3416
03:37:13,320 --> 03:37:17,520
Similarly,
someone says, If I don't have Firefox

3417
03:37:17,520 --> 03:37:20,560
browser yesterday
someone asked, Can I come in this code?

3418
03:37:20,800 --> 03:37:24,360
I said, But now today we can try it here.

3419
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:27,640
Simple web Driver manager dot

3420
03:37:28,320 --> 03:37:31,200
Firefox Driver dot stick up

3421
03:37:31,920 --> 03:37:34,200
and then driver is equals to a new

3422
03:37:35,320 --> 03:37:37,360
Firefox driver.

3423
03:37:37,400 --> 03:37:40,080
Correct.

3424
03:37:40,080 --> 03:37:41,400
No new drivers.

3425
03:37:41,400 --> 03:37:43,960
No need for chrome driver
Co-driver Dougherty XY

3426
03:37:50,200 --> 03:37:51,120
guy understood

3427
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:54,960
this code.

3428
03:37:54,960 --> 03:37:56,760
The yamaha's.

3429
03:37:56,760 --> 03:38:00,480
Connect this into chrome driver
don't be talking about

3430
03:38:01,080 --> 03:38:12,000
or driver or.

3431
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:14,400
All right. So now your headache is gone.

3432
03:38:14,560 --> 03:38:18,840
You don't have to take care
of the part of your.

3433
03:38:18,840 --> 03:38:21,240
I think it is. It is having let me check

3434
03:38:23,200 --> 03:38:25,000
it sure that this

3435
03:38:29,480 --> 03:38:32,600
No it doesn't get somebody

3436
03:38:33,600 --> 03:38:36,600
I have age

3437
03:38:37,760 --> 03:38:40,280
enhanced Firefox because

3438
03:38:41,840 --> 03:38:43,880
it has grown even it has chromium

3439
03:38:44,560 --> 03:38:47,640
it doesn't give somebody.

3440
03:38:47,640 --> 03:38:52,640
All right.

3441
03:38:52,640 --> 03:38:52,920
Yeah.

3442
03:38:52,920 --> 03:38:59,160
Maybe in the newer version
you can find it.

3443
03:38:59,160 --> 03:38:59,760
All right.

3444
03:38:59,760 --> 03:39:02,920
So now let me tell you
one more thing here in the new login,

3445
03:39:03,520 --> 03:39:06,200
you don't need to copy this complete part.

3446
03:39:06,200 --> 03:39:11,040
Once again, simply go back check,
which is the new version 5.0.3.

3447
03:39:11,040 --> 03:39:13,480
Right. This is the new version. Okay.

3448
03:39:14,240 --> 03:39:16,880
Go in your symbol write

3449
03:39:17,640 --> 03:39:20,920
instead of this 3.8.1 just right.

3450
03:39:21,240 --> 03:39:25,440
5.0.3 find

3451
03:39:26,880 --> 03:39:29,520
it is giving you this error

3452
03:39:31,080 --> 03:39:31,280
order.

3453
03:39:31,320 --> 03:39:32,520
The project

3454
03:40:16,920 --> 03:40:19,920
and you say guys, here it is upgrading.

3455
03:40:19,920 --> 03:40:24,960
Now my appropriate according
to the new wording of web driver correct

3456
03:40:26,040 --> 03:40:27,720
state the error is also gone

3457
03:40:28,680 --> 03:40:31,960
now. Now
let's go back to my common metrics

3458
03:40:32,200 --> 03:40:34,880
this time if I write here, this time
if I write

3459
03:40:35,280 --> 03:40:38,680
web driver manager, dog

3460
03:40:38,680 --> 03:40:40,920
it, safari

3461
03:40:40,920 --> 03:40:44,760
dog, and it

3462
03:40:46,880 --> 03:40:48,520
so now next time lets

3463
03:40:48,520 --> 03:40:51,440
it new Werdum came in the market
and you want to upgrade.

3464
03:40:51,760 --> 03:40:54,280
You don't have to add this group
by default.

3465
03:40:54,720 --> 03:40:58,000
Once again, just change the version
and reload your project.

3466
03:40:58,000 --> 03:41:02,360
Your will get the updated libraries
every single thing just by changing

3467
03:41:02,360 --> 03:41:03,800
these values. Yes.

3468
03:41:03,800 --> 03:41:09,480
Got it.

3469
03:41:09,480 --> 03:41:16,320
Is there duty is one of the things
that you are learning right now.

3470
03:41:16,320 --> 03:41:19,520
I told you so many things on the way.

3471
03:41:19,520 --> 03:41:22,440
Now your one problem is going.

3472
03:41:23,160 --> 03:41:25,360
Which one? Chrome driver

3473
03:41:25,480 --> 03:41:27,600
right now.

3474
03:41:27,600 --> 03:41:31,360
Another problem will be gone in
just half an hour.

3475
03:41:32,240 --> 03:41:33,760
What is that problem? We didn't

3476
03:41:35,360 --> 03:41:35,840
remember

3477
03:41:35,840 --> 03:41:38,000
yesterday when I was executing my code

3478
03:41:39,160 --> 03:41:42,160
by mistake, I gave the wrong part
of this particular fight

3479
03:41:42,920 --> 03:41:46,200
and I was getting null pointer exception
when I was executing the code.

3480
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:55,040
How many of you guys remember?

3481
03:41:55,040 --> 03:41:55,680
Right.

3482
03:41:56,200 --> 03:41:57,120
Why it is happening?

3483
03:41:57,120 --> 03:42:02,720
Because I'm trying to give this thought
manually correct.

3484
03:42:02,720 --> 03:42:05,840
I'm trying to give this spot
manually the file path,

3485
03:42:06,480 --> 03:42:10,680
but I should not pass anything
hardcoded, right?

3486
03:42:10,680 --> 03:42:12,840
I should not pass anything is hard coding.

3487
03:42:13,200 --> 03:42:14,920
Then what is the resolution?

3488
03:42:14,920 --> 03:42:16,640
What is the alternative?

3489
03:42:16,640 --> 03:42:18,720
So this is not the only thing.

3490
03:42:19,080 --> 03:42:21,600
This is not the only thing
that we are going to pass.

3491
03:42:21,600 --> 03:42:24,360
Like file. But

3492
03:42:25,560 --> 03:42:28,560
the path that I want to store
to my screenshot,

3493
03:42:29,960 --> 03:42:33,160
the part where I want to pass
my is data from

3494
03:42:34,080 --> 03:42:37,000
or sometimes implicit and explicit wait.

3495
03:42:37,040 --> 03:42:41,640
So final values see every word
I'm passing this time right?

3496
03:42:41,640 --> 03:42:44,040
And then I'm passing this
ten and 20 everywhere.

3497
03:42:44,040 --> 03:42:45,960
So I don't need to pass this things.

3498
03:42:45,960 --> 03:42:48,840
I want to simply pass one parameter
here, right?

3499
03:42:48,840 --> 03:42:52,840
And I will define this new way to
one place because these values are final.

3500
03:42:52,840 --> 03:42:53,840
These values are see

3501
03:42:55,360 --> 03:42:56,280
your data.

3502
03:42:56,280 --> 03:42:58,960
This final or not in the project.

3503
03:42:58,960 --> 03:43:01,000
You are not going to change your data.

3504
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:02,520
But again and again, right?

3505
03:43:02,520 --> 03:43:05,920
So your data path is final.

3506
03:43:05,920 --> 03:43:09,560
You're confident properties
support is final or not in the project.

3507
03:43:09,560 --> 03:43:13,560
Tell me this, but final or not

3508
03:43:15,520 --> 03:43:16,080
unique?

3509
03:43:16,080 --> 03:43:17,520
That's what we were talking about.

3510
03:43:17,520 --> 03:43:19,000
Organized structure.

3511
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:22,040
It means
things are not changing their places.

3512
03:43:22,440 --> 03:43:25,240
So the part we are defining it one based

3513
03:43:25,240 --> 03:43:29,400
these spots are not changeable,
but they are fixed and final.

3514
03:43:29,760 --> 03:43:32,560
So I need another class where

3515
03:43:32,560 --> 03:43:35,080
I can all these constants.

3516
03:43:35,600 --> 03:43:37,920
Then I can keep all of these constants.

3517
03:43:38,200 --> 03:43:39,960
Now let's do this.

3518
03:43:39,960 --> 03:43:42,440
I'm going to create another class here.

3519
03:43:42,440 --> 03:43:43,320
When I say class.

3520
03:43:43,320 --> 03:43:47,400
It is a Java code, and the name of my
class I'm going to create is

3521
03:43:49,200 --> 03:43:50,040
Constants.

3522
03:43:50,040 --> 03:43:54,800
This is my class, Correct.

3523
03:43:54,800 --> 03:43:58,080
Now tell me is the constant
I want to utilize.

3524
03:43:58,080 --> 03:44:01,920
I want to use this constant spot
throughout my project.

3525
03:44:01,920 --> 03:44:04,240
So which access modifier I have to use

3526
03:44:10,120 --> 03:44:13,720
public?

3527
03:44:13,720 --> 03:44:15,600
Let's make it's technique.

3528
03:44:15,600 --> 03:44:19,880
Now I'm saying
my path is not going to change, right?

3529
03:44:19,880 --> 03:44:21,920
My path is not going to change.

3530
03:44:21,920 --> 03:44:25,920
So When I say my path is not going
to change, it means I have to make it

3531
03:44:26,640 --> 03:44:28,160
find it

3532
03:44:28,800 --> 03:44:30,800
and what data type

3533
03:44:30,800 --> 03:44:33,520
I would be having when I received my.

3534
03:44:33,800 --> 03:44:36,800
But let's define path or any other part.

3535
03:44:37,080 --> 03:44:38,760
What did I say?

3536
03:44:38,760 --> 03:44:39,800
Screen

3537
03:44:40,600 --> 03:44:43,240
I'm writing string.

3538
03:44:43,240 --> 03:44:44,600
So the very first part,

3539
03:44:44,600 --> 03:44:48,280
the very first one is my disk
configuration file path, right?

3540
03:44:49,080 --> 03:44:51,240
The path of my configuration file.

3541
03:44:51,240 --> 03:44:56,120
So to keep everything which are constants,
I always write the always write in caps.

3542
03:44:56,640 --> 03:44:59,400
So I'm going to write configuration

3543
03:45:02,120 --> 03:45:03,320
file path

3544
03:45:03,720 --> 03:45:08,200
correct.

3545
03:45:08,200 --> 03:45:09,120
All right.

3546
03:45:09,240 --> 03:45:13,880
Now from here, I'm

3547
03:45:13,880 --> 03:45:21,600
going to copy this thought right?

3548
03:45:21,600 --> 03:45:23,520
I'm going to copy this path.

3549
03:45:23,520 --> 03:45:27,600
And I've been here since this is my string

3550
03:45:28,120 --> 03:45:30,960
I'm going to paste to click this connect

3551
03:45:33,000 --> 03:45:36,440
and connect. Yes.

3552
03:45:37,080 --> 03:45:50,440
By it is not correct subject.

3553
03:45:50,440 --> 03:45:51,240
Fine.

3554
03:45:51,240 --> 03:45:53,520
Make me do one thing then let me copy

3555
03:45:54,600 --> 03:45:55,960
the path from here.

3556
03:45:55,960 --> 03:45:59,800
This is my path right?

3557
03:45:59,800 --> 03:46:12,760
I will go ahead and constants and
then I will paste the path of my new idea.

3558
03:46:12,760 --> 03:46:21,240
This now, is this correct?

3559
03:46:21,240 --> 03:46:23,320
Yeah. All we are going to do this

3560
03:46:24,720 --> 03:46:26,560
now. Still we are passing

3561
03:46:26,560 --> 03:46:29,000
hardcoded data, right?

3562
03:46:29,680 --> 03:46:32,640
This is the part of my local machine.

3563
03:46:32,640 --> 03:46:35,720
When it works for other machines.

3564
03:46:35,720 --> 03:46:38,880
Tell me no right then.

3565
03:46:39,160 --> 03:46:41,240
One way to do it is this.

3566
03:46:41,520 --> 03:46:46,240
See, you can provide the path

3567
03:46:48,360 --> 03:46:49,800
like this

3568
03:47:01,200 --> 03:47:01,800
right

3569
03:47:02,120 --> 03:47:05,480
inside to my It's not a C folder
because this is my project hierarchy

3570
03:47:05,680 --> 03:47:08,720
and inside my project hierarchy

3571
03:47:08,720 --> 03:47:11,120
I'm going to get this spot correct.

3572
03:47:11,720 --> 03:47:13,840
This is one part. Now.

3573
03:47:15,320 --> 03:47:17,560
Now what I'm going to do is see,

3574
03:47:18,640 --> 03:47:21,600
let me take my previous project
just for one thing,

3575
03:47:21,600 --> 03:47:25,640
I want to show you something from here.

3576
03:47:25,640 --> 03:47:38,680
Let me take any class
just to execute my code.

3577
03:47:38,680 --> 03:47:41,400
Let me take this particular class

3578
03:47:41,400 --> 03:47:43,840
here.

3579
03:47:43,840 --> 03:47:46,520
I'm going to write I'm going to write
one thing

3580
03:47:47,480 --> 03:47:51,120
there to remove this part

3581
03:47:51,120 --> 03:47:54,480
right?

3582
03:47:54,480 --> 03:47:56,640
There is a command called

3583
03:47:58,720 --> 03:48:00,960
System Dark

3584
03:48:00,960 --> 03:48:06,280
Gate property, right?

3585
03:48:06,280 --> 03:48:09,480
What I'm writing here is system
dark gate property.

3586
03:48:10,120 --> 03:48:12,920
When I use this command system,
guarded property,

3587
03:48:12,920 --> 03:48:16,240
I can get so many properties off my system

3588
03:48:16,240 --> 03:48:19,080
and so many other things, for example,

3589
03:48:19,840 --> 03:48:23,200
which operating system I'm using, right?

3590
03:48:23,840 --> 03:48:27,240
So I can write here or s dart name,

3591
03:48:28,840 --> 03:48:29,760
see this

3592
03:48:29,760 --> 03:48:34,080
system dart gate property
and owns dart name when I use it,

3593
03:48:34,640 --> 03:48:36,840
when I run this code, you will see that

3594
03:48:53,560 --> 03:48:55,080
it is giving me Windows ten.

3595
03:48:55,080 --> 03:48:57,000
Can you see here is

3596
03:48:57,280 --> 03:49:00,800
it gives me Windows ten.

3597
03:49:00,800 --> 03:49:02,640
This is my current operating system.

3598
03:49:02,640 --> 03:49:03,400
Correct

3599
03:49:09,160 --> 03:49:10,840
guys can see

3600
03:49:13,960 --> 03:49:15,480
similarly

3601
03:49:16,320 --> 03:49:19,880
similarly if I want to check

3602
03:49:20,280 --> 03:49:22,720
my user name right,

3603
03:49:23,280 --> 03:49:26,840
so this property will retain the user
name, right?

3604
03:49:27,480 --> 03:49:27,960
Right.

3605
03:49:27,960 --> 03:49:30,320
Now where I'm using this code,

3606
03:49:30,320 --> 03:49:33,840
where I'm executing this code
with which user I'm using this.

3607
03:49:34,160 --> 03:49:37,440
So see,
it will give me the user name also, right?

3608
03:49:38,120 --> 03:49:43,080
Can you see it gives me the user name,
my name, correct.

3609
03:49:43,080 --> 03:49:47,200
It is here guys.

3610
03:49:47,200 --> 03:49:49,400
Similarly, similarly,

3611
03:49:50,360 --> 03:49:52,640
when I write this command user

3612
03:49:52,640 --> 03:49:55,920
derby, I are user D r.

3613
03:49:56,360 --> 03:49:58,800
It provides me the path

3614
03:49:58,960 --> 03:50:02,040
of my current project in this point.

3615
03:50:02,040 --> 03:50:04,320
It gives me the plot user directly.

3616
03:50:04,320 --> 03:50:09,960
It shows explains that in which directory
you are executing your part, in

3617
03:50:09,960 --> 03:50:13,440
which directory you have your RC folders
and other structure.

3618
03:50:13,840 --> 03:50:15,480
So when I execute code,

3619
03:50:16,600 --> 03:50:21,240
see this
is something new you're learning now.

3620
03:50:21,920 --> 03:50:24,840
This dev driver manager
constraints and everything.

3621
03:50:24,840 --> 03:50:27,400
It is a part of framework

3622
03:50:28,800 --> 03:50:33,000
You'll see here
it says it returns the part.

3623
03:50:33,320 --> 03:50:35,360
Right? Which path is this?

3624
03:50:36,120 --> 03:50:39,360
There is this thought is this one

3625
03:50:39,360 --> 03:50:43,320
You'll see users my name workspace

3626
03:50:43,320 --> 03:50:47,160
and then project name user's
my name, workspace and project name.

3627
03:50:47,520 --> 03:50:48,280
Correct

3628
03:50:50,720 --> 03:50:54,200
Now now just copy this,

3629
03:50:55,280 --> 03:50:58,680
copy this right now going our project.

3630
03:50:58,800 --> 03:51:00,480
This is our project, right?

3631
03:51:00,480 --> 03:51:04,920
We come here in our project.

3632
03:51:04,920 --> 03:51:06,400
In our project.

3633
03:51:06,400 --> 03:51:08,320
Let's do this

3634
03:51:09,120 --> 03:51:09,800
right.

3635
03:51:11,160 --> 03:51:13,080
What are we going to do here
in our project?

3636
03:51:13,080 --> 03:51:16,240
Is we will write

3637
03:51:17,400 --> 03:51:18,720
this code.

3638
03:51:18,920 --> 03:51:22,320
Now I am creating a range relating how

3639
03:51:23,600 --> 03:51:27,360
does any matter
which project, which system,

3640
03:51:27,840 --> 03:51:33,120
which directly you are using,
because these is the part, right?

3641
03:51:33,120 --> 03:51:35,040
This structure is fine.

3642
03:51:35,040 --> 03:51:37,280
Remember their definition of framework.

3643
03:51:37,760 --> 03:51:39,960
This structure is final.

3644
03:51:39,960 --> 03:51:42,520
No one is going to change this spot.

3645
03:51:42,520 --> 03:51:45,520
Right inside is RC, inside is RC.

3646
03:51:45,520 --> 03:51:46,800
Everything is same.

3647
03:51:46,800 --> 03:51:49,120
Inside resources everything is same.

3648
03:51:49,400 --> 03:51:53,600
The only thing change is this location
of the project in every other machine.

3649
03:51:53,840 --> 03:51:56,640
So now we made it common for everyone.

3650
03:51:57,040 --> 03:52:00,720
It doesn't matter whether you're studying
it in desktop or in users

3651
03:52:00,720 --> 03:52:04,920
or in downloads or in workspace
or in ideal projects or anywhere.

3652
03:52:05,280 --> 03:52:08,160
It will return that board
for all the system.

3653
03:52:08,360 --> 03:52:13,400
And since this part is constant
for everyone, so every every time

3654
03:52:13,560 --> 03:52:16,920
this board will work
in every single machine,

3655
03:52:17,400 --> 03:52:21,280
correct?

3656
03:52:21,280 --> 03:52:21,800
Correct.

3657
03:52:21,960 --> 03:52:24,640
But if someone is not following
the framework

3658
03:52:24,640 --> 03:52:27,360
standard rate, he
or she will not be able to

3659
03:52:27,920 --> 03:52:31,160
commit the code in the repository
otherwise everyone's code will break

3660
03:52:33,960 --> 03:52:35,280
up underneath.

3661
03:52:35,280 --> 03:52:38,040
When we decide,
when we define some variables

3662
03:52:38,040 --> 03:52:40,800
which are final
values are not going to change.

3663
03:52:41,000 --> 03:52:41,520
Right.

3664
03:52:41,520 --> 03:52:47,680
Those variables
will define this by encapsulate.

3665
03:52:47,680 --> 03:52:52,360
All right, guys, does it make sense?

3666
03:52:52,360 --> 03:53:00,720
The post word.

3667
03:53:00,720 --> 03:53:03,080
Now let's take the second one. Right.

3668
03:53:03,720 --> 03:53:06,200
I'm going to make it for the exit public

3669
03:53:07,320 --> 03:53:11,120
static final.

3670
03:53:11,120 --> 03:53:14,520
And I'm thinking for my for my

3671
03:53:16,600 --> 03:53:18,400
implicit and let's see,

3672
03:53:18,400 --> 03:53:21,760
I'm going to make it
finally, 10 seconds for every single one.

3673
03:53:22,080 --> 03:53:22,800
Right?

3674
03:53:23,040 --> 03:53:26,520
I will tell you similarly, right.

3675
03:53:26,520 --> 03:53:30,000
For right now,
let's take it for implicit quickly now.

3676
03:53:30,600 --> 03:53:33,360
Now, just two changes
we are going to make right

3677
03:53:34,440 --> 03:53:35,560
in our common methods.

3678
03:53:35,560 --> 03:53:38,760
If I go in the common methods,

3679
03:53:39,960 --> 03:53:42,760
we you think we need to parse
this data this time, you and me

3680
03:53:49,160 --> 03:53:52,800
not deleted

3681
03:53:52,800 --> 03:53:54,080
what we need to write.

3682
03:53:54,080 --> 03:53:57,600
We need to write your constants

3683
03:53:57,600 --> 03:53:59,400
dot can you see

3684
03:53:59,400 --> 03:54:03,200
it is giving configuration
file path click a configuration point.

3685
03:54:03,200 --> 03:54:06,560
But now,

3686
03:54:06,960 --> 03:54:09,880
now come here.

3687
03:54:09,880 --> 03:54:12,600
It asked for 10 seconds. Right?

3688
03:54:12,600 --> 03:54:15,480
I don't want to parse this time here
I will write

3689
03:54:16,320 --> 03:54:20,280
constants dot

3690
03:54:20,400 --> 03:54:21,880
implicitly

3691
03:54:21,880 --> 03:54:27,480
correct.

3692
03:54:27,480 --> 03:54:30,680
Right. Can you see this code?

3693
03:54:30,680 --> 03:54:37,040
This particular piece of code?

3694
03:54:37,040 --> 03:54:40,680
Isn't it very simple and straightforward
than ever before?

3695
03:54:41,760 --> 03:54:45,120
The browser name is coming
from configuring

3696
03:54:45,120 --> 03:54:47,760
configuration file,
but this coming from constants.

3697
03:54:48,560 --> 03:54:51,040
You are reading the properties
from somewhere.

3698
03:54:51,480 --> 03:54:55,080
You are getting the keys
from your configuration properties file.

3699
03:54:55,560 --> 03:55:00,600
You're passing the keys Web Driver
Manager is the handling or the execution

3700
03:55:01,040 --> 03:55:05,040
field browsers for all the browsers,
not only just one browser.

3701
03:55:06,120 --> 03:55:08,760
You're this configuration file part
the mix

3702
03:55:08,760 --> 03:55:13,560
your project makes your framework platform
independent

3703
03:55:14,160 --> 03:55:18,920
right At the same time you are passing
even the time, right?

3704
03:55:18,960 --> 03:55:22,080
The integer values you are passing from

3705
03:55:22,080 --> 03:55:38,680
bit from your constants.

3706
03:55:38,680 --> 03:55:39,600
All right.

3707
03:55:40,160 --> 03:55:41,320
I'm glad.

3708
03:55:41,320 --> 03:55:44,440
I'm glad that you guys found it helpful.

3709
03:55:44,440 --> 03:55:45,360
So far, so good.

3710
03:55:45,360 --> 03:55:48,080
Guys, Everyone.

3711
03:55:48,080 --> 03:55:58,320
Does it make sense?

3712
03:55:58,320 --> 03:56:12,720
Bring.

3713
03:56:12,720 --> 03:56:13,560
All right.

3714
03:56:15,040 --> 03:56:17,280
Like I told you so many things on the way.

3715
03:56:17,280 --> 03:56:21,840
Still, since

3716
03:56:22,400 --> 03:56:29,200
so many things on the way.

3717
03:56:29,200 --> 03:56:30,120
All right.

3718
03:56:31,000 --> 03:56:45,240
Can we say 1014 today?

3719
03:56:45,240 --> 03:56:47,640
No, no, I'm just kidding.
And they don't worry.

3720
03:56:47,640 --> 03:56:48,240
Don't worry.

3721
03:56:48,240 --> 03:56:50,200
I'm not going to take care of this
much of time.

3722
03:56:50,200 --> 03:56:53,640
I can totally understand.

3723
03:56:53,640 --> 03:57:12,600
Yes. Short of financial,
this is your constants.

3724
03:57:12,600 --> 03:57:16,960
All right.

3725
03:57:16,960 --> 03:57:21,880
So for now,

3726
03:57:22,280 --> 03:57:24,960
guys, still, we are just starting

3727
03:57:24,960 --> 03:57:29,920
right?

3728
03:57:29,920 --> 03:57:33,480
It's still we are just starting
with the framework creation rate,

3729
03:57:34,560 --> 03:57:36,120
because these things

3730
03:57:36,120 --> 03:57:39,800
are one, the starting one hour
on this data driven concept.

3731
03:57:40,320 --> 03:57:41,040
Right.

3732
03:57:41,440 --> 03:57:43,600
We have spent our one hour on day five.

3733
03:57:43,600 --> 03:57:44,760
That's why we are not able

3734
03:57:44,760 --> 03:57:48,440
to complete every single thing
what we were supposed to complete.

3735
03:57:48,920 --> 03:57:49,200
Right.

3736
03:57:49,200 --> 03:57:52,440
But yes, in Tuesday's class,

3737
03:57:52,440 --> 03:57:55,360
I will try to cover
the remaining topics of today.

3738
03:57:55,360 --> 03:57:57,720
And then New for Tuesday.

3739
03:57:57,720 --> 03:57:58,360
Okay.

3740
03:57:58,360 --> 03:58:00,720
Now, the important point here, right?

3741
03:58:01,800 --> 03:58:04,000
I'm not going to add anything
new from here.

3742
03:58:04,680 --> 03:58:07,440
We will add all of this
things from that point.

3743
03:58:08,720 --> 03:58:09,760
Don't worry about it.

3744
03:58:09,760 --> 03:58:12,000
We will do it on my on Tuesday.

3745
03:58:12,000 --> 03:58:14,520
Right now, the important thing
which we are going to do,

3746
03:58:15,160 --> 03:58:16,280
what is an important thing.

3747
03:58:16,280 --> 03:58:18,080
Can somebody tell me

3748
03:58:40,000 --> 03:58:42,600
first you need this code.

3749
03:58:42,600 --> 03:58:44,200
Go ahead.

3750
03:58:44,200 --> 03:58:52,000
Whatever the code I have written here,
you all need it.

3751
03:58:52,000 --> 03:58:56,320
So let's commit this code, create
a new repository and then committed there.

3752
03:58:56,640 --> 03:59:01,320
Yes. GitHub setup.

3753
03:59:01,320 --> 03:59:02,640
So let's go ahead and do it

3754
03:59:10,320 --> 03:59:13,320
right.

3755
03:59:13,320 --> 03:59:16,160
I'm going to create a new repository
from here

3756
03:59:17,840 --> 03:59:20,960
and my new repository is

3757
03:59:21,080 --> 03:59:22,280
based in

3758
03:59:24,840 --> 03:59:26,360
framework

3759
03:59:29,760 --> 03:59:30,600
Bash team.

3760
03:59:30,600 --> 03:59:36,880
Correct.

3761
03:59:36,880 --> 03:59:39,480
All right, Node, I'm waiting.

3762
03:59:40,200 --> 03:59:40,960
But for what?

3763
03:59:40,960 --> 03:59:44,280
I mean, no, no, no. You don't have to.

3764
03:59:44,640 --> 03:59:45,920
You don't have to waste.

3765
03:59:45,920 --> 03:59:47,400
I am going to commit to my record.

3766
03:59:47,400 --> 03:59:50,640
I'm just showing you how
you can create your repository as well.

3767
03:59:51,640 --> 03:59:53,160
All all right.

3768
03:59:54,480 --> 03:59:55,440
That's what I'm showing you,

3769
03:59:55,440 --> 03:59:59,480
how you can create your own repository
and how you can commit to your code.

3770
03:59:59,480 --> 04:00:00,400
Anyways.

3771
04:00:00,400 --> 04:00:02,040
You will be

3772
04:00:02,160 --> 04:00:06,800
you will be having this application site
on how to create the repository.

3773
04:00:06,880 --> 04:00:09,400
And there
you will see how to handle this part.

3774
04:00:10,160 --> 04:00:13,920
Okay,
so creating this repository name, right?

3775
04:00:14,000 --> 04:00:15,800
So this is the repository name.

3776
04:00:15,800 --> 04:00:17,040
This is my repository here.

3777
04:00:17,040 --> 04:00:19,600
I will keep all of my code.

3778
04:00:19,600 --> 04:00:22,760
Remember I used to commit the code
and then use use

3779
04:00:22,760 --> 04:00:25,560
to take the pull of code
straight from the repository.

3780
04:00:25,960 --> 04:00:29,280
That repository also we had,
we have made like this.

3781
04:00:29,680 --> 04:00:30,480
All right.

3782
04:00:30,480 --> 04:00:31,760
So now I'm showing you how

3783
04:00:31,760 --> 04:00:35,720
we can make the repository
and how we can integrate this repository

3784
04:00:35,920 --> 04:00:39,480
and you can use the same repository
using intelligently.

3785
04:00:39,960 --> 04:00:41,760
You don't have go and use it

3786
04:00:41,760 --> 04:00:45,240
even though if you want
you can use command prompt as well, right?

3787
04:00:45,600 --> 04:00:49,440
CMT But on our terminal as well
for Mac users.

3788
04:00:49,720 --> 04:00:53,000
But if you to use directly
from your intelligent

3789
04:00:53,440 --> 04:00:56,480
then also you can use this
so I'm going to make it public

3790
04:00:56,880 --> 04:00:58,240
so that everyone can access.

3791
04:00:58,240 --> 04:01:01,040
You can see here anyone on the internet
see this repository

3792
04:01:01,240 --> 04:01:02,480
you choose or can commit.

3793
04:01:04,080 --> 04:01:04,920
All right,

3794
04:01:05,040 --> 04:01:09,480
I'm simply clicking on the repository.

3795
04:01:09,480 --> 04:01:12,440
When I create repository,
it is giving me that you are right,

3796
04:01:12,560 --> 04:01:14,520
which I generally share
with every one of you.

3797
04:01:14,520 --> 04:01:16,320
This is the repository you are in.

3798
04:01:16,320 --> 04:01:18,840
You can access it
and you can take the code.

3799
04:01:18,840 --> 04:01:22,040
It says create a new repository
on the command line.

3800
04:01:22,160 --> 04:01:24,800
So these are the commands.
So you have to take care of.

3801
04:01:24,800 --> 04:01:30,240
Like I say in your decisions,
you will get the details right of it.

3802
04:01:30,440 --> 04:01:34,440
You will learn how you can use this from
the command, from the from the terminal.

3803
04:01:35,160 --> 04:01:38,520
Now, I just copied this part from copy.

3804
04:01:38,520 --> 04:01:40,640
You already copied this.

3805
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:59,680
Now, if I go in my project,

3806
04:01:59,680 --> 04:02:04,600
all right, if I go in my intelligence here
on my intelligence,

3807
04:02:05,160 --> 04:02:08,880
you will see I will show you guys how
we can use it from command prompt as well.

3808
04:02:08,960 --> 04:02:09,480
Don't worry.

3809
04:02:09,480 --> 04:02:09,960
Right

3810
04:02:09,960 --> 04:02:13,320
next time, when we will commit this code,
we will commit from the command from.

3811
04:02:13,560 --> 04:02:15,200
Don't worry. Right.

3812
04:02:15,200 --> 04:02:17,320
So from here. From here.

3813
04:02:17,320 --> 04:02:20,720
Can you see this vicious?

3814
04:02:20,720 --> 04:02:35,600
How many of you guys can see this
see option?

3815
04:02:35,600 --> 04:02:38,760
All right, Mike,
let's see why you're not getting it.

3816
04:02:38,760 --> 04:02:41,640
I'm going to click Enable Control
integration.

3817
04:02:42,160 --> 04:02:44,120
This part, right?

3818
04:02:44,120 --> 04:02:47,560
I'm going to click here
and enable Virgin Control integration

3819
04:02:49,200 --> 04:02:50,880
of node step.

3820
04:02:50,880 --> 04:02:52,840
Right
now, I'm going to commit the code, right?

3821
04:02:52,840 --> 04:02:54,000
So you have to take the code.

3822
04:02:54,000 --> 04:02:56,960
Once you commit
your code in the repository, right,

3823
04:02:57,160 --> 04:03:00,720
then you will get all of these things.

3824
04:03:00,720 --> 04:03:05,600
Now this is virgin control system.

3825
04:03:05,600 --> 04:03:09,960
They run tools and after tools
you will see this

3826
04:03:09,960 --> 04:03:13,000
because you already have gate,
you already have gate.

3827
04:03:13,200 --> 04:03:16,320
So you guys select on, you already have

3828
04:03:16,320 --> 04:03:21,960
good there.

3829
04:03:21,960 --> 04:03:24,280
Now click okay.

3830
04:03:24,320 --> 04:03:26,920
When I select right, I click okay.

3831
04:03:26,920 --> 04:03:29,360
It gives me this option.

3832
04:03:29,360 --> 04:03:52,000
Now tell me how many of you guys
can see this get option?

3833
04:03:52,000 --> 04:03:54,360
How many of you guys can see this
option now?

3834
04:03:54,360 --> 04:03:55,840
Everyone. Right.

3835
04:03:56,280 --> 04:03:57,000
All right.

3836
04:03:57,000 --> 04:04:01,880
Point go in two weeks on the vehicle,
select the first option right.

3837
04:04:01,920 --> 04:04:06,480
Enable integration, Virgin control
integration, select the gate

3838
04:04:06,480 --> 04:04:07,520
and click okay.

3839
04:04:07,520 --> 04:04:09,960
And then you will see this
get option here.

3840
04:04:09,960 --> 04:04:14,080
Remember, guys, I'm showing you right now
how we can commit our code

3841
04:04:14,080 --> 04:04:17,440
and how we can integrate
out of virgin control out of gate

3842
04:04:17,760 --> 04:04:20,880
via using IDG that is intelligent.

3843
04:04:20,880 --> 04:04:23,920
You can do the same thing for command
from as well.

3844
04:04:24,000 --> 04:04:26,320
It gives you more power
when you use command.

3845
04:04:26,640 --> 04:04:28,000
All right. So I will show you that.

3846
04:04:28,000 --> 04:04:32,080
But also how we can commit our code via
using command.

3847
04:04:32,800 --> 04:04:33,400
Okay.

3848
04:04:33,800 --> 04:04:47,800
Everyone is getting this option gig now.

3849
04:04:47,800 --> 04:05:01,120
The next gig I need ask for manage
reports.

3850
04:05:01,120 --> 04:05:01,680
Okay.

3851
04:05:01,680 --> 04:05:04,040
I'm just select on this manage remote.

3852
04:05:04,040 --> 04:05:04,680
I'm going to get it

3853
04:05:05,880 --> 04:05:08,960
and it gives you this plus sign.

3854
04:05:08,960 --> 04:05:09,600
Right?

3855
04:05:10,800 --> 04:05:13,080
When you select this, let's sign

3856
04:05:13,080 --> 04:05:16,800
it will ask for the
You want it Now remember I copied this.

3857
04:05:16,800 --> 04:05:17,920
You are in from here.

3858
04:05:17,920 --> 04:05:19,840
This the you want to write?

3859
04:05:19,840 --> 04:05:21,800
I copied this you are in.

3860
04:05:21,800 --> 04:05:25,240
I will go and simply paste this
You are in here correct?

3861
04:05:26,480 --> 04:05:27,960
Right is understandable.

3862
04:05:27,960 --> 04:05:32,280
So what I'm doing click on get manage

3863
04:05:32,280 --> 04:05:35,720
reports then click click click on this
plus sign.

3864
04:05:36,480 --> 04:05:38,800
Enter the you are in and then click.

3865
04:05:38,800 --> 04:05:42,080
Okay. And you see this.

3866
04:05:42,080 --> 04:05:46,560
You are in here.

3867
04:05:46,560 --> 04:05:47,160
We're due.

3868
04:05:47,160 --> 04:05:49,680
I'm trying to integrate this
with my project

3869
04:05:49,680 --> 04:05:52,160
because I'm going to commit this code.
Right?

3870
04:05:52,640 --> 04:05:53,560
I will give you this.

3871
04:05:53,560 --> 04:05:55,520
You are in so you can update the code.

3872
04:05:55,520 --> 04:05:57,880
You can get the updated version
of the code, right.

3873
04:05:58,440 --> 04:06:02,080
If you also commit the code in this
repository, there will be a conflict,

3874
04:06:02,880 --> 04:06:06,160
right.

3875
04:06:06,160 --> 04:06:07,080
I will give you this.

3876
04:06:07,080 --> 04:06:09,280
You can use it to get the pull of the code

3877
04:06:10,080 --> 04:06:13,640
the way you guys are taking the code
from my previous repositories.

3878
04:06:13,640 --> 04:06:13,840
Right.

3879
04:06:13,840 --> 04:06:16,000
You can take it from get as one click.

3880
04:06:16,000 --> 04:06:18,800
Okay, fine

3881
04:06:29,440 --> 04:06:29,920
guys.

3882
04:06:30,200 --> 04:06:36,040
So far is it fine. Yes.

3883
04:06:36,600 --> 04:06:38,240
Correct. Correct.

3884
04:06:38,240 --> 04:06:40,360
You will use this repository

3885
04:06:40,360 --> 04:06:43,720
after your good session
when you will be working on your project.

3886
04:06:43,720 --> 04:06:44,080
Right.

3887
04:06:44,080 --> 04:06:47,440
You will use your own repository
that you have to manage your remote

3888
04:06:47,440 --> 04:06:49,920
and you have to do everything
the way I'm doing right now.

3889
04:06:49,920 --> 04:06:58,440
Okay.

3890
04:06:58,440 --> 04:06:59,000
All right.

3891
04:06:59,000 --> 04:07:01,520
So now if you see I'm
having these three options, wait

3892
04:07:03,200 --> 04:07:05,280
to take the updated code from the project,

3893
04:07:05,520 --> 04:07:09,440
from the repository to commit the code
and to push the code.

3894
04:07:09,840 --> 04:07:14,400
Remember, before pushing the code to the
repository, first we have to commit.

3895
04:07:14,760 --> 04:07:17,400
Commit means transfer your code

3896
04:07:17,400 --> 04:07:20,640
from local machine to your depository.

3897
04:07:20,880 --> 04:07:21,480
Right.

3898
04:07:21,480 --> 04:07:26,360
So first you commit and the moment you
push it, it will go into your repository.

3899
04:07:26,640 --> 04:07:28,440
So first I'm going to commit this code

3900
04:07:30,320 --> 04:07:31,400
exist.

3901
04:07:31,800 --> 04:07:35,000
Just select all the checkboxes
so it will get all of the files there.

3902
04:07:35,040 --> 04:07:36,360
Right. And commit a message.

3903
04:07:36,360 --> 04:07:38,000
So I'm saying

3904
04:07:38,800 --> 04:07:43,200
the latest code.

3905
04:07:43,200 --> 04:07:46,440
October 18

3906
04:07:47,560 --> 04:07:49,200
2021 Right.

3907
04:07:49,200 --> 04:07:51,480
This must be the commit the message.

3908
04:07:51,480 --> 04:07:54,720
So this is the standard message
because every day you commit your code

3909
04:07:54,960 --> 04:07:58,800
and whenever you commit your right every
single day before leaving the office,

3910
04:07:58,960 --> 04:08:00,720
you commit your code to the repository.

3911
04:08:00,720 --> 04:08:02,400
This is the procedure, guys.

3912
04:08:02,400 --> 04:08:06,520
Never, ever keep your code on to the local
machine before leaving office.

3913
04:08:06,520 --> 04:08:09,560
Always commit your code
into the repository, getting it.

3914
04:08:10,120 --> 04:08:10,960
Everyone

3915
04:08:15,560 --> 04:08:15,920
code.

3916
04:08:15,960 --> 04:08:18,440
What if your system gets crashed
in the night?

3917
04:08:19,120 --> 04:08:22,200
Every data, every single code lost.

3918
04:08:22,200 --> 04:08:22,840
Right.

3919
04:08:23,440 --> 04:08:26,200
So that's why you should keep everything

3920
04:08:26,200 --> 04:08:41,240
in the repository? Yes.

3921
04:08:41,240 --> 04:08:42,000
Like yes.

3922
04:08:42,000 --> 04:08:49,320
Correct.

3923
04:08:49,320 --> 04:08:51,920
I will see my that I will
I will look into this.

3924
04:08:51,920 --> 04:08:54,560
Why it is why is it happy now?

3925
04:08:55,080 --> 04:08:57,720
Now you'll see all of these files
I've mentioned latest

3926
04:08:57,720 --> 04:09:00,840
quarter message
and simply I'm committing this coming

3927
04:09:06,600 --> 04:09:07,560
the moment I can make it.

3928
04:09:07,560 --> 04:09:10,160
So two files contain problems, right?

3929
04:09:10,200 --> 04:09:11,840
No errors and three warnings.

3930
04:09:11,840 --> 04:09:13,400
Fine, because no errors.

3931
04:09:13,400 --> 04:09:15,600
I can commit to my code.

3932
04:09:17,040 --> 04:09:18,440
You will see one message here.

3933
04:09:18,440 --> 04:09:24,120
It says ten files completed right?

3934
04:09:24,120 --> 04:09:27,000
Yes, it is fine. It is fine. No issues.

3935
04:09:27,280 --> 04:09:29,600
It says ten points committed right

3936
04:09:30,760 --> 04:09:33,200
now after committing What is the next.

3937
04:09:33,200 --> 04:09:36,040
Come on, we have to after commit.

3938
04:09:36,040 --> 04:09:37,240
We have to

3939
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:42,960
push, right?

3940
04:09:42,960 --> 04:09:45,360
We have to push our code
to the repository.

3941
04:09:45,680 --> 04:09:48,560
So from here this is the option.

3942
04:09:48,560 --> 04:09:52,560
See, it's this push
and the short key is control shift key

3943
04:09:53,040 --> 04:09:56,920
Mac users
command shift key or option shift key.

3944
04:09:56,920 --> 04:09:57,960
Right. Command shift.

3945
04:09:57,960 --> 04:10:00,840
Basically click here on PUSH

3946
04:10:01,320 --> 04:10:04,920
and it says from master to origin Master,
you will push your command.

3947
04:10:04,960 --> 04:10:09,880
Right now, all this project structure,
this project you will get when you push it

3948
04:10:10,440 --> 04:10:13,680
right, when you push it again,
you will get successful message here.

3949
04:10:14,400 --> 04:10:17,400
I'm going to use token
because it will ask for the token.

3950
04:10:17,400 --> 04:10:23,320
So I my token available here.

3951
04:10:23,320 --> 04:10:33,960
I focus on this.

3952
04:10:33,960 --> 04:10:39,520
This is my token.

3953
04:10:39,520 --> 04:10:42,800
So I will tell you
how to get this token right

3954
04:10:51,840 --> 04:11:24,120
by forces because

3955
04:11:25,160 --> 04:11:26,360
the second

3956
04:11:28,320 --> 04:11:31,880
point but this is the same one

3957
04:11:36,720 --> 04:11:39,120
I have it already.

3958
04:11:39,360 --> 04:11:43,320
It says the token is wrong,
but I've deleted this token.

3959
04:11:43,320 --> 04:11:45,360
Let me take this token from here
once again

3960
04:11:47,040 --> 04:12:28,760
by going inside settings.

3961
04:12:28,760 --> 04:12:52,640
So no, it is incorrect.

3962
04:12:52,800 --> 04:13:08,280
This is not the correct one.

3963
04:13:08,280 --> 04:13:10,680
And comics is someone has changed.

3964
04:13:10,920 --> 04:13:13,280
No, no, no. It's not working.

3965
04:13:13,640 --> 04:13:20,480
There a problem?

3966
04:13:20,480 --> 04:13:22,800
Yes, someone has updated already, guys.

3967
04:13:22,800 --> 04:13:24,960
So I will update this code. Right.

3968
04:13:25,080 --> 04:13:28,120
I mean I'm updated
the code and communicate as well.

3969
04:13:28,400 --> 04:13:30,800
It is just
we need to check the credentials because

3970
04:13:31,360 --> 04:13:33,680
someone has changed his credentials.

3971
04:13:33,680 --> 04:13:36,560
So we have to check the authorization.

3972
04:13:36,560 --> 04:13:38,520
And once I get this token, I will update.

3973
04:13:38,520 --> 04:13:43,760
It's okay.

3974
04:13:43,760 --> 04:13:50,640
I will push discord
in the repository for sure.

3975
04:13:50,640 --> 04:13:51,480
All right.

3976
04:13:51,480 --> 04:13:54,360
Because it was working
and I don't know what happened.

3977
04:13:54,360 --> 04:13:56,640
Now someone has updated the password

3978
04:14:00,280 --> 04:14:00,600
again.

3979
04:14:00,600 --> 04:14:01,960
It will ask for this.

3980
04:14:01,960 --> 04:14:04,800
Let me copy one more time.

3981
04:14:04,880 --> 04:14:08,080
No, Someone has changed
to define nowadays.

3982
04:14:08,400 --> 04:14:11,000
So there is so far this code, right?

3983
04:14:11,040 --> 04:14:13,080
Whatever the code we have written.

3984
04:14:13,080 --> 04:14:28,400
Do you guys have any question
in this code?

3985
04:14:28,400 --> 04:14:29,360
All right.

3986
04:14:29,440 --> 04:14:32,160
Was it understandable for everyone, guys,
to this session

3987
04:14:32,160 --> 04:14:42,480
session?

3988
04:14:42,480 --> 04:14:44,080
All right, great.

3989
04:14:44,080 --> 04:14:47,000
Guys. I think I'm done from my previous
session. Thank you so much for that.
