1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,200
All right, guys.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,680
Last number one, NBA.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,040
And I've already started recording it.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,360
You see, it's already started.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,880
Okay.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,680
I hope everyone can hear me clearly

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,960
once you're nice, because today

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,120
the only thing you have to do is

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,720
listen to them speak.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,520
Just listen to me what I'm saying.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,880
See what I'm doing here on the screen.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,720
Right?

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,840
You don't have to touch anything.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,360
Anything, Billy.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,320
Right. And that.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,160
So you will be able to understand
every single thing.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,680
What I'm going to teach

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,560
just fine.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,080
First, understand, let's start from a

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,560
the time

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,240
simple language,

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,720
full form is application

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
programing

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,600
interface.

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,320
What is it?

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,360
Is a master expert, by the way. It

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,880
application programing interface API.

28
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,720
This is the full form,
just simply for right

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,600
now. Let me explain to you what API is

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,360
my medium.

31
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:16,680
I don't even know the meaning of one word
from this for fine

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
application programing interface.

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:32,520
You guys must have seen.

34
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,960
Uh. Okay,

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,400
now you guys must have seen
this many people names, I would say

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
hundreds of times.

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
Google things,
which I'm going to explain, you know.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,920
But you didn't observe them

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,080
the way I want you to observe from now
what works.

40
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,920
So now, from today onwards,
after that glass, whenever

41
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,480
you look at those things,
your perceptions will completely changed.

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,760
It will be changed
because of the explanation

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,840
you're going to have from today.
All right.

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,960
So in this post,
Glass will see the significance of it,

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,200
rate the use of it,

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,240
how it has changed, significant how

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,320
it has brought significant change
on dinner table for all of us.

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,240
How big connects
so many things, how it provides

49
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,760
so many benefits in our lives
right from now,

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,240
and how we generally use them
in this industry.

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,320
Without this,
I don't think that anyone from us is

52
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,440
surviving day in this digital world.

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,440
Let's start them one by one right?

54
00:03:40,440 --> 00:04:05,800
First, let's consider one example
a very simple example.

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,920
What is this based?

56
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,120
This is a restaurant
called a Message in my husband.

57
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,120
All right.

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,120
So restaurants, this is my message

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,000
for Katrina because what it was doing.

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,000
So let's play

61
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,280
right now.

62
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,200
Now, let's see in this in this restaurant.

63
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,960
In this restaurant right.

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,720
Maryam threw a party movement.

65
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,760
That's what they meant, a Katrina.

66
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,600
They all came to the party.

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,160
They all came to the party.

68
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,120
Now, let me give you
the internal arrangement of this.

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
This is their table, right.

70
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,800
Which is available here in my their right.

71
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,480
And these are the chairs available
like so here,

72
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,320
see my safety

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,040
right it Katrina is sitting

74
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,760
on Maryam Izadi certainly her mother also.

75
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,080
Right.

76
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,400
Or what was passing
by saw Maryam Coleman here also joining

77
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,600
so what this sitting in the group

78
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,480
but now now

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
this is the very basic example

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm giving you a very basic exam

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,800
not on this day, but on this table.

82
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,760
You for people.

83
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,560
Absolutely right.

84
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,240
If you need something to eat,
listen carefully.

85
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,200
This if you need something to eat, trade,
there is a kitchen available

86
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,560
right where ship is making so many things.

87
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,240
So Chef Sylvain is available.

88
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,720
Right ship is cooking everything

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,840
right now.

90
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,560
If you need something

91
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,960
from me, for example,

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,680
produce, you're asking them,
What do you do?

93
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,760
Right.

94
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,280
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,040
I'm sorry if I misspelled this, but.

96
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,720
Okay.

97
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
If you need this on me,

98
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,400
we're saying we come together
to give whatever the things you need.

99
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,360
Will you be able to communicate

100
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:34,400
directly with me?

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,360
That's good. You can have

102
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,720
Jimmy Castro's friend get request.

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,840
I, Jimmy, No,

104
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,640
you cannot communicate with me directly.

105
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,920
Right?

106
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
You communicate here.

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,680
You communicate here with a person.

108
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,600
We call him maybe a waiter

109
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,680
or a server or some of the things. Right?

110
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,360
So let's say
your server guy is available yet

111
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,280
his name assignments

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,680
like my best friend assignments.

113
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,720
He's a bit in my company

114
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,760
because he is my best friend.

115
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,960
There's what I do with my best friend
most of the times.

116
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,160
Like So now.

117
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,280
Now what do you usually do?

118
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,760
Simonds and Mr.

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,200
Simonds will ask you, ma'am,
what you need it.

120
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,680
Miriam's is I need this burrito.

121
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,880
Assignments will come to me.

122
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
Assignments will ask me first,

123
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
Do we have burritos straight?

124
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,600
If I say yes, we do.

125
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,520
Yes, we do have.

126
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,120
Right.

127
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,800
Then it says will get fine.

128
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,000
She ask for one burrito, right?

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,920
She asks for one burrito. Right.

130
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,080
Make it

131
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,720
right, make it once.

132
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,800
But it is really not.

133
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,760
Who will you going to make this?

134
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,640
I am a chef, right? This is my that.

135
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,320
I'm going to make it like.

136
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,880
So if I'm going to make it

137
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,520
after cooking your burrito,
after making you connect

138
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,880
directly, come and give it to you.

139
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,920
Do not look right.

140
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,960
Like who?

141
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,840
Who is going to who is going to delivery

142
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,560
this Mr. Simas.

143
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,360
So you will send this burrito wire, Mr.

144
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,840
Simas and Mr.

145
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,600
Simon is going to deliver it on your team,

146
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,000
Correct?

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,520
Is this correct

148
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,920
enemy?

149
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,920
How many times
how many times you did this in your

150
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,920
multiple times?

151
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,760
Thousands of times. Millions of times.

152
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,840
Alex is exceptional.

153
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,920
These are just one very nice,

154
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
great.

155
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,400
Maybe you're saying one way everything

156
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,440
might be fine.

157
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,800
So now, now see why.

158
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,000
Why you cannot communicate with chefs

159
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,720
Because of so many reasons.

160
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,600
Because of so many reasons.

161
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,880
Let me tell you, some of

162
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,680
the first reason might be

163
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,280
because you guys know
English extremely well.

164
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,840
Right?

165
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,280
And that guys, chefs or Italian

166
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,160
explained it extremely well, Benny.

167
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,160
But you guys don't know how to speak
Italian.

168
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,720
He doesn't know how to speak English.

169
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,040
Now, people from two different languages

170
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,160
cannot communicate with each other,

171
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,000
cannot communicate with each other.

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,640
Right?

173
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,200
So if if you cannot communicate
with each other what you need,

174
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,400
you need someone in intermediate grade.

175
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,720
You need intermediate who can establish

176
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,640
a connection in between you and chef.

177
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,680
So who can take your order?

178
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,120
Go there in the order
bank and delivery on your table.

179
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,200
You need someone like this. Correct?

180
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,000
You need someone considered.

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,560
We will translate Zima.

182
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,040
That one was
This can also be an example. Great.

183
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,880
We need someone in between.

184
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,600
Correct.

185
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,040
So who can help us in

186
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,160
communicating with the chef what it is.

187
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,000
It would be this

188
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,240
second reason.

189
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,680
Right now we're talking for
small restaurant, great small restaurant.

190
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,520
We're not involved right now,
but if you go to any first grade,

191
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,520
maybe you are at the eighth floor on ninth
or 10th floor of the you

192
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,560
that you're ordering from. Right.

193
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,000
But the restaurant is not available
in the same to the restaurant, maybe

194
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,800
in the ground floor or maybe in the top
of a beautiful it could be possibly

195
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,040
right place.

196
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,160
So what chef
and you guys are not at the same place

197
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
when you both are not in the same place.

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,680
It's impossible
to connect with each other.

199
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,440
Right? You're not going to call anyone
to the ship

200
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,000
and the name of the page you have.
I did this, but you have this.

201
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,120
You don't have the money.

202
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,160
Even got it and is not.

203
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,040
You know that
he doesn't have that much of time

204
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,680
that he will going to accept your call

205
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,800
waiting making something in the restaurant

206
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,360
at the same time you cannot do this

207
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,720
right this he cannot do this.

208
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,480
So again
you need someone who can communicate

209
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,320
in between you and the chef.

210
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,840
Speak now.

211
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,360
Now, when we talk about this part,
when we talked about this

212
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,680
part, this situation, here,
we have three things.

213
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,160
First, medium

214
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,640
thinking.

215
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,680
So that is a chef.

216
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,520
Third,

217
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,680
silence is a wait, right?

218
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,600
It is, but she is a customer.

219
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,760
So customer, waiter and shame.

220
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
When we talk about blind

221
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,280
server architecture, remember one thing.

222
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,600
Remember one thing.

223
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,400
The one the one who makes a request.

224
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,800
The one the one who gives
the order is like

225
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,520
the one who provides,
who provides the food.

226
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,240
Who makes the food is server

227
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,600
and the one
the one who is transporting this order.

228
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,960
Taking the dishes back to you
on your table is your

229
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:17,440
If is your

230
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,560
Nona's good API is timer's

231
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,000
server is so that

232
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,560
remember the chef chef cannot be a waiter

233
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,640
and Victor cannot be a she. Read

234
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,600
the is understood this

235
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,760
first example
what I explained about restaurant

236
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,800
three

237
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,520
Now here

238
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,080
when we talk about client server
architecture, right.

239
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,360
Remember if you understand this term,
what is Glen server architecture right.

240
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,480
And you implement the things the way
I'm trying to explain you entire

241
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,600
a bar is a piece of cake.

242
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
Entire A bar is a piece of cake.

243
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,320
The only thing you should understand
is what I'm explaining.

244
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,280
You truly

245
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,280
connect connecting people

246
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,480
right after connecting people disappears,

247
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:42,800
right?

248
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,320
We don't need that kind of a

249
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,840
Gardner.

250
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,680
Right.

251
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,920
Is this butterscotch?

252
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,680
If we discuss after we send it

253
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,280
right?

254
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
So now,

255
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,880
now, here it you see in client

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,640
server
architecture, right when you're customer.

257
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,320
But in this particular example
as a customer, you are a client.

258
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,880
As a chef is chef and Ms.

259
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,320
is a server.

260
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,600
Right?

261
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,160
And this waiter, Mr.

262
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:25,560
Simonds, he is an API is an API.

263
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,360
So the order you give

264
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,080
listen one more point again,

265
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,440
the order you give in this situation,

266
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,480
we call this order as

267
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,880
a request

268
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,600
request.

269
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,080
So assignments beg your request, right?

270
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,680
It API take your request to home

271
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,880
server

272
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,240
and then server answers to your request

273
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,520
Server answers to your request.

274
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,240
So the answer settlement is giving you.

275
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,000
So the answer server is giving you.

276
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,120
We call it

277
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,520
response.

278
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,080
We call it a response. Understood.

279
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,520
The one you say is request.

280
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,000
The one you receive is response.

281
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,720
So the one client is sending request.

282
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,160
EPA is taking your request to data server

283
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,600
server is providing something to API
that is response.

284
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,640
So API is again
taking back this response to that line.

285
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,600
So blind server connected
via API client is sending request APIs,

286
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,920
taking the request, taking it to

287
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,080
someone
instead of what is returning the response.

288
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,920
Again, it is taking this response
and delivering it back to the customer or

289
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,800
playing server architecture using API

290
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,560
in normal length windows to

291
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,120
the ones we're doing.

292
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,240
So far so good or not

293
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,040
nice,

294
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,680
but do you want me to go slow

295
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,000
or the point

296
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,040
after a long time

297
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:44,560
and then the device?

298
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,480
Right now
let me give you the example of API

299
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,760
how API box is you could see

300
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,560
and then you will be blown away

301
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,960
by thinking that, Oh,

302
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,280
I'm seeing API every day
and I wasn't aware of it.

303
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,640
Seeing

304
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,960
first this example clearly,
so I'm not going to use it anymore.

305
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,480
It will deliver

306
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,560
liquid logic.

307
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,840
Tell me some of the banks,
some of the famous banks of use

308
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,960
the name of those banks

309
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,440
which you guys are using, Bank of America

310
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,160
cheese

311
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,400
for Wells Fargo,

312
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,560
Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation.

313
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,160
You'd be fine.

314
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Enough, enough, enough, enough.

315
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,200
I don't want bank account in any of them.

316
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,960
And that's Scream five is more than

317
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,600
B and C, D, C, u, ABC, x, y, z.

318
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,920
When you do three every bank
Lloyd user got

319
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,920
25 banks is c d d Bank of America

320
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,960
is Wells Fargo, HSBC right

321
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,400
now tell me how many of you guys

322
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,720
are using this credit debit cards,

323
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,320
specifically debit card to withdraw
the money from the ATMs and everything

324
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,400
almost.

325
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,560
All right.

326
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,000
And don't take the responsibility
for every one

327
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,840
about yourself.

328
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,360
I just delivered an audit.

329
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,320
Someone said I don't use
by using it on my behalf,

330
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,560
but majority,

331
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,120
you use this card rate, fine.

332
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,680
Have you ever observe then
if you have a card

333
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,440
of Bank of America
radio Bank account in Bank of America.

334
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,840
But if you go to a be a machine

335
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,880
automatic bid machine,
everyone knows Indian Railways.

336
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,760
The machines we generally use it will do
the amount they do to check the status.

337
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,960
Even this idiom belongs to Chase Bank.

338
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,760
This APM is for kids bank right

339
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,120
race If you go there.

340
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,200
If you go there,

341
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,160
if you go there in this bank

342
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,760
here, a machine is available
and you insert your card

343
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,200
which is available in Bank of America,

344
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,000
but your account is available
in Bank of America.

345
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,960
But you are you forget about
how many dollars yet charging

346
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,880
and why they're chatting and not willing
to talk about the job is not right.

347
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,000
We are going to talk about the school
right.

348
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,720
Money comes first. Everything.

349
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,960
I'm explaining something.

350
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,440
No one is going to focus on that.

351
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,320
Everyone's thinking
I have to pay the money.

352
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,800
We don't have to pay the charge.

353
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,320
See here, here

354
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,400
in this ADB,

355
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,600
a card that you have,
this card is Bank of America card.

356
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,000
Great.

357
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,040
But the ATM you're using this is belong
to the 18 belongs to your she bank.

358
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,800
But still the moment you inside your card

359
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:28,680
it shows your date on one.

360
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,680
It shows your little notation

361
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,560
right

362
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,840
now Now just consider the same situation.

363
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,280
Just consider the same situation.

364
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,040
All bank can integrate.

365
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,640
It's like this it money is trying to exist
in another form

366
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,760
and as opens up hopefully is
but it shows at another point.

367
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,840
Miracle Epsilon

368
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,560
three.

369
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,480
Is it possible?

370
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,480
Is it possible?

371
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
No, no, no, no, not it's north.

372
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,720
See, Marina is already
logged in in her form,

373
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,160
and that is loaded in her phone.

374
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,760
So if you logged in with your account,

375
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,280
you can not
it can not show any of that account.

376
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,000
Right.
It can not show any of that account.

377
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,000
But but here in this A.T.M.,

378
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,960
a guy from Bank of America
from d d bank chains

379
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,160
bends for just b c from any bank,
from any bank rate.

380
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,800
You have a debit card or debit card.

381
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,680
You want to withdraw some money,
you go in any of the atrium right there.

382
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,680
You use your card and it will allow you to
withdraw your money.

383
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,880
It will allow you to withdraw your money.
Right.

384
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,880
This is the functionality everyone knows.

385
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,640
That's how things work in. Let

386
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,440
everyone

387
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Now let me give you how

388
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,400
this things work in banking.

389
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:10,960
See, that's

390
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,240
fine.

391
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,160
So now, now see what happens.

392
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,080
This database.

393
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,400
This database is available.

394
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,280
They will find their trade.

395
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,320
What example? Bank of America.

396
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,240
Read all the all the information related
to the customers accounts and everything.

397
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,200
Bank of America put all this information

398
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,280
here in its database

399
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,160
right now.

400
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,480
Don't you think that is
data is very, very important

401
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,680
for the bank?

402
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,240
It is very important.

403
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,360
Can they share their data
with any other bank,

404
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,240
For example,
this is their database or Chase Bank.

405
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,600
This is their data for us.

406
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,480
No, they cannot share any data
with any other bank.

407
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,680
Correct.

408
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,400
Any other data with the credit.

409
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,600
History is not the financial data, Right.

410
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,200
It's your record
just to give you more loan or something.

411
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:50,840
Right.

412
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So see,
Bank of America has its own database,

413
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,280
which is purely Securency, right?

414
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,120
Chase Bank has its own database, which is
purely secured, and at the same time

415
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,480
the bank has its own redundancies
or just purely secured seats.

416
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,120
Correct?

417
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,280
So we have multiple database for

418
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,400
multiple banks.

419
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,200
The point

420
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,080
multiple database for multiple banks.

421
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,000
Then how is it possible
that when they try to insert my bank card

422
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,200
right in any other way as these bank AGM,
it is able to rate

423
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,600
this particular bank
is able to fetch my data?

424
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,520
How is it possible when bank is not going
to allow the access to their databases,

425
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,120
to any of their main, then how does a be a
machine is getting my data.

426
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,720
That is the only question.

427
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:04,200
See how it looks.

428
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,760
Remember all these banks,
whatever the private banks are available,

429
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,400
public banks are available, government
banks are available.

430
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,560
They all are connected to federal bank

431
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,960
better Bank is basically
a government government bank.

432
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,000
Even centralized bank, federal bank.

433
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,120
It owns this federal bank owns
all the banks.

434
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,160
Right?

435
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,680
So all banks, for example,
it is Bank of America,

436
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,880
Chase Bank, any bank, any other bank.

437
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,240
All these banks are connected
to federal banks or not. The

438
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,960
all these are connected to

439
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,800
connect.

440
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,240
So now here, here, here,
every bank is connected.

441
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,480
This one, this one, maybe some World Bank.

442
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,080
Right.

443
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,640
And then this A-Team, this A.T.M.

444
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,120
machine, the Indian machine we talk about.

445
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,920
Right.

446
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,120
This data machine from Let's see,
she has been trained.

447
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
It is connected
to this centralized server.

448
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,080
Okay?

449
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,560
It is connected
to this centralized server.

450
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,400
So now what is happening at

451
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,040
the moment, right?

452
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,680
See how it works?

453
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,320
All these banks are connected to Central
bank, right?

454
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,600
The moment you insert your card, you get

455
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,920
the moment to insert your card.

456
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:33,080
It sends a message, a signal
to just bank that, Hey, I got one card

457
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,720
having the number one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

458
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,160
Do we have any detail
for this particular card?

459
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,320
So just banks is.

460
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,760
No, we don't have any user with this data.

461
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,200
It transfers that request to us
and delays the database.

462
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,800
So now here in this centralized database.

463
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,520
Right.

464
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,760
Because their data was not able to phone
inches bank.

465
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,400
Right.

466
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,880
What is being does it send your request
to federal bank database

467
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,480
here in central bank
see Bank of America is available.

468
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,280
Chase Bank is available right.

469
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,600
Citibank is available,
Wells Fargo is available.

470
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,520
Other banks are also available.

471
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,680
So now it quickly
check with everyone who you have.

472
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,560
You have it is. Yes.

473
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,720
Bank of America says yes, I do have

474
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,080
I do have this database available with me.

475
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,840
Find it sense
that the risk to Bank of America, someone.

476
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,080
But now when it sends
that it goes to Bank of America.

477
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,920
Central Bank of America says yes,
it is a customer, a gentleman customer

478
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,600
having everything in the account
allow him to use his account.

479
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,920
So the moment it sends this message,
this is what we call response.

480
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,560
The response comes back to the central
bank.

481
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,720
It transfers back to the bank.

482
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,520
Just bank shows the same thing unexpected.

483
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,880
And that's
how you generally take your money

484
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,920
from the

485
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,080
industrial

486
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,360
underscored

487
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,480
everyone.

488
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,080
Now let's talk about $3

489
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,400
to spark

490
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,600
your favorite.

491
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Everyone's favorite, $3.

492
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,160
Why? Why they charged this three bucks?

493
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,200
What is the reason behind it?

494
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,880
Why did you have to this three bucks?

495
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,520
Basically because they can.

496
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Right.

497
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,640
So remember, remember case

498
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,240
if you use the same bank
18 various account exist.

499
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,640
You don't have to charge anything.

500
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:02,920
If you

501
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,080
use someone else's a DRM,
then you have to charge.

502
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,840
You have to be right

503
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,680
that in case

504
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,200
why is it
see if your account is inches bank

505
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,480
and you put you inside your card
in the ATM that Adam is also

506
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,520
in the juice bank, it simply sends
you requested it's simplest answer

507
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,600
request here just makes is yes,
we do have this.

508
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,520
We do have this. Okay.

509
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,680
So are they interacting
with this federal bank services?

510
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,160
Are they interacting?

511
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,520
He is no right.

512
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,160
So there it provides
a detail directly to you.

513
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,240
Just make sense.
All right. We have this data.

514
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,680
We are not going to connect.

515
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,080
We are not going to leverage your services
for this particular call.

516
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,960
That's fine.

517
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,400
We are going to allow this user
to take anything from his account.

518
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,320
Right?

519
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,600
Right. But

520
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,760
when it comes to this centralized

521
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,920
database of central bank, this works.

522
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,720
This would be issues
to this linking of connections,

523
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,800
everything to maintain this,
to keep them updated.

524
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,800
Right.

525
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,120
And live and working and up all the time.

526
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,720
24 seven. Right.

527
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,880
It means it requires a lot of maintenance

528
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,440
rate case,

529
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,360
but it requires a lot of maintenance

530
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,920
so they can not charge with anyone
about this maintenance.

531
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,400
So what they do is if you are using
the services that only you have to charge,

532
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,360
if you don't use the services,
you don't have to charge.

533
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,120
And that's that's
why if you use any of that, Adam,

534
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,080
if you use any of that idiom,
then only you have to pay this price.

535
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,280
Otherwise you don't have to pay this price

536
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,400
got replaced.

537
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,640
How We
generally get the money from the Indian.

538
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,840
So now, now here,
the one who is sending the request,

539
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,280
who is taking the response,

540
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,040
communicating with all the banks
that were with federal Bank, everything.

541
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,640
Right?

542
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,280
Maybe other database of Bank of America
is available in New York

543
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,480
and maybe the database of Chase Bank
is available in Washington, DC

544
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,960
and maybe this federal bank
centralized is robbery is available.

545
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,520
Maybe it's the Chicago, Illinois. Right.

546
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,400
And the guy is trying to get this money
from to California.

547
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,200
Right.

548
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,240
So one is in Pacific, one is in Eastern

549
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,360
Time, one is in Central Bank.

550
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,560
All over the U.S.

551
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,160
things are distributed everywhere.

552
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,200
But then who is going to connect
all these things together?

553
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,080
Who is sending this request?

554
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,640
Who is picking the response?

555
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,080
Everything. Who is doing

556
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,520
behind

557
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,520
FBI connect all this?

558
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,520
This comes together
to make of one ecosystem,

559
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,640
to make one ecosystem.

560
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,560
All right.

561
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,840
Now, tell me since how long
you have been using this services,

562
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Indian services, long thing

563
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,160
since how many years
when you have been using this?

564
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:28,080
18, maybe five, six, seven, eight,
nine years, 18 years.

565
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,280
Right. It might be possible.

566
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,280
1983.

567
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,800
Like similar.

568
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,720
You are older than this planning.

569
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,240
Excellent.

570
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,000
All right.

571
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,160
So, see, we have been using this database

572
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,240
in so long,
but we never knew that we're using API.

573
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,280
We are utilizing API visit

574
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,000
industrial, this example,

575
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:09,440
every one.

576
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,920
So for any confusion in describing
what API means,

577
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:24,200
how we works.

578
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,760
Right.

579
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,720
So the first example, the first example
which I gave you

580
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,400
was a completely non-technical example.

581
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,000
I took probably a length

582
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,040
and then the next example

583
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,160
which I give you, it is a little bit
technical, little bit technical.

584
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,120
Right now the title exemple,
which I'm going to give you

585
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,840
is more technical in More Easy,

586
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,320
which we use every now and then.

587
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,160
We use every now and then.

588
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,720
Right?

589
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,160
So let's go ahead and take that exam.

590
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:18,920
Zima Something came for you
in the chat. Oh,

591
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,000
by the way, there is liquidity.

592
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,360
One thing we have an option
where you can text first with your

593
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,400
in case in case if you need

594
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,240
we have that option.

595
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,840
Just it

596
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,000
it's for me.

597
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,400
Thank you so much matter.

598
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,200
So now see I'm going to open right
one particular

599
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,880
application.

600
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,960
Let the journey begin.

601
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,840
Skyscanner don't go.

602
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,880
Not in the right.

603
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,880
What is this?

604
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,160
Days Skyscanner

605
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,440
great website, the book tickets, the link

606
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,960
basically.

607
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,800
So for example, if you want to book hotel
for your upcoming vacation

608
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,520
in Santorini Island, Greece,
you can go here, put your best in

609
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,960
if you want to book a tickets.

610
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,320
If your visit to India, come and meet.

611
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,400
I'm available right.

612
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,280
So you book tickets from here.

613
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,080
If you want to hire something
in any other country

614
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,320
where you're traveling,
great for vacation,

615
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,320
you can simply
you can simply hire those car services.

616
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,320
Also from you know nice.

617
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,520
Makes them bank for sure.

618
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,600
No, just give me a heads up in advance
before two weeks

619
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,840
and to be able to make some

620
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,240
Katrina

621
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,240
Internet.

622
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,200
Is it

623
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,520
when is going

624
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:27,960
to be committed?

625
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,440
So you need

626
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,680
how would I handle

627
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,480
why they're trying to ruinously

628
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,640
I already have 21 trainings in pipeline.

629
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:28,120
How can I make such a decision?

630
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,280
My plans can wait.

631
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,760
No, someone else will take this.

632
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,720
Basically

633
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,280
it conflict

634
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,400
work is a priority.

635
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,080
It simply does reality.

636
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,720
As long as you're working
people just think

637
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,440
as long as you're delivering
according to their requirements

638
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,760
of their requirement,
they reach on you, talk to you.

639
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,000
That is you.

640
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,080
They give you money,
they give you everything,

641
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,640
they give you your their time is.

642
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,560
But the moment you stop doing all of this
things and you focus on the person,

643
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,080
they would forget.

644
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,120
They would forget for sure, Right?

645
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,320
The one rule that applies to
this one is the rule of exchange.

646
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,520
You give you knowledge,
you give your time,

647
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,280
and then they give you respect.

648
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,480
It is nothing great.

649
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,880
Giving selflessly to the community
doesn't exist anymore.

650
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,400
It's simply to it.

651
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,160
No, I'm talking about in general,
everywhere you go,

652
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,080
whether it is a business
or it is any of that thing, everywhere

653
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,080
you go, right, it happens, right?

654
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,040
So it's it's better to

655
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,240
accept what it is and how we have.

656
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,280
So that that's
why you have to be very nice, right?

657
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,080
You have to have more

658
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,440
knowledge like an export.

659
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,480
So when you open your mouth,
you build people who you are busy.

660
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:08,880
Good.

661
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,200
So make sure
whenever you just enter into the room,

662
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,720
you just light up being dead
or with your presence.

663
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,880
That kind of knowledge,
that kind of confidence must not educate.

664
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,800
You should get it actually right.

665
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,720
So that's where I'm focusing on is right.

666
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,960
The one you're talking about
is not a big deal.

667
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,960
If I decide in the morning,
in the afternoon, you didn't get a news

668
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,440
credit, that sort of big deal.

669
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,040
This is something we can do
at any point of time.

670
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,400
Everyone is doing this.

671
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,240
But what I am doing,
everyone cannot do it right.

672
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,800
So do the provision
that everyone can not do.

673
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,680
And then automatically
you will get more respect,

674
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,360
more valued.

675
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:58,560
Fine.

676
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,080
That that's what I'm betting you learn.

677
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,160
More commission engineers are available
in the market right?

678
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,320
But once you start betting,
they prevent in such a way

679
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,760
prepared yourself in such a weak
field knowledge in such a way

680
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,520
that you can tell this right when making
I wanted to your recruiter like this.

681
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,680
Okay go ahead find all the people

682
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,720
find the screen
all other candidates in the US.

683
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,400
If you find someone like me
hired him otherwise come in

684
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,040
like this kind of attitude you should get.

685
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,520
And believe me, the moment you get it,
this type of attitude and the way

686
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,600
you give your interview with this
attitude, they will not going anywhere.

687
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,920
They will come to you.

688
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,520
They will hire you or sure,
because everyone needs exception.

689
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:47,200
And that is the industry.

690
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,360
They know her.

691
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
What is like that?

692
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,800
Try this.

693
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,600
Try this in books.

694
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,120
But you don't have to do this first.

695
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,720
Explain that
explaining your knowledge in everything.

696
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,000
Otherwise you say, Hey,
you will never find someone like me.

697
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,040
And he said, All right,
what is an Indian web driver?

698
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,720
And you said Then he said, Yes,
I will never find a person like you

699
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,520
to do it.

700
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,680
Okay?

701
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,560
Because you're completing something else
and you're delivering something else,

702
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,680
sufficient or not, but

703
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,000
correct.

704
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,520
Now, let's come to the point again
when you guys got some of the best wing,

705
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,760
but it's not a base work.

706
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,120
Some news I wasn't aware
that is going to get engaged.

707
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,320
Congratulations to the brother.

708
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,840

00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,520

I am going to book a ticket.

712
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,920
I'm going to book a ticket from

00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,640
New York to Mumbai.

714
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,960
Right. From New York to Melbourne.

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,560

Happy 705.

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,320
It's Indian Guernsey.

721
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,280
It will be

722
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,880
all over, Mother.

723
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,480
It's expensive.

724
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,720
Genocide, kind of.

725
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,280
Oh, it is.

726
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,880
You can consider

727
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,920
almost 2000,

728
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:20,520
almost 2000 books.

729
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,080
Right.

730
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,960
So now, now you see what is happening

731
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,160
when I start to Skyscanner that hey,
Skyscanner

732
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,520
go great go here.

733
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,200
And once you go to this particular place,

734
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,280
find me, find a particular one,

735
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,280
Find me a particular flight

736
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,320
from Mumbai, New York to Mumbai.

737
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,960
Great.

738
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,160
New York, Dubai, cutting.

739
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,920
So what it does, what it did,
basically it gave me multiple options.

740
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:02,160
See, Skyscanner
says, okay, we have got the

741
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,360
we have United Airlines,

742
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,760
we have British Airways,

743
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,160
we have Etihad, we have India.

744
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,960
I'm just taking this plane

745
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,880
now. No, Nicole,

746
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,760
I will send your ticket.

747
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,440
I will send it.

748
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,160
Fine.

749
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,320
So now, see, Skyscanner

750
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,600
gave you five different rate.

751
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,400
Skyscanner gave you five different
airline details for your search.

752
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,120
Now, for us, it is very easy.

753
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:53,240
They tell me one thing, Ari,
connecting directly with Qatar Airlines,

754
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,200
United Airlines, British Airways,
the dehydrated

755
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,200
out of interacting with them. No.

756
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,400
But can we see their flight schedule

757
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,280
from Mumbai to from New York to Mumbai?

758
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,840
We can see that

759
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,360
right now.

760
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,160
Just consider here in one place,
take one destination.

761
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,600
You're getting all these options right
with just one request.

762
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,800
How difficult would it be
if we had to interact with Amy

763
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,040
with every other airlines?

764
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,200
We have to go to their website.

765
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,160
We have to invest their data,
we have to get the information,

766
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,440
and then we have to compare the prices
manually.

767
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,720
We have to check.

768
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,560
Okay, despite this point of time
and having this much of money.

769
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,000
So I should go with this
or when all this thing

770
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,280
now is doing by one particular part, go

771
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,640
Skyscanner.

772
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,040
So Skyscanner is taking care
of all those things,

773
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:01,200
correct.

774
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,600
But in reality, Skyscanner

775
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,080
is not an airline,

776
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:16,160
which is Skyscanner is not an airline.

777
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,360
Then how is it possible that

778
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:22,640
Skyscanner is giving you the details
of all these elements?

779
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,800
Right.

780
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,760
So now let's understand this hierarchy,

781
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:36,280
how things work in the banking sea.

782
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,840
You are sitting on your computer,
you make a request, right?

783
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,640
You search for here

784
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,520
new your book movie.

785
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,960
That request went to Skyscanner.

786
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,960
The request went to Skyscanner.

787
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,160
Right now again, databases
very important data is very important.

788
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,400
Correct.

789
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,880
So here Qatar Airways has its own database

790
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,360
data is its own database.

791
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:07,600
If Etihad has its own database,
British Airways is exported, Right.

792
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,760
Skyscanner sends this request
to databases, to all their databases.

793
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,160
These databases are available
at different places.

794
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,600
Different places. Right.

795
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,240
This this Qatar Airways is

796
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,160
they these Etihad cities and British this.

797
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,280
All right.

798
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:32,240
We cannot share our database with you.

799
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,160
We cannot share our information with you.

800
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,120
The only thing you need,

801
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:42,040
the only thing you need,
you will be able to take that.

802
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,400
How When I search for New York,
the Mumbai isn't giving me any option

803
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:53,720
for release to London. No,

804
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,480
but do you think that is a disaster?

805
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,080
Etihad Airways do not.

806
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,920
And this British Airways

807
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,480
has only flights from New York
to one with just one flight.

808
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,680
No, they are having hundreds of flights,
thousands of flights all over the world.

809
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,600
Right.

810
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,600
But it is giving us segregated options.

811
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,760
Three third options, the options we need.

812
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,720
It means do advantages.

813
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,360
First, we are getting very sorted, things
we don't have to be bothered about.

814
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,840
Okay,
which one is from New York to Mumbai?

815
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,560
We don't have to worry about it,
but It's very simple.

816
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,000
Second thing,
these airlines are very reliable buy

817
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,840
because now they are shedding
just one piece of information,

818
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,000
just one chunk of information
or the complete information

819
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,360
from their database.

820
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,000
Right.

821
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,520
They are having the details of thousands
of flights, but at the same time,

822
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,480
they are not providing
all thousands of flights.

823
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,480
They're providing you
just one flight detail

824
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,880
that you are expecting them
to provide cutting.

825
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,320
So now Skyscanner
how they are protecting their database.

826
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,720
Cadbury de pigeons in British Airways
at this point of time,

827
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,600
they simply provide access via API.

828
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,160
They said we have made what

829
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,880
is Skyscanner.

830
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:21,480
If you need to read the information about
the flights, use this particular API.

831
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,480
In this API, just the parameters unique.

832
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,640
For example, Mumbai
to New York or for example

833
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,880
New York, London by example,
the New Delhi, whatever the flight

834
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,600
you need,
just provide those parameters in your API

835
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,760
and then we will give you the information
about that particular location

836
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,600
and how many flights we have,
what is the seed status

837
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,720
we have and every single thing
about this particular park, right?

838
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,360
So it means sharing the small chunk
of information

839
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,280
from the database can have fun,
can be done by an API.

840
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,560
That's what Skyscanner is doing.

841
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,240
So now, now your flights trade,
your flight tickets

842
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,560
may be available, right?

843
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,800
If someone else press some constraints
here, then you book it via Skyscanner.

844
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,160
It charges convenience fee.

845
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,240
If you observe it, rules
it, charge convenience fee,

846
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,160
Skyscanner every other website.

847
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,080
Right.

848
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,640
If you go here, for example,
people try to book this ticket

849
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:23,920
all year.

850
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,480
Why did you look in the last adult show
you right

851
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,520
with this price they will add some charge

852
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,400
they will add some charge, what we call it
convenience fee rate.

853
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,960
Convenience fee.

854
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,080
So how how this part is this Skyscanner
is making money via this particular one.

855
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,680
It basically provides
you all this guidance.

856
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,640
Right.

857
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,280
And when you're making that request

858
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,360
at the time of checkout,
at the time of making a payment from here,

859
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,720
right from here,
it will charge some amount, for example,

860
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,640
of $10 or $15 or $20.

861
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,680
Maybe the digital will be all right.

862
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,760
So now now just imagine

863
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,840
airlines are getting their own money.

864
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,440
Right. And what do you think?

865
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,760
How many people use this Skyscanner
or this type of websites day?

866
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,000
How many people use
them throughout the world?

867
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,040
Too many.

868
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,360
Let's consider one.

869
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,160
We have almost homeless
people on the planet,

870
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,280
almost 700 millions, right?

871
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,440
Almost 7 billion people.

872
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,880
We just consider .07 percent.

873
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,520
It is 1 million that 1 million users
are making the request.

874
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:39,800
Right.

875
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,560
And they are made making their bookings
by Skyscanner everyday.

876
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,720
No, Skyscanner is not doing anything.

877
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,960
It doesn't have any database.

878
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,600
It holds the information.

879
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,400
It fetches the information from several
places and gives you that information.

880
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:54,960
Right.

881
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,400
So 1 million requests, if they charge just

882
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,320
ten bucks for every request and we see

883
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,400
how they're making a big

884
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,120
next business,

885
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,800
that's the business API has, right.

886
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,000
And that's
why nowadays you'll see is my dream.

887
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,960
Make my dream easy.

888
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,200
Go and Skyscanner and so many other
so many other

889
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,720
players are available in the market and
they are providing a lot of facilities.

890
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,080
Expedia right.

891
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,480
And this one we call it

892
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,520
which one?

893
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,520
My area book this part hotels

894
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,720
or textbook Booking.com.

895
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:46,920
Right.

896
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,400
So so many so many websites are available
in the market.

897
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,080
They generally provide
this type of vassiliadis.

898
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:54,880
Right.

899
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,960
So they connect with the Airbnb right
Airbnb connect.

900
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,360
So these these websites basically connect
with hotels, connect

901
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:09,560
with of greens, connect
with card renters, connects with airlines.

902
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,160
Right.

903
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,280
So now at one place
you can book your hotel, so you can book

904
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,920
your cars, you can books your trains and
you get booking flights and everything.

905
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,520
So it's not only about the facilities
that they provide,

906
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,560
it's about the money
also that they are making.

907
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:28,280
Because if a customer comes to their
website, customer comes to their website,

908
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,560
their rate, this customer can booked
every single thing.

909
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,880
So now this customer doesn't
have to go to any other people

910
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,400
just when using one paid

911
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,320
customer can leverage every single thing,

912
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:49,360
every single industry.

913
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,000
Now if you're making a flight tickets
flying, right, they charge $10

914
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,480
each site, $20 for your roundtrip profit
and giving you a nominal charge.

915
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,480
It could be more because you're making
a booking for $2,000.

916
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:03,920
Definitely.

917
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,240
They charge 25, $30 minimum,
then hotel booking again, convenience

918
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,600
card rentals,
an inconvenient fee from one particular

919
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,600
customer.

920
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,600
They can make 30 to $40
just to understand.

921
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:24,840
Now it happens 365 days, 24 seven
every single.

922
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:29,640
Their job is to make sure that their data
is coming directly and people are able

923
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,600
to book their tickets, whatever
they want to book, then it will double.

924
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,480
The only thing is management.

925
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,080
They are just managing their servers,
they are just managing their websites.

926
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,360
They are providing you the facilities.

927
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,320
We go there,
we provide our data, we provide that

928
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,080
email and phone number,
name and every single thing.

929
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,440
And they use this data
for marketing as well.

930
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,920
That's why
sometimes you get messages from nowhere.

931
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,880
They are very happy with intensity

932
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,000
level with your loved ones.

933
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,720
They complete pursuit of use this quote
on their website and user.

934
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,080
I got 50%.

935
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,280
You already provided your data
to the website, right?

936
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,000
That's why

937
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,120
they are giving you this for the marketing
purpose advertisement kind of stuff.

938
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,800
So if they have reply flights
available, right, there is no

939
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:23,320
there are no people in the plane
and they're giving you 50% discount rate.

940
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,640
Even if people booking that,
it will to make money.

941
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,280
They're making money now from this. Right.

942
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,440
So there's some eBay books

943
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,160
connecting with

944
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,960
multiple databases of multiple airlines,
making the relevant

945
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,600
information, providing it to your system,
to the request.

946
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,360
You have made.

947
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,720
It gives you the response
in return of that.

948
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,120
And then you start to your book,
their tickets, their tickets, books.

949
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,640
By making a payment,

950
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,800
it connects you to Internet
banking or via card to bank server.

951
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,400
From there you get confirmation.

952
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,560
So that is also eBay.com booking
their tickets, getting them permission,

953
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,600
and it is also API call booking a hotel,
get the details of the hotel.

954
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,880
There is also API.

955
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,960
And so every various API
that connects multiple systems

956
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,320
together, industrial

957
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:23,920
so far

958
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,360
so good rate.

959
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,720
This is just
this is just almost half of the class.

960
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:39,360
Tell me any confusion about API
now you can you see how API is

961
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:47,240
are working in your lives.

962
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,840
Is it something regarding you something
you know it was already there.

963
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,880
It was already there.

964
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,800
We just we just have to
look at the look at the things within

965
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:09,360
like so no,

966
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,080
no whatever the things. Yes.

967
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,560
Getting whatever the things we learned
so far is first

968
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:19,920
line,

969
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,560
second set of

970
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,760
code API,

971
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,960
The one was client.

972
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,560
What he does is sense that request

973
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,840
blind is the one who's saying stuff
request

974
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,960
and server is the one who just wants to

975
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,440
that request.

976
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,440
Server is the one who responds
to their request API.

977
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,160
Big care of transmitting
this request in response

978
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,000
from blind server from server to play

979
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,360
in this case.

980
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:05,280
In this case this New York
we played this and you you are a client.

981
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,400
You are sending this request and you get
the response straight from Skyscanner.

982
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,760
These are the claims, right?

983
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,840
This is Skyscanner
is the API who is going to working this

984
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,560
process, transmitting the
information from here in this

985
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,400
industrial this everyone,

986
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,800
should we proceed further

987
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:43,640
now let's talk about

988
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,560
flying

989
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,760
server

990
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,880
architecture.

991
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,960
Mind you,

992
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,320
if I go to slides, you'll see

993
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,120
it's escapes.

994
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,480
This is very bad thing.

995
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,920
I never look at those clients.

996
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,640
Fine claims server architecture.

997
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,560
The first thing, the first thing
we are going to go with, You see,

998
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,240
now, without looking at this picture,
you can penetrate

999
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,720
what is sort of
what in what is going right.

1000
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,000
It gives you one example.

1001
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,600
There is a server that connects

1002
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,600
with multiple text on it

1003
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:38,480
connects with your laptop,
it connects with the Internet,

1004
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,760
it connects with the printer
and with so many things, connect

1005
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,240
in technical terms I'm talking about.

1006
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:52,080
But the example which we see,
it is more clear by looking at that.

1007
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,200
Now, if you understand,

1008
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,680
if you look at this particular one,
after understanding those examples

1009
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:01,200
now, you'll be able to tell
what is the server for the server who

1010
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,120
responds to the request.

1011
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,680
Now, who is going to make the request
blind?

1012
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,120
So which are the client?

1013
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,440
You see, four clients are available here.

1014
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,880
If you want to print
something by a server,

1015
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:17,160
you are connected to bring
that you are connected to a domain, right?

1016
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,520
You just send a command it, okay,
Bring this page and bring that.

1017
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,160
It will give you the page.

1018
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:27,160
Connect.

1019
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,640
So this is basically a physical server
rate of 11 point.

1020
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,720
Now, this is something
we need to understand

1021
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,440
client server architecture,

1022
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:44,280
blind server architecture,
one by one will go

1023
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,360
and look all the categories of blind
set of picture.

1024
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:53,040
Okay.

1025
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,840
Already case.

1026
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,920
So here, here, when we talk about claims

1027
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,720
server architecture, we have to make
sure that we understand one

1028
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,480
layers.

1029
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,680
What are the layers specifically?

1030
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,880
See, we have three layers.

1031
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,200
The first is

1032
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,040
we have presentation

1033
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,840
layer, we have application layer

1034
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,400
and we have detail.

1035
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,920
Listen to this point carefully, guys,
how many layers we have in

1036
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,840
any application

1037
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:01,640
with a kind of yes, three layers.

1038
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,720
We have not understand every single layer

1039
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:12,360
and every single layer.

1040
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,800
How many of you guys user index
each item by far

1041
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,760
majority of US rate
use this particular part.

1042
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,040
The majority of us use
this particular part rate.

1043
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,000
The one you see on your screen,

1044
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,000
the one you see on your screen,
we call it UI,

1045
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,400
right?

1046
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,400
User interface, front end

1047
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,120
so that we can communicate to the system,

1048
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,960
the one which we see here,
the one which we see here

1049
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,640
on to our screen, because in this UI

1050
01:04:54,040 --> 01:05:06,480
or we call this front end right,
this is your presentation is

1051
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,720
because rendering something,

1052
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,480
then it presents something.

1053
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,080
So we call it presentation layer

1054
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,520
Discord,

1055
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,640
it presents something
we call it because initially,

1056
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,040
but then you want

1057
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,040
when I right here user name

1058
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,640
and when I read your password,
I click on log in button.

1059
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,360
It takes me to dashboard reach, right?

1060
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,160
It makes me for

1061
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,400
who said this,

1062
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,000
who said this to a chat and application
that, hey,

1063
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,080
if someone enters admin
as a username and password,

1064
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,840
you want to chat and clicks on logging
button,

1065
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,240
you have to open only dashboard page

1066
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,280
not even page, not an employee bit.

1067
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,200
Who said this

1068
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,120
developer said the purpose

1069
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,240
of this, this
and this was develop the application.

1070
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,320
Right.

1071
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,160
So basically, basically this is the logic.

1072
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,040
This is the logic.

1073
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:25,240
Somewhere someone has written this logic,

1074
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,640
correct?

1075
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,760
Some of this
someone has written this project.

1076
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,360
So remember, this is not your data guys.

1077
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,760
Their data is coming from database.

1078
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,080
That is another thing, right?

1079
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,200
This is the logic that I'm talking about.

1080
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,320
If someone inverts username and password
and that is correct, and when someone

1081
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:50,320
clicks on logging, you should not
get that particular customer

1082
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:51,960
an error

1083
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,520
message, but instead
you should provide this dashboard screen.

1084
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:56,600
Right?

1085
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:03,320
So it comes, it comes from application
logic, where application near

1086
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,720
where business logic has been written
that business logic is

1087
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,720
all right,

1088
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,440
where business started restricting

1089
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,680
this is the application. This

1090
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:17,120
kind of

1091
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,560
so now are two things we understood.

1092
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,880
First is using
it has nothing to do with the logic.

1093
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,800
It is just a UI look and feel.

1094
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,760
What we are seeing there.

1095
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,840
User name well, which I do in blue.

1096
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:32,880
Kind of amazing
when it comes to both username people.

1097
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,280
Extremely nice password, nice.

1098
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,000
Not logging button green.

1099
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,720
No business logic.

1100
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,760
See it's built
this presentation layer application.

1101
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,880
This is if someone enters username
and password correctly and clicks on

1102
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,080
logging button,
then you should open only facebook page

1103
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:59,280
if someone enters username and password
incorrect and clicks on login button,

1104
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,400
then instead of opening dashboard page

1105
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,640
this time
you should provide an error message

1106
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,640
and error message

1107
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,240
and this should be the error message
you should provide.

1108
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:15,240
Connect.

1109
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:15,800
Connect.

1110
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,200
So now this is the logic.

1111
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,280
This is the logic.

1112
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:23,000
Fine logic is available
when in application

1113
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,600
like the third layer is their data.

1114
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,520
And thirdly is their data.

1115
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,320
Yet what does it mean to see

1116
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,080
business logic sees if someone enters

1117
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:40,160
correct username and password
and click on in,

1118
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:44,040
you should provide dashboard page
on dashboard page,

1119
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,720
you should provide all the details
of the employees in every single.

1120
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,040
This is logic system, but they mean

1121
01:08:51,520 --> 01:09:00,680
does logic have any data?

1122
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:03,200
No, no.

1123
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,120
Logic is kind of instructor logic.

1124
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,840
Just instruct the things
logic sees everything, right?

1125
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,640
Business logic.

1126
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,040
Since everything that he application do
this, do this, do this fine.

1127
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,000
Should this data,
this data and district are fine,

1128
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:21,320
but the data is not with application.

1129
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,080
Their data is not in the business.

1130
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:28,400
Logic data is in data is in data layer

1131
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:33,240
x5 why we call it database
or simple language.

1132
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,720
We colleague.

1133
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,480
So like

1134
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,200
server

1135
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,200
rate database or server

1136
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,400
or industrial

1137
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,640
and this world everyone

1138
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:57,280
now in more simple language,
in more simple language,

1139
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,320
this presentation is your frontend

1140
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,600
this data and it is your bank

1141
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,640
and this application layer is

1142
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,840
your middleware.

1143
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,880
It is rooted in frontend, backend
middleware,

1144
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,360
presentation layer application layer

1145
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,680
data. Yes.

1146
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,680
And this code against the meaning of three
layers, presentation, net application

1147
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:31,680
layer and intelligence.

1148
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,120
When we connect
with these three layers together,

1149
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:39,280
when we connect these three layers
together,

1150
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,920
we get one and

1151
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,440
then you enter something,

1152
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,120
you provide some inputs,
you get some output

1153
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,840
details coming on UI so you can see it
easily.

1154
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,520
Middleware is providing the logic that,

1155
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:57,280
hey, if someone enters this party
should provide this data databases.

1156
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,760
I have one information based on the logic.

1157
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,680
Just come to me.
I will give you all the information there.

1158
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:07,800
So things we're going to be making for
any of the application behind the scenes,

1159
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,120
these things that are going
on, these three layers, all honestly

1160
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:12,680
great.

1161
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,840
And on
the printing, on the presentation screen,

1162
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,560
we always get the output,
which is nothing but the outcome

1163
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,880
of this particular part

1164
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,800
and the structure

1165
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,880
fine, let's cross it further.

1166
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:47,440
There.

1167
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,520
So now here, let's start with claims
server architecture.

1168
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,120
In the first architecture I'm thinking is

1169
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,920
the architecture

1170
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:09,160
which when we are taking guys
and we like the architecture, not what is

1171
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:14,520
this won't be an architecture goes,
Have you ever heard about this one?

1172
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,880
Do you know

1173
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,240
Dominic's

1174
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:29,120
in a hundred kilometers

1175
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:33,320
enough.

1176
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,680
When you have presentation live

1177
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,960
your application layer

1178
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,000
and your data

1179
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,320
layer, your presentation layer,

1180
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,800
your application layer
and your data layer, all that.

1181
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,560
Three layers are available at one place
or in one machine

1182
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:14,080
in one place.

1183
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,960
We live in one place or

1184
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,600
in one machine.

1185
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,880
In a single machine.

1186
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,200
In a single machine.

1187
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,480
Getting my point what I'm explaining you
when your presentation there

1188
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,920
application layer data layer

1189
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,240
on that the layers are available
in one place.

1190
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,080
Your presentation
that is nothing but your blind

1191
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,680
rate from where you make request.

1192
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:49,080
Your This server is nothing
but your data layer, right?

1193
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,920
That gives the response
correct application.

1194
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,560
It is nothing.

1195
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,240
The logic is written on

1196
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,720
a transport circuit
according to the logical request you make.

1197
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,280
Great guess.

1198
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,520
So when when your presentation live

1199
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,520
your application in your data layer

1200
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,680
on the three
layers are available in a single machine.

1201
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,240
In one system,
we call it one beer architecture.

1202
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,320
The best example of one architecture is

1203
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:27,000
a calculator.

1204
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,920
How calculated?

1205
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,680
The best example Let me show you.

1206
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,120
And you see, I want to calculate the

1207
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,960
everyone's

1208
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,680
what I see in front of me.

1209
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,640
This is my presentation, the mark, the

1210
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,160
this is not presentation.

1211
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,920
If I type here, do

1212
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,320
less.

1213
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,360
Frank

1214
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:03,520
and I click on equals to sign.

1215
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,400
So it gives me estimate

1216
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,040
who said this to calculate other
hey calculator

1217
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:14,080
if soil type do
and then plus sign and then five

1218
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,960
and then if you put equals two

1219
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:21,760
you have to add these two things together.

1220
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,040
Logic.

1221
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,240
So very logic is available.

1222
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:30,720
Extreme logic is available.

1223
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:36,200
The logic is available in application
this cutting.

1224
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:41,840
So mind my application,
it is also available at the same place

1225
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:47,960
or not.

1226
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,600
My application
here is also available at the same place

1227
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,080
and the is correct

1228
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,360
so two plus flight is equal to seven.

1229
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,800
Now. See

1230
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,240
now see

1231
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,000
this data is available,
two plus five is equal to seven.

1232
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,000
So it holds the information.

1233
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,960
It holds the information.

1234
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,120
If I write here something, let's add three

1235
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,560
plus five

1236
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:21,360
is equals to it says end right this time,
which says eight.

1237
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,640
If I click here, you see three
plus five is equals to two

1238
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,240
plus five is equal to seven.

1239
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,800
The previous operation,

1240
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:32,280
which I did, the previous operation,
which I did, is also available here.

1241
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,440
The current operation, which I did just
now that is also available here.

1242
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,280
Now tell me to operate this calculator.

1243
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,040
Listen to this point carefully.

1244
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,320
Just to operate this calculator,

1245
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:55,000
do I need to connect
with the internet? No.

1246
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,240
Even if I don't have the Internet,
even if I don't have

1247
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,640
any of that connection is still
if I open my laptop

1248
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,200
and if I want to use my calculator,
I can simply come here.

1249
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,280
I can simply open it, perform.

1250
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,680
Some explains the operation,
and I can get the output at the same time.

1251
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,440
I can see whatever
the operations I performed in.

1252
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,520
The data is also available here,

1253
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:22,680
even though if it is for a temporary basis
but still data is available here or not.

1254
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,400
Right.

1255
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:27,000
So it means my data
near is also existing in the same system.

1256
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,360
My application.

1257
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,720
It is also existing in the same system.

1258
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,520
My presentation
there is also existing in the same system.

1259
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,400
Right?

1260
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,840
So according to the definition of claims

1261
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:42,600
that our architecture model
type would be an architecture,

1262
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,040
when of presentation layer
your application layer your data layer,

1263
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:51,520
all these three layer exist in one system,
we call it one

1264
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,840
the architecture
and the example is calculator

1265
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,840
and a story

1266
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:07,480
week.

1267
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:17,520
Everyone in the street or not, students.

1268
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,720
Is there anyone who has any question
in this part in sort of architecture,

1269
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,680
some now, now in this UI part,
why our presentation layer

1270
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:31,920
when you put three plus five is equals to
what are you doing?

1271
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,720
Make a request,

1272
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,480
you are making a request with three
plus five

1273
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:40,000
and when you got this eight,
what is this eight?

1274
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,760
This eight is the response.

1275
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,760
This eight is the response. Who does this?

1276
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,400
Who transports this data?

1277
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,480
API API transport is simply three
plus five.

1278
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:56,040
So API gives you a simple
because these things happen very fast

1279
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:01,080
in a milliseconds you get all of this
information, you getting good.

1280
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:05,520
The negatives will never understand the
response rate, how quickly things work.

1281
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,720
But yes, this is what we need.

1282
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:10,600
We need quick resolution,
we need quick solution

1283
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:16,400
and that's how we get quick solution.

1284
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:25,680
Is this clear to everyone?

1285
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,040
Nice.

1286
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,120
The moment customers are
new, what it are simply time

1287
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,920
frame.

1288
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,640
Fine.

1289
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,480
Let's take a break guys.

1290
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:46,360
Then.

1291
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,280
All right,

1292
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,760
so now, now before the break

1293
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:56,880
for clean set of architecture,
we are done with the first time.

1294
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,680
We are done with the fourth type call

1295
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,600
with the first one,

1296
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,320
call one the architecture.

1297
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,280
Right.

1298
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:12,320
And here in this one, be an architecture,
have seen one exemplar,

1299
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,960
which is calculator.

1300
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,040
So the question is, do we have

1301
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,560
other examples
Also for one, did architecture.

1302
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,360
So the answer is yes, we do have
what are those example?

1303
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:29,760
Let me give.

1304
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:34,880
So basically, basically
when we talk about the examples of client

1305
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,040
one bit
architecture, one year architecture,

1306
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,040
whatever the stand alone application
we had

1307
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,600
is doing a loan application.

1308
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,120
We also call them desktop application,

1309
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,200
such as

1310
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,120
Ms. Bank

1311
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,760
loan bed

1312
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,160
calculator

1313
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,520
and so many apps.

1314
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,280
These all are a standalone application

1315
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,960
or in simple language,
we call them desktop application, right?

1316
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:13,240
So all the desktop application
and stone estate and on application,

1317
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,440
these applications are the best
examples of one

1318
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,040
be an architecture understood

1319
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:27,600
both Perfect.

1320
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:32,040
Now let's talk about the second type
called

1321
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,720
second type called

1322
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,240
two different architecture,

1323
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,960
what we call today's

1324
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,200
to date architecture, right?

1325
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:53,440
So here in this two architectural house,
the arrangement again, we will play

1326
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:57,840
with the three Layers application
presentation indeed and earlier.

1327
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,360
So here we write

1328
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:02,920
application.

1329
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,120
First I should write presentation

1330
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:13,680
and presentation layer.

1331
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,880
Second, we have this application layer

1332
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,400
and the third we have is

1333
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,120
data.

1334
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:21,960
Correct

1335
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,800
increase.

1336
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:31,440
When your presentation layer
in simple language, we call it UI, right?

1337
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:36,080
When you presentation
layer is available is available

1338
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:40,920
on client end
and your application in detail.

1339
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:45,240
This two layer application and data layer
when this two layer

1340
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,840
is available on on server

1341
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:51,480
and so and right

1342
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:57,320
so on the line and you will have
your presentation layer on server

1343
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,680
and you have your application in detail
here.

1344
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,840
Understood.

1345
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,280
Now let me give you the example

1346
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:10,640
then maybe it will be more understanding
that we will.

1347
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,800
The best example is have you ever been

1348
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,800
to McDonald's many or Domino's?

1349
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,200
How many of you in there.

1350
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,600
Yes, Katrina. Great. With three. Yes.

1351
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:29,520
It seems you go there every now
and then and delivered with plus nine.

1352
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:31,800
Nice. Right?

1353
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,280
So you guys go there eight.

1354
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,560
Everyone was really simple

1355
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,920
When you go to there once a week

1356
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,680
I could see everyday my prime right.

1357
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,880
And then it said junk food.

1358
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,880
But still I couldn't
find any best example in there.

1359
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,840
So I'm taking this one.

1360
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:55,000
So now, now if you go there
and you stand on to the counter

1361
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,640
where a guy or a girl is available
right on that cash counter.

1362
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,160
Right.

1363
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,360
Or the billing counter, you see one
machine is available

1364
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:06,480
there.

1365
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,120
One machine is available there. Right.

1366
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,480
What is that machine

1367
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,120
self-checkout?

1368
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:16,880
No, not so.

1369
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,880
Checkout
machine. The machine in the machine

1370
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,840
there is a monitor available.

1371
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:29,440
When you see when you said that, Hey,
I need one burger

1372
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,560
or I need one piece that one,
they generally do.

1373
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:36,760
They put some details in that system,
then put some details in their system.

1374
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:40,680
Right.

1375
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:45,200
And then whenever they provide
the details, their system provides you the

1376
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,920
getting their system
provides, you the bill.

1377
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,960
So now now tell me, for example,
if a guy or

1378
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:59,280
a girl is living in New York, right,
it orders pizza.

1379
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,280
There's order visiting Domino's.

1380
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:11,120
And that guy who's living in California,
he knows orders is up in Domino's.

1381
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,280
Will there be a same price
or different results, Same pizza

1382
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:24,520
in New York and California?

1383
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:30,000
It's a different place. Why?

1384
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,880
No, not Texas
under fucking more Texas guys.

1385
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:37,680
I'm talking about Texas.

1386
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:40,240
I'm talking about the pizza base price.

1387
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,200
The base price of this pizza, for example.

1388
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,560
It is available at $10.

1389
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,480
I'm just taking one example.

1390
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,040
So it is available in dollars in here
and here.

1391
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,600
Heroes.

1392
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,320
Then you put some Texas,
you put some other factors,

1393
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,640
you put some service charges.
These are different thing.

1394
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,680
But when the base prices are the same

1395
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:06,720
rate,

1396
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,440
they always seem the base price.

1397
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,560
Now this Texas and everything
depends on the

1398
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:17,000
which the state is imposing how much Texas

1399
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:21,520
so there is generally a takes part
I'm talking about the base price.

1400
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,800
The base price is steam by

1401
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,480
because the system of Domino's.

1402
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:32,040
The system of Domino's creates
rate for the entire U.S.

1403
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,800
rate rate.

1404
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,920
It clears for entire U.S.

1405
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:42,200
So now you find all the items,

1406
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:46,200
the items available here, the same items
will be available here. Also

1407
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,160
rate whether it is a lower gig
or it is a discrete

1408
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:56,680
or best result, it is a pizza or whatever,
whatever size, great slides or anything

1409
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,240
you'll find here.
Also the same thing you find here.

1410
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:04,560
Also, they know what system does.

1411
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,240
You provide some detail straight away.

1412
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,040
You provide details.

1413
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,120
For example,
one pizza gives you the price of $10.

1414
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:12,640
Here.

1415
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,440
The price is coming from here

1416
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:21,040
from your server,
which is a database, correct?

1417
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:23,840
This place is coming from there.

1418
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,320
It does seem to

1419
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,320
it, doesn't it?

1420
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,800
It could have been done.

1421
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,160
Okay.

1422
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:33,320
Your order will be there
and they could give you this piece

1423
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:36,520
right directly without asking your name
and everything. But

1424
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:42,640
but what they generally do
is they ask you for your first

1425
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:46,440
maybe rate your email,

1426
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,640
your phone number, right.

1427
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,280
All the things they ask, and then

1428
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,400
they ask for this.

1429
01:27:55,400 --> 01:28:00,400
Do they really need all these things?

1430
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,240
Do do we really need all these things
to make a bill?

1431
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:05,280
To generate a bill?

1432
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,200
No, but still.

1433
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:07,840
But still.

1434
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:12,160
They're taking this
this is the business. How?

1435
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,840
Because they think that you didn't see it.

1436
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,840
The intel, you didn't see it on your bill.

1437
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:19,320
Right.

1438
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,680
And they gives you this fine

1439
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,440
Now, on this particular bill,
even if you don't have your name,

1440
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:31,000
there will be having invoice number,
it will be having transaction IED.

1441
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,240
If you made any online payment. Right.

1442
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,920
It will be having order details,
the price of orders

1443
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,520
and everything right
then where this information goods.

1444
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,720
There's no question

1445
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,840
you'll never find your email
ID or something great on your bill.

1446
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:52,960
So what they generally do is
they are making their database,

1447
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:58,600
they're increasing their database in here,
and they are just keep adding.

1448
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,200
They are just keep adding
your data into the database.

1449
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:06,400
So they would be having more data
because they that is a new good

1450
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:10,040
information zation
right in today's generation.

1451
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:14,880
So now people are spending
millions of dollars just to buy some data.

1452
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:16,120
Correct.

1453
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,440
So if the buy some data, they
can use this data for so many purposes.

1454
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:40,360
For so many purposes, correct.

1455
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:44,520
That's why that's why when you provide
your email in phone number.

1456
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:45,160
Right.

1457
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:49,440
Certainly on your birthday
or on your anniversary or on any day,

1458
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:52,800
any nation holiday,
you get messages from Domino's.

1459
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,440
They use it for marketing purposes.

1460
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,520
The message to take would be,
we have this offer right in house.

1461
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,520
You just come in,
there's often order online.

1462
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,960
You get this offer getting.

1463
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,000
So they use it for marketing purposes.

1464
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,680
They just do mass meeting.

1465
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:14,480
They just do bulk SMS to all the people.

1466
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:17,640
And even if it converts by 1% or 2%

1467
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,480
or 5% rate, it makes millions to them.

1468
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,080
That's why
they generally get in this information.

1469
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:28,120
And then wait, getting this information,
it costs nothing to them

1470
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,760
because you're already their customer
is already here at their doorstep.

1471
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:33,280
Customers.

1472
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:37,800
Their customer is ordering something and
they are just collecting your information.

1473
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,080
It is stored in their database
free of cost.

1474
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,880
On one hand,
they are saving millions of dollars

1475
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,080
on the hand
they are making millions of dollars.

1476
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:47,600
Right.

1477
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,240
Win win situation for Domino's
and for all the other franchisees.

1478
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,160
Right.

1479
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:55,840
So in this case, in this case,
this presentation

1480
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,760
earlier, when we talk about this
presentation, they are right.

1481
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,640
It is available there.

1482
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:05,000
So now this guy who is standing
there is a blind right

1483
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,400
who is providing your details of orders.

1484
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,360
Right now.

1485
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:11,600
The data goes to database via
some middleware.

1486
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:13,960
Business logic is written over here.

1487
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:18,440
So presently only available here
data available here, presentation

1488
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:22,200
the application layer available
here, presentation layer available here.

1489
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,960
Data layer available here right.

1490
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,760
This part one.

1491
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:29,960
This part one
can include in due arrangement.

1492
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:32,520
That's why we call it to

1493
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,640
the architecture.

1494
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:50,120
Is it clear to everyone, any question
in this book what I just explained,

1495
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:58,520
any question in this part?

1496
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,960
No question of it.

1497
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,240
One more example for to the architecture

1498
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:06,480
and then we'll proceed further to it
because they're the same.

1499
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:09,720
They are going to be here
because there are two levels.

1500
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,080
The first is presentation in one place
and the second is

1501
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,880
application and Italian it
another place is right.

1502
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:18,200
So two layers.

1503
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,280
Let's way

1504
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,920
one more example.

1505
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,800
Have you ever been to Barbican

1506
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,800
or any of the restaurant

1507
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,360
where they generally provide.

1508
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,440
Right.

1509
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,480
So when I brought to you.

1510
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,080
Right.

1511
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:38,120
And in that embed
they ask you to give them feedback.

1512
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,360
It happens a lot nowadays.

1513
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:43,400
People don't provide those, you know,
checks or bins or something like this.

1514
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:49,280
So basically they give you one simple iPod
or I think their application opens.

1515
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:53,120
You just need to select some radio
buttons, checkboxes and then you need

1516
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,640
to make a visit

1517
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,320
there.

1518
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,440
So we provide feedback.

1519
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:59,040
So in this case, then

1520
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:11,640
you might have seen it page somewhere,
some Applebee's hazard

1521
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:16,200
rate, some Applebee's having some good

1522
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,840
we use have

1523
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,080
great

1524
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,840
the airport great

1525
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,000
great the way airport also you see this

1526
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:31,760
nice of them

1527
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,280
fine so

1528
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:38,880
now when you provide this detail right
think about this application.

1529
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,960
Tell me can you access this application

1530
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:48,480
for providing feedback in your phone. No.

1531
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:49,840
Right.

1532
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:54,840
Because this presentation
there is available in one place

1533
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:58,160
in their own network.

1534
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:01,880
Whenever you embed your data
in asked to your date of birth,

1535
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,200
your marriage, anniversary date,

1536
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:07,800
something like this,
it ask you to immolated.

1537
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,280
It asked your name also
and then it gives you some evidence.

1538
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:15,120
Homelessness are based reason was
the food was the ones their discipline

1539
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,360
and every single thing rate
and then you provide

1540
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:21,120
your rating on the label in whatever it is

1541
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,840
and then you see So what happens

1542
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:28,560
the moment you enter all these
onto the presentation layer, Right.

1543
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,200
It goes to their database, right.

1544
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:34,760
So according to the logic
which is available in application there,

1545
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,240
according to the logic which is available
in this application, right.

1546
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,640
This logic is what the logic information
goes and seals in their database.

1547
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,720
And then the same logic applies
for marketing purposes, right?

1548
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:54,920
So then you good messages, you get e
you get constant.

1549
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,840
One more example of duty
architecture completion.

1550
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,520
Is that clear? No

1551
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:11,240
suitable.

1552
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:15,680
Now let's talk about another one called

1553
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:25,200
3D architecture

1554
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,600
called 3D Architecture.

1555
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,360
Great, simple.

1556
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:34,280
In one year architecture,
we had presentation layer, application

1557
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:39,080
layer, the Italian in one place
and do their architecture.

1558
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,280
Weird presentation needed one place

1559
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:45,600
application that indeed area
another place in 3D architecture.

1560
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,240
We will be having presentation
layer it one place

1561
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,240
application
layer one place data layer two.

1562
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:55,920
And why is this so

1563
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,040
and what are the examples of it?

1564
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,560
This is what we need to demonstrate.

1565
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,240
This is what we need to understand, right?

1566
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:09,160
For example, here I go

1567
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,960
and I open here

1568
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:27,760
I open Amazon right?

1569
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:32,760
They see Amazon here.

1570
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:35,480
Okay, Now see

1571
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,880
if I had ideas black shirt

1572
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:44,880
and I search for black shirt.

1573
01:36:44,880 --> 01:37:16,640
Just a moment.

1574
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:17,400
All right.

1575
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:22,800
So now, now, here
you see right when go to this application.

1576
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,360
Right.

1577
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,240
And I search for the black shirt.

1578
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,520
What is happening?

1579
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:29,160
I did it on my presentation layer.

1580
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:31,280
Correct. I'm representing layer.

1581
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:34,400
Now, if I go

1582
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,200
and this is Amazon, by the way,
I'm using great.

1583
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,520
This is Amazon, by the way.

1584
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:41,760
I'm using see,
I click on this particular one.

1585
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:45,200
I opened it.

1586
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:49,920
Now you see who is selling this?

1587
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:50,960
Is this Amazon?

1588
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,800
We're sending this?

1589
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,400
No, it's cloud added, right?

1590
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,080
Some X-Y-Z company. Right.

1591
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,120
So let me
explain. Is the company is selling

1592
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,000
now see the business.

1593
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,120
You are here on your screen.

1594
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:14,640
You searched for you search for work,
black shirt, Amazon,

1595
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,640
Amazon is having your exportable
rate, Amazon

1596
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,760
having your support,
and their business logic is redundant.

1597
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,680
Okay.

1598
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,960
If you search for black shirt here.

1599
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:24,840
Right.

1600
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:28,040
If you search here for black shirt
then what would happen?

1601
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:30,160
You search for black shirt.

1602
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:34,800
So now this Amazon is connected
with so many people.

1603
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,520
It's connected with so many,

1604
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:40,280
you know, merchants
who are selling their products via Amazon.

1605
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:43,760
So it states that exist
and it captures their data

1606
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,800
from all the people who have black

1607
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,520
shirts available and provides it here.

1608
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,680
Correct.

1609
01:38:50,680 --> 01:38:55,840
So now now this letter,
the logic is written and this data layer

1610
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:58,920
where their data is available
can not be in the same place.

1611
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,280
It cannot be the same place.

1612
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,360
And the reason is very simple.

1613
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:08,920
White cannot read the same place
because here, here this place is available

1614
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,200
somewhere else and this data is available
somewhere as correct

1615
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,320
correct guys,

1616
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:21,040
because their data is coming
from multiple sources.

1617
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,080
We have one Amazon so that in a group.

1618
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,720
Great. Right.

1619
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,040
So now you'll see.

1620
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:30,640
Now you'll see this presentation it
another place application did it

1621
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:35,800
another place data layer in another place
right data near it another place.

1622
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:40,880
When we have this type of arrangement
we call it read the architecture.

1623
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:44,400
Now this three year architecture examples

1624
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,520
are Facebook,

1625
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:51,880
Instagram, Amazon,

1626
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,560
Skyscanner

1627
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,800
is my trip.

1628
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,120
Airbnb

1629
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:03,800
and so many others and so many others are

1630
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,560
guys truly therapeutic generators to

1631
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:14,640
bring three data architecture in this.

1632
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:17,560
Would everyone let's

1633
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,520
let's go a step further

1634
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:29,400
something very interesting.

1635
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:34,400
If we expand
if we expand this 3D architecture,

1636
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:37,760
it becomes it becomes

1637
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:42,400
distributed architecture or we call it

1638
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,520
and the Iraqi just what we call it,

1639
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:47,840
the Iraqi

1640
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:51,960
nature distributed architecture
or Indian architecture.

1641
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:55,280
Now what is the meaning of this
entire architecture?

1642
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:59,720
What is the meaning of this
distributed architecture?

1643
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,920
Tell me one thing

1644
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,800
Microsoft.

1645
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,040
Microsoft is having a database, correct?

1646
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:12,640
Let's consider this presentation layer,
this business layer,

1647
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,800
application layer and this data layer.

1648
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:25,720
Now tell me how much data Microsoft has?

1649
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,880
A lot.

1650
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,120
We don't even know how much data has rate.

1651
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,280
Microsoft has in one server.

1652
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,360
In one server, can Microsoft

1653
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,040
put all their data store all their data

1654
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,440
just in one server? No.

1655
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,560
What would happen if it was all in one
sort of a server

1656
01:41:47,600 --> 01:42:37,440
is not capable to handle in a
just a moment.

1657
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:37,920
No, no, no.

1658
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,120
You not lost me.

1659
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,600
Don't worry.
You don't lose me. I'm here to Silver.

1660
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,720
It is just a bit
of history going on dates by

1661
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:09,640
going to connect us.

1662
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:11,240
Fine, fine.

1663
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:16,680
So now you see presentation
layer, application layer data net rate.

1664
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,640
Recently you might have heard the news.

1665
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:20,000
Maybe.

1666
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,400
I'm not sure
whether you guys heard about it or not.

1667
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:26,880
Recently,
Google decided to change its data center

1668
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,640
in India from Hadramout to Bangalore.

1669
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,960
Wait, everybody is a place in India.

1670
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,680
We call it cyber. Huh?

1671
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:38,280
Now the new cyber
city of India is Bangalore because of

1672
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,760
climatic conditions, right?

1673
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:44,760
They decided to change their data center
from Hadramout to Bangalore.

1674
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:46,920
Because Bangalore is more favorable.

1675
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:50,600
Bangalore has more favorable
climatic conditions for the database.

1676
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,600
Now the same problem rate

1677
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,680
was heavy
with Microsoft as well in the US,

1678
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:01,320
and they were spending billions of dollars
just to cool down their servers

1679
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:05,320
because the amount of data
was so high, right?

1680
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:09,360
The amount of data was so high
and they were not able to manage

1681
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,080
those servers because they were,

1682
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:15,840
you know, spending millions of dollars
just to cool them down so that engineers

1683
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,280
subpoenaed data.

1684
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,240
A guy from India. Right.

1685
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,200
They're ingenious.

1686
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,120
And the leader of those engineering

1687
01:44:24,120 --> 01:44:28,280
team has decided
and they came up with the strategy.

1688
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:30,480
You know, what is that strategy?

1689
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:35,480
They decided not to spend millions
and billions of dollars just to cool down

1690
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:39,560
those servers and, you know, putting them
into cold room or something like this.

1691
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:43,400
Instead, they found a location in the U.S.

1692
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,880
They found a location in the U.S.

1693
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:50,480
They're out one year, nine months,
nine months.

1694
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,560
That's the climate is freezing.

1695
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,200
The climate is very cold.

1696
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:57,480
So they found that location in U.S.

1697
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:00,680
Right now, what they do, generally,
they're they're

1698
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,440
they're in good place and they hired.

1699
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:06,440
Yeah, me I will tell you the name of it.

1700
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:07,320
The zip code for

1701
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:11,760
so now what they do generally what they do
generally is

1702
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:16,880
they hired the complete lack of what
at the end the bond over there.

1703
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,080
Let me show you this.

1704
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:33,160
If you can.

1705
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,200
You see this, everyone

1706
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,160
think so.

1707
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:42,320
What they did generally,
they hired this, you know

1708
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:46,240
river the complete bond for 100 years
from the government.

1709
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,240
They took it on lease basically.

1710
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:51,800
Now already the climate is very cheap.

1711
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,920
The climate is freezing
very cold at the place.

1712
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,800
And if you talk about water,
it is just freezing rain.

1713
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,760
This water temperature is very low.

1714
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:05,320
So it cools down
your server automatically.

1715
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:09,920
So what they do, what they did generally,
they created this type of,

1716
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:14,400
you know, this capsule straight
and they placed their servers

1717
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:18,760
inside this capsules and they put these
capsules down into the water.

1718
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:21,240
You see they're putting down
all their capsules.

1719
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,160
This here, this one, right.

1720
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:25,720
They're having their server
like this their database.

1721
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:29,040
So now my
if you're thinking I'm storing my flight

1722
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:32,960
in Microsoft Cloud, but it is voting,
it is storing here in this particular

1723
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,120
your flight is available in this river.

1724
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:40,040
Can you see like this

1725
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,000
That's how they seemed

1726
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:47,000
millions of dollars
they saved millions of dollars.

1727
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,880
You see
their data is available underwater.

1728
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,640
So now next time next time,
if their database increased,

1729
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:57,360
what they will do create one more capsule,
put it under the water.

1730
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:00,680
Simply, they don't have to spend millions
and billions of dollars.

1731
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:01,960
Right.

1732
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:05,560
So now, because they're deep,
AI's available here doesn't mean

1733
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:08,800
that the application logic
will also be available here.

1734
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,040
Application
logic can be available at another place.

1735
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:13,880
I need an example also,

1736
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:17,920
but so now first let's sort out
this particular part data layer.

1737
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:22,040
Work.

1738
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:24,720
And as you guys this everyone understood

1739
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,800
database part.

1740
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,640
Let's come to our point.

1741
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:34,640
So tell me one
system can have multiple database, right?

1742
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:37,680
Multiple servers
relies coming from multiple sources.

1743
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:40,240
Correct.

1744
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:44,880
Correct.

1745
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:49,520
Similarly similarly
if we talk about application,

1746
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:57,160
so tell me how many countries
we have on this planet,

1747
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:59,840
how many countries we have known globally.

1748
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:05,080
I'm taking your blood in the
knowledge hundred, 301 9200

1749
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:13,320
2066206.

1750
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:16,520
Earlier, it was 36 countries

1751
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:18,880
really

1752
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,720
to about Europe

1753
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:26,640
to zero four was earlier.

1754
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:30,600
I think the numbers was 204
and essentially two countries in Greece.

1755
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:31,320
Right.

1756
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:36,200
So it's two zero, I think.

1757
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:40,280
So to zero six,
according to my knowledge, 207006.

1758
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:45,360
These are the number.

1759
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:49,920
So now now see, in every country
this book is available on

1760
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:55,440
the Amazon is available in every country.

1761
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:58,440
Yes, Amazon is available everywhere.

1762
01:48:58,440 --> 01:49:00,640
But tell me one thing.

1763
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:02,960
If I open Amazon, right,

1764
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:09,120
and if I go here, right.

1765
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,760
You see these languages available?

1766
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:15,360
These languages available, right.

1767
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,920
Hindi, Tamil, Telugu

1768
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:21,480
and Malayalam trade bundle up in Marathi.

1769
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:25,960
These are some of our regional languages,
right?

1770
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:30,080
These languages are available
only for Indian users.

1771
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:34,400
But if someone tries
to access the same application

1772
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,920
the same Amazon in U.S.,
will they be able to get

1773
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:43,000
all these language options?

1774
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,240
No. Right.

1775
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:49,000
How is it possible that one application

1776
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,760
in had multi functionalities
for different languages?

1777
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,640
Remember one thing to operate

1778
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:01,240
with in any country,
every application has to follow

1779
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:04,640
the regulations
of the beginning nation Correct.

1780
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,040
And then these regulations is different
for different countries.

1781
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:09,800
Correct.

1782
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:14,280
So this time the application
logic comes into the picture

1783
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,880
where we have made
people application. Yes.

1784
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,560
When we have multiple logics available.

1785
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:21,240
Right.

1786
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:24,920
So for example, in India
you have to provide this use,

1787
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:28,960
you have to provide this China, provide
these European countries,

1788
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:34,320
some native Sweden, provide this,
you provide this, Brazil,

1789
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:39,440
provide this, Mexico, provide this right
lot of business logic.

1790
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:41,680
So it was lot of business logic.

1791
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:44,520
Now, wherever you are,
this is a presentation.

1792
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:45,360
We're blank.

1793
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:48,640
Whenever you are,
you let's log in from Brazil.

1794
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:51,520
It connects you here, take your database.

1795
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:57,000
What I'm connecting from India, connects
me here, District office and so on.

1796
01:50:57,320 --> 01:50:58,040
Right.

1797
01:50:58,040 --> 01:51:00,080
So you'll see application layer

1798
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:04,360
there check by and B what is AP

1799
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:11,400
IP? Yes, it's IP config going to IP
country.

1800
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,120
Great.

1801
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:16,080
So now now you see this presentation,

1802
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:21,200
it is connected multiple application layer
and this multiple applications

1803
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:24,120
layers are connected
with multiple data layers.

1804
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:26,520
So when we have this multiple data layers,

1805
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:29,560
multiple applications near a presentation
layers, right.

1806
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:33,120
That are distributed to multiple places

1807
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:38,440
and from those multiple places,
we are making one system,

1808
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:43,040
this type of system
we call distributed architecture

1809
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:47,120
and IT architecture or extended three tier

1810
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:59,600
architecture, any question.

1811
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,200
So for this

1812
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:09,720
so far, so good.

1813
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:10,680
Everyone

1814
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:28,000
models, let's proceed further.

1815
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,320
Now the question is fine.

1816
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:33,040
Whatever the things
we are seeing here on UI,

1817
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:36,200
it means on presentation

1818
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:39,480
that thing is coming
from Italian, correct, from server.

1819
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,760
So everything is from place to server,

1820
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:46,240
data is coming from here and showing here.

1821
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:49,360
Then why do we need this API?

1822
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:51,840
What is the need

1823
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:58,680
to test API?

1824
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:02,240
The point then what do we need?

1825
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,440
Why do we need to test APIs?

1826
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,120
Very genuine question.

1827
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:08,200
Right, Very genuine questions.

1828
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:09,160
Fine.

1829
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:22,360
Let me tell you this.

1830
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,560
See why API testing.

1831
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:28,440
So basically, basically

1832
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:32,760
when we talk about three things

1833
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:35,000
UI, we call it,

1834
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,040
we call it front end development, right

1835
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:44,960
at the same time someone works on
database, we call it back in development.

1836
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:47,400
At the same time someone is calling.

1837
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:51,800
If someone is working on middleware
also, right, That is also a development.

1838
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:53,800
Now tell me

1839
01:53:54,120 --> 01:54:01,200
which language people
generally use to develop something,

1840
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:04,320
but you develop with which language.

1841
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,360
English language.

1842
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,800
No. Yes.

1843
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:09,920
They use either HDMI,

1844
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:12,480
CSF, JavaScript

1845
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:15,680
and Angular this language to use.

1846
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,280
Right

1847
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:19,800
for banking,
which language people generally use

1848
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:28,720
for banking.

1849
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:29,280
Java,

1850
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:34,520
python, Ruby for shell JavaScript

1851
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:38,360
swimming like known as well
estimators for printing. No.

1852
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:42,920
And then you see assistance for printing
gasket extensions for banking.

1853
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,120
There is no cases on HTML.

1854
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:48,680
It's a hard core programing language
like Java C++.

1855
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:51,400
By then it will be full shell.

1856
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,440
These are the languages.

1857
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:54,120
All right.

1858
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:57,120
Similarly for middleware,
also some language.

1859
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:58,640
Great. I don't know which language.

1860
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,920
We also they use some language
for developing

1861
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,400
three layers.

1862
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:06,640
They are going to develop.

1863
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:09,840
Three beams are going to work on this.

1864
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:13,720
All these three teams are working on

1865
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:19,120
different programing languages.

1866
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:22,440
So you are let's
see if it is available in CCIS

1867
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:25,920
or in Angular backend is available in Java

1868
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:29,080
and is available in 18.

1869
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:33,480
Now see to make this application working

1870
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:35,760
to enable this

1871
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:38,480
application first, what we have to do,

1872
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:43,200
we have to connect these three layers
together to make it a single application.

1873
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:45,240
So make it a final product.

1874
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:48,120
We have to connect all these three things
together or not, and

1875
01:55:58,720 --> 01:55:59,760
we have to do it.

1876
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,520
We have to connect all these three things
together.

1877
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:05,000
Now I guess he is. No, ma'am.

1878
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,320
You should believe it.

1879
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:08,960
Without connecting,
there is nothing which is going to work.

1880
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,600
Great.

1881
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,840
So we have to connect.

1882
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:13,320
We have to establish this connection.
All right.

1883
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:14,480
If you don't connect

1884
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:17,600
your database to your machine,
if you don't connect your database

1885
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:22,320
to your application,
then what would happen in that case?

1886
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:25,560
What would happen in that case, you would
not get anything on your application,

1887
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:27,240
right?

1888
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:31,440
If you don't connect your business logic,
no connection,

1889
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:35,680
nothing is going to come
from the database.

1890
01:56:35,680 --> 01:56:36,080
Correct.

1891
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,520
And no communication.

1892
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:41,440
Fine. So no, no.

1893
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:44,840
Remember one thing,
these are the limitations of application

1894
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:48,720
that the applications which are developed

1895
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:54,680
in different programing languages
cannot communicate to each other directly.

1896
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,520
It is as simple as that.

1897
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:00,400
If you know how to speak English
and if someone knows how to speak Italian

1898
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:03,960
right, you cannot communicate
directly with that person.

1899
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,960
Mean unless you know this language. Right?

1900
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,640
Or you find some intermediate.

1901
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:11,280
He doesn't know how to speak English.

1902
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,000
You don't know how to speak Italian.

1903
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,480
There is no communication at all. Right.

1904
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:17,800
So you need someone

1905
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:21,400
who can translate your message
and you can translate his message for you.

1906
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:22,480
Right.

1907
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:27,000
You need someone similarly here
also to check

1908
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:32,880
whether these applications connected
develop in a different programing.

1909
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:36,080
Languages are working correctly or not

1910
01:57:36,240 --> 01:57:39,240
and are able to communicate
with each other or.

1911
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:44,360
Not we have to use one intermediate thing
and that intermediate

1912
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:49,680
will pass on the information
will transmit the information from layer

1913
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:55,600
to another layer to another layer,
because this part is API, right?

1914
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,480
This part is API.

1915
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:06,720
Understood, right?

1916
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:09,600
More clear example is Skyscanner.

1917
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:16,400
Maybe Skyscanner used an angular, Angular

1918
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:20,240
and some other
and then it connects with data airlines.

1919
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:23,120
So maybe data is using, let's say, Java,

1920
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:26,400
how these two applications
are connecting together,

1921
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:30,680
how these applications are communicating
with each other when they're developing

1922
01:58:30,680 --> 01:58:35,760
different programing languages, using APIs

1923
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:39,040
using it, right?

1924
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:42,600
So now why API distinct is important.

1925
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:48,440
See here, firstly, to make systems
developed in different languages

1926
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:50,280
to communicate.

1927
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:55,000
Second thing for security reasons
also, right,

1928
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,840
Because no one wants
to share their database with anyone.

1929
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:05,200
I give you the example of data
and I give you the examples of Etihad.

1930
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:07,680
I give you the example of Qatar Airways.

1931
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:10,560
They don't want to share their database
with you.

1932
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:13,680
Instead, they
but they are ready to give you

1933
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:17,680
the only piece of information
which you need based on your query.

1934
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:18,680
Correct.

1935
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:22,800
So now if you have an API, then
you have this facility, but you can share

1936
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,080
just one piece of information
and not the complete information.

1937
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:28,000
You just share one piece of information.

1938
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
And that would be more than enough.

1939
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:36,160
That would be more than enough, Correct?

1940
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:39,720
Is this correct based?

1941
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:42,160
So security also maintains this

1942
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:43,960
posting.

1943
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,640
It enables us to communicate
among the people applications

1944
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:52,840
developed in different
programing languages right now.

1945
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:54,960
See now see what is happening.

1946
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:58,240
What is happening here?

1947
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:06,760
My Do we need to use this particular part?

1948
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:10,960
For example, let's say
now going to book the ticket from New York

1949
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:15,960
to Mumbai, from New York to open it,
she would indicate,

1950
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:20,160
and she got one DNA number after booking.

1951
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:22,840
And the Vienna number is one, two, three

1952
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,400
at the same time.

1953
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:29,000
At the same time, someone booked a ticket

1954
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,000
from Kiev, Ukraine, right.

1955
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,880
To, let's say,
someone critical from Ukraine to

1956
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:40,720
the U.S., like New York.

1957
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:45,560
She also got the same
be another one, two, three.

1958
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:51,000
How is that possible that for two different bookings people got simply enough

1959
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,040
people got simple enough.

1960
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:57,240
How is it possible

1961
02:00:57,720 --> 02:01:00,280
is there any issue with their database?

1962
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:03,720
No databases,
just giving you the information okay,

1963
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:07,080
this is your data
is that initial with the presentation

1964
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:07,560
there

1965
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:12,720
no presentation
that is just showing you the things.

1966
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:14,520
Is that initial with the logic?

1967
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:17,920
No, there is no issue the logic either
because logic says

1968
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:21,520
if you book a ticket,
we will provide you be in a database.

1969
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:22,240
This all right,

1970
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:26,280
this is the business ticket
and provided there, what is the problem?

1971
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,440
There is a glitch.

1972
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:31,440
There is a glitch in a buy

1973
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:35,080
rate,
different database for different person.

1974
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:38,160
No such one database for all people.

1975
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:40,000
Glitch in the API.

1976
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,720
How glitch in the API?

1977
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:46,040
It's very simple, but
when we talk about a glitch in the API,

1978
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:49,640
always remember one thing, right?

1979
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,800
That API is not able to get

1980
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:56,280
the exact updated data
from their database.

1981
02:01:56,280 --> 02:01:58,400
It simply goes there right.

1982
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:02,040
If there is a glitch in the API,
it simply goes here.

1983
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,080
Great.

1984
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:06,720
Fix their data
but their data is not get updated.

1985
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:09,960
So the previous data only issues on
to the application.

1986
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:13,280
According to the logic,
we will show you data.

1987
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:17,400
So trade according to the database,
we will send you their data.

1988
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,880
It is also right
according to the presentation,

1989
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:22,040
it says we will show you the data.

1990
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:25,080
It will show you the data,
but your logic is correct.

1991
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:27,840
Presentation
there is correctly data player is correct.

1992
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,360
Who is the culprit?

1993
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:32,280
Culprit is your API,
which is not upgrading the data.

1994
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:37,080
So that's why two people can get saved
for different bookings.

1995
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:40,600
That's why we need to test API
to make sure

1996
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:46,400
that data transmission of data
transfer of data is going smoothly or not

1997
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:49,000
industrial.

1998
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:49,920
This part

1999
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,560
on this

2000
02:02:55,560 --> 02:03:07,680
is the booking reference.

2001
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:09,600
No, it doesn't update the data.

2002
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:17,320
It makes the data updated data.

2003
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:21,240
IPS translating one programing language
of a server to another.

2004
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:22,480
No, no, no.

2005
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:26,520
I never said
this API is not going to translate

2006
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:29,400
or convert or translate
any programing language, right?

2007
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:34,480
It provides that chunk of chunk of right.

2008
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:37,600
It provides a chunk of information
in machine

2009
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:40,400
readable
form, right in machine readable form.

2010
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:43,440
And then it converts
this chunk of information

2011
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:47,120
that is no translator translator
I just gave you.

2012
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:49,600
I just gave you the example of that.

2013
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:52,440
Yes, it is it is a at basically

2014
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:55,000
it getting information here in this book.

2015
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:57,920
Normally it has to be in the.

2016
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:01,360
Yes. When normally it has to be unique
and generally it is unique.

2017
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:07,160
But if your API is, then definitely
it gives you this kind of situation, but

2018
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:12,080
it generates do the same reference number
for two different bookings

2019
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:15,360
already.

2020
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:22,040
So for
any question, why do we need to test

2021
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:25,440
API domain
then the security to enable the system

2022
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:28,160
so that they can communicate
with each other right.

2023
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:29,840
With each other?

2024
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:37,920
It connect now.

2025
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:40,480
Now let's talk about

2026
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,160
let's talk about the last portion
of explanation we will use.

2027
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:46,640
Postman only.

2028
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:47,160
Yes, sir.

2029
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:52,920
We will use Postman only contact.

2030
02:04:52,920 --> 02:04:56,640
So now the last point of this class.

2031
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:59,320
Then I'm going to explain.

2032
02:04:59,320 --> 02:05:05,760
See here,

2033
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:15,200
let me open our application right.

2034
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:17,880
This is our application, right?

2035
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,320
Tell me

2036
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:22,320
when we perform any type

2037
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:25,040
of operation in this application,

2038
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:28,240
what are the things we do generally

2039
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,480
in any application?

2040
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:42,080
What are the things we do?

2041
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:43,080
Clicking

2042
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:45,000
search

2043
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:47,240
request.

2044
02:05:47,240 --> 02:05:49,680
Just click

2045
02:05:49,680 --> 02:05:51,400
first log in by credentials.

2046
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:55,240
Okay.

2047
02:05:55,240 --> 02:06:04,000
See, browse, request log in served.

2048
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,800
Okay, let me ask.

2049
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,120
It's talk about some
high level of information.

2050
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:12,520
Typing something,

2051
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:15,560
log in something clicking
something, browsing something.

2052
02:06:15,560 --> 02:06:20,080
These are very low level information rate,
very a ground level information.

2053
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:23,680
I'm talking about high level information,
the scope of this thing,

2054
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:28,040
the scope of this to to best any software.

2055
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:28,920
Right.

2056
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:32,200
What are the operations we need

2057
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:34,440
to think about adequately this

2058
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:39,480
either

2059
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:41,240
either

2060
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:46,960
we read the information

2061
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:51,360
from start of

2062
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,840
our database,

2063
02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:58,560
either retrieve some information
from the database.

2064
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:02,440
For example, let's see,

2065
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:06,120
I click on employee list

2066
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:08,920
and it throws me out

2067
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:18,560
every time it happens to me.

2068
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:21,280
Whenever I try to log
into this application includes me

2069
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:25,920
or we send it to database.

2070
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:26,640
Fine.

2071
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,960
So first first high level of information,
I'm telling you.

2072
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,560
So when I'm checking the
who creates wanted times, this

2073
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:44,640
right So

2074
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:47,760
now now you see right now you see here

2075
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:53,120
we include so now you see here

2076
02:07:53,120 --> 02:07:55,320
all this data is coming from this

2077
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:06,000
and media is
their data is coming from their database.

2078
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,880
But now when you are actually searching

2079
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:12,840
for an employee here,
for example, this one,

2080
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:17,280
if you are searching for an employee here
using this particular I.D..

2081
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:18,280
Right.

2082
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:21,520
What would happen in that case?

2083
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:23,160
It gives you the data.

2084
02:08:23,160 --> 02:08:25,800
It gives you the data
for this particular employee.

2085
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:26,760
Correct.

2086
02:08:27,720 --> 02:08:30,200
For this particular employee,
it gives you that data.

2087
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:33,160
So you will be able to see that database,
right?

2088
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:36,120
Correct.

2089
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:39,160
No, it could be multiple ways.

2090
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:41,040
You want to search one employee.

2091
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,040
You can search one employee.

2092
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:46,680
You want to search all the employees
you can search all the employees.

2093
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:49,680
You want to see the leave calendar.

2094
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:51,760
You can see the need in calendar.

2095
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:56,160
You want to see whatever
the things you can see everything here

2096
02:08:56,880 --> 02:08:59,040
by our database.

2097
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:02,200
So you are leaving the information

2098
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:05,360
from the database and verifying it.

2099
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:08,280
It means getting the information,
verifying the information.

2100
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:12,400
All the things cover in just one part,
this part retrieving the information,

2101
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:17,640
correct.

2102
02:09:17,640 --> 02:09:19,000
Guys, please.

2103
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:19,360
Correct.

2104
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:23,400
A lot.

2105
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:28,360
Second thing, you are

2106
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:32,400
adding some information

2107
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:37,040
in there, database or server.

2108
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:39,960
You add some information
in there, database of server.

2109
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:43,000
For example, click on an employee.

2110
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:46,200
Go here.

2111
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:49,360
Right. Gave

2112
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:52,560
one saved

2113
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,720
employee generated

2114
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:57,840
and began a scan of

2115
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:02,880
Who is this bug?

2116
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:06,960
Well right.

2117
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:12,360
So we created
we created an employee, right?

2118
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:17,200
The moment we created an employee,
what what does it mean?

2119
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:20,400
It simply means we have added some pieces

2120
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,520
of information in the database,

2121
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:26,840
then added some of information
in the database

2122
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:29,440
more than we did this right.

2123
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:35,400
Similarly, if we are applying for leave,
if we are going to assign some data

2124
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:39,840
to someone, some information to someone,
we are simply adding

2125
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:43,400
some pieces of information
in the existing database.

2126
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:47,120
So it means creating a data

2127
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:52,440
or adding a new record in the database
or start over and then verify it.

2128
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:56,720
That is the second option.

2129
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:58,600
That is the second operation.

2130
02:10:58,600 --> 02:11:02,080
The third operation,
the third operation Create.

2131
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:05,880
The third operation
we do is delete something.

2132
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:08,240
We delete the information

2133
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:13,320
from the database, from the database,

2134
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:17,520
or someone tried to delete
this information from their database.

2135
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:26,880
What sort of innovative right
is this correct.

2136
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:27,480
Right.

2137
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:31,280
Whatever the data is available there,
I just deleted three employees.

2138
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:34,920
So what I did, I deleted some information
from the database.

2139
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:38,280
I deleted
some information from the database.

2140
02:11:38,280 --> 02:11:43,880
Right.

2141
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:47,040
And then then the last operation,

2142
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:53,480
the last operation we perform is,
we just update some information.

2143
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:57,480
We just obtained some information
in database,

2144
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:01,400
in database or settlement activity place.

2145
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:05,280
So basically, on a high level,

2146
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:10,760
if we talk about the operations
we perform, so we perform one operations,

2147
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:14,880
we perform
simply creating a record in the database,

2148
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:18,280
retrieving the record from the database,

2149
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:21,240
updating the record in the database,

2150
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:23,880
deleting the record from the database.

2151
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:28,120
These operations
we call create operations,

2152
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:32,760
which we generally perform in in U.S.

2153
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:33,800
history

2154
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:38,720
in the United States, using
which tool Selenium

2155
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:46,200
VM menu connect.

2156
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:47,280
Yes, correct.

2157
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:51,000
But it is operating.

2158
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:58,320
There is is this period.

2159
02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:00,040
This is one level.

2160
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:03,120
Let's talk about another element
I have seen recently.

2161
02:13:03,120 --> 02:13:06,720
You guys have completed your sequel part
my sequence, right.

2162
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:11,440
The database part.

2163
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:21,440
What is the joint?

2164
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:30,360
What is intercalated,

2165
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:34,720
why we grew by.

2166
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:36,760
See, no one is going to take

2167
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:55,640
that.

2168
02:13:56,280 --> 02:14:01,360
I just wanted to check
whether you guys are still awake or not.

2169
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:03,600
What was the last one?

2170
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:04,560
What was the last one?

2171
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:05,680
Group by

2172
02:14:10,040 --> 02:14:11,240
group By order

2173
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:14,160
by there is are the keywords distinct?

2174
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:15,360
Right.

2175
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:18,000
These are things you generally use

2176
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,400
while making your select quality.

2177
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:22,840
I don't know the database, you guys.

2178
02:14:22,840 --> 02:14:23,440
No database.

2179
02:14:23,440 --> 02:14:33,960
I don't know.

2180
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:35,880
We're looking for collection of data.

2181
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:37,000
Okay, fine.

2182
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:37,880
Let's come here.

2183
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:41,480
Now, see, in database
you use my equal, which

2184
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:50,040
if I'm not wrong,
my second will be trained right.

2185
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:52,640
Some query like this, the leg

2186
02:14:52,640 --> 02:14:55,360
stuff from

2187
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:01,200
employee data we have.

2188
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:04,560
Employee I.D.

2189
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:06,960
is equal to this data.

2190
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,240
And then you selected there is an option.

2191
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:11,640
You run it
and you get the data for this in

2192
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:14,760
something like this.

2193
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:16,880
This is you select
what is equal query there.

2194
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:18,040
So you rate

2195
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:25,520
now see what are the things you perform
here.

2196
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:26,480
Also,

2197
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:30,720
you are retrieving the information
from the database,

2198
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:32,520
getting

2199
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:40,600
you can object to the information
also here or not.

2200
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:48,680
And me,
you can delete a record also here or not.

2201
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:49,640
Tell me

2202
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:57,600
and you can add

2203
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:00,080
or create a record from here or not
because

2204
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:03,920
for things

2205
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:07,440
to retrieve, update, delete and error
or create records,

2206
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:09,960
these four things

2207
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:24,840
trade

2208
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,840
create operations.

2209
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:31,640
Again,
you are performing grade operations again.

2210
02:16:31,640 --> 02:16:37,440
You are performing
using your database, right?

2211
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:40,760
So now if we talk about the UI

2212
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:43,160
part credit operations,

2213
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:46,600
if we talk about banking part

2214
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:49,520
that is database credit operation.

2215
02:16:49,840 --> 02:16:54,440
So there is a middleware
where we are going to test API.

2216
02:16:54,680 --> 02:17:02,280
So what we are going to API,
what we are going to test in API is

2217
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:06,320
we are going to perform same operations.

2218
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:11,280
Then my board, the aims are showing me
create operations right

2219
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:15,200
then It is very simple that I'm going
to describe the operation in API.

2220
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:17,720
Also, it has nothing to do with DreamBox
testing.

2221
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:20,600
Alex is white box, black box, gray box.

2222
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:21,840
It has nothing to do with this.

2223
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:24,840
Okay, so we hear great operations.

2224
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:26,520
Either we create the data

2225
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:30,720
or we retrieve the data or we update the
data, or we believe the data

2226
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:40,360
rate.

2227
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:41,440
Right, guys?

2228
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:43,440
Yep. Yep.

2229
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:46,320
So these are before things.

2230
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:50,120
These are the four things
we are going to perform, right?

2231
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:56,120
The entire API is doing
is all about thread operations.

2232
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:57,360
That's it.

2233
02:17:57,360 --> 02:18:01,760
That is the FBI is all about
that is nothing else in the API.

2234
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:06,520
There's the whole explain mission of API

2235
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:12,960
in real life, practical, laid back
niggly architecture wise

2236
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:16,680
how things work,
what the operations we perform.

2237
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:28,200
By any question so far in this book,

2238
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:34,680
was it clear, was it understanding

2239
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:55,000
and interesting as well?

2240
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,080
And is it right?

2241
02:18:57,080 --> 02:18:59,600
I'm telling you, I'm telling you just

2242
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:03,240
just spent some time with this.

2243
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:05,400
Now tell me, after three out of Bece

2244
02:19:06,600 --> 02:19:08,600
now, how many of you guys

2245
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:11,400
is still not aware of you?

2246
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:16,400
Yeah, well,
what grade I gave you the business idea.

2247
02:19:16,400 --> 02:19:22,800
Also, is there anyone who still understand
what is API in how API

2248
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:41,520
see Zima? No.

2249
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:44,800
Silva. Elena.

2250
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:45,720
Anna,

2251
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:47,720
where were you guys?

2252
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:51,120
Where are you now? Fine.

2253
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:57,280
And then I came to the picture.

2254
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:00,160
Yeah. Yeah. That one is missing, correct?

2255
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:03,800
Correct. And.

2256
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:09,320
All right, guys.

2257
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:24,680
In tomorrow's class, right, Right.

2258
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:28,320
You can take.

2259
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:28,680
Right.

2260
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:29,800
Nothing is

2261
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:35,720
excellent, Silva.

2262
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:36,600
You're learning.

2263
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:40,320
I see. Right.

2264
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:44,520
So tomorrow's class,
we will see how we are going

2265
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:48,200
to make all of these things,
how we are going to make that request.

2266
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,200
What is the request?

2267
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:51,120
Actually, What are the things?

2268
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:52,520
What does DNS help?

2269
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:55,800
We generally provide a lot of things,
lot of things on the right.

2270
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:59,160
And also, meanwhile,
I will share one video right

2271
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:03,320
from that video you can see
how we can download the post to it.

2272
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,160
So guys, please download the postman.

2273
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:08,280
Right? I would share the video.

2274
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:09,720
It's really easy process.

2275
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:12,400
Even if you write, just download
Postman right.

2276
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:13,000
You will get it.

2277
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,320
It is an extension
also available with Chrome

2278
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:17,040
so you get the postman from there.

2279
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:20,040
Also, I don't think that you need video,

2280
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:23,160
but yes, still I will give you the video
so that it will help you

2281
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:26,480
and stay with message in practice no more.

2282
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:29,160
But if you if give up this early

2283
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:32,600
based on just one day view

2284
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:34,880
play,
do you really think that your thought

2285
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:36,320
this cannot

2286
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:41,520
many people will see like okay

2287
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:44,080
you can't do this explain

2288
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:48,080
things are very difficult find

2289
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:51,600
because things are difficult
that's fine here

2290
02:21:52,080 --> 02:22:03,480
otherwise it would be done
by someone else.

2291
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:05,680
Right. I think I will definitely share
that with you.

2292
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:08,200
Don't worry about it.
I will definitely share the video.

2293
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:13,600
It also I'm going to update the slides
for today's class.

2294
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:14,480
Okay.

2295
02:22:14,480 --> 02:22:18,600
So you go there.

2296
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:20,320
Yeah. At the same rate.

2297
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:22,640
So you go there
and you can use them as that happens.

2298
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:23,520
Point great.

2299
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:28,000
So here right now, because we are not
using this part intelligently, right?

2300
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,960
I'm not going to push any because that is

2301
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:34,200
the only thing we have is just our slides.

2302
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:39,640
So I will put the slides
and the ones to start writing of the post.

2303
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:43,080
We read on question
everything that you will be have,

2304
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,720
you'll be having every single thing
in your postman except

2305
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:58,120
on this.

2306
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:01,160
Bob I think I'm done for my sake
for today's class.

2307
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:17,520
If you guys have any question
you may ask or else we can do.
