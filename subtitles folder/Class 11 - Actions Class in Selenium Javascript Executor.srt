1
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
I lost two classes, guys.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,320
Well, technically,
today is the last class of selenium.

3
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,520
Tomorrow, we're going to be going over

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,600
some other design.

5
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,720
Okay, so design of the framework.

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,200
I'll start with page object model,

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,640
and then you guys going to continue with

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,000
with building up the test
engine framework and Cucumber

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,320
framework.

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,840
Okay.

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,720
All right.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,680
So I hope everyone completed the homework

13
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,000
that I gave last time.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,400
Right.

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,000
And everyone understood
about the last class, all the topics.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,640
And I hope you guys are practicing right,
Especially the tables.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,800
How to manipulate the tables, rows

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,840
and columns.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,400
All right.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,280
So today, it's not going to be
a really difficult class, but

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,440
just going to go over some last topics and

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,760
if we have time, I'm going to start with
page object model, and then

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,440
we'll end there.

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,600
Okay.

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:09,480
See? All right.

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,920
So let's let's do a quick recap, guys,

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,960
of what we've done so far or last class.

28
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,280
All right.

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,160
And then we can go ahead and start
with some new topics.

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,800
Okay.

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,840
All right.

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,080
So what did we do last class, guys?

33
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
Okay, so we worked with calendars, right?

34
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,040
What else?

35
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,080
And we have covered actions class
with covered screenshots.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,440
Right?

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,040
So now we know how to

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,000
how to have screenshots, how to make

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,400
some other extra actions.

40
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,240
Right.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,120
With Selenium.

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,160
Check. Check your settings.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,640
Okay.

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:13,920
So it seems like
everybody else can hear me.

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,360
Okay, good.

46
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,600
All right, guys. So.

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,920
So now

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,600
let's start with calendars. Right.

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
So what do we know about calendars, guys?

50
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:42,120
How do we handle calendars?

51
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,800
Okay.

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,280
All right.

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,480
So calendars are similar to the table,

54
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,640
right, that we have on the Web pages.

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,560
So how to handle
with first click on the calendar.

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,720
Then we find the month and the date.

57
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,960
Okay.

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,160
Store date into a list.

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,800
Okay, So what do we do?

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:18,240
What do we do with what month, guys?

61
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,880
We get the text.

62
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,640
Okay.

63
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,240
And then what?

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,080
So we locate the month, we get the texts,
and then look through.

65
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
We find the next button.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,120
Right.

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,360
Okay, good.

68
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,400
Okay.

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,680
I have my month. I have my next button.

70
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,920
What else?

71
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,400
We need a while. Right.

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,280
Because we don't really know
how many times

73
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,640
we need to click on the next button
to find the expected months.

74
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Right.
So we're clicking on the next button.

75
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,200
So we found our month.

76
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,640
Now we stop there. Right.

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,640
So afterwards, we will go ahead and start

78
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,400
looking for the date.

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,640
Right. That we need.

80
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,240
And then we're going to go ahead and start
looking through the dates.

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,800
And we have a condition
when our matching the date

82
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,480
where we match the date
with our condition.

83
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,560
Only then we're going to click on it.

84
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,480
Right. Okay.

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,080
Nice.

86
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,600
What about the.

87
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,480
Before we move forward?

88
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,960
Any questions, guys, on the calendars?

89
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:48,720
How to handle the calendars?

90
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,560
Oh, good.

91
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320
Right. Okay.

92
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,480
All right, So let's

93
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,760
let's go ahead and talk about

94
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,840
talk about the actions class.

95
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,040
Right.

96
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,720
If declared outside of the loop.

97
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,240
Okay. Yeah.

98
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,320
Then that means your page
is getting refreshed, right?

99
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,280
When you click on next or something is get
something is happening in the website.

100
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,800
Right.

101
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,320
If your next button wasn't working,
if you declaring it outside of the loop.

102
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,240
Right. So that happened

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
last time
when we were dealing with tables.

104
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,840
When you click on next,
the whole page is getting refreshed.

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,680
Right.

106
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,840
So that's probably why it wasn't working.

107
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,080
Okay, so what do we know about actions,
class guys?

108
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,040
What can we do with actions?

109
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,560
Class when we use actions, class.

110
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,680
So actions class is used

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,720
for keyboard and mouse actions, right?

112
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,520
Okay.

113
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,840
So what kind of actions do we know?

114
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,440
Okay, so we now drag and drop right?

115
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,480
We have mouse over or double click.

116
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,120
Right. We have right click. Okay.

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,280
So these are some extra actions

118
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,480
that we can perform with actions
class, Right.

119
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,040
Okay. So we've done drag and drop.

120
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,440
I think we've done moves to an element.

121
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,200
Right.

122
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,440
So today we will be going over the right
click and the double click actions.

123
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,520
Okay.

124
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,080
All right.

125
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,400
So but before we do that,

126
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,800
let's go over the screenshots. Right?

127
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,080
So why do we need screenshots? Guys

128
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,280
to report the bugs, Right.

129
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,240
To have approved or something. Right.

130
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,960
If our test case passed or failed
so that we can show to our developers

131
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,520
if it's de fact, we just

132
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,880
would just create a defect
and attach everything in there.

133
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,560
And so main point of having the screenshot

134
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,480
is to have a proof of our test case

135
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,520
has covered some functionality.

136
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,560
Right.

137
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,480
So what's difference between actions
class and action class?

138
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,600
I think we already had that question
last class.

139
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,280
I'm not sure what action class has.

140
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,200
Okay.

141
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,800
I've never looked into that.

142
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,120
So it probably has
some different methods in there.

143
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
So just take a look
what's going on in there?

144
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,960
Okay.

145
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,120
All right.

146
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,960
Any other questions
before we move forward,

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,640
guys?

148
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:14,880
Okay.

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,200
And one more thing, guys.

150
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,040
Today, since it's the last technically
last class of this millennium

151
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,640
and tomorrow we won't be doing
anything new with Selenium.

152
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,920
So I am going to give you

153
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,960
a very big homework

154
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,160
from the

155
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,920
from the very beginning,
what we've started so far.

156
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,560
Okay. To

157
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,840
up to date.

158
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,360
Okay.

159
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,280
So it's going to be
pretty good exercises for you

160
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,400
so that you can refresh your memory

161
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,920
from what we started from
right until today.

162
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,520
Right.

163
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:05,000
You're going to have to create a lot of
a lot of new steps and do more examples.

164
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,520
It's not going to be the Oracle now.

165
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,840
I have pretty good examples in here

166
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,440
so that you guys can go ahead and do that,
but I'll give them to you

167
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,520
at the end of the class.

168
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,640
But did you guys start with Test
and G already

169
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,840
or no.

170
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,680
Okay. Nice. Okay.

171
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,360
So you covered test in G,
Did you did you guys cover

172
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,360
assertions or. No.

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,400
Okay, you guys covered the session.

174
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,240
It's nice. Okay, good.

175
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,640
Because I have
this kind of examples as well,

176
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,360
so I'll give those to you
so that you can practice on those as well.

177
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:45,960
Okay.

178
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,120
Next.

179
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,320
All right.

180
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,160
So right now let's see.

181
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,200
What I am going to do is

182
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,280
on set then.

183
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,160
All right.

184
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,680
So today what we're going to be doing
will go over the rest

185
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,280
methods that we have in actions

186
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,680
class, like right click and double clicks.

187
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,680
Then what we're going to be doing
will will be

188
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,560
uploading some files
by writing some scripts.

189
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,960
And what we're going to go over
is JavaScript execute.

190
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,080
Okay, so not too much today.

191
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,760
And then if we have time, I'll just start
with page object model, and then

192
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,920
we'll continue tomorrow.

193
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:36,880
Okay.

194
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,160
So let me create the class, Right?

195
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,040
Let me create a new

196
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,360
package

197
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,440
to class 11 point

198
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,800
and create a new class.

199
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,840
And that's

200
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,960
right.

201
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,760
And double

202
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,240
what actions?

203
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,800
Oh, that's awesome.

204
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,440
That's

205
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:16,920
all right.

206
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,800
So let's see.

207
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,200
So let me just copy this

208
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,520
just here.

209
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,280
So if

210
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,680
let me see if we have

211
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,720
something that's

212
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:55,040
more all.

213
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,080
Okay. All right.

214
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,520
So what we're going to be doing in here,
we will be navigating to this website.

215
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,760
And then when we navigate, you can see

216
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,000
that these buttons
indicate some text in here.

217
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,600
And this one is asking us to right click.

218
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,920
This one is asking us to double click.

219
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,240
Okay, I'll share the links in a moment.

220
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,960
Okay.

221
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,800
So when we right
click on this, you will see there's a

222
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
what's called there's a menu popping up.

223
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,520
So I click on edit
We need to handle this in here

224
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,080
and I'm going to double click on this
and then we'll be handling

225
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,400
this alert as well.

226
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,440
Okay, so

227
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,440
let me just send this.

228
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,040
Okay.

229
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,040
And I need to update this in here.

230
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,040
Okay.

231
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:03,400
Any questions, guys,
before we get started?

232
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,280
Now? Questions.

233
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,160
Okay.

234
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,760
Good.

235
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,800
Okay.

236
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,000
So now, guys, first of all,
what do I need to do

237
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,960
in order for me to start this text?

238
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,520
So I already navigate.

239
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,360
I already navigated to that you out.

240
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,240
What is my next step in here?

241
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,080
We need to find this element, right?

242
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,560
That we need, that
we want to interact with.

243
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,080
So I'm going to inspect this page

244
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,840
in here and I have my Dom open.

245
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,440
So let's go ahead and try to

246
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,240
identify this element.

247
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,400
So how can we identify this element, guys?

248
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,400
So I have a class in here.

249
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,120
I also have some texts in here.

250
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,320
We could do an X path
and go by text, right?

251
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,240
So they open up.

252
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,040
What's the topic right now?

253
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,440
The topic is right click and double click

254
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,680
on actions.

255
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,760
Okay, so I open this.

256
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,120
Let me actually this

257
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,880
I open this selector box. Right.

258
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
So double slash.

259
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,440
I have a span

260
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,440
tag in here.

261
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,520
Okay, so what I am going to do, since I am

262
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,560
identifying this by text,

263
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,440
I'm going to mention text in here and

264
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,480
I will need to paste

265
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,240
a text that is on our button.

266
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,640
Right. Okay.

267
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,640
This is our x path and this is one of one

268
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000
can use link text in here.

269
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,040
That's a question for you.

270
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,160
Can you?

271
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,520
Why not?

272
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,840
It's not a link, right?

273
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,040
So you can use a link text for links.

274
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,240
Because as in here we don't have any tag.

275
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,640
Right?

276
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,400
So that the tag that we have
is ten right now.

277
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,720
So if it had an eight only then

278
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,880
you can use the link text.

279
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,400
All right.

280
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,160
So what I am going to do
when a copy of this class go back here

281
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,400
and I will create a web

282
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,080
element in here and say that

283
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,880
right click

284
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,440
button is equal to

285
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,480
driver dot find element

286
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,520
by x path.

287
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,040
There we go.

288
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,600
So we have an element
that we want to interact with, right?

289
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:09,960
So what is our next step, guys?

290
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,760
We need to create an action class
object, right?

291
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,240
So in order perform some actions,

292
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,160
some extra actions

293
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,840
like move to an element of right
click, double click right.

294
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,280
What we need to do,
we need to have an object of action class

295
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,560
ready for us, right?

296
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,120
So actions action is equal to new

297
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,960
actions in here.

298
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
And what we need to do,
we need to import this class.

299
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,040
Okay, So inside

300
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,680
the constructor, what we need to specify,

301
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,800
we need to specify the execution
object, right?

302
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,200
Which is in this case, our driver. Okay.

303
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,560
So once we have this action

304
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
class object and we have an element

305
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,920
that we want to perform our action on,

306
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,440
then we can start performing our action.

307
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:09,760
Right?

308
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,000
So in this case, what we need to do,
we need to right click on that button.

309
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:13,800
Right.

310
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:19,160
So in action class, guys, right
click is called a little bit Different.

311
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,480
Okay, So when I try to access all the

312
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,800
methods from actions class,

313
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,400
what I need to select in here is context.

314
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,200
Click okay.

315
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,440
So contact's click is what it's going
to do is going to go ahead and click.

316
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,600
It's going to perform. I right
click, okay.

317
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,040
So I'm going to choose the first method
because what we need to do,

318
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,760
we need to perform an action
on the element, right?

319
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,760
So I'm going to copy this

320
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,080
and paste this in here.

321
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,240
What I need to do after I I'm doing

322
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,840
the contacts click and here guys,

323
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,240
I need to perform this action right?

324
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,040
And if I have

325
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,760
more than one action
on the same line, guys,

326
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:20,520
what do we need to do in that case?

327
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,200
We need to build all the actions
and then perform, right?

328
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,160
Okay, good.

329
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,400
All right, so let's run this.

330
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,880
Okay, So I'm going to run this

331
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,840
and let's see if we will be able to right
click

332
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,440
on that specific element

333
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,680
and we'll go there.

334
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,040
So we right click.

335
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,800
So now you can see that
this menu popped up.

336
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:12,000
So what we need to do now, we need to
click on this edit option, right?

337
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
So any questions before we move forward,

338
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,800
guys?

339
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,200
Okay. Pretty easy, right?

340
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,120
If you want to do a right click,
you just use

341
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,280
contact's click from Actions class.

342
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,600
All right, So click on this.

343
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,560
So now what I need to do,
I need to go ahead

344
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,000
and locate this element, Right?

345
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,760
How are we supposed to locate this one?

346
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,400
Guys,

347
00:20:49,400 --> 00:21:01,840
any thoughts?

348
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,800
I have this element that I want to click

349
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,640
share.

350
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,760
Okay.

351
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:09,920
Okay.

352
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,200
So simply, we have a we have a tag
and we have a text in here, right?

353
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,440
Why don't we go ahead
and do the same thing as we've done

354
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,800
for the button itself,
for the button of right click me.

355
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,520
Right.

356
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,280
So what I'm going to do in here,
double slash

357
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,360
span tag, right?

358
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,320
Again, I'm using the text option and here

359
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,320
and what I will do, I'll go ahead

360
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,920
and put the existing text in here
and you can see that

361
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,240
it's one of one
it located the element we need.

362
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,360
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to

363
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,600
copy this, go back

364
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,520
to my script and I will create another web
element in here.

365
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,640
All right?

366
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,560
Okay. So edit

367
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,080
option

368
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,520
is a driver, that font element

369
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,560
by X path and I will paste this

370
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,040
in here.

371
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,720
Okay.

372
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,240
So once we have done this,
so now what do I need to do in this case?

373
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:26,720
Guys, we can simply

374
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,640
go ahead

375
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,640
and perform a regular click, right?

376
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,320
But sometimes, guys,

377
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,040
sometimes this click will not work.

378
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,880
Okay?

379
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,880
So you will not know why it's not working.

380
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,200
And maybe

381
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,360
something is wrong with a website or just
selenium is not picking up something.

382
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,080
So in that case, guys,
if this click doesn't work,

383
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,880
there is an option to click on any element
on the web

384
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,480
page from the action class as well.

385
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,680
Okay.

386
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,320
So what you can do in here,

387
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,400
we will be using the action class object

388
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,160
and what we can perform

389
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,720
is this simple click in here,
but we need to specify what

390
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,640
what elements we need to click and then

391
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,320
perform our action.

392
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,520
Okay.

393
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,120
Is it always safer to use actions?

394
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,600
No, guys, it's not always safer
because most of the time,

395
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,680
like 90% of the time
your regular click will work.

396
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,920
Okay. But sometimes it's very rare.

397
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,520
I think in my project
I've only seen this once

398
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,800
that it didn't work and we
we use some different ways of clicking.

399
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:59,520
Okay. Yep.

400
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,120
So as I said, guys in coding

401
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,000
there is not only one option to perform
some actions or to have a solution, right?

402
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,960
So in coding there's a lot of different,
different solutions, right?

403
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,120
So this one is one of the alternatives
for the regular click.

404
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,480
Okay,
Well the regular click is going to work.

405
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,120
Okay guys,
in this case, in this example, but this is

406
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,480
an extra thing for you guys.

407
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,800
If sometimes this regular click
doesn't work,

408
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,480
you don't get lost
or you don't panic or anything.

409
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,040
You use a different way for this.

410
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,200
Okay, so let's run this and see

411
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,080
if we are able to click

412
00:24:51,080 --> 00:25:03,360
on that edit option.

413
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,840
Okay, There you go. So we clicked.

414
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,160
We can clearly see in here
that we have a alert popping up in here.

415
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,600
Okay?

416
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,200
No one would look at us
weirdly for using actions.

417
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,600
First of all,
you need to use the regular click.

418
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,080
Okay.

419
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,680
So if that doesn't work,
only then you're using the actions.

420
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,800
Click okay.

421
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,040
So if if you have a reason to say that,
hey, okay, so the regular click

422
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,440
somehow not working when I'm performing
or trying to click on some elements

423
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,640
and that's why I'm using this action,
then it's fine.

424
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,080
No one is going to say anything.

425
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,000
Okay, sure.

426
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:12,840
Let's have it in the notes.

427
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,240
Okay, So

428
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,680
if let's

429
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,880
put it this way, if regular

430
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,760
click

431
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,640
not work

432
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,560
you can use and

433
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,640
turn the way off

434
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,720
having

435
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,840
access class

436
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,960
click method F from

437
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,040
in order to perform tense.

438
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,080
Well it's sometimes

439
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,880
okay, let's go ahead and take a look
what that method actually does.

440
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,240
Okay. So let's see if we have this.

441
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,040
Let's see here.

442
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,560
This form, it's building
and performing at the same time.

443
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,880
It's going to work without this, I think.

444
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,720
But sometimes it won't catch the action.

445
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,560
Okay.

446
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,000
So as I said before, guys,
if you have multiple

447
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,120
what's called multiple methods, right?

448
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,160
If you have a method chaining in here
and you just do it

449
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,440
without build, it will work. That is fine.

450
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,200
But you do build
so that it's a precaution for you, right?

451
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,160
In the future it might not work
so that you don't have to go ahead

452
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,000
and change that again.

453
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,440
Okay. So you take a little bit precaution.

454
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Even if it's working, it's fine,
but you take it precaution

455
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,240
so that in the future,

456
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,600
if it doesn't work, you don't have to go
back and change the code.

457
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:11,600
Okay.

458
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Any questions, guys?

459
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,360
All right.

460
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,760
So now I clicked on edit what I need to do

461
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,720
now, guys, I clicked on.

462
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,000
Edit I have this thingy over here.

463
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,160
We need to handle the alert. Right. Okay.

464
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:52,320
So what kind of alert
are we having right now in here?

465
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,680
Okay.

466
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,760
What kind of pop up?

467
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,680
It's a simple alert.

468
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,360
Okay, So is it a Windows based? Is it a

469
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,360
web page?

470
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,960
Is it a JavaScript alert?

471
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,720
What kind?

472
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,480
Okay, so there's a window,
there's JavaScript, there is web based.

473
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,400
Okay,
So I have different different answers.

474
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,880
Guys.

475
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,240
Okay.

476
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,480
Why do you guys think it's a web
based alert?

477
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,760
So people who said it's a web based alert,
why do you guys think it's a Web

478
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:49,320
based alert?

479
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,920
It's from the Web.

480
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:56,320
Okay.

481
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,680
We cannot inspected. Right.

482
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,840
So if you have a Web based alert,
what you can do

483
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,800
is you can go ahead and inspect that.

484
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,240
Okay.

485
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,920
So if you have a Windows based alert,
so that means you're

486
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,440
having a completely new window
popping up for you.

487
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,360
Right.

488
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,400
So since it's neither of those,
that means this is a JavaScript alert

489
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,840
and this is a simple alert, right?

490
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,320
What we can do, we can only click on.

491
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,160
Okay, right.

492
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,800
So how do I handle this
alert in my script?

493
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:41,680
Guys?

494
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,200
Okay, switch. Right.

495
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,040
So we need to switch to that alert.

496
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,520
Okay.

497
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,160
So okay, so driver

498
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,360
that switch to an alert.

499
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,280
Okay.

500
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,680
Do I need to somewhere?

501
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,160
I switch to an alert. What?

502
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,640
What is next, guys

503
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,920
assigned to a variable of an alert type.

504
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,360
Okay, that's very good.

505
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,400
So if you have a question in your
interview, guys, we went through this.

506
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,800
If you have a question,
how do you handle alert with selenium?

507
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,440
What would be the answer

508
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,560
using an alert interface, right?

509
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Absolutely. Right. There we go.

510
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,240
So what we can
do, alert, alert is equal to this.

511
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,240
So import the alert

512
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,360
interface in here

513
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,120
and then we have alert dot, except.

514
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,800
Right.

515
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,200
Okay.

516
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,040
So we're going to accept that
alert in here.

517
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,240
All right.

518
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:19,560
So let's execute this.

519
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,640
That should be enough.

520
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,240
If you say you use alert interface
and you can ask them if you want to go

521
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,280
in details on how often, how many ways

522
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,280
or what can you do or how can you handle

523
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,360
you can just do.

524
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,880
Okay. Seems like it handled that alert.

525
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,080
Okay.

526
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,480
So you can just do here.

527
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,280
You could just do not accept that is fine.

528
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,240
But if you have in in your future,

529
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,480
if you have more alerts
you need to handle,

530
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:04,680
what do you want to do?

531
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,000
So let's say in our execution right now,
I need to.

532
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Okay. So let's get back.

533
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,840
So I clicked on right click right.

534
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,160
This alert popped up.

535
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,720
I clicked.

536
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,400
Okay, so now I'm clicking on this one.

537
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,360
See, I have another alert.

538
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,040
So that means
I need to go ahead and switch to it again.

539
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,000
Right.

540
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,960
But let's go back.

541
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,200
If I assign this to a variable, if

542
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,320
I don't have to do this again,

543
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,600
that's why we're assigning this switch
to alert to a variable,

544
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,040
because we don't want to switch
to alert again and again in the future.

545
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,120
Okay.

546
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
All right. So let's go back in here.

547
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,400
So now what I need to do,
I handled that alert, right?

548
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,240
So now what I want to do,
I want to double click on this.

549
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,240
Okay?

550
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,560
And get this text print out in my console
and then handle this alert.

551
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,160
Okay.

552
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,280
So if I double click on this,
what kind of alert am I having in here

553
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:28,800
this time?

554
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,920
Again, a simple alert, right?

555
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,160
Okay, good.

556
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,360
All right.

557
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,240
So now let's
go ahead and identify this element.

558
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,560
Okay.

559
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
How do we want to identify this element?

560
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:49,160
Guys?

561
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,520
Okay, That's a good question, Blake.

562
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,240
Guys,
do we have to switch back when we are

563
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,360
when we handle an alert?

564
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,600
Where did we use to do this?

565
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,120
In frames, right?

566
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,280
So if you have a frame,
you switch to the frame manually

567
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,520
and you switch back manually, but

568
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,720
with alerts, you switch to an alert,

569
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,080
but it gets the focus back
automatically, Right?

570
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,200
Okay.

571
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,280
So since we have a pretty long
text in here, why don't we use a contains

572
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,320
method
right when we are having a x path in here?

573
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,200
Okay.

574
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,200
So I'm going to go ahead and do button

575
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,560
and do contains

576
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,560
right text

577
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,680
is equal to

578
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,080
double click.

579
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,480
Okay.

580
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:12,200
Why is this not working guys? See?

581
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,840
All right.

582
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,040
We should use a comma
instead of an equal sign.

583
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,400
Right?

584
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,920
So if you use this,
then we can see that it is one of one.

585
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,800
It's unique and I can copy this path.

586
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,000
Right.

587
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,560
So go back in here
and create another web element,

588
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,160
which is

589
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,400
double click

590
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,320
button is equal to driver add find element

591
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,240
X path, paste this and here.

592
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:49,840
Right.

593
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,040
So now guys, this is

594
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,880
I have my web element, right?

595
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,120
So I need to perform
a double click in here.

596
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,000
So since I already have an object

597
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,800
of the actions class in here,
I don't have to create a new one, right?

598
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,400
So I'm going to be using the object
that I created on line 19

599
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,680
and I'll go Action dot simple,
double click.

600
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,440
Okay, So a double click in here.

601
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,280
And what I need to do, I need to mention

602
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,520
what element I am double clicked

603
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,440
right?

604
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,560
And then what I want to do,
I need to perform right.

605
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,920
Okay.

606
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,040
So once I perform this,
what is my next step?

607
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:49,920
Guys?

608
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,160
Accept that alert.

609
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:58,480
Okay, so we need to switch it to switch
and get texts.

610
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,160
Right.

611
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,240
So do I. Do I need to switch again?

612
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,920
Guys in here.

613
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,160
I need to driver that switch

614
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,720
now. Right.

615
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,000
We don't really need to do this
because we already have an object

616
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,840
of an alert in here
which helps us to switch to an alert.

617
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,600
Right.

618
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:23,960
So what I will do, I'll directly
print out the alert dot, get text in here,

619
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,000
and after this what I need to do,

620
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,880
I will simply accept that left.

621
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,280
Okay, Now let's execute this

622
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,280
code and see

623
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:51,960
if everything runs smooth.

624
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,600
There we go.

625
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,000
So seems like
we double clicked on that as well.

626
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,320
And you can see that
we got the text from the alert

627
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,200
and we accept that that alert as well.

628
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,200
Right.

629
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:03,840
Okay.

630
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,440
Any questions, guys, on how to perform it?

631
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,080
Right
click and double clicks by using actions

632
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:25,960
class.

633
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,600
Very straightforward.

634
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,640
Everything good, right?

635
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,800
Double click.

636
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,600
The only thing that might be getting
a little bit

637
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,800
confused with actions class
is this context.

638
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,040
Click okay
because everything else is simple.

639
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,160
English drag and drop
move to element right?

640
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,920
Double click.

641
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,760
The only thing that is not

642
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,400
simple English in here is the contacts
click, which performs the right click.

643
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,960
Okay,
so you just need to remember this one.

644
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,920
Okay,

645
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,080
If there's no questions,

646
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,560
then let's move to a different topic

647
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:20,840
in here.

648
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:32,560
Check one thing.

649
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,480
All right,
guess so. Now what we going to be doing?

650
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,400
We will be uploading some files

651
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
and I'm pretty sure you guys already know
how to do this manually.

652
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,640
Right?

653
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,720
Whenever you are uploading some pictures,
whenever you uploading some documents

654
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,960
and some website.

655
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,240
Right.

656
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,200
You go ahead
and let me actually pull that up in here

657
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,640
file upload.

658
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,040
Right.

659
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,560
So if you want to do this, you click
sorry,

660
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,840
you choose your file first, right?

661
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,600
So you click on this.

662
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,680
There is you need to choose a file
from your computer.

663
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,240
When you do that, you click
okay, It's going to pop up in here

664
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,960
and what you do,
you upload that file in here, right?

665
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,720
And you've done this in social media.

666
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,000
You've probably done this
for some documents, whatever you're

667
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,200
uploading for something, business licenses
or just to get any documentation.

668
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,280
Right.

669
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,760
So this is what we will be doing,
but we will be doing it through this.

670
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,040
Correct. Okay.

671
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,400
So it's going to be really easy
to upload any files

672
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,040
through this script

673
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,480
and I'll show you how to do this.

674
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,320
All right.

675
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,440
So let's go back

676
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,600
in our intelligent
and I'm going to create a new Java class.

677
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,520
Okay?

678
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,080
So what I'll do is do file

679
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,400
upload.

680
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:17,440
Okay,

681
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,880
of the list and

682
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,440
I have this in here

683
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,920
and I go, guys.

684
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,960
Okay.

685
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,600
All right.

686
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,320
So manually, guys, by uploading

687
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,000
when you want to upload anything,
what you want to do

688
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,320
is go ahead in here

689
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,120
and stuff this.

690
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,920
Okay.

691
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,760
So basically manually
whenever you are trying to

692
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
to upload any file, Right.

693
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,520
So you have to go click on this.

694
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,760
Then you have to go find your file in here

695
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,160
and let's say anything in here, right?

696
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,640
Okay.

697
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,560
There we go.

698
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:36,240
So we have this in here.

699
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,840
Okay. Am I going too fast, guys?

700
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,240
Is there a lot of people who are behind

701
00:43:41,240 --> 00:44:00,120
right now?

702
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,280
Sometimes. Okay, guys.

703
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,560
So let me continue
and then I'll give you time to type.

704
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,040
Okay.

705
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,360
How did we get to the page that I'm on?

706
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,360
I sent you the link, guys.

707
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,280
I'll show you how how we got in here.

708
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:31,360
Okay, So.

709
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,880
Okay, I'll show you where to click.

710
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,480
Okay, guys.

711
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,880
So let's captured the logic right now.

712
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:36,760
Seems like

713
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,880
everyone is trying to get to the page
that I am on and trying to type in.

714
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,480
Right?

715
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,560
So I think it's better to catch up
with the logic first.

716
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,040
Okay, guys,
I'll show you how to get to any page.

717
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,240
It's easy, right?

718
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,200
But first of all, what we need to do,
we need to catch the logic

719
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,400
behind everything.

720
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,080
Okay.

721
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:58,760
All right.

722
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,560
So manually, guys, whenever you do this,

723
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,160
you have basically
you need to choose the file in here.

724
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,200
And what you need to do is
you need to click on upload.

725
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,280
Right?

726
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,560
Seems like it's not working,
but it's okay.

727
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,720
So let me choose a different from here.

728
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,840
Let's choose this one.

729
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,920
It should rest upload.

730
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,640
There we go. All right.

731
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,440
So when you upload,
you should be getting anything

732
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,000
like verification or success message,
right when you are doing it manually.

733
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,960
So in this case, we the file was uploaded,
we chose the file from our computer.

734
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:46,920
We on the upload and we have this name
and the success message in here.

735
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,240
Okay All right.

736
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,880
So now let's do it in the script.

737
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,840
Okay, so it's pretty easy.

738
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,160
So first of all, guys,
what I want you to pay attention in here,

739
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,600
so let's get that so simply, guys,
whenever

740
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,840
which type of file we can

741
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,880
try to upload guys like the

742
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,480
I think text file or Excel or word file,
it's in here.

743
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,920
So that's going to be better

744
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,000
because I don't think

745
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,360
this website accepts all type of files.

746
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,120
Okay.

747
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,800
You could try you could try pictures

748
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:39,120
as well.

749
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,400
Okay. Yeah, that's fine.

750
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,000
That's okay.

751
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,400
All right.

752
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,520
So before guys, before doing anything.

753
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,280
Okay.

754
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,600
Before writing your script, guys, what?

755
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,760
I want you to make sure guys,
So whenever we have a button, right?

756
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,520
Whenever we have a button
and you inspect that button, what do you.

757
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,000
What kind of tag do you see for that
button?

758
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:14,640
Guys?

759
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,080
No, no, not the tag name.

760
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,720
The tag name, not the attributes. Right.

761
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,320
So exactly.

762
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,440
So usually
when you're inspecting a button,

763
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,520
the tag name should be button, right?

764
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,960
Pretty straightforward.

765
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,280
But whenever you are uploading a file guys
through the script,

766
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,120
what you need to make sure, guys,
that this file, when you choose

767
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,560
this button, when you choose the file

768
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,480
guys, has the tag of input.

769
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,800
Okay, so here it's a little bit different.

770
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,280
So what you can do in here,
you can input something.

771
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,800
Okay.

772
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,880
And in this case,
what we will be doing in here,

773
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,680
we will be inputting that path

774
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,440
and the location of the file
that we want to upload.

775
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,240
Okay.

776
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,560
Is that clear, guys?

777
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,080
So basically, here's what we did.

778
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:21,600
So when I choose file,
I am choosing from my desktop, right?

779
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,640
And here if I click on this.

780
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,520
So basically what I'm doing,
I am giving this place,

781
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,160
I'm giving this place a path

782
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,800
or the location of my file, right?

783
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,720
So we will be doing the same thing.

784
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,520
So but first of all,
what we need to do, we need to

785
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,880
let me see in here, we need

786
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,040
to locate this choose file element.

787
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,720
Okay. So

788
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,560
before, before we get into the page.

789
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,680
Right. So we we are on this page, right?

790
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,080
So what we need to do,
we need to click on this file.

791
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,080
Upload. Okay, guys.

792
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,880
So let me inspect this in here.

793
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,080
All right.

794
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,280
So we have this.

795
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:22,400
What can we use in here, guys? I d

796
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,080
we can use a link text right there.

797
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,880
We go.

798
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,760
So let me copy this.

799
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,520
Get back in here and create a web element

800
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,320
and say that file

801
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,480
upload link is equal to driver

802
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,360
find element by

803
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,880
link, text
and paste this link text links here.

804
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,000
So what we simply need to do is

805
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,280
to click on that link.

806
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,680
All right, so let's get back in here.

807
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,440
So when I click on the file upload link

808
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,040
in here, then I'm going to

809
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:12,240
what's called land on this page
where I can actually upload the file.

810
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,600
Right?

811
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,160
So now before we upload the file,

812
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,040
we need to locate this element.

813
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,520
Okay.

814
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:26,600
And in here what we have, we have an ID
in here which I can use, right?

815
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,160
So I'm going to copy this ID

816
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,640
and I will create

817
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,760
another web element and name
it as choose file

818
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,120
is equal to the

819
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,040
driver.

820
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,760
Find element by I.D

821
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,840
and paste this into.

822
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,600
Okay.

823
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,520
Is that clear? So far guys?

824
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:03,760
What I'm doing in here.

825
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,920
Okay, cool.

826
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,760
All right.

827
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,960
So simply guys, now since

828
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,720
it's an input element, right?

829
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,320
That means we can send something.

830
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,880
We can send some text in there. Right.

831
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,480
And as I mentioned before,
what we need to specify

832
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,920
is our location of the file, right?

833
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,600
Or in other words,
we need to specify the path of the file.

834
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,440
Right. So

835
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,320
so what I have in my

836
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,200
desktop right now, so let me see

837
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,040
here.

838
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,480
Meet it is over here. Yes.

839
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,800
So there we go.

840
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,280
So I have this sample test data

841
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,160
in here on my desktop, Right.

842
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,440
So what I need, I need a

843
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,760
I need a whole pass for this

844
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,920
file. Right.

845
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:08,840
So in in Mac, what I need to do,
I'm going to do get info

846
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,760
and I think in Windows what you need to do
is you need to go ahead and get

847
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,960
you go to properties, right?

848
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:24,400
So get info in here.

849
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,000
I have it here. Right.

850
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,120
So in Mac guys, what you need to do,
you need to start with users, okay?

851
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,720
You don't need this Mac SSD or whatever.

852
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,000
Okay.

853
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
What you need to do,
you need to start with users.

854
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,600
Okay, so I'm going to copy that.

855
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,640
The one in here
and I will go to intelligent.

856
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,600
Okay, so open this back.

857
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,760
And what I am going
to do is going to copy this

858
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:59,960
file and simply

859
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,560
send keys in here

860
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:10,440
and not this one.

861
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,720
Okay, Choose file, send keys in here

862
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,360
and let me see.

863
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,600
And I'm going to get this

864
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,200
and paste this thing here.

865
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,880
Okay? Is that clear, guys?

866
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:39,240
Any questions?

867
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,840
Yeah, Yeah, I'll edit
guys. I'll edit guys.

868
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,520
So I'm just trying to I'm just trying
to see if everyone is on the same page.

869
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:55,320
Okay.

870
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:55,960
Okay.

871
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,400
Seems like all good.

872
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:02,880
All right.

873
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,200
So now I only have here up
to my desktop, right?

874
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,960
So what I need to do,
I need to mention the actual file.

875
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,000
Right?

876
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,960
So my file name is simple tasks data.

877
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,320
Right.

878
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,120
And do not forget guys
to mention the extension as well.

879
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,400
Okay.

880
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,640
So it's going to be x

881
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,880
as x seems since it is an Excel file.

882
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:33,760
Right?

883
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,080
So after you locate the desktop

884
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,560
and then what you need
to do is you need to actually

885
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,120
mention the file

886
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,960
name as well.

887
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,760
Okay.

888
00:54:48,320 --> 00:55:01,560
Any questions on this, guys? Yes.

889
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,080
You have to write the full name
of the file and its extension.

890
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:12,360
Okay.

891
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,640
I think you have to put.

892
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,080
Yes, I think you have to.

893
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:25,160
Guys, if it's PNG file.

894
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:32,520
Yes. Dot PNG.

895
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,720
All right, so let me execute this.

896
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:48,680
Okay, Let's execute this.

897
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,920
Okay. Running here.

898
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,600
Click on that. Okay.

899
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,120
So you can see that in here, guys.

900
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,200
You can see that
we uploaded the sample test

901
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,200
data in here.

902
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:02,640
Okay.

903
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,200
So that means the path that I gave
was correct.

904
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:17,040
Okay.

905
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:17,360
Okay.

906
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,480
So when you run guys, as long as you see
your file name on the web page,

907
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,680
that means it is fine.

908
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,640
That means you were able
to provide the right path

909
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:42,560
for your file. Yes.

910
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,040
Without the extension, it will not work.

911
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,440
So you have to make sure
you put the extension as well.

912
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,400
Okay.

913
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,840
So we send the whole path of the
of our file.

914
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,680
So now the only thing that's left for us

915
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,640
is to go ahead, actually click on upload.

916
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,080
Right.

917
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,320
So it has an ID in here,

918
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,560
so I'm going to copy this ID

919
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,720
and I will go back and here create

920
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,720
another web element right.

921
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,120
Upload button is equal to driver

922
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,040
find element by

923
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,480
ID, paste that ID here

924
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:44,040
and I'll just simply click on upload.

925
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,160
Okay.

926
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,240
Tried different.

927
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,360
Okay. Yeah, that's fine.

928
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,880
That's okay. All right.

929
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,520
So let's run
this and see if we can get the

930
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:08,160
the success message
and the name of our file.

931
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,240
There we go.

932
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,520
So we clicked on upload as well.

933
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,840
So now we get the success message,
which is file upload it

934
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:20,120
and the the file name in here as well.

935
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,560
Right. Pretty straightforward and easy.

936
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:31,440
Right guys.

937
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,200
So sometimes guys, sometimes

938
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,080
what we need to do is

939
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,440
sometimes this send keys
will not work for us.

940
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,480
Okay? So sometimes it's not going to work.

941
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,800
That's why whenever it doesn't work, guys,
you will need to use

942
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,440
some different libraries.

943
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,680
So in this case, what you can use is
you can use a rollback class.

944
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,680
Okay, So it has it has different

945
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,360
different methods
and you can perform different, different

946
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,280
key actions as well.

947
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,840
So you can copy that file
and you can paste that file in your

948
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,200
in your web page. Okay.

949
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,960
So just you could just take a look
at that rollback class.

950
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,880
Just briefly, guys.

951
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,600
And but most of the time this send keys

952
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:26,880
will work perfectly fine.

953
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,120
Let me go in here

954
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,280
and let me say

955
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:42,000
upload files, not interact.

956
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,480
That's why we use correct? Yes.

957
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,920
So that's why we sending direct path

958
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,360
because we won't be able to interact
with a Windows based popups.

959
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:51,880
Right.

960
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,800
But if you want to interact with Windows
based pop ups, what you can

961
00:59:55,800 --> 01:00:00,080
do, you can use a robot class,
as I just mentioned.

962
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:06,040
Okay, upload

963
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,720
documents in here.

964
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,960
So in order to upload

965
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,160
documents using

966
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:23,440
selenium, we can simply

967
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,640
do is right

968
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,920
and we can

969
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,480
pass a file path.

970
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,000
Right.

971
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:42,840
And if send keys

972
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,480
not work, use

973
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,520
robot.

974
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,920
Okay, so robot
class is basically coming from Java.

975
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,560
Okay. From Java Library.

976
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,800
So there's a lot of different combinations
that you can do with keyboard.

977
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,880
Okay.

978
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,880
So you can briefly take a look at that,

979
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,480
what kind of methods it has
and what else you can perform.

980
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:12,480
Okay, But it's a pretty good library.

981
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,520
I found some actions with that as well,

982
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,360
and it's pretty good.

983
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,480
Okay. All right.

984
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,520
I guess any questions on actions class
and how to upload the documents?

985
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:45,480
Yes. Okay.

986
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,440
It's 807.

987
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,120
Okay, guys.

988
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:54,360
So let's take a quick break
and let people type up the code in here.

989
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:00,400
So probably let's come back at 825.

990
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:01,800
Okay?

991
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,240
Come back at 825.

992
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:10,440
A ten minute break,
and then we'll continue with JavaScript.

993
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:10,960
Execute.

994
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,280
Okay.

995
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,040
All right.

996
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,760
Okay, guys, I'll see you at 825

997
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,800
next to the code for

998
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,400
why it's not it's

999
01:02:39,440 --> 01:20:02,240
it's just.

1000
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,400
All right, guys, let's get back

1001
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,360
and let's continue

1002
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:16,800
the class.

1003
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:47,760
So I get to go.

1004
01:20:48,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Nice.

1005
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:01,800
Okay, guys.

1006
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:06,680
So now let's talk about the JavaScript
execute,

1007
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:08,520
right?

1008
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:11,280
Okay, so JavaScript execution,

1009
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,240
guys, did anyone do a research?

1010
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:18,000
First of all, guys, didn't
anyone to do a research

1011
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,920
about the JavaScript executes

1012
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,120
see things like not,

1013
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:44,720
okay, okay,

1014
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,240
that's fine.

1015
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:48,760
All right.

1016
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:52,200
So JavaScript executes, right?

1017
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:57,360
So JavaScript execution is a library

1018
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,880
that is present in Selene, Okay.

1019
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,640
And it can be executed

1020
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,600
in different programing languages

1021
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:09,760
like Java, Python
and different differently.

1022
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:14,640
So the JavaScript executable
is an interface, Okay?

1023
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,360
And he has some methods

1024
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,520
that you can perform on the web page.

1025
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:21,240
Okay.

1026
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:27,080
So these methods are a little bit
different than usual actions.

1027
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:32,960
Okay,
So like there is one exact same method

1028
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,920
for click which you can perform
with JavaScript, execute as well.

1029
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:38,840
Okay.

1030
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:43,000
So other methods you can,
you can highlight an element,

1031
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:49,200
you can refresh the page,
you can scroll up and down and on the page

1032
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,200
you can also open a new tab

1033
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:56,520
and you can also scroll
to a specific element.

1034
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,680
Okay So these kind of actions are given

1035
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:05,400
inside our JavaScript
to execute our library.

1036
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,480
Okay.

1037
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:11,280
And we will be performing those actions
right now.

1038
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,360
Okay.

1039
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,680
So we should only be using JavaScript,

1040
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:22,720
execute order
when we are not able to perform actions

1041
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,880
such as click

1042
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,480
on the elements or opening a new tab.

1043
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,280
Okay guys, so

1044
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,000
let's go over the notes first

1045
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,640
and here.

1046
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,760
Okay, So JavaScript

1047
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,120
executes.

1048
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,720
Okay, so it is a library,

1049
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,640
is a library and selenium

1050
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:57,960
which can be executed

1051
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,120
different

1052
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,760
languages.

1053
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,560
Okay, So we can put those in here, Java,

1054
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:18,400
C-sharp, Python and etc..

1055
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,520
Okay.

1056
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,280
And we can say that
JavaScript execute here

1057
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:29,600
is an interface, right?

1058
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,000
And methods or actions

1059
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,720
which can be performed

1060
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:47,840
by using execute.

1061
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,880
So those are the actions in here.

1062
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,760
Click on the element,

1063
01:24:55,120 --> 01:25:00,160
right scroll to the page

1064
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,440
and refresh the page

1065
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,760
and highlight

1066
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:14,160
the the element.

1067
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,400
We can also do scroll to a

1068
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,600
specific

1069
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,320
element and we can also open and use TAP.

1070
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:31,440
Okay, So any questions guys,

1071
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,040
before we move to an actual implementation

1072
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:01,320
robot class,

1073
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,800
it has different methods to

1074
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,320
to interact with Windows

1075
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:12,520
based platforms.

1076
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,360
It comes from Java Library.

1077
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,280
Okay. All right.

1078
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:22,440
So JavaScript
executable here has two different methods.

1079
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,520
Okay.

1080
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:28,360
It has executed script and execute
async script.

1081
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,440
Okay.

1082
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,560
So it's going to help us to keep the

1083
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:36,360
the extras
and now more interactive, right?

1084
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:40,680
As we said in here, scrolling to the page,
highlighting an element,

1085
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,040
scrolling to a specific element.

1086
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,800
Right. Or opening and you tap

1087
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,200
right again guys.

1088
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,600
So we can click

1089
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,080
on the element the now we can click
by regular selenium and click.

1090
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,880
We're going to have an action
class click right.

1091
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,600
And now there's another alternative
that we can use is

1092
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,880
JavaScript execute or collect.

1093
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,320
Okay, So sometimes, as I said,
it's not going to work.

1094
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:10,880
So you have to use some different,

1095
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,200
different ways
in order to achieve what you need to do.

1096
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,920
Right.

1097
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:21,400
Okay, so JavaScript executed guys.

1098
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,840
It has a little bit of a different syntax.

1099
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:25,560
Okay.

1100
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,080
So what you need to do, you just need to

1101
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,880
what's called you just need to

1102
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,400
remember those that script

1103
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:42,000
that I am going to write down right now,
it has its own built in script

1104
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,760
that you need to follow
in order to perform this kind of actions.

1105
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,960
Okay, So

1106
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:49,840
What I am

1107
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:53,080
going to do, I'm
going to create a new Java class in here

1108
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,840
and I will name it as

1109
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,560
JavaScript execute or demo.

1110
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,400
Okay, So

1111
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,360
now what I want to do in here

1112
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:28,520
is, is this.

1113
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,680
So let me get

1114
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:40,440
the URL.

1115
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,680
Might have this here.

1116
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,200
I'm not here.

1117
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,440
Okay, that's

1118
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,960
my thing.

1119
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,880
It was some thoughts project

1120
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:16,760
right now.

1121
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,240
What was that

1122
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:24,720
scene

1123
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,960
that guys what was the what was

1124
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:34,680
the length for the

1125
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,280
okay so I had it right okay

1126
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,400
but it was system okay.

1127
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,680
All right Yeah I had it right. Okay guys.

1128
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,120
So what I want to do in here, guys,

1129
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,680
I want to

1130
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,160
navigate to this page

1131
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,200
and what I want to do.

1132
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,120
I want to

1133
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:01,440
enter using name and password
and what I want to do.

1134
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,640
I want to highlight the password

1135
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,600
text box in here.

1136
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,800
Okay, So let's go back

1137
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:18,320
in here and let's see

1138
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:21,480
where we use

1139
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:26,640
to identify those.

1140
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:34,200
Think we have it here now,

1141
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:38,440
okay. Yes.

1142
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:41,160
So I'm going to copy this

1143
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,440
and place this in here.

1144
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,720
Okay.

1145
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,880
Log in, button in here. Okay, guys.

1146
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,640
So everyone knows what this trip does,

1147
01:30:50,880 --> 01:31:00,440
right?

1148
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,680
I think I need I might change the URL

1149
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:09,560
in my script.

1150
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,280
Okay, so this is the URL.

1151
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,800
So what I need to do here, I'm passing

1152
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,160
username and password.

1153
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,840
Okay?

1154
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,920
And what I am doing here,

1155
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:28,440
I will be highlighting this password.

1156
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,240
Okay.

1157
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,320
All right.

1158
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:35,040
So now what I need to do guys,

1159
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:40,720
since I passed username
and password in here, what I need to do.

1160
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,720
Okay, so let me comment this out.

1161
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,760
Okay.

1162
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,920
So first of all, if I want to use
a JavaScript executed in here,

1163
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:54,520
I need a JavaScript execute or object.

1164
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:55,360
Okay.

1165
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,560
And since this is an interface, right,
we won't be able to create

1166
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:03,760
a an object directly, right?

1167
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:06,880
We either to create it indirectly

1168
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,600
or we will be casting this down.

1169
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:10,920
Right.

1170
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,880
So when was the last time we were casting
something down?

1171
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:16,440
Guys were what was the implementation

1172
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:27,960
and the web driver?

1173
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:38,000
We're creating an object indirectly,
right?

1174
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:49,840
Any other times, guys?

1175
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:51,720
Alerts No, we're not.

1176
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,600
We're not down casting in there.

1177
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,920
Right.

1178
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:03,120
The question is, when was the last time
we were casting something down

1179
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,320
or up

1180
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:18,000
in our implementation?

1181
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,640
Anyone remember

1182
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:32,040
now? Okay, guys,

1183
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,040
last class.

1184
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:35,960
What did we do?

1185
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:39,480
Guys, It was just last

1186
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,360
class, right?

1187
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:48,280
So what we did in the last class, guys,
we casted down,

1188
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:51,480
take screenshots, interface, right?

1189
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:56,080
So what we are going to be doing this
time,

1190
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:01,360
we will be doing the same thing,
but we will be doing it.

1191
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,360
The JavaScript executing.

1192
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:10,840
Okay,
so what I will do in here, JavaScript

1193
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,960
executable, right?

1194
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,640
I'll put it as gas. Jess Right.

1195
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:21,960
So I'll have a JavaScript execute

1196
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:26,840
right here and we are passing this down
to the driver, right?

1197
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:31,440
Because that's our actual execution
object, right?

1198
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:35,160
So we have this in here,
we have a JavaScript execution

1199
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,480
execute object in here.

1200
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:42,040
So now as I said, guys,
it only gives us two different methods,

1201
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:46,960
which is execute script and execute
async script, right?

1202
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:51,720
So we are only going to be using
the execute script method.

1203
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,400
Okay. So

1204
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,760
what I will do in here,

1205
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:02,560
I'll do just that execute script.

1206
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,120
So in here this method is going to

1207
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,240
expect us to different arguments.

1208
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,240
Okay.

1209
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:16,160
So the first argument is the action
we are performing.

1210
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:22,000
The second one is
the object on the web page.

1211
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,200
Okay, so in here, guys, what is that
object that we're performing an action

1212
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:37,800
on, not on the web page?

1213
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,520
What is the object
that we're performing an action on

1214
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,360
the password TextBox.

1215
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,000
Right.

1216
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,160
So what I'm going to do in here,

1217
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,880
I'll just copy this

1218
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,360
and paste this in here, right?

1219
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:58,360
So that's the element
we need to interact with.

1220
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,320
So before this, write what I need to

1221
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:05,800
do, I am going to perform an action.

1222
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:10,920
Okay, So since I said, guys,
it has a little bit of different

1223
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,960
script, so you just need to remember

1224
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,520
how it works.

1225
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:23,640
Okay, so this is a built in script
that I am going to put in here right now.

1226
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:28,200
Okay, So what you need to do in here,
you need to start with

1227
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:31,600
arguments, okay?

1228
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,120
Arguments.

1229
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,520
Open and close the square bracket.

1230
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:39,520
Inside the square bracket,
you need to put the zero

1231
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:43,440
and then that style.

1232
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:48,000
Okay, So we are we are working right now.

1233
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,760
We're trying to change some styles
in here.

1234
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:51,480
Okay.

1235
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:54,520
And in this style,
what are we trying to do?

1236
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,120
We're trying to do

1237
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:01,160
with trying to manipulate
with a background color.

1238
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,320
Okay.

1239
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:06,080
And what I need to do
is want to put the background color

1240
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:11,240
and I'll put an equal sign

1241
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:15,240
single code, and let's do it as red.

1242
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,400
Okay. So

1243
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,280
here, don't get confused yet.

1244
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,200
Okay, guys.

1245
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:24,960
So because this script that I just wrote,

1246
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:30,120
this is a built in script
to a JavaScript, it okay,

1247
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:36,240
So if I don't think you have to memorize
all the scripts

1248
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:40,640
that that JavaScript execute or has,
you just need to know the logic

1249
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:44,360
and the actions
that you can perform with JavaScript.

1250
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:45,440
Execute.

1251
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:49,680
Okay, So what I will do right now,
let me run this

1252
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:52,680
so that you guys can visually see

1253
01:37:52,680 --> 01:38:05,680
what is going on.

1254
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:06,800
There we go.

1255
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,000
So what happened here, guys?

1256
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:13,880
Whenever I, I entered my log in

1257
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:18,360
and the password,
it highlighted my password.

1258
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:21,040
TextBox Right, guys.

1259
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:25,560
So when,
when can you actually use this guys

1260
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,800
Yeah, this is just a visual change for us.

1261
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:30,480
Exactly.

1262
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,560
For screenshots.

1263
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:33,560
Absolutely right.

1264
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:37,880
So sometimes let's say
the text is not appearing correctly.

1265
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:41,400
So what you can do, you can just
highlighted take screenshots and

1266
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,440
create a defect and attach that in there.

1267
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:45,720
Right.

1268
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:47,080
There we go.

1269
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:52,640
When you want to highlight important words
or any elements on the webpage, right?

1270
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:57,720
So this is one of the actions
that you can perform with

1271
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:01,000
with JavaScript to.

1272
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,040
Okay.

1273
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:26,200
Any questions on this?

1274
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:37,920
The blogs are crazy right now.

1275
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,120
You misspelled arguments zero

1276
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,320
line 21 here.

1277
01:39:53,320 --> 01:40:01,240
This is down casting.

1278
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:02,280
We have an interface.

1279
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:06,560
We need an object of that interface.

1280
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:13,320
So basically what we're doing in here
is down casting our object

1281
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,040
to the execution point object
that we have.

1282
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,360
Okay.

1283
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,120
So in here, since the driver is our

1284
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,680
execution object,
so we need to perform some different

1285
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:30,320
actions as well, right?

1286
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,800
So that's why we're doing this.

1287
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:41,640
Since we can't create an object
of the JavaScript, execute or interface.

1288
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:43,080
So I said your name. Right?

1289
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:43,600
Okay.

1290
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,040
Okay, no problem.

1291
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,520
Can you highlight
any text on the webpage? Yes.

1292
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,160
So if you go ahead and get

1293
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:55,800
you need to have a web
element on hand, right?

1294
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:02,080
So You need to locate that web element
and then you have to execute this.

1295
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,000
Correct.

1296
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:10,680
Okay.

1297
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:13,280
You can try. Yeah, try.

1298
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:16,840
Let's try.

1299
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:20,160
I don't know if we're going to work

1300
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,920
red or what.

1301
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,160
What else can we do?

1302
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,040
Purple

1303
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:27,760
of blue.

1304
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,960
Okay, Yeah, Let's do this. Fine.

1305
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,120
There we go.

1306
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:47,240
So let's execute this.

1307
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,320
There we go.

1308
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:54,200
So now it's a different color in here,
right?

1309
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,040
Okay.

1310
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:56,280
All right.

1311
01:41:56,280 --> 01:42:06,600
Any questions, guys, on this?

1312
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,160
What does zero mean?

1313
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:11,320
I'm not really sure what this means,

1314
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:15,880
but just know that this is how it's built.

1315
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,320
Okay?

1316
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:22,600
How can you use it without down casting?

1317
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:27,160
I don't think you will be able to, but
there might be some other ways, of course.

1318
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:39,840
But this is one of the way that I know of.

1319
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:43,000
Yeah, you can use the same syntax
for the username.

1320
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,800
You just need to change that element.

1321
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:51,520
You interacting with.

1322
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:56,400
Okay.

1323
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:11,280
Any other questions?

1324
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:16,200
Okay, so here what we're doing,
we're just down casting.

1325
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,560
That means.

1326
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:23,840
So when you try to convert one data type

1327
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:28,360
to another data type,
that's when you want a down downcast.

1328
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:38,440
Okay.

1329
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:41,280
Line 20.
Yes, the line 21 will be the same.

1330
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:45,000
You just need to use this object

1331
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:50,520
on the username.

1332
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:50,920
Sure.

1333
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:55,320
Just you can have the same exact in here.

1334
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,840
You just need to change the

1335
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:00,920
the element that you're

1336
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:07,640
trying to interact with right.

1337
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,680
So let's do this right.

1338
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:11,560
And the other one is blue.

1339
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:23,480
So let's run this.

1340
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,040
All right, there you go.

1341
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:29,400
So you just need to change the

1342
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:32,240
the objects that you want to interact
with on the web page.

1343
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,360
So we use for other actions.

1344
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:50,200
What what other actions
are you talking about?

1345
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,840
Confuse on down casting.

1346
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,240
Okay, guys.

1347
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:54,600
Okay.

1348
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:57,040
In order for us to use

1349
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:03,200
to use JavaScript, execute our methods.

1350
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:07,200
Okay,
how do I get access to those methods guys?

1351
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,000
Okay. If I have a class. Okay.

1352
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,080
And it has some methods like, let's say
action class, what do we do, guys?

1353
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:17,640
So in order for me to get access to,
the actions class

1354
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:26,640
methods, we create an object, right?

1355
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,480
Because it's a class.

1356
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:33,960
Okay, So we're creating an object
because we can do this with actions class

1357
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:37,440
because it's a class and you can create
an object of the class, right?

1358
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,960
So since this JavaScript

1359
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,720
execution is an interface, right?

1360
01:45:43,960 --> 01:45:48,840
So it's an interface
and we just need to have access

1361
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,760
to the, to the methods, okay.

1362
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:54,160
To the methods that it has.

1363
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:58,000
And in order to do this one,
what we need to do,

1364
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:04,000
we need to have an object to
we need to be able to execute it.

1365
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:08,000
Okay, So what we're doing right now,
we're basically

1366
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
converting the data type in here by down
casting.

1367
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:15,080
Okay, So don't go too much into details.

1368
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:18,240
Went to down
Castle, went to up class in here.

1369
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:22,560
Okay so whenever you're having
an interface and you trying to use it

1370
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:26,280
from different libraries,
you either don't pass or you directly,

1371
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,880
you can implement

1372
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:33,640
most of the time as we did on alerts guys,

1373
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,680
depending on

1374
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:39,840
what kind of interfaces they are

1375
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:43,040
and what kind of

1376
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,040
actions you want to perform.

1377
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:50,880
Okay, so but in JavaScript guys
in JavaScript execute or what

1378
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,080
you need to do, since you're performing
some actions on the web page,

1379
01:46:55,240 --> 01:47:00,240
you need to cast it down
and change your data type to a web driver.

1380
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:04,440
Okay?

1381
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,520
No, you don't have to do that.

1382
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:15,840
Okay?

1383
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,000
You don't have to.

1384
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,280
Dom cast all the what's called
all the interfaces, okay,

1385
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:26,720
Because here, guys, what we are doing,
we're actually

1386
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:30,360
performing an action
on the web page, right.

1387
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:36,240
And to perform action on the web page,
we are using the driver in here.

1388
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:37,560
Right?

1389
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:42,520
So, so in order for us to

1390
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:46,320
to perform some actions
and use at the same time

1391
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,800
the methods that are available
in the JavaScript executable,

1392
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:53,200
we need to have this JavaScript execute

1393
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:56,000
or casted down and change the data type.

1394
01:47:56,560 --> 01:48:01,080
Okay.

1395
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:02,680
Yeah. I think I already did that.

1396
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,320
It should highlight both.

1397
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,000
Okay, check them.

1398
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,400
Check the spell spelling on the

1399
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:12,360
on your script.

1400
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:17,120
Okay.

1401
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:20,760
And check your elements
that you're trying to interact.

1402
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,680
Okay, guys.

1403
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,960
So now we change the background color
of the username and password

1404
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,840
text boxes, right?

1405
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,280
So what I want to do guys,

1406
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:37,200
I want to click on the log in button,

1407
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:40,080
but I don't want to use the regular click.

1408
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:40,800
Okay.

1409
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:45,000
So there is another alternative for you to

1410
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:51,560
to click on any button
or on any web element, right?

1411
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:52,760
If you want to click.

1412
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:57,240
So again, guys, since we already have the

1413
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,800
the JavaScript execute our

1414
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,520
object in here, what I am going to do,

1415
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:09,120
I am going to use that
and I will use the same exact method.

1416
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:15,600
Okay, so now what is the element we will
be interacting with in this case, less

1417
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:27,320
the login button, right?

1418
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:30,880
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to put the login button in here.

1419
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,840
Okay.

1420
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,040
And then what I need to do,

1421
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:40,120
I need to write down this credit,
that action that we're going to be doing.

1422
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:40,440
Right.

1423
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,960
So again, arguments

1424
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:46,240
with zero, Okay.

1425
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:49,440
And what I simply want to do

1426
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:54,680
is to click, okay,

1427
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:59,440
So this is the script,
the built in script for JavaScript execute

1428
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:04,600
or to click on the button or the element,
whichever you want to.

1429
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:08,840
Okay. Yep.

1430
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:12,200
We got all we got three
different click options right now.

1431
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:15,640
Okay, So let's execute this.

1432
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:17,880
I think this is going to be really fast.

1433
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:32,800
So let's see.

1434
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,760
There we go.

1435
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:38,760
So it highlighted all to element's
username and password, right?

1436
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:43,040
And, and it clicked on the login button

1437
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,680
and we see that we are on the dashboard.

1438
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,960
Okay. Now, excuse me.

1439
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:50,640
Exactly.

1440
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:54,200
No excuse for not being able to click.

1441
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,720
Right. Exactly.

1442
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:57,920
All right,

1443
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:05,760
guys Any questions on this?

1444
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:10,560
Any questions on how to highlight
or how to

1445
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:17,400
click on the Web element?

1446
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,120
Any preference on clicking?

1447
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:22,480
Yes, regular
click is the first option for you.

1448
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:26,120
Okay.

1449
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:28,960
Regular click is the first option for you.

1450
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:31,360
The second option, it depends on you.

1451
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:34,240
You either want to go with JavaScript,
execute,

1452
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:38,000
or actions class click
okay, it's up to you.

1453
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:43,240
They both to alternative to the
to the regular click

1454
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:48,960
on Insulate.

1455
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:54,920
Okay.

1456
01:51:54,920 --> 01:52:05,320
Any questions guys, for now?

1457
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:06,960
Okay, good. All right.

1458
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:11,760
So now let me go ahead and create
one more class

1459
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:19,080
and Skeeter demo two.

1460
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:24,760
So let's go over different
different options

1461
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,200
in JavaScript. Executed.

1462
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:32,760
Okay, go.

1463
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:38,160
So I am going to change the URL to

1464
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:43,280
Amazon.com.

1465
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:43,920
Okay.

1466
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,680
So okay.

1467
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:50,840
So now, yes,

1468
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:53,760
when normal click doesn't work,
you will try the others.

1469
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,280
Exactly.

1470
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,080
Okay, guys.

1471
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:03,800
So now when you navigate to the Amazon,
you can see that

1472
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:06,960
the page is very long, right?

1473
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,480
So there's a lot of stuff
going on in here.

1474
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:10,760
There's a lot of links.

1475
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:13,880
So in order to to find something,

1476
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:16,920
you have to scroll down right?

1477
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:21,680
So sometimes, guys,
sometimes it's not going to happen

1478
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:25,920
very often guys,
but it's really rarely happening.

1479
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:29,600
Thing
that if you want to click on some elements

1480
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:33,240
in the middle of the website
and you are just

1481
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:36,240
showing this, it's not going to work.

1482
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:39,840
Sometimes selenium doesn't
catch some elements which are not

1483
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,800
visible to them, to selenium.

1484
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:45,920
Okay,
So in order to click on those Elements,

1485
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:49,840
what you want to
do, you want to scroll down

1486
01:53:51,160 --> 01:53:53,760
or what
you want to do, you want to scroll up.

1487
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,800
Okay, So

1488
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:02,240
what we're going to be doing right now,
we're going to be scrolling up and down

1489
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:07,040
and we will be scrolling
to the specific elements.

1490
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:10,880
Okay, So let's go back in here

1491
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,000
and start actually

1492
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,680
implementing that. Okay.

1493
01:54:16,680 --> 01:54:19,160
So first of all, guys,

1494
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:22,920
if you want to scroll up and down
what you need to do,

1495
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:25,800
you will go ahead and use JavaScript,
execute.

1496
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:26,880
Okay?

1497
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:31,040
So for me to use a JavaScript,
execute or methods, what I need to do,

1498
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:33,480
I need to create a

1499
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:37,960
object of the JavaScript, execute it right

1500
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:41,960
script, execute a driver in here.

1501
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,640
So we cast it down.

1502
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:49,560
So now what I need to do,
I need to execute some scripts, right?

1503
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:54,520
So in here guys, since I want to scroll up

1504
01:54:54,520 --> 01:54:58,160
and down, I don't have anything right now

1505
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,000
to scroll into, right?

1506
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,040
So I will be scrolling by numbers.

1507
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:08,280
What do we scroll by on the web page,

1508
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:17,480
guys?

1509
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:18,840
Just calling up and down.

1510
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:21,000
Guys, we're not changing any pages, right?

1511
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,880
So here we are on the same page,
but we're just scrolling down

1512
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:25,920
right

1513
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:37,760
For now.

1514
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,560
We don't need an element, right?

1515
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:43,560
Because we are just
scrolling down on The View, guys.

1516
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:50,240
Okay,

1517
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:53,400
what are we scrolling by

1518
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:55,120
browsing?

1519
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:57,880
Okay, lines.

1520
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:04,320
Not really.

1521
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:09,120
So we will be scrolling by pixels.

1522
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:14,240
Okay,

1523
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:20,720
so what we are having here,
we will be scrolling by pixels.

1524
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:21,440
Okay,

1525
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,840
so what I am going to do in here,

1526
01:56:28,160 --> 01:56:31,800
I am going to

1527
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:42,640
I am going to put a script
that is built in for JavaScript.

1528
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:45,480
Okay, so what I am going to do in here,

1529
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,480
so I am scrolling on the window, right?

1530
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:52,680
So I'll put window that

1531
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,040
scroll by

1532
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:02,000
and inside the parentheses what I will do,

1533
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:06,480
I will start from the zero and.

1534
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:11,360
I will go down by 500 pixels in here.

1535
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:16,640
Okay, so let me run this

1536
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,120
and see what we're going to have

1537
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:24,720
for now.

1538
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:26,760
Yes, we have to. Yes, Correct.

1539
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:31,920
If you just want, scroll on the page.

1540
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:35,080
So for now you have to.

1541
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:38,200
Yes. Yes.

1542
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,320
So we navigate to the Amazon right now.

1543
01:57:40,360 --> 01:57:44,640
So now you can see that
we are a little bit down in here.

1544
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:46,320
Okay.

1545
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:49,120
So you can see that
we are not at the very top.

1546
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:51,680
We work a little bit.

1547
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,400
Scroll down in here.

1548
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:58,680
Okay.

1549
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:29,280
Any questions, guys?

1550
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,480
Scroll with actions.

1551
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:39,080
I haven't tried that.

1552
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:39,360
Okay.

1553
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,600
So how to know after zero

1554
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:45,120
what number to put for?

1555
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:47,480
This is just an option to scroll down.

1556
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:50,640
Okay, so you can guess any any number

1557
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,640
of checks and

1558
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:59,880
in the scrolling text.

1559
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:01,320
I'm not. No, no guys.

1560
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:06,480
So here I am just scrolling down
without knowing where I'm going to end up.

1561
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:15,240
Okay,
so I'm just scrolling a little bit down

1562
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:19,880
so I don't know where I'm going to end up,
but this is how you scroll

1563
01:59:19,880 --> 01:59:23,760
down on the page and I'm going to show you
how to scroll down

1564
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:27,920
to this, to this specific element, and
that's going to make more sense to you.

1565
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:33,760
Okay, You can scroll more.

1566
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:34,320
Yeah.

1567
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:40,280
If you if you edit this number,
you can scroll more.

1568
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:41,080
Okay.

1569
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:44,080
So now if I want to scroll back up, guys,

1570
01:59:44,640 --> 02:00:02,560
So how would you do this?

1571
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:05,880
Okay. Or

1572
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:08,080
just here,

1573
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:11,680
what you want to do this same way, right?

1574
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:14,160
What you can do,

1575
02:00:14,160 --> 02:00:25,600
you can go -500.

1576
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,280
I'm not sure about a horizontal way
how to scroll on horizontal way

1577
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:33,400
because here guys this JavaScript execute

1578
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:38,640
or whenever you maximize your page,
most of the pages

1579
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:42,160
they get,
you don't have to scroll horizontally

1580
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:52,240
right?

1581
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:52,920
Okay.

1582
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:55,160
So this is going to be really fast.

1583
02:00:55,160 --> 02:01:10,440
So let's see if we can catch up on this.

1584
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:15,480
Let's see.

1585
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:16,440
Okay, there we go.

1586
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:19,960
So we scroll down and we went back up.

1587
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:38,200
Okay, Can you break in between?

1588
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:46,920
What do you mean?

1589
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:47,640
Oh, you want to see?

1590
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:49,160
Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. Let's.

1591
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:54,840
Let's do this.

1592
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:55,440
Yeah, sure.

1593
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:58,160
Let's put for 2 seconds. Okay?

1594
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:19,600
And let's run this.

1595
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:20,120
Okay.

1596
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:24,080
There we go.

1597
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:27,720
All right,
so we scroll down and we scroll back up

1598
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:46,960
the second JavaScript executable.

1599
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:51,360
I think it's a class
that's a different thing.

1600
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,480
So the one you should be looking for

1601
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:56,880
is JavaScript executable,
which is an interface.

1602
02:02:58,120 --> 02:03:06,120
Okay.

1603
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:06,640
All right.

1604
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:10,840
So now, guys, what I want to do in here,
since

1605
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:15,000
it's a long way right
there, is it's a long page here.

1606
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:18,840
What I want to do, I want to scroll.

1607
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:22,680
Okay, beautiful.

1608
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:25,320
I want to see

1609
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:33,080
I want to scroll

1610
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:36,120
right to this button over here.

1611
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:37,880
Back to top.

1612
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:40,560
Okay. So.

1613
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:45,240
So since we don't know how many pixels
we need to scroll down.

1614
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:47,400
Okay, What we can do?

1615
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:50,680
We can directly scroll to this element.

1616
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:58,720
Okay, so what I am going to do in here,
I am going to inspect this page

1617
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:04,160
and I will need to identify this element
first.

1618
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:09,840
Okay, So let's see,
what can we use in here, guys?

1619
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:22,560
How can we identify this?

1620
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:25,240
Let's
see if class name is available. Right.

1621
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:27,480
So let me copy this class name

1622
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:29,800
in here.

1623
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:30,600
All right.

1624
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:34,600
And let's create this web element

1625
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:39,720
back to top, right?

1626
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:40,040
Right.

1627
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:40,680
Where

1628
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:47,160
to find element.

1629
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:50,440
I have a class name in here

1630
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,200
and what I need to do now

1631
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:01,200
since I have that element on hand
right now.

1632
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:04,440
So I going to

1633
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:06,640
execute this script.

1634
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:10,080
Okay. So again,

1635
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:13,040
I need to paste an element

1636
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:18,000
that I need to interact first in here
and then I need to paste it.

1637
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,360
Actual scripts.

1638
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:21,920
Okay, So what I'm going to do

1639
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:28,080
is zero arguments, and here, right.

1640
02:05:28,120 --> 02:05:31,280
And now what the action is,

1641
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:36,960
I am basically scrolling into the view,
right Scroll

1642
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:40,360
into view in here

1643
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:43,680
and open and close parentheses

1644
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:48,960
and I'll just paste to inside.

1645
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:49,800
Okay,

1646
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:54,400
So let me execute this

1647
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:59,640
and let's see if we will be,

1648
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:04,280
scrolling down to the exact same element
that we just mentioned here

1649
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:17,880
or just go up and down.

1650
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:20,800
And now you can see that we scroll

1651
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:24,720
right to the bottom where you can see this

1652
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,480
back to the top button in here,

1653
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,280
right?

1654
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:34,560
Pretty cool, right, guys?

1655
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:37,760
It's just it's just a little bit confusing

1656
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:41,120
scripts that Java's executed or has.

1657
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:50,840
But other than that, there is a lot
of cool stuff that you can do with this.

1658
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:51,520
All right.

1659
02:06:51,520 --> 02:07:00,360
Any questions, guys?

1660
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:25,680
Let me close the session in here.

1661
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:28,200
Good question, Michael.

1662
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:29,240
Yeah, you could do that.

1663
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,440
Try this.

1664
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:31,760
Try this at work.

1665
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:35,120
Let's see what happens.

1666
02:07:35,120 --> 02:07:37,280
So if you get fired,
don't come to me, though,

1667
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:50,160
okay?

1668
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:50,520
Okay.

1669
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:53,880
If it comes to me,
then I'll probably laugh, but it's okay.

1670
02:07:54,360 --> 02:08:05,880
We'll see.

1671
02:08:05,880 --> 02:08:06,720
Okay.

1672
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:07,720
Now questions.

1673
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:10,800
Let's continue. Right. So let me create

1674
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:14,600
a new Java class in here and say

1675
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,680
class four

1676
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:37,120
Oh, I'll probably won't be boss

1677
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:51,680
for I won't be probably doing automation

1678
02:08:51,960 --> 02:09:13,920
in three months, guys.

1679
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:16,240
Yes, I am going
full time back in development,

1680
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:19,560
but probably in a month or so

1681
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:29,520
we'll see.

1682
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:31,040
Oh, no, no.

1683
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:35,440
This not in my last batch, guys.

1684
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:45,040
Probably not, but.

1685
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:45,640
All right.

1686
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:53,640
So let's continue.

1687
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:54,440
All right.

1688
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:56,240
So now

1689
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:58,600
study

1690
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:12,720
what to do
if if you if you study and it's fun,

1691
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:17,760
but you absolutely not passionate
so if you're finding fun stuff in it.

1692
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:21,160
So that means you already have
some passion, right?

1693
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:22,920
We just

1694
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:26,040
just think about money now,

1695
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:33,920
okay.

1696
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:34,480
All right, guys.

1697
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:39,600
So let me copy this and let's go over

1698
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:43,680
some more JavaScript

1699
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:50,760
execute or actions.

1700
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:54,920
So instead of Amazon,
I will be going to Google.

1701
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:55,840
Okay.

1702
02:10:55,840 --> 02:11:02,040
So what I am going to do in here, guys,
I will be using a JavaScript

1703
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:05,880
executed to open up a new tab.

1704
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:11,640
Okay, So what I will do
and here again I am going to

1705
02:11:12,880 --> 02:11:15,280
create a JavaScript execute object

1706
02:11:15,720 --> 02:11:18,880
and casted down

1707
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:22,560
to the driver. Right?

1708
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:28,080
And then what I need to do,
I am going to execute this script.

1709
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:32,200
Okay, so me to open a new tab, it's

1710
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:36,840
going to be just one script
and I will be managing Windows again.

1711
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:40,800
All right, So window dot open

1712
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:45,120
right, and opening closed parentheses
here.

1713
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:49,440
I need to insert the semicolon
and finish my

1714
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:54,720
what's called

1715
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:58,200
and finish my statement.

1716
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:00,760
Okay, So let's actually

1717
02:12:03,480 --> 02:12:04,560
do this.

1718
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:07,960
Okay. Okay.

1719
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:09,480
Let's run this first. Okay.

1720
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:16,800
And let's see what's going to happen.

1721
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:22,360
I'm going to bias syntax poser.

1722
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:32,520
I thought you going
to put my picture in there.

1723
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:38,400
All right, So I'm executing this.

1724
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,120
Oh, he already has mine. Okay.

1725
02:12:40,120 --> 02:12:44,640
Okay, good, good.

1726
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:47,160
All right,
So I executed this script, right?

1727
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:51,000
So what happened
is I navigate it to Google and

1728
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:54,120
I opened up a new tab.

1729
02:12:54,840 --> 02:12:55,200
Right?

1730
02:12:56,680 --> 02:12:59,520
So right now, guys,

1731
02:13:00,240 --> 02:13:03,600
so let me close this.

1732
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:05,640
Any questions on this line?

1733
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:14,360
16 guys.

1734
02:13:14,360 --> 02:13:18,680
Now, this is just a built in scripts in.

1735
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:21,360
Right? So I have a question for you guys.

1736
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:24,440
So if I navigate to the URL

1737
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:29,200
after I open up and New window guys

1738
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:34,480
in the script this time
this is a built in script, okay?

1739
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:39,720
That's
why we need to put the semicolon in here.

1740
02:13:39,720 --> 02:13:44,520
So okay, when I open up a browser,
I open up a new window.

1741
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:45,400
Okay.

1742
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:50,000
So if I navigate to Google, guys,
where is this going to open?

1743
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:53,080
Is it going to open on the first tab
or the second one

1744
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:01,960
second line?

1745
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:04,440
Okay. Okay.

1746
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:06,520
First

1747
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:09,080
will.

1748
02:14:09,080 --> 02:14:11,360
First, second. Okay, cool.

1749
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:13,840
Let's run this and see

1750
02:14:26,640 --> 02:14:27,200
what happened.

1751
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:27,560
Guys.

1752
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:30,520
It opened

1753
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:35,480
that page and navigated to that page
on the first tab. Why?

1754
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:39,400
Because even though we open
a new tab in here,

1755
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:44,080
our focus is still on the first page.

1756
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:49,200
Okay,
so if I locate this element, the search.

1757
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:51,880
Okay, if I locate this element

1758
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:54,720
and I send some cheese in here

1759
02:14:56,080 --> 02:14:59,720
right after this script,
is it going to send in there

1760
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:08,160
or now?

1761
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:09,200
Yes, right.

1762
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:12,400
Because our focus is on the

1763
02:15:13,880 --> 02:15:15,360
Google in here.

1764
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:17,440
So let's go ahead.

1765
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:19,520
I think it was this one. All right.

1766
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:23,040
So let's inspect that

1767
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:26,840
Google.

1768
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:32,640
So let's inspect this page.

1769
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:36,720
And what I want to do here, let's see.

1770
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:43,200
Okay, I have a name in here,
so let me use this thing.

1771
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:45,880
Close this. Okay.

1772
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:49,800
So what element search is equal to driver

1773
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:53,560
dot find element by

1774
02:15:54,680 --> 02:15:57,400
where is the name

1775
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:02,320
here and what I need to do.

1776
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:05,120
Search, start and keys.

1777
02:16:06,360 --> 02:16:08,240
There's a lot of stuff in right.

1778
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:09,000
Okay.

1779
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:11,280
So let's execute this

1780
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:26,400
so we open a new tab.

1781
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:28,480
Tab in here.

1782
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:31,840
Would navigate it to Google
on the first of all on and you can see

1783
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:37,040
that we entered the text on the first tab
because our focus is still there.

1784
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,800
But visually we on the same

1785
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:42,760
we are on the second tab, right?

1786
02:16:43,320 --> 02:16:45,640
Any questions on this?

1787
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:47,800
Any questions on JavaScript?

1788
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:54,320
Execute any questions to what we've done
so far in Selenium.

1789
02:16:54,320 --> 02:17:19,520
Guys,

1790
02:17:19,520 --> 02:17:22,800
if you click on what

1791
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:26,840
you don't have to click
to open a new tab, right?

1792
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:30,800
So you just need to execute this script
and it will open

1793
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:43,200
a new tab for you.

1794
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:46,720
The text we sent, the text we sent

1795
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:50,920
in here.

1796
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:53,160
So you
need to click on the Google support.

1797
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:54,920
I don't think
it's going to open a new tab.

1798
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:56,120
If you click

1799
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:16,520
the first one. Yes.

1800
02:18:16,520 --> 02:18:21,880
So if you want to do that, you
you open a new window.

1801
02:18:22,120 --> 02:18:26,800
You need to switch your focus
to the second right.

1802
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,240
And only then you can navigate to the

1803
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:35,960
to the different zero.

1804
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:43,680
Actually, that's going to be
a good homework for you guys.

1805
02:18:43,680 --> 02:18:44,840
Let me add that.

1806
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:48,760
Okay?

1807
02:18:48,760 --> 02:18:51,360
Because you already should know how it is.

1808
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:54,720
Switch between windows

1809
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:57,120
or is and it's

1810
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:05,840
Michael.

1811
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:07,840
That's not that's not good, man.

1812
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:08,720
That's.

1813
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:14,320
Am I falling in there?

1814
02:19:14,320 --> 02:19:15,680
Why are they holding me?

1815
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:21,120
I'm like, I'm like,
fainting in there, man.

1816
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:34,920
Come on.

1817
02:19:34,920 --> 02:19:36,920
They hold me back.

1818
02:19:36,920 --> 02:19:51,960
Okay.

1819
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:54,880
All right,
So that's actually pathetic notes.

1820
02:19:55,440 --> 02:19:56,400
Let me see

1821
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,640
the homework.

1822
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:07,760
So open

1823
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,520
new browser, right.

1824
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:17,040
Open a new tab.

1825
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:24,160
Navigate to a different URL

1826
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:27,400
on a new tab.

1827
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:28,120
Okay.

1828
02:20:28,360 --> 02:20:29,560
There you go

1829
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:32,880
to syntax.

1830
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:36,120
Okay. Nice.

1831
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:37,840
At least here I have two guns.

1832
02:20:37,840 --> 02:20:52,680
Okay, that's good.

1833
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:55,040
My mic is in team syntax. Why?

1834
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:56,480
Who hired him?

1835
02:20:56,480 --> 02:21:09,240
First of all, he hired and so.

1836
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:10,920
Well, probably he's working for free.

1837
02:21:10,920 --> 02:21:21,760
So that that works.

1838
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:22,680
Okay.

1839
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:28,640
All right, guys, any questions?

1840
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:30,680
Any questions on.

1841
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:33,160
Let's put the jokes aside. Right.

1842
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:35,280
So we've got 30 more minutes, guys.

1843
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:37,520
So any questions on

1844
02:21:38,600 --> 02:21:41,560
JavaScript, executable actions, classes,

1845
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,720
anything guys

1846
02:22:35,480 --> 02:22:37,480
are, it's fresh.

1847
02:22:37,480 --> 02:22:39,640
That's a homework for you. Okay.

1848
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:42,440
So that's what I have

1849
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:44,120
in my notes. Okay.

1850
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:46,560
Find out how to refresh with JavaScript.

1851
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:51,600
Execute.

1852
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:53,800
We go through the last homework.

1853
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:58,080
What is what is confusing
guys for the last

1854
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:05,280
for the last.

1855
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:06,360
Yeah. I don't think you should.

1856
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:08,320
You should worry too much about this.

1857
02:23:08,320 --> 02:23:11,880
Remembering the script. Exactly.

1858
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:26,000
For use with this one.

1859
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:31,880
What is the confusion?

1860
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:34,200
Are we going to use Firefox in selenium?

1861
02:23:34,200 --> 02:23:37,640
No, but I'm not sure if you guys are going
to be doing this in test engine.

1862
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:43,640
You should probably I think you will be
doing some parallel testing in testing.

1863
02:23:43,640 --> 02:23:44,520
G Okay.

1864
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:53,120
So you will be using two different
browsers.

1865
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:54,880
But again, guys, I'm not sure.

1866
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:59,120
I think that was one of the topics
where you parallel testing.

1867
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:02,760
You can ask the instructor, I don't even
know who's going to be teaching testing.

1868
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:13,880
You guys.

1869
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:14,880
Oh, okay.

1870
02:24:14,880 --> 02:24:18,840
Yeah, ask him because I'm pretty
sure testing G has Good,

1871
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:21,160
good.

1872
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:41,760
Where you guys can do parallel testings.

1873
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:47,280
All right,
so let's go over the homework now.

1874
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:51,320
Okay?

1875
02:24:51,320 --> 02:24:51,720
Okay.

1876
02:24:51,800 --> 02:24:55,040
Pretty good amount of things in here.

1877
02:24:55,040 --> 02:25:11,760
Like, there's no questions for me.

1878
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:14,520
Yes, that's it for tonight.

1879
02:25:14,520 --> 02:25:17,320
I think I'll

1880
02:25:17,320 --> 02:25:18,120
I'll.

1881
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:21,560
I'll start with I'll start with

1882
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:26,480
page Object model right now,
just to give you

1883
02:25:26,480 --> 02:25:29,520
an idea of what is going on

1884
02:25:30,360 --> 02:25:31,720
and then we'll wrap it up.

1885
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:34,440
But first, let's go
let's go over the homework.

1886
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,160
Okay.

1887
02:25:37,160 --> 02:25:38,320
Okay, guys.

1888
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:42,160
So the first homework, you open
a new browser, you open a new tab,

1889
02:25:42,160 --> 02:25:46,480
you navigate to the different URL
on a new.

1890
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:50,160
Okay, So that's that should be clear.

1891
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:54,240
And then here goes

1892
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:58,960
one test case
where you need to use it in testing,

1893
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:02,040
and I want you to use assertion.

1894
02:26:02,760 --> 02:26:03,640
Okay.

1895
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:06,360
So what I you to do is

1896
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:09,200
navigate to this

1897
02:26:09,200 --> 02:26:11,280
website and then you're to know it's

1898
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:14,880
here.

1899
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:15,560
All right,

1900
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:18,480
So enter a valid username

1901
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:20,880
and leave the password empty.

1902
02:26:21,560 --> 02:26:26,000
Okay,
So on log in button and verify the error.

1903
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:31,080
The error message with the text
password cannot be empty.

1904
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:34,080
Is this way. Okay.

1905
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:37,680
And you guys are did this

1906
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:42,520
okay.

1907
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:43,000
That's fine.

1908
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,360
You can do it one more time.

1909
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:47,280
Right. But.

1910
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:48,600
But do it.

1911
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:49,040
Okay.

1912
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:51,960
So don't do it in test
and you do it in selenium now.

1913
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:58,080
Okay.

1914
02:26:58,080 --> 02:26:58,520
All right.

1915
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:03,680
So the second one, did you probably you
guys probably did this as well

1916
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:07,920
so navigating to the same website,
leave username and password empty

1917
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:10,520
and click on the log in button.

1918
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:11,640
Okay.

1919
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:14,520
And verify this error message is

1920
02:27:14,520 --> 02:27:18,000
this way.

1921
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:21,440
Okay. And here

1922
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:24,440
the other one.

1923
02:27:25,360 --> 02:27:28,120
So you need to to the same website.

1924
02:27:29,720 --> 02:27:32,400
Enter valid

1925
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:34,520
username and the wrong password.

1926
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:36,360
Okay.

1927
02:27:36,360 --> 02:27:39,360
So click on log in and verify that

1928
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:42,480
invalid credentials is this okay?

1929
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:44,280
When is the due date?

1930
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:45,960
There's no due date for this. Okay.

1931
02:27:45,960 --> 02:27:48,440
This is for your own practice, guys.

1932
02:27:48,440 --> 02:27:53,040
Okay.

1933
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:57,280
So this one, do it on the selenium
project.

1934
02:27:57,680 --> 02:27:58,360
Okay.

1935
02:27:58,360 --> 02:28:00,640
So what I want you to do on this one

1936
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:05,960
is to go here

1937
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:14,080
and start

1938
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:18,120
going through each and every tab in here.

1939
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:22,200
Okay,
So first of all, what you need to do,

1940
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:25,760
you need to drag and drop
here, double click in here,

1941
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:30,320
switch to the frame, enter something here.

1942
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:31,200
Okay.

1943
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:38,320
I don't think
we have anything in here. Yes.

1944
02:28:38,760 --> 02:28:42,480
And then click on the next available.

1945
02:28:42,480 --> 02:28:43,920
So I think we're on the phone

1946
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:46,600
right now. Yes.

1947
02:28:46,600 --> 02:28:50,880
Click on the next tab
for click on this link.

1948
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:54,360
Wait for the element in here, verify

1949
02:28:54,480 --> 02:28:58,560
the whole text is displayed in here.

1950
02:28:58,800 --> 02:29:00,880
Then click on the next tab, guys.

1951
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:07,320
Okay, Let's
see how you're going to handle this. So.

1952
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:12,080
So basically
what I want you to do is navigate

1953
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:17,120
through every tab that you have in here
and perform all the actions.

1954
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:22,040
Okay, So this form, right,
you already know how to handle the

1955
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:27,840
what's called radio buttons and checkbox
says you know how to handle the drop downs

1956
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:33,880
and here we know how to input text
and click on submit and everything.

1957
02:29:34,320 --> 02:29:38,600
Right So when you're done with that
you go to controls.

1958
02:29:39,320 --> 02:29:41,640
I think you already we were already there.

1959
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:44,000
So widgets in here. There we go.

1960
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,360
We have another file upload, Right.

1961
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:48,480
So try to upload any file in here

1962
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:53,480
actions again, click me double click.

1963
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:56,480
Okay drag and drop in here.

1964
02:29:56,480 --> 02:29:58,840
Move to an element.

1965
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:01,240
Right. So switching.

1966
02:30:01,240 --> 02:30:02,960
So we've done this example.

1967
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:04,320
Try to do it again.

1968
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:06,800
Okay Exactly.

1969
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:10,840
Do everything on the website
one by one on the tabs.

1970
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:26,040
Okay. Yes.

1971
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:29,880
They the YouTube channel
that I used to work is nivine.

1972
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:30,480
Okay.

1973
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:32,960
I think it was nivine

1974
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:35,920
something.

1975
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:39,160
But if you just Google not Google,

1976
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:41,400
just let's go

1977
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:48,600
Navy automation.

1978
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:51,000
There we go. Okay,

1979
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:53,120
So remember this

1980
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:57,680
you guys

1981
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:58,920
okay, you

1982
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,560
So yeah, I think this is for the

1983
02:31:07,080 --> 02:31:08,680
Naveen Automation lab.

1984
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:10,440
Okay. So go in here.

1985
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:12,480
He's got pretty good

1986
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:19,840
pretty good videos in here.

1987
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:23,840
He explains a lot of good stuff

1988
02:31:29,640 --> 02:31:32,880
that.

1989
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:33,560
All right.

1990
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:39,720
Any other questions, guys?

1991
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:49,920
Homework? Yes.

1992
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:51,240
It's posted in the course.

1993
02:31:51,240 --> 02:31:58,800
Announcements.

1994
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:01,480
Go. Okay.

1995
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:03,840
I'll push the code right after we finish.

1996
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:04,680
Okay.

1997
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:07,440
All right, guys,
If there's no questions tomorrow,

1998
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:11,120
we're going to go over the page model.

1999
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:13,560
That's going to be a little confusing.

2000
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:15,040
Okay, guys.

2001
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:18,240
But because I will be jumping through

2002
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:21,920
between a lot of different packages.

2003
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:22,720
Okay.

2004
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:25,840
So I'd suggest to just follow me
when I'm explaining

2005
02:32:25,840 --> 02:32:29,040
and not type
because you will get lost in there.

2006
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:29,840
Okay.

2007
02:32:29,840 --> 02:32:33,080
So I'll be jumping
through different packages tomorrow.

2008
02:32:33,240 --> 02:32:36,200
So it would be best to follow me

2009
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:39,480
what I'm doing in there.

2010
02:32:39,480 --> 02:32:43,720
I don't think I'm going to teach
cucumber guys.

2011
02:32:43,720 --> 02:32:44,520
Okay.

2012
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:51,360
Yes. No typing tomorrow.

2013
02:32:51,360 --> 02:32:53,760
Just come to the class and enjoy the show.

2014
02:32:54,360 --> 02:33:00,840
Last class tomorrow.

2015
02:33:00,840 --> 02:33:03,480
All right? Okay, guys.

2016
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:05,240
Have a good night, everyone.

2017
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:06,960
Thanks, everybody.

2018
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:09,040
But tomorrow's topic page object model.

2019
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:11,760
Okay.

2020
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:14,280
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

2021
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:16,520
And please start

2022
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:19,680
working on the homework
and please practice.

2023
02:33:20,240 --> 02:33:21,600
Okay.

2024
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:24,120
Thanks, everybody,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

2025
02:33:24,120 --> 02:33:27,080
Okay.

2026
02:33:27,080 --> 02:33:35,520
Goodnight, everyone.
