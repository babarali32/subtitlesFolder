1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:12,560
Yeah.

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,160
Let's continue with our selenium classes.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,640
Okay.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,320
I think we have enough people
to get started right now.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,720
Okay. How is everybody doing, guys?

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,400
I hope everyone is doing good.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,080
Everyone is having fun with Selenium,
and I hope everyone

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,960
completed their homework
and everything is working.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,520
Okay, good.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,880
Am I going to share the solution
for the homework

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,240
nowadays?

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,520
I think you guys usually go over those

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,240
on review classes right?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,960
And yeah, there you go.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,000
If you check the syntax syntax students
channel.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,640
Right.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,600
I think everyone is sending their
solutions in there so you can compare

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,720
yours to their.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,440
All right.

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,320
Okay, guys,
any questions from the homework?

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,720
I hope today

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,640
we're going to be more active and active
right.

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,120
Oh, how are you going to know?

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,160
How are you going to know
if that's the right one?

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,560
Okay, guys.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,600
So in coding, there's
no one way of solving something, right?

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,000
There's always different

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,880
different ways of solving something
or coming up with something

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,800
or getting something done.

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,520
Right.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,720
So I think

32
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,720
whichever solution, if you see some guys

33
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,960
made something different,
it doesn't mean yours is wrong.

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,720
Okay.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,600
As long as your solution is working
and there solution is working,

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,160
that means you guys both did a good job.

37
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,560
It's working and that's what it matters.

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,640
You don't think that you're doing
something wrong or you not doing something

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,440
right.

40
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,520
Okay,
so in coding, guys, there's always, always

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
there's you can do it
different, different ways.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,760
Okay.

43
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,320
And we saw it
even last class that you can do.

44
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,280
You can manipulate your list

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,400
with iterator, with four loops,
with the regular, with advanced for loops.

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,800
Right.

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,120
So it all it's all up to you on what

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
what approach you want to take.

49
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,080
Okay.

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,040
So whenever you come up with a solution,
don't think it is the wrong one.

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,200
Okay.

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,680
As long as your code works,
as long as your script

53
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,040
is running, fine, That's what matters.

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,720
Okay.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,400
All right.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,440
Any other questions, guys?

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,080
Yes. It makes a lot easier on
you guys right now.

58
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,160
And even if you find a job, right?

59
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,440
Even when you start working,

60
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,680
you I mean, everyone
has their own approach to solutions.

61
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,520
Everyone have.

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,320
Everyone has their approach
to debug something

63
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,520
or find out the solutions
or find out some mistakes or anything.

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,160
Right.

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,400
So it's not that
there is one way of doing something.

66
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,480
Okay.

67
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,840
So don't be too much worried about.

68
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,000
So that's why we're trying to teach you
some different, different ways

69
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,920
so that if this is does
if this doesn't work, use this one.

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,200
If this one doesn't work, use that one.

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,920
And you should be coming out with
different, different approaches yourself.

72
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
Okay.

73
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,760
All right.

74
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:18,120
Any other questions?

75
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,840
All right.

76
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,360
It's no questions.

77
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,960
Then let's get started with

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,640
with doing a recap from yesterday.

79
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,880
Okay.

80
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,440
So what did we cover yesterday, guys?

81
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,480
Dropdowns.

82
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,160
Right. Okay.

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,120
What do we know about dropdowns? Guys

84
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,440
with covered
dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons.

85
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,080
Right.

86
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
So let's start off.

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,240
Let's start with checkboxes and radio
buttons, guys.

88
00:04:49,480 --> 00:05:06,840
So how do we handle radio buttons
and checkboxes?

89
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,160
Either by clicking or

90
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,480
using the select
plus for checkboxes and radio

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,880
buttons? Guys

92
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,840
only for dropdowns.

93
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,080
Right.

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,840
Okay, so let's talk about checkboxes
and radio buttons first.

95
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,440
Okay. So.

96
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,840
So in the for checkboxes
and radio buttons, what you can do,

97
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,240
you can sort them in the list
and look through them. Right.

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,280
And then given the condition, you perform
some action.

99
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,920
Right?

100
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,640
Or if you have one checkbox
or you have one

101
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,280
radio button, then what you can do is
you could just click on it, right?

102
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,640
Okay. So that was it. It's there's not big

103
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,600
a lot of stuff

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,680
with checkboxes and radio buttons
you can use for loops.

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,200
You can use either.

106
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,560
It's all up to you
how you want to handle it.

107
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,400
Right. So what about dropdowns?

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,240
So we said dropdowns can be handled

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
by either clicking
or using the select class.

110
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,920
Right.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,600
So when do we know that we can use select

112
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,040
class guys

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,960
if we have the select tag?

114
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,320
Right.

115
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,960
So what we need to do,
we need to make sure that the dropdown

116
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,520
we are trying to interact with
it has a select tag.

117
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,400
Only then what we can do is

118
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,240
we can go ahead and use select class.

119
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,560
Okay. How many types of

120
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
of dropdowns do we know guys about?

121
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,400
Two types. Okay.

122
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,520
Which ones?

123
00:06:59,560 --> 00:06:59,880
Okay,

124
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,560
so we have single select dropdowns
and we have multiple select dropdowns.

125
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,480
Right.

126
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,680
So what can we do with multiple select
dropdowns,

127
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,440
which we cannot do with single select?

128
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,080
Am I reading?

129
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,240
Is the video?

130
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay, guys.

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,480
Okay.

132
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,920
Okay, good.

133
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,200
All right.

134
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,760
Okay, guys.

135
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,200
So what we can do with multiple select

136
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,560
dropdowns that we can not do

137
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,520
with single select guys.

138
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,440
Okay, Select multiple items.

139
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,000
That's first. Okay.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,080
What else

141
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
is multiple?

142
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,280
Yes, is multiple is a verification.

143
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,640
It's it gives us the boolean.

144
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,240
If our job down is

145
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,280
multiple, select or no.

146
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,520
Right.

147
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,560
So that's just a checkpoint for us.

148
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,600
Right.

149
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,080
What else, guys?

150
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,480
So let me go in here.

151
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,680
Let's see.

152
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,600
So if I do this and I did this one or

153
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,560
manually,
I don't think you can do this in here.

154
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,240
You can only select manually.

155
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,880
Okay. Okay.

156
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,480
So in multiples, select.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,440
Right In multiple select,
what we can do is

158
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,360
we can disallow some options from the ones
we selected.

159
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,440
Okay.

160
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,680
So if you want to select something
from your selection,

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,160
what you need to make sure
obviously your multiple,

162
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
you need to have a multiple
select dropdown, right?

163
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,520
And only then what you could do.

164
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,320
You can go ahead and select some values.

165
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,120
Okay.

166
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,120
How many ways can we select a

167
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
and option from the dropdown?

168
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,680
Three ways. Okay.

169
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,960
Which are

170
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,760
OC by index, by visible text

171
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,120
and by the value.

172
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Right. Okay.
And what I'd say by the value.

173
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,200
Guys, what are we trying to look for?

174
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,960
What value I would trying to get

175
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,880
the attribute value right.

176
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,800
So we're trying to look for the attribute
which is value.

177
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,680
And we taking that value, right?

178
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,720
There's a lot of values in there.

179
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,640
Okay.

180
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,280
All right, good.

181
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
Any questions?

183
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,320
I hope no one no one is having issues.

184
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,160
Were the chrome drivers. I saw some.

185
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,920
I saw someone mentioned about the updated
update of the Chrome browser.

186
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,560
So if you get it updated guys,
or it gets updated automatically.

187
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,760
Please go ahead and download the right
Chrome driver for the Chrome browser.

188
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
Okay.

189
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,200
So if you have a version 93,

190
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,680
you need a Chrome driver of version 93.

191
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,440
Okay.

192
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,480
All right.

193
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,720
I hope no one is having that problem and

194
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,480
the selenium is running.

195
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,720
Running fine right now.

196
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,160
Okay, good.

197
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,360
All right.

198
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,360
So today, guys,
what we're going to be doing,

199
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,000
we will be going over the alerts
and we will be going over the frames.

200
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,480
Okay.

201
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,440
So I hope you guys did some research

202
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,520
over the frames and alerts

203
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,600
and let me create

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:38,240
a new file in here.

205
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,920
Okay, So I am plus six.

206
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,760
Okay.

207
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,920
So anyone did research on alerts, guys?

208
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:56,440
Let me see.

209
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:07,920
What is alerts, guys,
What do we know about alerts?

210
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,880
Okay, so a small message red

211
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,560
box that gives info for the user.

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,360
It's a pop up message
or it's a pop up window.

213
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,960
Right.

214
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,840
Okay.

215
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,600
A pop ups,
we can use switch commands. Okay.

216
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,200
That's good.

217
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,000
All right.

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,280
So basically, if I go

219
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,640
here and I click on the button, right.

220
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,280
And you can see something pops up, right?

221
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Right on the page. Right.

222
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,160
So this is a pop up,
or you can call it an alert.

223
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,040
Okay.

224
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,200
So it's basically a pop up
and it takes a complete

225
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,400
focus of our main page
that we're working on.

226
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,640
Okay.

227
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,160
And we won't be able to proceed
until it is handled.

228
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,800
Okay.

229
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,160
So if I go ahead and click on
anything on the Web page,

230
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,400
you can see that
I'm not going to be able to do this.

231
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,000
Okay.

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
So unless I go ahead and click okay

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,120
and only then, like

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm going to be able to go ahead

235
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,480
and continue my work on that Web page.

236
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,680
Okay.

237
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,880
So there are different types of alerts.

238
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,600
Okay.

239
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,840
But before we go into that,
let me just put it in here.

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,320
Alert is a

241
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,000
pop up message, right?

242
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,640
Alert

243
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,720
takes

244
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,240
complete

245
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,520
off of our main page

246
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,080
that we are

247
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,240
working on. Okay.

248
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,960
And we cannot

249
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,320
proceed until

250
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,400
it is handled.

251
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,640
Okay. All right.

252
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,720
Three types of alerts. Okay.

253
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,440
What are those guys?

254
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,600
Simple alert.

255
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,360
Prompt, alert and confirmation. Alert.

256
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,960
Okay, so that's actually the subtype.

257
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,840
Okay, so we have an upper level of types
of alerts.

258
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,320
The three that you just mentioned,
simple, prompt and confirmation.

259
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,960
These are the subtypes. Okay.

260
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,600
But there are three types

261
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,720
of alerts.

262
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,520
Okay.

263
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,440
Does anyone know what these are?

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,440
Okay, so web based alerts

265
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,720
is the same thing as browser alerts.

266
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,480
So they're both the same.

267
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,560
And there is a JavaScript alerts.

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,600
And then there's one
which is called Windows based alerts.

269
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,200
Okay.

270
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,200
So there's three types of alerts.

271
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,840
And I'm going to go over those one by one.

272
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:13,880
Okay.

273
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,280
So first we will go over the Web
based alerts.

274
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,040
Okay.

275
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,000
Web based
alerts are also cold as h HTML alerts.

276
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,440
Okay.

277
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,680
So these alerts,
we can simply identify them as elements.

278
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,240
We can simply inspect them
and perform our actions.

279
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,960
Okay. And if I go

280
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,280
to the Facebook page.

281
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,520
Okay.

282
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,920
And I click on Create New Account.

283
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,720
What do we see, guys?

284
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
We see some pop up.

285
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,320
All right. On the page.

286
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,920
And you can see that
the main page is getting disabled.

287
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,240
Okay.

288
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,520
So what you need to do is either
you want to handle all the fields in here,

289
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,800
or you can close this, right in order
to get back to your main page.

290
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,800
Okay.

291
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,520
So the good thing in here is
you can simply go ahead

292
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,960
and inspect this in here
and you can interact

293
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,520
with everything on this pop up. Okay.

294
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,560
That's why it is called web pages
or HTML alerts,

295
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,800
because we can perform our actions

296
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,960
from this selenium

297
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,920
like clicks, sending keys
or performing any other actions.

298
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,480
Okay. Is that clear?

299
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,240
Guys, any questions on this?

300
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,320
Okay.

301
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,840
So we can simply

302
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,360
post facts and perform

303
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
needed actions.

304
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,440
Okay.

305
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,200
So now, guys, the second one is

306
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,640
the JavaScript alerts.

307
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,200
That was for alerts,

308
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,360
which is also called

309
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,840
browser alerts.

310
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,240
Okay.

311
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,760
So here what we need to do in here,

312
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,040
we need to handle this
a little bit differently.

313
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,040
Okay.

314
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,720
We're going to be using some some
different methods which are switched to.

315
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,640
Okay.

316
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
So since

317
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,360
let's go back

318
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,120
and click on one of these.

319
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,680
So since it is taking the complete

320
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,560
focus from our main page,
what we need to do,

321
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,200
we need to switch our selenium focus
to this alert.

322
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,920
And only then we can perform
some actions on it,

323
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,040
and then we can get
a focus of our main page back.

324
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,760
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

325
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,560
And I will be going into details
and we will be writing all the scripts

326
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,760
so that we can get more
and more information on that.

327
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,880
Okay. So we can handle

328
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,560
these alerts by using

329
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,920
switch to method.

330
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,560
Okay.

331
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,160
And what we cannot do in this case,

332
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,680
we cannot inspect a JavaScript alert.

333
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,520
Okay.

334
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,800
So if I click on this,
this thing is not expectable.

335
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,840
Okay.

336
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,280
And if you look at the previous example
that I showed you,

337
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,600
you can simply inspect that pop up
because it's a Web based alert.

338
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:38,960
Right.

339
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,360
So you can expect that
you can perform actions as needed.

340
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,320
Okay.

341
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:51,840
Any questions on this, guys?

342
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,120
And you can see it is outside the browser.

343
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,520
Exactly.

344
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,800
All right.

345
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,640
So let's get back in here.

346
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,920
Right.

347
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,240
So third, third alert in here

348
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,240
is going to be our Windows based alerts.

349
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,360
Okay.

350
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,120
So this alert we cannot handle

351
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,080
with selenium.

352
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,920
Okay.

353
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,520
Because whenever you have a Windows
based alert,

354
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,160
if it is completely different window

355
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,720
from your from your browser. Okay.

356
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,640
And that's why we cannot automate
with selenium.

357
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,280
Okay.

358
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,920
And we set it in our first class
that what kind of application we can only

359
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,840
automate with selenium guys.

360
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,800
We can only automate

361
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,080
web applications
by using selenium web driver.

362
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,040
Okay.

363
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,480
So in here
we having a Windows based pop up.

364
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,600
So we need to use some different tools
so that we can get into that

365
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,240
and we can handle those alerts.

366
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,920
And let me see the easiest one that

367
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,240
let me see if we have it

368
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:28,680
here.

369
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,840
And let's see.

370
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,440
Okay.

371
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,520
So this is this is the one, guys.

372
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,560
So whenever you try to upload any document
in anywhere, right.

373
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,640
So in in any webpage or

374
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,720
you're trying to to upload a picture.

375
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,360
Right.

376
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,240
So when you click on Choose a document
or choose a picture,

377
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,240
then you will see that
this kind of pop up will come up, right?

378
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,920
So that you can go ahead
and choose your picture

379
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,440
or you can choose your document
that you are uploading.

380
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,400
Right.

381
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,000
So as you can see in here,
it is completely different window from the

382
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,480
from the browser.

383
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,040
Okay.

384
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,680
So these kind of pop ups,
they are called as Windows based alerts.

385
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,640
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

386
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:24,120
Any questions?

387
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
Okay, good.

388
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,960
So we cannot handle

389
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,080
with selenium.

390
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,800
All right.

391
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,160
So now we know how to handle the Web based
alerts, right?

392
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,240
Because you can simply inspect
and you can perform any needed action.

393
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,560
We can't really

394
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,640
handle Windows based alerts
unless we using some different tools.

395
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,080
And I'll go over those tools as well.

396
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,280
But mainly we will be handling
JavaScript alerts.

397
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,560
Okay. And

398
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,200
now let's go over the types

399
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:19,040
of JavaScript alerts.

400
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,280
Okay.

401
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,160
So we said that there are three

402
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,120
types, right?

403
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,400
And as I said, guys,
they those three types

404
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,400
that you guys mentioned,
there are subtypes.

405
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,000
Okay.

406
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,200
So main types of the alerts
are these three

407
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,120
and the three that we mentioned before

408
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,840
as simple confirmation

409
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,280
and the prompt alerts,
they are the subtypes of alerts

410
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,520
which are types of the JavaScript alerts.

411
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,640
Okay.

412
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,640
So let me start from here.

413
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,680
Has a killer engineer.

414
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,960
Do we need to learn those tools to be able
to interact with Windows based alerts?

415
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,040
I wouldn't say so

416
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,760
because you can,

417
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,360
but it's it's a whole lot different tool.

418
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,320
Okay.

419
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,520
So if you want to.

420
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,320
So there's two things, right?

421
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,640
So if you are trying to interact
with the Windows based alerts.

422
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,920
Okay.

423
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,880
So either you go ahead
and learning a new tool

424
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,040
or what you can do,
you can just pass that thing manually.

425
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,480
Okay.

426
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,760
If you cannot automated with silly.

427
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,920
Okay. So there's two options.

428
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,200
And these two options are

429
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,640
they depend on how you guys discuss
with your team.

430
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,160
Okay.

431
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,200
But if you learn to interact with Windows
based alerts

432
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
or anything Windows based,

433
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,600
that is up to you. You can do that.

434
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,400
That's additional information.

435
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,800
But as far as I know
and as far as I've seen

436
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,560
in my projects, I have

437
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,600
I have done I have interacted with Windows
based alerts only once.

438
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,680
Okay.

439
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,400
And I have used a different library

440
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,240
from that.

441
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,040
That library comes from Java.

442
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,640
I'll go through it in a little bit.

443
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,760
Okay. Okay.

444
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,520
So the first type of JavaScript
alert is a simple alert.

445
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,800
Okay, Simple alert.

446
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,240
What it does is it pops up.

447
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,680
It gives us some message.

448
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,000
And there's only one button
that we can actually click on.

449
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's a okay button.

450
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,320
Okay, So if I go back in here
and click on alert.

451
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,600
So you can see there is a information
in here, some information.

452
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,640
And what you can only do is
you can click okay in here

453
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,280
and you get back to focus
to the main page.

454
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,440
Okay.

455
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,680
So what we're going to be doing in here,

456
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,520
we will be simply clicking.

457
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,840
Okay. Okay.

458
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,160
So the second one would
be confirmation of alerts.

459
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,480
Okay.

460
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,240
Confirmation alerts.

461
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,000
So this confirmation alert
will have two different buttons.

462
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,120
Okay. One of them is cancel.

463
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,320
The other one is. Okay.

464
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:26,640
Okay.

465
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,880
So and there is a message,
of course, in there.

466
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:36,840
So these kind of alerts, they are mostly
coming up in in like government projects.

467
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,560
Okay.

468
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,320
When you go there, when you just land
on the government project,

469
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,840
that's going to be a pop up, big pop up
saying that you accepted or not accepted.

470
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,960
There are some terms and all that stuff

471
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,000
about some fraudulent stuff, Right.

472
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,280
So if you don't accept it,
then you're going to get redirected

473
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,440
to a different side.

474
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,720
If you accept it, then you can continue.

475
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,080
Okay.

476
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,440
I'm pretty sure you guys have seen
this kind of stuff already.

477
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,280
So confirmation of alert is okay
or cancel.

478
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,280
All right.

479
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,120
So let's go back in here.

480
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,840
Either cancel

481
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,880
or click.

482
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,080
Okay. All right.

483
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,560
And the third one is the prompt alert.

484
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,280
Okay.

485
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,800
So what you can do for prompt alert.

486
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,200
And here you're going
to need to enter some message.

487
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,160
Okay.

488
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,200
So you enter the message
and you click okay, or

489
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
you don't enter anything
and you click cancel.

490
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,240
Okay.

491
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,920
So most of the time
you will be entering some text

492
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,080
and then click, okay.

493
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,960
All right.

494
00:26:50,280 --> 00:27:00,440
So any questions so far, guys?

495
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,480
Any confusion

496
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,160
on that?

497
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,160
So now let's go over

498
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,960
the methods of

499
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,240
how to handle alerts in here,
and then we will dive

500
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,520
into the implementation itself.

501
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
Okay.

502
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,960
So to handle

503
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:30,120
JavaScript alerts,

504
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,560
we only have four different methods.

505
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,480
Okay.

506
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,200
So first one,
if you want to go ahead and click on

507
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,080
and click on.

508
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
Okay. Okay.

509
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,160
There's a method which is called accept.

510
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,960
And then

511
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,600
if you want to click on Cancel,
as we've seen in confirmation

512
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,560
and prompt alerts, what you can do is

513
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,040
you can go ahead and do dismiss.

514
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,440
Okay.

515
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,880
And then

516
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,800
if you go if you want to go ahead

517
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,000
and if we click on this,
there is a message, Right?

518
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,400
So if you want to go ahead
and get that text

519
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,400
and print it out or verify it or

520
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,280
put some conditions in there,
what you can do

521
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,360
is simply get text in here.

522
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,280
And the last one is for the prompt alerts.

523
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,120
If you want to enter something

524
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
in that, if you want to enter any message

525
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,720
or if you want to enter your name,
if you want to enter any text in there,

526
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,440
what you can simply do
is simply send keys.

527
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,640
Okay.

528
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,240
So these are the four methods
that we will be using.

529
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,440
Okay.

530
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,640
Any questions before
we dive into the actual implementation?

531
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:11,880
Guys, for the new program,
the pop up message,

532
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,720
three buttons,

533
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,520
even have three.

534
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,120
When you close any program.

535
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
What all is.

536
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,560
If it's asking if you want to save
or don't save or cancel.

537
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,920
Is that what you're talking about?

538
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,480
No, no, no.

539
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,360
Those are those are
if you are working on the web page

540
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,000
and you see those, then

541
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,880
then you
I mean, I've never seen that before.

542
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,200
If you're working on the webpage,
first of all.

543
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,040
Okay.

544
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,720
If you working on the web page
and it's asking you to save or not,

545
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,440
that's going to be your Web based alert.

546
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,680
Okay.

547
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,360
But if you're working, like,
let's say on Excel or on PDF

548
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,680
or on word,
and you try to save something in there.

549
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,760
Okay.

550
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,000
That way it's completely different

551
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,960
because your application
is not even a web application.

552
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:16,880
Okay.

553
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,080
So that's going to cause that's going to
be considered as the Windows based alert.

554
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,280
Okay.

555
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,560
But if if you have

556
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,720
like online

557
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,360
Excel or online work, you will have a

558
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,120
you will have a Windows
and not Windows based

559
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,600
and you will have a Web
based alert in there.

560
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,440
It's going to ask you to save or cancel
or whatever it is.

561
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,920
It will be a web based alert,
which you can handle

562
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,320
by simply inspecting and performing
any actions you want to perform.

563
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,320
Okay.

564
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,600
What is the switch to method?

565
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,760
We're coming to that point.

566
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Okay, guys,
I'm just going to create a class

567
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,200
and then we will go one by one
and the prompt alert.

568
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,880
One more time, guys.

569
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,160
The prompt alert will have a textbook.

570
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:17,640
Okay, So that you guys can enter
some text in there and then click okay.

571
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,080
Or if you don't want to click anything,
you could just click on Cancel.

572
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,520
Okay.

573
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,640
All right,

574
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,560
So let's get back.

575
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,440
So I'm going to create a new package

576
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,760
and I will create a new class in here

577
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,960
and alerts

578
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,960
main method.

579
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,400
Right?

580
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,680
So go ahead and

581
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,200
get these from your

582
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,960
this.

583
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,440
I'm going to change the URL guys,
and I'm going to send it to you

584
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:35,640
quick right now.

585
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,280
There you go.

586
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,440
So you can use that.

587
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,760
Okay, guys.

588
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,880
So what I want to do in here,

589
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,840
I want to navigate to this website first.

590
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,240
Okay.

591
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,480
What I'm going to be doing,
I want to click on this alert

592
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,640
and then what I want to do,
I want to handle this alert on top.

593
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,240
Okay.

594
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,880
First of all,
what do I need to do in here, guys?

595
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,040
So I, I navigate it to this page.

596
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:20,240
What is my next step, guys,
we need to find that element.

597
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:20,880
Right?

598
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,720
Okay, so I'm going to inspect this page.

599
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,640
Okay, So there we go.

600
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,480
Alert in here.

601
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,560
So this is my alert button,
and it has an ID in here which I can use.

602
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,880
Okay, So I'm going to copy that.

603
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,240
I'd go back in here

604
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,120
and I will have a web element.

605
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Simple alert button

606
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,160
is equal to drive or dot

607
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,960
find element

608
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,360
by ID,

609
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,200
and I'm going to paste that value in here.

610
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,760
Okay, so now what?

611
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,040
I need to perform in here.
What I need to do.

612
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,760
I need to just click on it.

613
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,520
Right. Okay.

614
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,160
So when I click on that button,

615
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,840
what I will see
is this guy over here, right?

616
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,080
And we can't really inspect this.

617
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,120
We cannot do anything
unless we use something

618
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,320
installed inside the Selenium library.

619
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,000
Okay, So in order for us

620
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,760
to handle JavaScript alerts

621
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,120
with selenium,
we will be using alert interface.

622
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,280
Okay. So

623
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:50,520
before I do that,
I need to switch my focus to that alert.

624
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,680
Okay.

625
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,920
So when when our selenium starts
the execution,

626
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:59,240
okay, when we just land on that
on this web page,

627
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,240
I'm going to click on this
and our selenium is going to boost

628
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,200
the focus.

629
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,960
Okay.

630
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,560
So we won't be able
to control any of the elements

631
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,720
unless we until we handle this pop up.

632
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,720
Okay.

633
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,160
So I need to switch my selenium focus

634
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,760
to that alert and how I'm going to do
this is pretty easy.

635
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,320
So going to be doing driver that switch to

636
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,680
and then I'm switching to alert.

637
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,200
Okay.

638
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,200
Is that clear guys?

639
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,360
That this is how we switch our focus
to alert.

640
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,680
Okay.

641
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,800
So whenever we switch

642
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,240
our focus to alert what we get in return

643
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,160
is the object or a variable

644
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,400
of an alert interface.

645
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,840
Okay, so what I can do in here,

646
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,280
I can do alerts.

647
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,360
Simple alert

648
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
is equal to driver.

649
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,440
Switch to an alert.

650
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,200
Okay.

651
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,400
And import the class from selenium guys.

652
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,720
So here I have a variable

653
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,280
which switches to that specific alert.

654
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,480
Okay.

655
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,480
And we don't really have to specify
which alert we want to switch to

656
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,320
because you handle the alerts
only one by one.

657
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,600
And whenever you have one alert.

658
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,400
You can't go really anywhere
without handling it.

659
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,280
Okay.

660
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,800
And there is no way of specifying
which alert you want to handle

661
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,120
because you will be handling each
and every alert one by one, one at a time.

662
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,440
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

663
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:03,440
Any questions?

664
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,040
All right.

665
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,160
So seems like no questions. Right.

666
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,880
So on line 18, what we did was switched
our selenium focus to an alert.

667
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,720
So now what I need to do,

668
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,200
I need to click okay in there.

669
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,520
Right.

670
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,200
Because it's a it's a simple alert.

671
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,960
There's nothing you can do in here.

672
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,640
So in order for us to click, okay,
what we going to be doing,

673
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,800
we will be using an accept method, okay,

674
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,080
which will be coming from alert interface.

675
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,280
So what I will do in here?

676
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,600
Simple alert dot accept.

677
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,440
Okay.

678
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:52,960
And let me actually give it a pause
in here so that we can see visual Li.

679
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,040
What is going on on the page?

680
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,600
Okay.

681
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,520
Any questions before I run this?

682
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,640
Guys?

683
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,040
Okay, so let me run this and see

684
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:20,520
what's going to happen.

685
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,880
There we go.

686
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,760
There's alert and then the alert is gone.

687
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,560
Because what we did is
we handled that alert.

688
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,960
We clicked on. Okay.

689
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,680
And you can see here the message
that it says you have clicked on.

690
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,520
Okay, button in alert window.

691
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,280
Okay.

692
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,320
Any questions, guys?

693
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,920
I hope you guys had the same output
in here.

694
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Whoever is running their code

695
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,360
and here

696
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,480
for handling

697
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,040
simple alerts

698
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,480
and here

699
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:12,520
switching, switching

700
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,160
office

701
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,520
alert, you didn't get this message

702
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,520
in here.

703
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,800
Maybe you did something wrong.

704
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,400
Check. Check your intelligence.

705
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,400
Maybe there is an exception or anything
popping up

706
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,640
in your console.

707
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,040
Now, if you clicked on,

708
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,120
okay,
you should be receiving this message.

709
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,720
Okay.

710
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,320
Give it some time.

711
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:54,640
Okay.

712
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,440
So give it some pause time
because it's probably too fast.

713
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,200
Line 1617.

714
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,840
We're clicking on this alert button, guys.

715
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,520
Okay.

716
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,320
On this one.

717
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,920
And once this is appear

718
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,320
on line 18, where switching our focus

719
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,320
to that alert in here

720
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,480
and online 20, we're clicking.

721
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:39,600
Okay, so offering your rings.

722
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,440
Okay that's good.

723
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,600
All right, guys, any issues?

724
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,080
Is anything going on
that you guys are confused

725
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:56,320
with? And

726
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:16,360
go back to the code here, Right here.

727
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,480
It's got a pop up in the bottom.

728
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,120
What kind of pop up
did you get in the bottom?

729
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,320
Send us the screenshot
so that we can see that.

730
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,120
All right. So

731
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,680
okay, guys.

732
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,840
So no questions for simple alerts.

733
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,600
And now let's go ahead and

734
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,320
deal with a different alert,
which is our confirmation of alerts.

735
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,200
Okay.

736
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,040
So once I dealt with the simple
alert in here, what is my next step, guys?

737
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,720
So I have this.

738
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,960
We clicked.

739
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,080
Oh, you just have a net.

740
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,480
Okay, that's fine.

741
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,840
That's fine.

742
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,320
Okay.

743
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,840
All right.

744
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,000
So whenever we click or whenever

745
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,760
we handle the

746
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,720
the pop up by using selenium

747
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,760
guys,
it will we switch to an alert first, guys.

748
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,240
But whenever we handle it, the selenium

749
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,480
will automatically switch
back to the main page.

750
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,520
Okay?

751
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,840
So we don't have to do it manually.

752
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,360
Okay.

753
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,720
So whenever we handle them alert,
we're already on the main page.

754
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,200
We can perform any actions, but

755
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,000
we can perform any actions on the buttons,
on the text boxes or anything in here.

756
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:57,760
Okay.

757
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,040
So we don't have to go back and switch
our focus to the main page manually.

758
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,200
Okay, so now what I need to do,
I need to find this

759
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,240
confirm element and then click on it.

760
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,520
Right. So here, there is an idea.

761
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,120
All right,
so I'm going to copy this ID value.

762
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,800
I'm going to go back to our code
and I will start to find that element.

763
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:24,440
Right.

764
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,160
So let's say for

765
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,280
alert button

766
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,600
is equal to driver

767
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,400
element

768
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,440
I.D. again

769
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,360
and then

770
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,040
with simply click on that button.

771
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:48,800
Right?

772
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:59,240
So after we click on it, guys,
what do we need to do?

773
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,600
So, okay, guys,

774
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,480
do you have to do this switch process?

775
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,920
Always if you have one multiple,

776
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,440
multiple pop ups in one execution,
you don't.

777
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,320
Okay.

778
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,560
But in this case,
I will be doing different, different

779
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
switch to methods

780
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,800
so that you guys can understand
what is going on.

781
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,400
Okay, so since we already
have this in here, we can we use this?

782
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,600
Okay, but
I'm not going to be doing this right now

783
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,320
so that you guys get in a use
of switching to alerts.

784
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,040
Okay. Is that clear?

785
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,000
Guys,

786
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,120
any questions on this?

787
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,560
So whenever you have an alert,

788
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,000
what you want to do, you want to switch?

789
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,880
Okay.

790
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,520
All right. Yes.

791
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,800
So that you can do accept exactly.

792
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,840
Or dismiss. Yes.

793
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,040
So in this case, what I'm going to do
and here I'll have alerts

794
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,560
confirm alert is equal to driver

795
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,040
dot switch to

796
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,600
alert. Right.

797
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,640
So we switch to confirmation
alert right now.

798
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,320
So now what I want to do in here, guys,

799
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,320
I don't want to click on Accept.

800
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,800
I want to click on Cancel.

801
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:41,360
But before I click cancel,
I want to get this information

802
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,720
from the from the pop up.

803
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,480
Okay.

804
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,080
So what
I am going to do in here, simple, right?

805
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,400
What I am going to do in here,

806
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,200
I need to call my variable,

807
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,240
right
confirm, alert and simply get that text.

808
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,240
Okay.

809
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,360
And what? This is going to return
me, guys.

810
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,280
What am I getting in return?

811
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,400
I'm getting a simple strength
value, right?

812
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,480
So I can say alert text in here is equal

813
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,080
to information alerts that get text.

814
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,120
So once I get the text,
let's print that text out in here.

815
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,320
And now after I print it out,
what I want to do,

816
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,800
I want to click on Cancel
and how I'm going to do this.

817
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,120
I'm going to just click on Confirm
alert that

818
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:45,120
this Miss.

819
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,000
Why do we need to text?

820
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,480
Why do we need to get the text?

821
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,200
You mean

822
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,720
it's just I'm showing you how to do it.

823
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,920
Okay.

824
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,640
I'm showing you the methods
that I mentioned before in here.

825
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,560
Okay, so right now
we covered accept, dismiss, get text,

826
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,880
and in the next one,
we will be covering the sent teams.

827
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,480
Okay.

828
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,800
All right, guys.

829
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,000
So before before we handle an alert,

830
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,280
what I want to do after I click

831
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,680
on confirm alert

832
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,960
button,
I want to have a clause of our execution

833
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,800
so that we can visually see
what is going on.

834
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,040
Okay, so I'm running this right now.

835
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:45,440
So let's see what we're going to have.

836
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,080
Okay.

837
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,720
This is first alert.

838
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,120
This is the second alert.

839
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,000
Okay.

840
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,480
Well, there's something going on in here.

841
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:13,680
Let's go see what's happening.

842
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,960
See in here.

843
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,520
There's nothing happening in here.

844
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:31,760
Okay.

845
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:43,040
See, they didn't even print it out.

846
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,680
Oh, yours is working.

847
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,800
Okay.

848
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,400
Oh, good.

849
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,440
Okay, so that means there's
something going on with mine.

850
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,320
Okay,

851
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,240
So after I click this.

852
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:10,000
Okay, so I'm waiting for 2 seconds.

853
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,120
Okay, so let's. Let's try again.

854
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,560
Okay, guys, let's see.

855
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,760
There's probably something wrong
with this website.

856
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,200
Let's run
this and see what's going to happen.

857
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,920
Yeah,
this website is a little weird, guys.

858
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,800
And there is there's one thing
that is not at all in here.

859
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,520
Oh, there we go.

860
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,480
Okay, now it's working.

861
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,960
Okay, So now it works.

862
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,240
And we can see that
you press cancel on confirm window.

863
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,240
Okay, so there's probably
something wrong with the website I'm

864
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,480
not sure what is going on, but this

865
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,800
sometimes this website acting up really

866
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,760
in a weird way.

867
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah.

868
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,400
The website the website needed in that

869
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,000
you have some inappropriate ads

870
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,200
that's that's
actually based on your search.

871
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,120
Michael Okay, so

872
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,800
sorry.

873
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:20,960
Sorry.

874
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,080
Michael That

875
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,000
okay, I think Michael left

876
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,960
that computer, okay.

877
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,200
That computer is strictly for Java.

878
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,800
Okay. Okay.

879
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,040
I see.

880
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:56,080
All right, I

881
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,240
Fergus, any questions on how to handle

882
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,880
the confirmation alert,
how to get the text and how to

883
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,880
click on cancel?

884
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:19,200
Guys?

885
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,400
Yeah, you look for Michael Doubter.

886
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,520
Okay.

887
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,400
Okay.

888
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,360
All right,
so now let's go ahead and take a look

889
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:42,880
at the scene, okay?

890
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,120
Andre, you have.

891
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,920
Okay, Please, guys, take a look at the

892
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,840
what's called

893
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,120
Take a look at the error
that Andre is getting right now.

894
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,680
So if you look into it, it says

895
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,680
element click intersected, guys.

896
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:02,720
Okay.

897
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,000
So let me explain that what that means.

898
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,560
I hope you guys already know, but I'm
going to get some more clarity on that.

899
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,280
Okay.

900
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,160
So does anybody know what that means?

901
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,440
Actually, before we go on

902
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,480
element click Intercepted,

903
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:27,560
guys.

904
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,920
Almost taken like football, almost.

905
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,640
Elizabeth That's a very,
very good choice actually.

906
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,720
So sometimes, guys, when we run right now,
when I run

907
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,000
my browser is not maximized.

908
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,040
Sometimes your

909
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,160
your page

910
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,240
and your elements may get onto each other.

911
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,760
And whenever you're selenium
clicks on one of them,

912
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,760
they it may click on a different element
because they are intercepting each other.

913
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,080
Okay.

914
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,080
So whenever you have
this kind of exception, what you want to

915
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:09,640
do, you want to maximize your window
so that it is full screen

916
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,440
and you can see all the elements
separate from each other.

917
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,440
Okay.

918
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,920
So that that would be one of the things
that I would suggest to do.

919
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,800
Okay.

920
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,480
All right.

921
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,600
So now let's go ahead and

922
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,600
do a prompt in here. Right.

923
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,960
Enter some tax click. Okay.

924
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,160
So hello, how are you today?

925
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,520
We're doing that.

926
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,640
Okay. It works. Okay. Nice.

927
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,280
All right.

928
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,120
So now what
do I have to do in this case, guys?

929
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:45,720
So we will handle the simple alert.

930
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,080
We handled the confirm our alert.

931
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,640
So now it's time for us
to handle the prompt alert.

932
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,440
Right.

933
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,640
So locate the prompt element in here.

934
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,080
All right, We have this prompt. I'd.

935
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,120
So I'm going to copy that value.

936
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,360
Go back,

937
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,600
create a variable

938
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,680
prompt alert button

939
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,720
is equal to try for dot

940
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,120
element and I'm finding this by ID.

941
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:29,920
You place that idea here.

942
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,440
So now

943
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,040
alert click.

944
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,160
So after we click, let's give

945
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,080
it ten more seconds

946
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,600
right?

947
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,360
Yes, I'm using it a lot
because that's the reliable one.

948
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:50,840
Okay.

949
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,920
And you guys,
I know you guys already know how

950
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,200
to use different locators.

951
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,680
Okay.

952
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,920
So we're given a pause in here so that
we can see visually what is going on.

953
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,160
So now what I need to do next, guys.

954
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,160
So I clicked on the prompt alert button.

955
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,040
What is my next step?

956
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,760
Send keys.

957
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,720
Where

958
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,840
we need to switch first.

959
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,400
Right? Exactly.

960
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,520
So what I need to do, I need to do driver

961
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,320
that switch to an alert in here.

962
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:37,000
And what I can do is here.

963
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Prompt alert is equal to

964
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,360
switch to alert.

965
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:41,880
Right.

966
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:46,160
So now what I want to do,
I want to enter some text

967
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,200
and then what I want to do,
I want to click.

968
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,400
Okay.

969
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:50,880
All right.

970
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,840
So here prompt, alert

971
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,480
dot simply sent keys.

972
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,160
What do we want to send in here, guys?

973
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,560
Any suggestions?

974
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:09,840
Let's see.

975
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,440
Hello, world.

976
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,280
Not that naughty Michael.

977
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,480
Nice.

978
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,320
Okay, that's a good.

979
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,880
Okay. Asghar is king.

980
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,880
Okay. Asghar is king. Okay.

981
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,960
There you go.

982
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,160
All right, let's do this.

983
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:36,720
And then what I want to do,
I want to simply accept this.

984
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,960
Oh, he doesn't want to fight me.

985
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:54,760
Did you guys ask?

986
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,960
Want to dance? Battle instead? Okay.

987
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,920
Challenge accepted.

988
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,840
Okay.

989
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:17,040
All right, guys, let's draw on this
and see what's going to happen.

990
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,400
What accepts

991
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,200
what it does.

992
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,480
Okay, So let it finish right now.

993
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,240
Okay, guys.

994
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,840
So this website, I told you
guys, it's acting a little weird, right?

995
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:41,080
So when we clicked on Prompt,
you didn't really see how it answered it.

996
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,000
Okay.

997
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,840
But you can see that we clicked on.

998
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,400
Okay.

999
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,680
And it's displaying our

1000
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,560
what's called our text.

1001
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,680
Right? Exactly.

1002
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,800
So that should be our output
because we are entering this output.

1003
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,840
Okay.

1004
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,760
So okay guys, so accept
we'll go ahead and click on.

1005
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,360
Okay on the pop up.

1006
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,080
Okay. This is what it does.

1007
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,000
Okay.

1008
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,160
So you can't just use the click or any

1009
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,800
or submit in this case from selenium
that we've done so far.

1010
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,360
You have to do accept
or if you want to click on cancel

1011
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,120
or you have to click,
you have to go with dismiss.

1012
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,480
Okay, Any questions, guys

1013
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,720
and alerts

1014
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,640
click okay is accept.

1015
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,720
Okay, click.

1016
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,480
Cancel is dismiss.

1017
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,640
Let's
actually put this in the notes. Okay.

1018
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,880
So you could do click.

1019
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,400
Okay. Is

1020
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,480
or let's put it in here

1021
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,120
click okay

1022
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,640
dismiss it will click

1023
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,920
transfer.

1024
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,520
All right.

1025
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:24,160
Any questions, guys?

1026
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:40,200
Anything that you guys are confused with?

1027
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,640
Okay seems like no questions.

1028
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,560
So now use

1029
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,720
use another website

1030
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:55,480
if applicable.

1031
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,320
Yes, I'll give you
I'll give you a homework. Okay, guys.

1032
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,920
So you can work on on a different website
with with alerts.

1033
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,760
Okay.

1034
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,960
That that one is is is good

1035
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,040
we use switch method.

1036
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,200
Yes. So you don't every time since

1037
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,240
since we have this

1038
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,200
or since we have one switch.

1039
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,440
That is enough.

1040
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,600
Okay so here I am
just differentiating the variable names.

1041
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,320
Okay guys.

1042
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,200
So that's why I'm using
so that you guys can practice

1043
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,320
because this is the first time
we're doing this.

1044
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,440
So that's why
I'm switching to an alert every time.

1045
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,440
Okay,

1046
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,600
So, okay, so explain to switch again.

1047
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,200
Sure. So why are we switching in here?

1048
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:04,320
Okay, so whenever we click on this button,
there is an alert popping up, right?

1049
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,920
So and right now
I am clicking on different different

1050
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,240
buttons
in here, and it's not working. Why?

1051
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,280
Because my focus is taken by this alert.

1052
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,080
Okay, So I have to handle this alert first

1053
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,800
in order
for me to continue on this web page.

1054
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,040
Okay.

1055
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,640
So I need to click on. Okay in here.

1056
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:33,840
But in selenium, in order for you
to switch your focus, you will have

1057
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:39,120
to have this method of switch too,
and you have to switch to alert.

1058
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,840
Once you've done
that, you need to perform an action.

1059
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,520
It's either accept or you can dismiss

1060
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,440
according, right.

1061
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,040
So once you've done
that, you can go ahead and continue

1062
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,400
any actions
that you need to perform on that webpage.

1063
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,560
Okay.

1064
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:03,960
All right.

1065
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:13,080
Any other questions, guys?

1066
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:13,440
Okay.

1067
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,160
If no questions,
I have a question for you.

1068
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,120
So If you see guys in here,

1069
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,680
I got the text and I sent keys.

1070
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,560
What is the difference between this

1071
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,120
and the
ones that we used to do before guys?

1072
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,480
So we used to send keys

1073
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,080
on username password, we used to click,

1074
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:41,720
we used to get text from any
like from last time we did

1075
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,240
was the values from the dropdown.

1076
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,320
Right So what is the difference between

1077
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:53,040
this get text
and the one we've done yesterday?

1078
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,080
And what is the difference between
this keys which we used to do before?

1079
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:09,920
Guys,

1080
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,160
this is almost yes.

1081
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,720
So this is this sent keys

1082
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,680
and this get text
is coming from an alert interface guys.

1083
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,200
Okay because you cannot use the get text

1084
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,920
or send keys from the previous examples

1085
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:35,120
because those are coming
from the web driver.

1086
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,320
Okay.

1087
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,600
And those are given
only to interact with the web elements.

1088
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,320
Okay.

1089
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,560
But this is a JavaScript alert.

1090
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,840
This is not a web element.

1091
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,240
Okay, guys.

1092
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,360
So that's why we need different

1093
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,360
methods from

1094
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,920
an alert alert interface
so that we can use

1095
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:03,040
those get text
or whenever need to send keys.

1096
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,040
We use it from there.

1097
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,600
Okay. Any questions?

1098
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:31,520
Is that clear, guys?

1099
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,840
Okay, good.

1100
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,280
So let me see.

1101
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:38,880
So eight, ten right now.

1102
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,640
Okay, so let's take a 15 minute
break, guys, okay?

1103
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,400
And then we'll come back.

1104
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,160
We'll go over some more

1105
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,960
alert stuff

1106
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:51,280
sent. Keys is not working for you.

1107
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,280
You don't see the text itself, right?

1108
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,680
Yeah, that's the website problem.

1109
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,160
Okay, So that's the issue from there.

1110
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,920
From the web page itself,

1111
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,040
other types of commands or

1112
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,200
there are four types of commands
for alerts, right?

1113
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,120
Accept, dismiss, send keys and get text

1114
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,720
and we will be learning
more, more of commands.

1115
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,960
We will be

1116
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,480
interacting with multiple windows.

1117
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,560
Okay.

1118
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,720
And with some different

1119
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,920
what's called elements.

1120
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,480
And we will be performing different
actions actually on the web elements.

1121
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:45,960
Okay, I'll push the code
at the end of the class, guys.

1122
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:51,560
Okay.

1123
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,400
So we import

1124
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,920
you won't be able to import it
automatically.

1125
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,200
I mean, you can, but

1126
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,640
when when you don't have this.

1127
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,640
Okay, So this is not going to compile.

1128
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,760
So when you hover over in here, guys,

1129
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,840
it's going to say add exception

1130
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,680
to method signature.

1131
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,920
Okay? So you click on that.

1132
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,560
It's going to throw that exception
right away in here

1133
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,920
and it's going to compile it right?

1134
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:28,920
Fine.

1135
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,800
Any other questions,

1136
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:46,840
guys?

1137
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,080
You have every every class you start

1138
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,040
with, you need to
when you write your script

1139
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,520
and something doesn't compile,
you will have to import

1140
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:06,200
those libraries.

1141
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:11,080
All right, guys.

1142
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,840
Okay, let's see. Eight, 12.

1143
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,440
So let's come back at 830.

1144
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,120
Okay.

1145
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,000
So time for you to.

1146
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,080
Type everything and get some break.

1147
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:28,040
Okay?

1148
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:28,400
All right.

1149
01:07:28,400 --> 01:25:10,680
I'll see you 30 guys.

1150
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:38,240
All right, guys, let's get back.

1151
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:38,720
All right, guys.

1152
01:25:38,720 --> 01:26:01,360
Let's see how many people we got.

1153
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,080
Okay.

1154
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:06,000
All right, so let's see.

1155
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,040
Okay, guys.

1156
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:12,440
So we have covered the JavaScript
alerts, right?

1157
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,280
We know about simple.

1158
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:18,120
We know about confirmation alert,
and we know about prompt alerts.

1159
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:18,680
Right?

1160
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,080
So there's one more alert
that I want to show you

1161
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,040
which you won't be really facing
in regular basis.

1162
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,000
It's really up to the project, right?

1163
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:33,240
Well, whatever you're working on and the

1164
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:38,040
configurations and all the requirements
depending on that.

1165
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:38,720
Right.

1166
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,600
So sometimes when you just navigate
to the website that you want to perform

1167
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:48,200
some actions, you will get an alert,

1168
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,680
which is called an authenticate alert.

1169
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,200
Okay.

1170
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,680
So let me actually show you what it is

1171
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,520
now. Okay.

1172
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,040
Let's see

1173
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:08,200
here.

1174
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,120
Oh, okay.

1175
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,680
So I think I've already signed in in here.

1176
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:17,240
So what's

1177
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:23,760
this here?

1178
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,520
Okay.

1179
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:28,360
See, guys, when I just try to

1180
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:32,480
navigate to this web page,
what it's asking

1181
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:36,000
me, it's asking me
for my username and password.

1182
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:38,720
Okay? We didn't click on anything.

1183
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,000
We didn't do anything.

1184
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:44,760
What we did,
we just navigated to this website.

1185
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:45,840
Okay?

1186
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:51,800
And for us,
in order to handle this of alerts,

1187
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,480
we won't be really using
the alert interface.

1188
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,320
Okay, so we just need to pass the username
and password in here,

1189
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,840
but we're going to be doing it
a little bit differently.

1190
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:05,520
Okay.

1191
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:09,680
We won't be using any cent keys
or we won't be switching

1192
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,080
our focus to the alerts.

1193
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:18,120
Okay, So let me open a new class in here

1194
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,600
and say

1195
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,480
authentication alert

1196
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,600
here and

1197
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,360
we need to change our law.

1198
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:52,800
Okay.

1199
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,040
And I'm going to send you the URL here.

1200
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,560
My chats.

1201
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,880
Okay, So now we have our you.

1202
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:07,800
While we don't, we're simply navigating
to that web page and it's right away

1203
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:12,920
asking us for the username and password,
what it's asking us for those credentials

1204
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:20,080
in a alert, in the alerts,
what's called safe.

1205
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:20,680
Right.

1206
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:26,200
So what we're doing in here, we're
not going to be using any alert interface.

1207
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:28,920
We're not going to be switching
to that alert.

1208
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,360
But we are going to manipulate is our

1209
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,880
is our your zero.

1210
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,640
Okay.

1211
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:40,080
So after the steps, after the slashes,

1212
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,320
but before the actual web

1213
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,560
page, you are in here,
what we're going to do?

1214
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:50,880
We will be passing the username
and password.

1215
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,920
Okay, so this is how we're going to do it.

1216
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:55,800
So let

1217
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,440
this here.

1218
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,560
So what you need to do in here

1219
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,560
before this website name starts, right?

1220
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,920
The URL starts
what you can do, you can pass

1221
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:16,320
the username,

1222
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:20,760
you can put a column in here
and you pass the password.

1223
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:25,680
And then after you did that,
what you can do, you can put an ad sign

1224
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,800
and then the rest of your zero.

1225
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:35,600
Okay, So in this website, the username
and password is admin and admin.

1226
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,800
Okay,
so what I am going to do in here guys,

1227
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:44,640
I will start putting my username in here,
which is admin,

1228
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,880
and then I'll put a call in and here

1229
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:52,520
I'll put my password as admin as well.

1230
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,400
And I will put the at sign.

1231
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,000
Okay.

1232
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And the rest of the URL stays the same.

1233
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,040
Okay.

1234
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:04,680
So I'm going to run this here
and let's see

1235
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:13,640
what happens.

1236
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:14,160
Okay?

1237
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:19,320
Now getting we're not going to be able
to see that pop up as well in here

1238
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,720
because everything we are entering
is inside the URL.

1239
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,000
So that's going to get

1240
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:27,160
what's called

1241
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,440
it's going to get logged in really fast.

1242
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:34,200
But what we are going to be seeing in here
that we have

1243
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:36,400
proper credentials in here,

1244
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:39,960
is that clear, guys?

1245
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,480
So sometimes guys, sometimes

1246
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:46,400
you might get a question
or a question in the interview

1247
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:51,760
that, hey, let's say you have a pop up,
but it's an authentication pop up.

1248
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
How would you handle those?

1249
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,720
Okay, you could just say them, Hey, okay,
we have a username and password.

1250
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:00,800
What we're going to do with it just simply

1251
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,280
pass them inside the euro

1252
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,600
and just navigate to that

1253
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,560
or what's called navigate to that URL

1254
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:15,160
and that's it.

1255
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:15,760
Okay.

1256
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:27,720
Any questions?

1257
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:28,960
Can I put it in the notes?

1258
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:35,600
Sure.

1259
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,760
To handle authentication alerts

1260
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,200
when the to pass

1261
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,400
username and

1262
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,080
password in the store.

1263
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:54,120
Okay.

1264
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,120
Okay. So

1265
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,640
let's actually get

1266
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:15,280
this is an example.

1267
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,320
There you go.

1268
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:18,280
Okay.

1269
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:30,760
Any other questions, guys,
before we move forward,

1270
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:35,520
how would you to handle the alerts?

1271
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:40,760
How would you handle the authentication
alerts?

1272
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:41,040
Yeah.

1273
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,080
When you run it with selenium,
when you run it with your automation

1274
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,960
script, you want see
how it's going to input the credentials.

1275
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:52,160
But when you do it manually,
you will see the actual alert in there.

1276
01:33:52,320 --> 01:34:00,720
Okay.

1277
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:01,080
Okay.

1278
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:05,320
You want to you want to
you want the interviewer to do that.

1279
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:13,800
Okay, try that.

1280
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,080
All right, guys, if there's no questions.

1281
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:16,520
Okay.

1282
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:22,200
Let's jump on to the next topic that
we need to cover today, which is crimes.

1283
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:23,320
Okay.

1284
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,800
So did anyone do any research on frames?

1285
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,840
Guys, what do we know about?

1286
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,080
Frames?
What are the frames on the web page

1287
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,720
and how do we handle those frames?

1288
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:50,280
Guess.

1289
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:57,600
See, frames

1290
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,200
divide our screen,
our web page into multiple.

1291
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:04,560
Okay,

1292
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:19,280
what else?

1293
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,680
Let me see, what else do we know?

1294
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:24,600
Guys are frames and I have friends.

1295
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,760
Okay?

1296
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,360
They have their own methods.

1297
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:39,720
Okay, What else?

1298
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,600
Okay, we need to switch.

1299
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:42,840
Okay?

1300
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:50,520
We need to switch to methods. So.

1301
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:54,840
Okay, guys, so frames on the web page

1302
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:58,280
are the separate windows.

1303
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:01,200
Okay, so

1304
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,560
frames are separate

1305
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,800
and independent windows on our web page

1306
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:13,320
and they allow developers to present

1307
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:16,480
multiple views on one page.

1308
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:18,640
Okay.

1309
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:21,120
So let me show you

1310
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,800
if I had it here

1311
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:47,280
and models, they should be

1312
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:48,720
here.

1313
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:51,640
It's not safe and there should be frames

1314
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,320
one way here.

1315
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,880
Let's see. Okay.

1316
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:57,840
This is great.

1317
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:58,200
Okay.

1318
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:02,400
There we go.

1319
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,000
Okay, guys. So if you look

1320
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:09,880
on this page, okay,

1321
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,320
so I have one page in here,

1322
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:17,640
and I have two more something on in here.

1323
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:24,960
Right? So.

1324
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,040
But we can do this.

1325
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,240
Okay? Now, I don't need to adjust it
now. Okay?

1326
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:33,840
So and you can see I can independently
go through this page, right.

1327
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:36,400
Go through this separate screen.

1328
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:41,400
And here is well,
I can go through this as well.

1329
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:44,360
So these are

1330
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:49,920
these are different and separate views
that developers build

1331
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,160
so that we can
so that they can have multiple different

1332
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:00,200
views and pages on one single page.

1333
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:01,080
Okay.

1334
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,160
So and in order to handle these,

1335
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,640
we actually need to switch on those.

1336
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:10,080
Right?

1337
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:14,280
And we have a couple of different methods
to handle these frames

1338
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,640
and we will be going over those
in a minute.

1339
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,840
Okay.

1340
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:22,160
So let me go back in here.

1341
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,360
Okay.

1342
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:28,040
So frames, so frame

1343
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,440
frame is in

1344
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:36,640
separate

1345
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,600
independent window

1346
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:45,640
in our web page

1347
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:51,440
and frames.

1348
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:54,600
I'll defer to

1349
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,440
represent multiple

1350
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,080
SKUs on

1351
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:10,760
one page.

1352
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:11,120
Okay.

1353
01:39:11,120 --> 01:39:14,280
So as we can see here, we have one

1354
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:18,200
big main page and can have here.

1355
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,280
There is one separate page

1356
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:24,720
and there is the second separate page
that we have in here, right?

1357
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:26,960
So Web page.

1358
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:29,440
Another Web page. Yes,
we can say that. Yes.

1359
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:32,880
But this this view is a smaller view.

1360
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,480
Right.

1361
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:37,160
So this is not going to be a main view
because main view

1362
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:40,160
is going to be the one
we just navigated to.

1363
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,000
Okay.

1364
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:44,200
So it's basically a nested
separate window.

1365
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:47,240
Okay.

1366
01:39:47,240 --> 01:40:00,880
Any other questions, guys?

1367
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:11,520
See, when you have navigation, no doubt
those are different.

1368
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,560
Those are different.

1369
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:18,560
The ones you talking about that
are you talking about these kind of menus,

1370
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:21,840
the navigation that you can

1371
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:33,160
navigate to different from there?

1372
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:37,520
If you're just talking about
the navigation panel that has like pages

1373
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,560
and everything that you can navigate
to a different page from there.

1374
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:45,000
That's Now this is
this is a little bit different case.

1375
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,040
Okay, This is a computer.

1376
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,040
Those are just links, right?

1377
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:54,720
So you click on those, it's free to read,
redirecting you to a different page.

1378
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:55,560
Okay.

1379
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:59,480
But here
you have a completely different view

1380
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,240
on the same web that we just navigate.

1381
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:07,120
Okay.

1382
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,160
As frames accessible within our web

1383
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:13,680
page. Yes.

1384
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:17,800
These these web page, these frames,

1385
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:21,440
they are interactive all

1386
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,520
like Web elements.

1387
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:25,440
And I'll show you how to interact
with them in a second.

1388
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:26,760
Okay.

1389
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:31,080
So let me go back in here.

1390
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:35,880
So there three ways to interact
with frames.

1391
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,160
Okay.

1392
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:40,200
So three ways to

1393
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,120
interact with

1394
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:46,760
frames in here.

1395
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,520
Look of them.

1396
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,600
The first one is by index

1397
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,360
by index,

1398
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,320
the second one is going to be by name

1399
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:05,720
or idea, and then the third one

1400
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:09,800
is going to be by

1401
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,560
web elements.

1402
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:14,120
Okay, so three ways to interact

1403
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,720
with the frames.

1404
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:19,400
Okay. All right.

1405
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,400
So as I said, guys, so frames are given

1406
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,600
us four to have different views
on the same web page.

1407
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:27,040
Right.

1408
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,600
And as we can see in here, as we can see

1409
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:33,840
in here,
that it is completely different view.

1410
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,840
It is completely a different Web site. So

1411
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:41,640
if we want to interact with the

1412
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,040
with the elements inside the frame,

1413
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:50,400
then what we need to do,
we need to switch to that frame first.

1414
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:53,840
Otherwise you won't be able to interact

1415
01:42:54,040 --> 01:42:57,480
with any of the elements inside the frame.

1416
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:57,960
Okay,

1417
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:07,360
sure.

1418
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:08,400
There you go.

1419
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:09,960
Yeah, I frame and frame there.

1420
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:15,600
Both say, okay.

1421
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:18,720
All right, so let's go ahead and

1422
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:23,040
start looking into the frames okay,

1423
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:31,720
so what I can do in here.

1424
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:36,280
So as you can see on this web page,
you see this frame

1425
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,360
and there is a text box in here, right?

1426
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:42,160
So how do we know that it's an eye frame?

1427
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:43,000
Guys,

1428
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:47,960
what you can do
is whenever you inspect the page

1429
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:51,840
and you open the selector box and here
what you can do,

1430
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,560
you can put the double slash
and you can do.

1431
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,120
And I frame.

1432
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:59,560
Okay, so in this page you can see that

1433
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:03,760
we have 13 frames on this single page.

1434
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:04,840
Okay?

1435
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,000
So those eye friends,
it's going to have its own view.

1436
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,680
It's going to have its own

1437
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,640
they're going to have their own elements.

1438
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:15,840
They're going to have their own buttons
and everything.

1439
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:16,680
Okay.

1440
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:19,680
Because it's separate
view from the main page.

1441
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:20,440
Okay.

1442
01:44:20,440 --> 01:44:25,440
So what we are going to do in here,
we will be interacting with the one

1443
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:29,280
with the first one in here
and will be entering

1444
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,640
some text inside this

1445
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,160
text box. Okay.

1446
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:38,040
So let's go ahead and

1447
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:45,560
a class.

1448
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,800
That button right corner.

1449
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:49,520
Which one

1450
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:58,720
you talking about?

1451
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:05,040
This.

1452
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:12,600
Send me the screenshot
so that I can see what it is.

1453
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:15,600
Okay, so let's create a class in here

1454
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:18,280
and say handling

1455
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:27,120
frames.

1456
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:32,880
Oh, now that one, this is,
this is actually the how

1457
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,120
this is from CSIS.

1458
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:39,640
And as you guys remember
I told you guys, CC

1459
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,760
is configured and it's

1460
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:45,360
what's called

1461
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:48,440
it is manipulated by developers, right?

1462
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:54,240
They add margins, they add padding,
they add orders to the what to elements.

1463
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:54,520
Right.

1464
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:58,560
So if you can see
if you see this button in here,

1465
01:45:58,720 --> 01:46:00,840
it has a basic authentication

1466
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:03,840
or what's called text,

1467
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,680
but it also has that black font,

1468
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,840
a black what's called

1469
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,680
border in here as well.

1470
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:12,080
Okay.

1471
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:15,360
So everything that is you see in here,

1472
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:20,160
it is configured and manipulated
by developers through this CE.

1473
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:31,440
SS Okay.

1474
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:31,920
All right.

1475
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:35,880
So let's have this here

1476
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:45,240
we okay, guys, question for you.

1477
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:48,880
Can we have two main methods
in the same class guys

1478
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:53,520
so that we can execute

1479
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,360
two different tests?

1480
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:07,080
Now, why not?

1481
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:09,240
What would be the reason that we want?

1482
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:10,520
We can have this

1483
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,520
open and

1484
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:24,360
have only one execution.

1485
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:24,920
Why not?

1486
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,600
Is Well, you

1487
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:31,920
the word is main, okay.

1488
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:33,800
But it's just a is just a method.

1489
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:35,160
Right guys

1490
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,320
the in

1491
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:42,680
another okay

1492
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:45,840
with overwrite each other

1493
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:48,120
you can overload it. Okay.

1494
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:52,000
Now I'm saying that
can we have this same exact main method

1495
01:47:52,240 --> 01:47:55,320
in the same class guys?

1496
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:03,040
Why not?

1497
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,400
You guys know how to create
regular methods, right?

1498
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:09,360
So this is a method as well

1499
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:15,880
of just one public method.

1500
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:31,440
So one class allows only one public
method.

1501
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:39,840
Okay, guys, this is one of the interview
questions actually.

1502
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,120
Why can I not have

1503
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:49,160
two main methods in the same class?

1504
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:50,840
What do you want? Execute.

1505
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,840
Why is it not going to execute? Guys,

1506
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:55,600
what kind of error am I getting?

1507
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,800
Okay, we're getting closer.

1508
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,600
It's going to give
an error. What kind of error

1509
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,000
is the same parameter?

1510
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,640
Okay, guys,

1511
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,280
anything else

1512
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:22,120
and method?

1513
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:29,400
Yeah, I know Google said that. Yes.

1514
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:32,120
Okay, guys, you can have that.

1515
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:34,560
You cannot have

1516
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:39,280
two same methods in the same class. Why?

1517
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:44,800
Because it's not going to compile.

1518
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:45,640
Right?

1519
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:48,560
So if I have the same

1520
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:52,880
your real variable guys,

1521
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,040
the same string, is it going to work?

1522
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:01,680
No. Right.

1523
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,720
Is the same

1524
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,880
variable different

1525
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:10,400
what's called different values,
But it's not to work

1526
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:13,360
because it's not going to compile. Right?

1527
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,520
It's already been defined. There you go.

1528
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:19,160
So methods and main
method is the same thing.

1529
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:22,560
If I have another main
method inside my class.

1530
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,280
What's going to happen
is it's not going to compile guys.

1531
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:29,960
Okay, so your Java is going to get

1532
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:35,600
really confused which one to execute.

1533
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,040
Okay.

1534
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,360
It will not get compiled, guys.

1535
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,680
That's the answer you should be

1536
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:45,880
giving whenever you have an interview
with this kind of question.

1537
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:49,680
Okay, So are you saying

1538
01:50:49,680 --> 01:50:52,480
that you can overload it or you can

1539
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,840
you you won't be able to override it?

1540
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,680
That is correct.

1541
01:50:56,680 --> 01:51:01,080
But the reason we can't really have this

1542
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,920
two times in one class

1543
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:08,560
is that it's not going to compile.

1544
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:09,360
Right.

1545
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:15,880
Okay.

1546
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,200
Yes, that is overloading.

1547
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:20,760
But I'm asking if I asked

1548
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,800
if you have exactly same right.

1549
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:27,360
So you will get a compile time error.

1550
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:29,760
Okay.

1551
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:32,880
So we will be okay.

1552
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:35,640
Let's continue
with dealing with friends now.

1553
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:36,760
Okay.

1554
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,080
So navigating to that website

1555
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:44,360
and try to we will be trying to

1556
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:50,320
access this textbox and we will be

1557
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:55,160
entering some text.

1558
01:51:55,160 --> 01:52:00,720
So what I'm going to do first in here,
what I'm going to do, I will be

1559
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:05,120
finding this text box element in here.

1560
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:07,800
Okay?

1561
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:11,600
And I have this text box
which has an idea of name.

1562
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:14,040
Okay? And I'm going to copy this ID

1563
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:20,160
and I will go back to my script
and I will identify it here.

1564
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:21,560
Okay.

1565
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:26,320
Web element,

1566
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:30,120
text box.

1567
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:34,600
Okay is equal to driver the find element

1568
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:41,200
by d, which is name here.

1569
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:45,400
And then what do we want to pass
in that text box?

1570
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:48,600
Guys?

1571
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:55,200
What is the text that we want
to send in here?

1572
01:52:55,200 --> 01:53:01,800
Any suggestions?

1573
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:02,320
Okay.

1574
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:08,640
Again, again,

1575
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:15,400
Michael.

1576
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:17,680
Okay. Give the people what they want.
Okay?

1577
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,600
Okay. Sounds good.

1578
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:22,520
Okay, let's do this.

1579
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,320
Let's do this.

1580
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:28,880
Michael is let's do probably

1581
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:31,640
something, right?

1582
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,840
Okay, Let's do this.

1583
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:35,520
We're not sure
yet. Okay, so let's do this.

1584
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:37,440
All right, So let

1585
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:40,440
me run
this and see what's going to happen.

1586
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,640
Okay? So

1587
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:57,120
running this.

1588
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:58,520
Okay, we're here.

1589
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:01,440
So now as we can see,
there's something going on

1590
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:05,360
in our console.

1591
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,720
Okay, so let's take a look at

1592
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:11,960
what is going on in here.

1593
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:15,880
Okay?

1594
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:17,200
And here

1595
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:21,000
I am getting and no such element
exception.

1596
01:54:21,720 --> 01:54:22,360
Okay.

1597
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:25,000
Why am I getting that?

1598
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:27,160
Because I can't find that element.

1599
01:54:27,160 --> 01:54:30,960
But if you look in here, I have
this ID as a name

1600
01:54:31,080 --> 01:54:36,520
and ID is the most reliable attribute
right?

1601
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:41,200
When you get no such element exception,
that means that it's not even on the web

1602
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:41,880
page, right?

1603
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,280
You can't even find this kind of element.

1604
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,280
Okay.

1605
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,960
So when you are

1606
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,880
getting these kind of exception guys,

1607
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:55,640
you need to check on your locator

1608
01:54:55,960 --> 01:55:00,360
and you need to check
if you have a frame inside your web page.

1609
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:01,800
Okay? Why?

1610
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,880
Because it's that element that you're
looking for inside the Web page.

1611
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:09,480
Your selenium will not seed at all

1612
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:13,160
unless you switch to that frame.

1613
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,600
Okay.

1614
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:17,120
Is that clear, guys?

1615
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,760
Your selenium will not see that element

1616
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:24,600
inside the frame until you switch to it.

1617
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:25,200
Okay.

1618
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:28,480
So that's why
we know that there is a nice frame in here

1619
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:34,320
and you can see that this is the IV frame
and our element is inside it.

1620
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:38,640
Okay,
So what you need to do in order for you,

1621
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:42,800
for your selenium to see this element,
what you need to do,

1622
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:46,080
you need to switch to this IV frame

1623
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:51,360
first. So

1624
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:54,720
here what I'm going to do

1625
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:59,720
in here before I find this okay,

1626
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:05,720
before I find this, what I need to do,
I need to switch to that frame

1627
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:11,400
and then find that element
and then perform actions.

1628
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:12,280
Okay.

1629
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:16,280
So pretty similar
to what we've done with alerts.

1630
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:20,240
I am going to do that switch,

1631
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:24,040
but this time I'm switching to a frame.

1632
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,720
And if you look in the in the frame
method,

1633
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,440
there's three different frames in here.

1634
01:56:32,680 --> 01:56:35,040
Okay, so

1635
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:38,760
what kind of what's called
what kind of methods

1636
01:56:38,760 --> 01:56:43,200
are these guys?

1637
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:46,240
So I have three exactly same methods,

1638
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,440
but I have different parameters in here.

1639
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:53,080
What kind methods are these?

1640
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:57,120
They are overloaded methods, right?

1641
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:59,520
Exactly.
Because they have different signature.

1642
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,880
One of them except integer one of them,
except strength.

1643
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:03,840
And one of them.

1644
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:06,480
Except the web element.

1645
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:09,520
Okay,
so this time I'm going to be using the one

1646
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:14,840
which accepts the eight integer
and we will be going through the

1647
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,160
indexes.

1648
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:17,880
Okay.

1649
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:21,920
So this is the first,
as you can see in here,

1650
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:27,360
this is the first frame that I found
and this is the first frame that I need.

1651
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:28,160
Okay.

1652
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:30,520
So what I am going to do

1653
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:34,640
if we're talking about the coding
index is guys,

1654
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:41,400
where do we start from?

1655
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:43,800
We start from zero, right?

1656
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:48,240
So here what I'm going to do,
I'm going to put a zero in here.

1657
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:53,760
We switch to the frame
which has an index of zero,

1658
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:57,480
and then we start to find the element

1659
01:57:57,600 --> 01:58:03,040
and then we paste some element
or we input some text in there.

1660
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:06,440
Okay, So let me run this

1661
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:15,800
and see what

1662
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:20,960
we're going to have.

1663
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:21,960
There we go.

1664
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,800
So what happened?

1665
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,120
We have a text in here right now.

1666
01:58:26,120 --> 01:58:30,360
So what we did
is, was switched to that frame

1667
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:36,200
and then we found that text books and we
entered the text that we wanted to enter.

1668
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:43,240
Okay, Am I saying,

1669
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:46,480
oh, you mean I frame inside the I frame

1670
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:50,040
Exactly. Yes.

1671
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:53,200
That can
be the that can be the probability.

1672
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:56,720
Yes, you can have that sometimes. Okay.

1673
01:58:56,720 --> 01:59:02,040
So it all depends on how your developers
build your web page.

1674
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:10,560
Okay.

1675
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:11,520
Frame section.

1676
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:17,640
Yeah.

1677
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:18,800
Okay, guys.

1678
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:22,360
So here what we did,
we switched to a frame.

1679
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,160
We found the element, and what we did,

1680
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:29,080
we input some text.

1681
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:34,160
Okay.

1682
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:47,040
Any questions on this, guys?

1683
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:53,840
Okay, let's see.

1684
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:58,800
Okay, so you guys are entering htp s okay,
so just do a step.

1685
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:03,280
Okay, guys.

1686
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:07,880
So how did we know it's the zero index?

1687
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:11,400
Because if you in here I wrote the iframe

1688
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:14,960
and if I go to the next I frames,

1689
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,480
they are different or they are hidden.

1690
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:24,760
Okay So and if you look at the first one,
this is what we need.

1691
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:26,120
Okay?

1692
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:30,520
So if this is what we need, that means

1693
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:34,680
if we go back to the scripting,
our indexing is starting from zero.

1694
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:37,720
Okay, So the first iframe on the web

1695
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:40,680
page is going to have index of zero.

1696
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:44,040
So this is how we determine
if it's index zero.

1697
02:00:44,640 --> 02:00:52,240
Okay.

1698
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:57,040
Once we are in the frame,
we need to exit, I'm coming to that point.

1699
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:05,280
Okay.

1700
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,560
So I look at the one of 13 meaning.

1701
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:08,840
Yes, correct.

1702
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:13,320
That is correct.

1703
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:13,720
Okay.

1704
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:17,880
So there guys, when we switched

1705
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:22,680
inside the frame, right into the frame
and we performed some actions.

1706
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:26,400
So here, guys,
this is a little bit different.

1707
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:29,600
Then we handled the alerts. Okay.

1708
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,120
In here, what we need to do,
we need to switch back our focus

1709
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:38,400
to the main page so that we can continue

1710
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:41,400
working on different elements.

1711
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:46,920
Okay, so in iframes, it's
not going to switch automatically because

1712
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:50,160
because we don't know that

1713
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:53,400
Sylvania will know if we have finished our

1714
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:57,360
our actions inside the iFrame.

1715
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:02,440
Okay, So we need to tell our selenium
that, hey, okay, I switched to the frame,

1716
02:02:02,760 --> 02:02:05,520
I switched to the frame,
I performed my actions.

1717
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:08,760
Now I'm going back to the main page.

1718
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:09,760
Okay.

1719
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,000
And how we're going to do
this is pretty easy as well.

1720
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:17,120
So after we perform
all the actions inside the frame,

1721
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:21,720
what I will do,
all the driver that's switched to

1722
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:25,200
that default content.

1723
02:02:25,600 --> 02:02:29,040
Okay,
so we're switching to a default content,

1724
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:32,760
which means we're switching
back to the main page.

1725
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,920
Okay.

1726
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:43,560
Is that clear, guys?

1727
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:55,080
Okay, good.

1728
02:02:55,080 --> 02:03:00,840
Yes, it will move to the main page
regardless of how you are.

1729
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:05,600
If are inside the two frames
or it doesn't really matter.

1730
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,560
Three five.

1731
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:11,760
If you are switching the default content,
that means you're switching your focus

1732
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:15,200
completely back to the main page.

1733
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:22,240
Okay, Back to the main page, correct?

1734
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:30,120
Yes. Any other questions,

1735
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:37,160
guys?

1736
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:39,600
It seems not so.

1737
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:42,680
Let's continue here.

1738
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:45,440
So let's actually do this.

1739
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:49,040
So when we were dealing with alerts, okay,

1740
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:52,040
so we had this button,

1741
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:55,360
so let's actually click on it

1742
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:58,440
before we switch to the default content.

1743
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:02,160
Okay, So let me run this

1744
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:05,320
and see what

1745
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:07,680
exceptions or what errors
we're going to get

1746
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:18,160
running this.

1747
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:19,280
Okay, We have a text.

1748
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:24,240
And now if you look here,
we're getting an exception again,

1749
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:27,000
and it's the same exception that we got

1750
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:30,240
before before we switched to the frame.

1751
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:30,720
Right?

1752
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:34,520
So we're getting no such element
because we're trying to locate

1753
02:04:34,800 --> 02:04:37,800
this simple alert button,
which is this one.

1754
02:04:38,080 --> 02:04:41,520
Okay, so why are we getting that
exception, guys?

1755
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:51,080
Why can't we just click on this alert?

1756
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:53,600
Because we are inside the frame.

1757
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:58,760
So in order to do so,
we need to get back to the main page

1758
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,680
and get our focus back to the main page.

1759
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:04,840
Right. Okay.
So how are we going to do this?

1760
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:09,840
We be just switching
to the default content, right?

1761
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:13,040
So let's run this again, see

1762
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:28,200
if this is going to work.

1763
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:28,960
Yeah.

1764
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:32,960
Now we switched back
or we clicked on alert button

1765
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:37,560
and you see that we have this alert pop up
coming out for us.

1766
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:38,640
Okay.

1767
02:05:38,640 --> 02:05:44,160
Any questions, guys?

1768
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:46,400
From France to alerts?

1769
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:49,120
Yes. So ifs okay.

1770
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:50,200
So here's

1771
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:51,960
what you're

1772
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:54,720
going to have to have in order to do so.

1773
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:00,040
So when you switch inside the frame
and you click on the button,

1774
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:03,240
which gets you that alert,

1775
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:06,360
only then you can switch
directly to alert.

1776
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:10,000
Okay, So let's say I have this

1777
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,160
iframe and I have a button in here.

1778
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:14,640
If I click on that button

1779
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:19,320
and it gives me that pop up,
only then you can switch to that alert.

1780
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:24,200
But here we have to switch back
and then click to that button.

1781
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:30,280
Okay.

1782
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:30,960
All right.

1783
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:47,640
Any other questions, guys, there?

1784
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:49,360
Okay, guys, give me one second.

1785
02:06:49,360 --> 02:06:50,640
I'll be right back.

1786
02:06:50,640 --> 02:07:17,360
Okay?

1787
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:21,480
Okay.

1788
02:07:21,480 --> 02:07:24,120
I'm going to scream out like that.
Okay? Not yet.

1789
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:25,440
Not yet. Okay.

1790
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:28,320
We got what is this, six class?

1791
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:30,080
We've got five more classes.

1792
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:35,040
Probably After that, we'll see.

1793
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:36,120
Okay, guys.

1794
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:39,720
All right, let's continue.

1795
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:40,080
Okay.

1796
02:07:44,520 --> 02:07:45,600
How to move?

1797
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:48,480
Okay, so if you have a frame

1798
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:51,520
inside, the frame

1799
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:54,120
and you moved to

1800
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:59,160
so you have a parent frame
and then you have a child's frame, right?

1801
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:04,880
So if you are inside the child's frame
and what you have to do, you have to move,

1802
02:08:05,320 --> 02:08:07,920
you have to switch to the parent first

1803
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:10,360
and then you have to go to the child.

1804
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:14,520
And if you want to move back,
what you want to do,

1805
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:18,920
you can do the exact same thing in here.

1806
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:23,360
Okay, So let's say the parent child
has an index of zero and you'd

1807
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:26,400
child frame.

1808
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:29,640
It has it has a index of one.

1809
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:30,600
Okay.

1810
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:35,760
So you move from zero, you move to
zero first, then you move to one.

1811
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:39,280
And then if you want to go back,
you just switch to zero.

1812
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:45,560
Okay?

1813
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:46,920
Is that clear? Guys?

1814
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:57,640
Any questions?

1815
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:00,720
So it all depends on how it's structured.

1816
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:02,760
Okay. So let's say

1817
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:07,440
if you have a zero and you

1818
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:12,360
have five different frames inside it,
then you can jump from 0 to 5.

1819
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:18,120
Or if you have a grandparent,
parent, child, grandchild,

1820
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:20,960
then you won't be able to switch it
right away.

1821
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:25,480
Okay, So you have to switch one by.

1822
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:38,600
So it all depends on hierarchy
of the frames.

1823
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:41,840
No, we won't be
we won't be dealing with nested frames.

1824
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:42,720
And I don't think

1825
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:47,800
even when you start working guys,
you won't be dealing with nested frames.

1826
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:48,760
Okay?

1827
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:54,560
The maximum amount of frames
that the maximum amount

1828
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:58,560
nested frames you will see is one
you were going to have one frame

1829
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:03,360
and you might have another frame inside
that frame.

1830
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:04,360
That's it. Guys.

1831
02:10:04,360 --> 02:10:08,320
You want have like five different frames
inside each other.

1832
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:11,880
Okay,
So that doesn't really make sense to build

1833
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:18,320
actually.

1834
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:21,880
All right. Okay, guys.

1835
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:24,240
So now let's continue.

1836
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:29,520
So this was one of the ways
of how to handle the frame, right?

1837
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:33,880
So let's go ahead and do the second way

1838
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:37,040
of handling the frame and switching

1839
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:40,560
to a frame by name or IP.

1840
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:41,280
Okay.

1841
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:45,240
So let me go back
here and let's take a look

1842
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:48,160
in here, guys.

1843
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:53,280
So this is my frame, right?

1844
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,080
So this is my frame.

1845
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:59,080
What kind of attributes
do I have right now for this?

1846
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:00,040
I frame

1847
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:10,240
you have

1848
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:12,840
we have name, right?

1849
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:15,600
And we also have the source,

1850
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:21,000
right So we used the indexing.

1851
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:24,720
So now what I can do in here,

1852
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:28,760
I can use the name value to identify

1853
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:30,920
this frame, because

1854
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:36,480
in here,
the second way of handling the frame

1855
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:41,440
we set, we, we switch it by name or I.D.

1856
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:42,480
Okay.

1857
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:45,280
So if you look inside of frame right now

1858
02:11:45,480 --> 02:11:49,800
or if you look into the other frames
and you see name or I.D.,

1859
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:54,840
you can grab those values
and you can switch to that.

1860
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:57,040
I frame by those values.

1861
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:57,800
Okay.

1862
02:11:57,800 --> 02:12:01,440
So right now what I am going to do here,

1863
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,920
I'm going to copy this name value.

1864
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:07,440
Okay? Go back.

1865
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:10,560
And what I will do, I will switch

1866
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:15,120
back to the same eye frame.

1867
02:12:15,520 --> 02:12:19,680
But this time
I'm going to be using the other method

1868
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:24,400
which accepts the string value
for the name or item.

1869
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:26,320
Okay, so what?

1870
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:32,760
I will do a paste that in here.

1871
02:12:32,760 --> 02:12:33,200
Okay.

1872
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:36,080
And then what I'm going to do and here I'm

1873
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:38,760
going to copy this web element, right?

1874
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:42,960
Because we already that
and we identified that element.

1875
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:46,600
And then what I will do, I will simply

1876
02:12:49,600 --> 02:12:51,600
send something else in here.

1877
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:55,760
So let's just put syntax.

1878
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:59,240
It's not like there's not like this

1879
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:02,160
syntax.

1880
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:03,840
That's okay.

1881
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:07,640
So now, guys, what we do in here,

1882
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:10,760
we switch to the frame by index.

1883
02:13:10,920 --> 02:13:14,040
Well, identify that text box, we

1884
02:13:15,120 --> 02:13:17,080
send some text in there,

1885
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:21,360
we switch back
and we don't need this, right?

1886
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:24,840
Because if we click on it,
our focus is going to be gone

1887
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:27,840
and we switch back to default.

1888
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:32,680
Now we're switching back to that frame
but in a different way.

1889
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:37,600
And then we are inputting
some different text in here as well.

1890
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:42,480
Okay, So run this and see

1891
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:50,600
what's going to happen.

1892
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:51,840
Name and ID?

1893
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:54,760
Yes, they're both reliable when it comes

1894
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:58,640
frames.

1895
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:01,200
Okay, What happened, guys?

1896
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:05,000
So right now
we enter two different texts in here,

1897
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:09,000
so we should probably delete
the first one.

1898
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,680
Right? So we already had that text.

1899
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,960
We switched back to the main page
and we switched back to the frame

1900
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:19,240
and we just continued adding more text.

1901
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:21,320
Right? So it added both

1902
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,240
text right now.

1903
02:14:23,240 --> 02:14:25,920
So before we

1904
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:30,640
add any text, after the first one,
what we want to do,

1905
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:35,600
we want to clear it first.

1906
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:35,920
Right?

1907
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:38,720
Okay, so clear it first and now

1908
02:14:39,080 --> 02:14:41,160
let me run this and see

1909
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:45,480
if we just have second

1910
02:14:45,480 --> 02:14:54,200
text right?

1911
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:54,840
There we go.

1912
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:58,800
So we had the first one
switching back and forth inside the frame.

1913
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:03,760
And then what we do
is we clear the first text that we entered

1914
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:06,840
and now we only have the second text.

1915
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:09,480
Okay, Any questions, guys?

1916
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:10,680
Any questions?

1917
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:16,000
How to handle the frames
and how to switch by index or by name.

1918
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,800
All right, you guys

1919
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:26,920
okay?

1920
02:15:27,080 --> 02:15:30,360
No questions. Good.

1921
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:46,680
So let me see.

1922
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:50,800
Okay, so now what I want to do,

1923
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:53,920
I want to switch to that exact

1924
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:57,160
frame by the Web element.

1925
02:15:57,160 --> 02:15:57,840
Okay?

1926
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:03,200
So that means whenever I want to switch
to a frame and I use this method,

1927
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:18,920
what do I need to pass
inside the parameter It's guys.

1928
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:21,360
So whenever I'm switching to a frame.

1929
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:26,080
Okay, so in this case,
if I'm switching by web element.

1930
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:28,200
What do I have to pass in here

1931
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,240
at two big values in here?

1932
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:48,120
Anything else, guys?

1933
02:16:48,120 --> 02:16:49,040
Name of the frame.

1934
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:53,600
We just press that in here right?

1935
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:56,000
The tag. Okay.

1936
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,720
The web element.

1937
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:58,600
Right, guys?

1938
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:01,200
So whenever we identify and I frame

1939
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:05,800
right, whenever we identify the frame,
first of all,

1940
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:10,480
I frame is what I frame
is a web element as well.

1941
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:11,800
Right?

1942
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:14,400
So it has these attributes in here.

1943
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:16,440
It has an IV frame tag.

1944
02:17:16,440 --> 02:17:21,760
So what we can do, we can identify this
as all other elements, right?

1945
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:26,440
You can write a next path, you can write
a CSR, you can find it by name.

1946
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:28,760
Okay?

1947
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:32,400
So whenever you do that,
what are you getting in return?

1948
02:17:32,520 --> 02:17:36,320
You getting a web element variable, right?

1949
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:38,400
As we've done in textbooks.

1950
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:41,280
This is a web element, right?

1951
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:44,600
So you can you can find that frame

1952
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:48,680
exactly
the same way how we did it for textbooks,

1953
02:17:48,680 --> 02:17:53,480
because I have frames our web
elements on the web page as well.

1954
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:54,680
Okay.

1955
02:17:55,160 --> 02:17:58,600
So what I will do,
I want to write a next for syllabus.

1956
02:17:59,080 --> 02:17:59,640
Okay.

1957
02:17:59,640 --> 02:18:02,880
So we know that this is the frame
that I'm looking for right now.

1958
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:08,600
So what I am going to do
is I'm going to start writing my stuff.

1959
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:11,160
How would I start my relative X
path in here?

1960
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:23,040
Guys?

1961
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:26,760
Double slash. Okay, double slash.

1962
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:31,520
I frame right,
I have frame and then square brackets

1963
02:18:32,080 --> 02:18:35,280
I want to use the source attribute is it

1964
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:45,240
possible guys.

1965
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:47,440
Okay, so we can do that. Right?

1966
02:18:48,920 --> 02:18:50,600
Source

1967
02:18:51,360 --> 02:18:53,200
is equal to

1968
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:57,160
we have this slash demo dot page send out.

1969
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:58,680
All right. There we go.

1970
02:18:58,680 --> 02:19:04,320
So it's one of one
that means that I iframe is unique

1971
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:08,840
and what I am going to do, I copy this

1972
02:19:09,760 --> 02:19:14,160
and I will store this inside the web
element.

1973
02:19:14,160 --> 02:19:14,520
Right.

1974
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:19,080
And say that this is a frame.

1975
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:21,920
Frame element is equal to driver,

1976
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:28,160
but find element by X path, right?

1977
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,600
So we have an X path in here.

1978
02:19:30,600 --> 02:19:31,800
So now

1979
02:19:32,800 --> 02:19:34,360
what I need to do,

1980
02:19:34,360 --> 02:19:38,640
I need to simply switch to that frame.

1981
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:42,000
Right. So here driver,

1982
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,800
switch to the frame.

1983
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:48,200
So this time it's going to be a web
element.

1984
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:52,360
Okay, so what we need to pass in here
a web element object.

1985
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:56,360
Okay, So here
what I'm simply going to pass is

1986
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:00,240
frame element that we just identified.

1987
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:04,240
And now what I'm going to do

1988
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:09,760
is clear this and I will

1989
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:17,680
enter some different

1990
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:19,520
text things here. Okay.

1991
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:21,840
So let's run this and see

1992
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:35,200
if we have the last text.

1993
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:39,160
And there we go.

1994
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:40,440
Yep, I did.

1995
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:43,640
I think I did clear the previous text,
but what is going on?

1996
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:45,520
So there is something going on.

1997
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:48,000
It says no such element exception.

1998
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:51,280
So it can't find our X5.

1999
02:20:51,480 --> 02:21:02,000
Why guys,

2000
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,880
what is the issue in here?

2001
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:11,240
We need to switch back to the default
and then switch back to the frame.

2002
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:12,400
Right. Exactly.

2003
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:19,960
So after we entered these right,
what we need to do,

2004
02:21:20,520 --> 02:21:23,080
we need to switch back

2005
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:29,000
to the default content

2006
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:33,640
and then it's going to
I'm going to be able to

2007
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:38,120
I identify this element,
switch back to that frame,

2008
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:41,520
clear the text, and then enter our

2009
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:44,640
new text right. So

2010
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:48,400
we're in

2011
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:54,280
a move line.

2012
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:55,320
Yeah, it will.

2013
02:21:55,320 --> 02:22:02,320
If you don't switch the default content
and you remove line 31,

2014
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:08,000
is that what you meant?

2015
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,400
Yes, it will work.

2016
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:14,280
You will just identify this element,
I mean this frame, right.

2017
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:18,080
But you're not performing any actions
and then what you are doing,

2018
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:21,280
you are just

2019
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:24,920
what's called you
clearing that textbox again and you are

2020
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:36,880
entering a new text into.

2021
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:40,920
All right, guys,
any questions on how to handle alerts,

2022
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:43,680
how to handle the frames

2023
02:22:59,120 --> 02:22:59,800
online?

2024
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:04,920
31 Yes, I use the frame element variable
that I created online.

2025
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:09,120
30 Okay,
so this is how I identified that frame,

2026
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:12,240
because the frame is the web
element as well,

2027
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:17,840
right?

2028
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:19,480
Let me find that.

2029
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:21,320
Let me find the X path again.

2030
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:24,120
Okay, So the X path, we go

2031
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:27,280
double slash
and we start with the eye frame.

2032
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:29,760
Okay?

2033
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:31,520
And start with the eye frame.

2034
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:34,800
So now square brackets, right?

2035
02:23:34,800 --> 02:23:37,400
I want to use the source

2036
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:39,680
attribute in here.

2037
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:41,080
So add

2038
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:45,600
as our C is equal to single quotes

2039
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:48,720
and do

2040
02:23:49,480 --> 02:23:54,240
slash demo that HTML.

2041
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:54,840
Okay,

2042
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:58,440
you take this value,

2043
02:23:58,440 --> 02:24:10,440
you just put it in here
and it should work.

2044
02:24:10,440 --> 02:24:13,240
Yes. Switching back
and forth inside the frames,

2045
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:16,560
it requires a little more attention. Okay.

2046
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:19,840
So let me actually put it in here. Okay.

2047
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:23,400
So in alerts, guys, how do we switch?

2048
02:24:24,080 --> 02:24:26,840
So how do we switch to an alert

2049
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:32,840
and how do we switch back guys?

2050
02:24:32,840 --> 02:24:38,160
So in alerts, so we manually

2051
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,520
switch to the to an alert

2052
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:49,680
and automatically switch
back to the main page right?

2053
02:24:49,680 --> 02:24:53,000
So switch

2054
02:24:55,080 --> 02:24:56,800
manually

2055
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:59,480
to alert and

2056
02:25:03,640 --> 02:25:07,440
automatically back.

2057
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:08,120
Right?

2058
02:25:09,160 --> 02:25:11,320
And in frames guys

2059
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:17,480
in frames, we switch it manually, right?

2060
02:25:17,480 --> 02:25:20,360
We switch to an to a frame manually

2061
02:25:20,480 --> 02:25:24,920
and we switch back to the main page
manually as well.

2062
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:26,200
Right?

2063
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:30,920
So manually to frame

2064
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:35,840
and switch

2065
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:38,920
manually

2066
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:42,120
back to the

2067
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:45,120
main page.

2068
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:45,720
Okay.

2069
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:53,600
All right.

2070
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:56,280
Amber of selenium. Okay,

2071
02:25:57,320 --> 02:26:00,440
good.

2072
02:26:00,440 --> 02:26:02,200
Selenium is easy, guys. Okay.

2073
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:05,680
So this is an easy subject that I
that I chose.

2074
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:07,640
Okay.

2075
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:12,680
Java is really,
really difficult to explain.

2076
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:13,080
Okay.

2077
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:17,760
So let me put one more interview question
for you guys.

2078
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:19,920
Okay.

2079
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:23,040
So sometimes in the interview,

2080
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:27,120
you get to ask how you handle the alerts.

2081
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:34,480
Okay, So this is an interview question.

2082
02:26:34,480 --> 02:26:36,800
How do you handle

2083
02:26:39,560 --> 02:26:43,000
alerts in selenium?

2084
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:48,840
Guys?

2085
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:50,040
Any guesses?

2086
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:52,200
How do we handle alerts in selenium?

2087
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:53,760
How would you answered this question?

2088
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:56,560
I'm your interviewer
I'm asking you this question.

2089
02:26:56,560 --> 02:27:04,960
How would you
how do you handle alerts in selenium?

2090
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:07,680
Switch to OC?

2091
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:16,360
What else?

2092
02:27:16,360 --> 02:27:18,840
By using alert interface.

2093
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:22,080
So if you say that that is enough.

2094
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:27,520
OC So when you when your interviewer
is a technical person

2095
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:31,520
and they're asking you how do you handle

2096
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:34,840
alerts in selenium, you can just tell them

2097
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:38,000
I'm handling alerts

2098
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:42,120
by using alert interface, okay?

2099
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:44,520
And you can actually ask them if they want

2100
02:27:46,520 --> 02:27:49,320
more information or if they want

2101
02:27:50,040 --> 02:27:53,560
if they want to know on methods
that I can use, Then

2102
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:57,600
if they say yes, then you can go ahead
and start telling them why

2103
02:27:57,960 --> 02:28:01,080
we're going to be switching to that alert
and then we can accept,

2104
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:05,640
accept, dismiss, get text or send keys.

2105
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:06,600
Okay.

2106
02:28:07,600 --> 02:28:09,120
You deserve a shot now. Yeah.

2107
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:11,920
There you go.

2108
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:14,080
Okay, so with handle

2109
02:28:16,440 --> 02:28:17,640
alerts

2110
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:23,040
by using alerts interface.

2111
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:26,920
So if we go back here, where is alerts?

2112
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:30,720
So let me actually open this up.

2113
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:36,040
So if I open up this alert guys
alert interface so you can only see

2114
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:39,720
there is four different methods in here

2115
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,840
and that set, there's
nothing else in here.

2116
02:28:44,200 --> 02:28:48,080
Okay, So just open

2117
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:52,360
the declaration for alert interface
and you can see that there's this maze.

2118
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:56,280
There is, except there's get text
and there is send

2119
02:28:56,800 --> 02:29:00,240
methods in here
and there's no other methods whatsoever.

2120
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:07,320
And okay.

2121
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:19,640
Any questions, guys?

2122
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:35,960
No questions.

2123
02:29:35,960 --> 02:29:38,560
Okay. So let me see

2124
02:29:43,320 --> 02:29:44,200
what I

2125
02:29:44,200 --> 02:30:32,560
have here.

2126
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:33,280
Okay, guys.

2127
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:36,800
Seems like that's what I have for today.

2128
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:42,080
And let's get let's get your homework.

2129
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:45,600
Okay. So

2130
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:48,800
get you some tasks

2131
02:30:48,800 --> 02:31:05,960
in here.

2132
02:31:05,960 --> 02:31:06,600
Okay, guys.

2133
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:08,880
So there's two tasks for you to complete.

2134
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:13,640
Okay, So what I want you to do here,

2135
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:15,880
let me copy this.

2136
02:31:15,880 --> 02:31:18,640
I think we already have this, right?

2137
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:27,200
So there we go.

2138
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:30,840
So navigate to this URL.

2139
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:33,920
Navigate to this URL.

2140
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:36,240
So what I want you to do, guys,

2141
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:41,280
I want you to verify
this header is displayed.

2142
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:42,960
Okay.

2143
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:46,320
Was it that one?

2144
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:53,840
Let's see.

2145
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:56,880
I think they changed it, but it's fine.

2146
02:31:56,880 --> 02:32:00,880
So what I want you to do guys,
