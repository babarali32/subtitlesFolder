00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,080
I think that's awesome, Guys, that.

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,440
That.

38
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,160
Dude, it's about to be the fourth week.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,600
Time flies.

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,760
There's only, like,
what, five months left to the course

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,320
that Jean says he believes is the third.

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,880
I think. I think Eugene is right.
I think you guys are right.

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,400
Maybe it is the third week.

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,600

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,280

Thanks. Dex.

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,800
Logically,
I know we have five months left,

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,320
but it feels like
it is still another six months.

53
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,320
I. Let's just say
it's going to be a rough time.

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
You know, you're going to have some.

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:06,080
Some tough holidays for sure,
but it's all for the greater good, right?

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,680
It's all for the greater good.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,440
Remember, guys, remember,

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,880
winning is a decision made before trying

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
to you remember that

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,480
you committed to it.

61
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,560
You chose this, you stick to it,
you follow through.

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,760
All right?

63
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,320
You follow through.

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,360
No matter how hard it's going to be,
what hurdles

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
you may have,
you're going to stick to it, right?

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
You guys are going to stick to it.

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
You guys are going to prove yourselves
right.

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,320
You're going to find it, you
know, inside you to to keep to keep up.

69
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,440
You you owe it to yourself, right?

70
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,040
You owe it to yourself to be great, Right?

71
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,440
Am I right or am I right?

72
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,560
You have nothing to prove to anyone
but yourself.

73
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,680
You want to be great or not?
It's up to you.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,480
No one can force you to be great.

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,760
It's. That's up to you.

76
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,640
That is up to you.

77
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,440
Lennie says we try.

78
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,360
Will. Trying is all you to do.

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,800
Right? Trying.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,480
That's all you can do.

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

82
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,360
So let's say 705.

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's give a couple more minutes to some.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,880
Some folks like to to join late
because they got better things to do.

85
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,920
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,200
Some people have important things to do.

87
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,120
That's another class too.

88
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:45,480
So let's see.

89
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,280
All right.

90
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,600
Menu. Class three.

91
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,880
All right.

92
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,720
Of course. Of course. Of course.

93
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,200
Guys, I didn't share my notes with the
yesterday right, that I read, did I not?

94
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,320
I don't think I did.

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,560
Jeez.

96
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,240
Terrible, Terrible.

97
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,560
Instructor,

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,640
I got some of your messages from
you guys were saying you don't teach good.

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,280
You know, this and that.

100
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,440
You know, you're the worst teacher.

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,440
And I'm just like, okay,
thanks for sharing

102
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:41,920

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,760
All right, so here are the notes.

104
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,880
Okay.

105
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,000
Here are the notes from yesterday's class.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,520
I'm going to send them.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,680
I'm going to send them in.

108
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,240

110
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,040
That's what I'm going to take everyone.

111
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,760
Of course, notes,
just a little music here.

112
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,840

okay.

114
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,640
And again, one more thing, guys.

115
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,520
This look, these are high level
notes, right?

116
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,080
So they're not complete sentences.

117
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,280
Okay?

118
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,480
And I kind of already talked about this
before we even started all of this.

119
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,920
You know, I told you guys

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,840
that I'm going to write these notes down,
but the rest I'll be saying during class,

121
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,680
because I kind of need you
to write your own notes on it if you can,

122
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,240
you know, And do you guys know how to

123
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,440
see? We sit

124
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,320
down and see if I'm saying the right thing

125
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,920
to you

126
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,520
once again while I send this

127
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,440
to the class to and

128
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,520
that is notes dear

129
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,400
senior notes.

130
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,720
And of course announcements
occur in course announcements, guys,

131
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,280
and of course announcements.

132
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,960
And there you go.

133
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,640
Kind of.

134
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,600
All right.
So go ahead. And course announcements.

135
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,920
Those were the notes from yesterday.
Keep them.

136
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,600
I told you guys that
for the rest of the notes.

137
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:30,920
Right.

138
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,480
You should be taking you guys know
how to take notes down like you guys know.

139
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,040
What's the

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,160
that you guys know what's what's the

141
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,680
like the best strategy to take notes down?

142
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,720
No, I mean,
it doesn't matter what you use.

143
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,920
If you use notepad,
you can use pen, paper or whatever.

144
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,440
You guys know what, what, what it is.

145
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,280
Eugene It's
nice, right? So one was nice. Yeah.

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,720
The best way to

147
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,680
take notes, Don, is when you hear someone
speak, okay?

148
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,440
Yes, I sure.

149
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,320
I say, you know what?

150
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,640
You ready for the market? Right?

151
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,280
You are ready for the market.

152
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,720
I shot Florida.

153
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,960
I said Florida. Yes.

154
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,520
Keywords, red

155
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,640
keywords, keywords, keywords, keywords.

156
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,240
Keywords means you're not writing
full sentences because it's really hard

157
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,960
to write a full sentence after
someone says a full sentence, write you.

158
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,760
You're not that no one is that fast.

159
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,120
So you write keywords, not you.

160
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,200
You hear something, okay, you'll see.

161
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
Okay, keywords.

162
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,240
This many faces, these faces, bam.

163
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
That's it, right?

164
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,720
And that's it.

165
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,600
But keywords, keywords, keywords.

166
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,640
All right, so manual testing, Class three.

167
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,360
All right.

168
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,600
So now that you guys
are officially testers,

169
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,000
you guys know how to write test cases.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,160
You guys know about SDLC,
you know about the software testing

171
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,640
lifecycle, you know the software
development lifecycle.

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,560
Tell me, what did we learn yesterday?

173
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,440
What did we learn yesterday?

174
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,400
Some things that come, come.

175
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,840
So very good, right?

176
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,000
Good.

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Again,
so I'm going to say cucumber scenarios.

178
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
Cucumber scenarios, right.

179
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,280
We learned.

180
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,640
Oh, let's not write
then what is very good?

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,040
What is good?

182
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,960
Good, What is

183
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,760
good?

184
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,000
It's a syntax.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,640
That's plain English text, right?

186
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,480
Yes, very good.

187
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,560
Right.

188
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,640
That's okay. Very good.

189
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,840
Take a smart, intelligent, wonderful.

190
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,440
All right.
What else did we learn yesterday?

191
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,120
Okay, let's learn about gherkin
keywords, red

192
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
gherkin, keywords, right. And so on.

193
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,960
Nobody said it.

194
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,440
We have given, we have given

195
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
one then.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,360
Okay.

197
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
And what else can we use,

198
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,040
Right.

199
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,600
What do we say
you can use and, and we can use but.

200
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,320
Right.

201
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,800
Can you tell me something about

202
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,080
these keywords like just one thing,
like how do we have to write them,

203
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,920
How do we have to write them?

204
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,360
Very good. Right?

205
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,000
First letter is

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,440
capital.

207
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,200
It's capitalized.

208
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,520
So that makes sense. Okay, that's complex.

209
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:43,440
So what is Gherkin
given one than what is given what is?

210
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,280
When we say given Mike,
we'll get there tomorrow.

211
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,640
Thanks for that.

212
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,280
That's the next point.
But let's take a few steps back.

213
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,520
What is given

214
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,720
given is what when you usually use
given key word you're writing,

215
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,200
what's the precondition? Right.

216
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Very good. Very good. Very good.

217
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,080
What about when

218
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,880
we're about one?

219
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,560
Okay.

220
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,760
One is where you specify in action.

221
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,360
Right.

222
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,280
And then as what

223
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,480
looks

224
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,320
very good, wonderful, put wonderfully.

225
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
But these are the rules. Right.

226
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,880
But what do we say about rules?

227
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:26,160
Once you know the rules, then what?

228
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,440
You can break them. Yes.

229
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,480
And what is the whole point of writing
like?

230
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,840
Well, what is the main goal of writing
a cucumber scenario like your main goal?

231
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,600
What is the main goal?

232
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,720
What is the main goal?

233
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,840
When you write?

234
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,960
One of writing
is to make it make sense. Yes.

235
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,800
Very good. Right?

236
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,720
They need to make sense.

237
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,200
Okay.

238
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,920
So when you write it down, right when
you write it down, read it to yourself.

239
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,280
Right.

240
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,520
Read it to yourself and ask yourself
if it makes sense.

241
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,600
And then once you read it to yourself,
then as someone else say, can you

242
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,960
can you read this?

243
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,760
Can you understand it? Right?

244
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,920
And they say, Yes.
Then you're good to go, right?

245
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,040
Does that make sense?

246
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,320
And for my fellow,

247
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,320
my fellow folks here
that are in different countries

248
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,120
where English is not your first,

249
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
your first language,
that's completely okay.

250
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
That is no problem.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,920
As long as you try.

252
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,480
That's okay, right?

253
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,760
As long as you try. It's all good.

254
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,640
All right,

255
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,320
cool.

256
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,600
Okay.

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,880
So someone said to me, What is that?

258
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,240
You said,
Oh, is it better to write them in?

259
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,480
First person First person or third person?

260
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,160
Third person. Right, exactly.

261
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,320
Third person.

262
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,760
I'm going to say it's recommended, right?

263
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,320
For best practice.

264
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,200
It doesn't mean
you have to have to have to write.

265
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,680
First person is used, but it always.

266
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,840
What is the goal of BDD?

267
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,000
What does BDD stand for?

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,960
By the way, was that for.

269
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,360
Yes, very good.

270
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,200
That's right.

271
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,320
You see, we're

272
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,120
the again.

273
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,840
And what is what are what is the goal
when we're writing to cover scenarios.

274
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Right.

275
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,840
What what is a goal?

276
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,200
You remember

277
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,640
we use BDD to describe

278
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,640
business tool to write

279
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,680
what our business rules.

280
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,440
Yes, very good.

281
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,480
Jamie, what are our business rules?

282
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,400
What are business requirements?

283
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,360
Requirements.

284
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,000
Right. And what did you say?

285
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,600
Yeah.

286
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,800
Describes to be here
the user will take on an application.

287
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,760
So how will the user use the application?

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,400
That's how you read the scenario.

289
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,720
Does that make sense?

290
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,200
Right.

291
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,240
How will the user use if you are

292
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,720
if Sharif if Sharif is the user.

293
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,520
So how will Sharif use the application?

294
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,080
Okay.

295
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,960
Given the user is on this page
and the user navigates here

296
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,120
and the user, you know that you go back
to, does that make sense?

297
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,440
Is that clear?

298
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,000
Does anyone have any questions?

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,280
And this is, you know, you guys did
very good yesterday, by the way.

300
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,440
We're going to do more of it today.

301
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,160
We're going to you're going to do like
a lot of it throughout the whole class.

302
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,720
Okay,

303
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,480
cool.

304
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,520
You're going to learn a lot.

305
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,360
So one thing you want to look out for

306
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,760
is, is I'm going to I'm going to type
an example.

307
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,000
It's going to be an example.

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,680
And I want you to correct me.

309
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,640
I want you to correct.

310
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,520
Okay, cool.

311
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,640
I want you to correct me.

312
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,360
All right.

313
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,040
And hold on. Don't start yet.

314
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,200
I'll tell you what to go.

315
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,120
So don't type anything yet.

316
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,480
That's

317
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,760
okay.

318
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,800
Okay.

319
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:35,000
Good.

320
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,120
So anything you

321
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,400
and funny thing is

322
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,320
that a few of you send the same scenario.

323
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,480
So I don't know what you guys are like
in a dream team or something,

324
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,960
but some of you guys
sent the same scenario, right?

325
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,560
So here we go again.

326
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,320
This is an example
given a user is on the syntax website.

327
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,600
Okay. All right.

328
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:26,160
Are you going to give this stuff
a thumbs up or thumbs up?

329
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,440
Someone says, we can simplify that. Okay.

330
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,960
All right. Can I tell you what I think?

331
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Can I tell you what I think?

332
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,160
Right.

333
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,600
Given the users on the syntax website,
what syntax

334
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,440
website.

335
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,040
Right.

336
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,960
What syntax website.

337
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,920
Right. So let's fix this. Right.

338
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,360
Given the users on the syntax,
even the users on the syntax

339
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,520
and the what is name of the application,
it must write

340
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,920
given to users on the syntax HMS website.

341
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,240
We always want to capitalize the first
letter of of of the name of a page.

342
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,720
Right.

343
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,640
So instead of locate lowercase s,
I'm going to change it to capitalize this.

344
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,480
Right.

345
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,040
So given a user is on the syntax
HMS website, right,

346
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,920
you can say website,
you can say applications.

347
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,600
Right now it's much better. Right now.

348
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,680
We know what

349
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,200
we know,

350
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,720
you know, and if you want to
use the website, we can add it.

351
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
We can only use that.

352
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,760
We know without that, you know,
I was going to make a sub syntax.

353
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,320
I got into syntax,
I forgot what the URL was.

354
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,520
I'm stuck on that. Cool.

355
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,040
You can add it here. No,
you don't have to.

356
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,520
You don't have to.
You don't have to do that.

357
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,280
You don't have to go

358
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,560
right.

359
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,000
But you
can't. There's nothing wrong with it.

360
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,600
You can see absolutely nothing wrong.

361
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,080
Does this make sense?

362
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,920
I'm going to go ahead and delete it

363
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,360
so it makes sense now, right?

364
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,400
Thumbs up.

365
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,440
Very plain and simple.

366
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,280
We made those two corrections, right?

367
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,000
We specified the website
and we changed this lowercase s

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,800
right to have capitalized s y
because it's the name of a page.

369
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,160
Right.

370
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,240
And you always capitalize
the first letter red

371
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,200
when you write your name down,
you say, Hey, my name is Marvin.

372
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,240
Like this.

373
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,120
Or the you say, Hey,
my name is Marvin with the capitalized

374
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,640
right, How do you do it?

375
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,840
Capitalize on it.

376
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,480
So same thing applies to pages.

377
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,120
All right.

378
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,600
Let's go to the next
let's go to the next step.

379
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,080
When users are on the HMS Home page

380
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,120
game, they should be

381
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,760
able to enter the username

382
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,120
when users

383
00:18:49,120 --> 00:19:02,640
are on the web,

384
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,840
when users should be able to enter
the username.

385
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,920
Let's see,

386
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,600
you don't need the first part. Hmm.

387
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
Well, can I.

388
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,640
Can I

389
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,920
can I just tell me what I think?

390
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,400
I go.

391
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,960
All right.

392
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,360
Right. So

393
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,640
given the user is on the syntax

394
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,600
HMS website, so
and now I said this is thumbs up.

395
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:38,880
Right?

396
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,240
But now reading this and and we're
analyzing here, we're analyzing together

397
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,320
because you guys are also going to be test
analysts, right?

398
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,040
So we are going to analyze this scenario

399
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,600
again
when users are in the syntax or I mean,

400
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,120
it doesn't even say syntax,
it just has a charm as home page.

401
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,520
Right.

402
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,640
Well, the thing is,
if I want to use the word home page here,

403
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,600
why don't I just go back to the first step

404
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,280
and say,
given any users and the syntax mess

405
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:17,600
page right, this makes sense right now.

406
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,920
I specifically narrowed
that down the website

407
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,640
to home page, right when user and not now.

408
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,440
Check this out.

409
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,200
Now check this out
when users are on the home page,

410
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,640
but they're already on the home page,
so this sounds redundant, right?

411
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,640
It sounds like
we're repeating the first step.

412
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,600
Right?

413
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,560
So that makes sense.

414
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,440
So let's get rid of this.

415
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,560
Yeah, let just remove it. It's redundant.

416
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,760
You guys. See what I'm saying, though?

417
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,400
It's redundant. Like, we're like.
We know we're already there.

418
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,240
We're seeing it again, right?

419
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,200
So let's get rid of it again.

420
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,680
They should be able to enter the username.

421
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,560
Okay, let's say

422
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,560
let's, let's change this.

423
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,880
Let's, let's change this to and.

424
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,400
Okay. Jimmy That's very good, Jimmy.

425
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,680
That is very good.

426
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,680
But we're going to build off of this
what we have right?

427
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,680
How about this?

428
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,960
So, okay

429
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,960
I don't

430
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,880
want so I said with cucumber scenarios
you can use should

431
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,360
the word should right with test cases
you're allowed to use that.

432
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,640
But I forgot to mention yesterday
that the word should should only be used

433
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,040
with the then clause with cucumber again.

434
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,400
Okay.

435
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,720
Like then the user should be loved it.

436
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,320
Right?

437
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,840
Does that make sense?

438
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,160
Does that make sense with everyone? Yes.
With the validation.

439
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,240
Then we can use that.

440
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,840
Okay, so

441
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,280
I'm going to delete this part

442
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,120
and says and enters

443
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,080
the username and where

444
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,920
Nick Nikolai, you're you are correct.

445
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,520
You are correct.

446
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Nikolai Very good job,
but we're just making this one better.

447
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,080
Okay? Nicola
We're just working on this one.

448
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,520
You are 100% correct.

449
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,160
Okay, let's just work on this.
Pretend that we have this.

450
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,040
I work
and we need to make some adjustments.

451
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,720
But Nicola, that.

452
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
That is very good. You are not wrong, but

453
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,240
so and enters username

454
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,760
into into the username textbox.

455
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,520
Right into the username textbox
username field.

456
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,040
So what if I said okay, I'm
going to give you an example TextBox.

457
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:49,960
Right.

458
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,360
And user
should be able to enter the password.

459
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
So we're going to delete this part.

460
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,440
Okay?

461
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,560
And enters the password

462
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,520
into the password field.

463
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,960
Okay, What's, what's wrong?

464
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,080
So we use the word should in cucumber.

465
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,400
Yes. Anthony But you always want
to use them with the then clause.

466
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,040
Okay.

467
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,120
With the done now with and now with given.

468
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,760
Cool. So what, what is what is.

469
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,040
Just give me like
you're doing a test case review.

470
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,600
What's up with this

471
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,240
connect clarify the HMS website log in.

472
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,160
Is it okay to say username.

473
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,240
I don't understand the question.

474
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,360
The HMS website log in.

475
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,560
Yes Anna That's right.

476
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,360
Christine 100% correct.

477
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,800
They understood this, right.

478
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,000
There's inconsistency in these two steps.

479
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,440
In the first step,
you use your same textbox.

480
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,400
In the second step,
you're seeing fields, right?

481
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,680
Stick to one, you pick one,
you stick to it.

482
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,200
Right?

483
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,560
So we're going to take the textbox
because we already had that right.

484
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,000
So given a user users on a syntax
HMS homepage that enters the username

485
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,120
into the user textbox and enters
a password into the password textbox

486
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,640
and click log in clicks,
write login button.

487
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Is this how login is?

488
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,440
Well, first of all,

489
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,080
they did good at putting this
the name of the button into quotations.

490
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,680
Right?

491
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,600
They did this very good.

492
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,200
Okay. Right.

493
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,000
And actually for Hot brings a good point.

494
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,760
Like what about the quotations for this?

495
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,240
And I'm sure you're talking about the
the name of the passwords, right.

496
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,640
The password that we're talking about,
we can put it in quotations.

497
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,680
That's fine.

498
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,200
But see,

499
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,520
where is that?

500
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,440
What's a let's see. It's right here. It

501
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,640
will see.

502
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,400
Oh, by the way, the URL, please
go see black market,

503
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,080
because you're going to use it
for the rest of the class.

504
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,960
But here it is again.

505
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,760
So Farhad is saying
that we should put those

506
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,920
we should indicate the names
of those fields and hues.

507
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,400
Right.

508
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,160
So enters the username into

509
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,000
the username textbox.

510
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,080
Okay, so that spelled username
with the capitalized you.

511
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,480
So we're going to come back here,

512
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,560
we're going to change this to capitalized.

513
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,880
You know,
we're going to put it in quotations

514
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,600
and the next one is called password.

515
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,840
Okay, you guys, you are one with this.

516
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,240
Very, very good.

517
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,040
Very good.

518
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,080
Farhad Good job and clicks login button.

519
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,600
Right?

520
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,480
So we know that there's one login button,
but what is the name of the but actually

521
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,720
it's log in, it's one word
and it's all capitalized.

522
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,760
Right.

523
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,200
Very, very good.

524
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,120
So I'm going to say login button.

525
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,080
Are we clicking
log in one with valid credentials?

526
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:12,200
Are we just clicking log in button?

527
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,280
How do you click a button
with valid credentials

528
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,520
so it doesn't make sense, right?

529
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
You can only just click a button.

530
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,440
Does that make sense?

531
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,000
Right.

532
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,120
So and clicks logging button right.

533
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,680
Then the user should be logged in.

534
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,200
Okay,

535
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,840
that is fine.

536
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,520
Okay, cool.

537
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,640
That is fine.

538
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,800
Does that make sense?

539
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,200
So we went from the first scenario
that we had and we fixed it.

540
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,800
We made it much better.

541
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,760
Now can you write it?

542
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,200
You cannot click enter.

543
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,360
How can you click enter?

544
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:00,000
A lot of you guys said in your test cases
that you guys would set,

545
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,240
you guys would press enter right

546
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,480
when clicks log in? No.

547
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:17,840
What do you mean?

548
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,680
Yeah.

549
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,200
Irina here you can actually use went

550
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,320
right one,

551
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,000
you can use one and it'll make sense
but Oh and here's a good example.

552
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,200
Look.

553
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,080
So Irina is like, Hey,
can we use web for this?

554
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,840
Right.

555
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
The question is the answer is yes.

556
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,760
And I want you guys to understand
this, Right.

557
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,440
Everyone pay attention.

558
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,800
First of all, does everyone know
you don't have to use all three?

559
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
Remember, Marianne, what we said?

560
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,640
If you know the rules,
then you know the rules, right?

561
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,480
That you could break them, Right?

562
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,800
The whole point is for you to make
it make sense. Right?

563
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,560
But Irina brought up a good point.

564
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,320
She said, Hey, can we use
when in this statement,

565
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,000
okay, look, everyone
pay attention to cute to this, okay?

566
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,840
The very close attention to this.

567
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,640
Again, it's like we're writing.

568
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,520
It's like we're
speaking in English. Right.

569
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,320
And you
can compare this to any other language.

570
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,240
I just don't know how to give you
examples, like in Russian or Ukrainian or

571
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,240
whatever language you may speak,
But I want you to pay attention to this.

572
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,200
Okay?

573
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,800
Look, given a user

574
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,920
is on this syntax, HMS Home page, right?

575
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,080
And when we're using and it's

576
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,680
a continuation
of the previous step, right.

577
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,920
So with this and we don't have to say

578
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,480
and the user enters the username password
in the title right now

579
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,240
we don't, we don't need to specify
and the user any more.

580
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,840
Right.

581
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,160
And enters a password
into opposite textbox and clicks log in.

582
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,080
But if you want to use one right,

583
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,040
you have to do this one
and then you have to specify the user.

584
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,840
Again.

585
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,480
When the user clicks logging button,
then the user should be logged in.

586
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:58,800
Does that

587
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,120
make sense?

588
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,000
Does that make sense or.

589
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,840
Well, plain and simple.

590
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,520
Okay, just keep it nice and simple
if you want to remember right.

591
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,240
If you want to make a short,
just use end right

592
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,560
when you use and you don't have to say
and the user, right.

593
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,960
You just continue
from the last step. Right.

594
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,480
And we've already declared the user here
with this step right now

595
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,240
when you want to use

596
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,200
when or when you want to use, then right
then you specify the user again.

597
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,000
Does that make sense, guys?

598
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,960
Does that make sense?

599
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,880
Now, the cool thing was I was reading
a lot of your comments, right?

600
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,600
How about present tense and last one?

601
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,920
What do you mean, present tense?
What would it be?

602
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,080
But that is the expected result and
that is actually what we're looking for.

603
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,760
That is
actually so it actually makes sense.

604
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,840
That's why

605
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,000
it actually makes sense.

606
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,840
Can we use when for second step?

607
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,040
Yes, you can.

608
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,520
You can.

609
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,880
But you have to specify the user,
right, for hot.

610
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,960
So you have to say when the user enters
the username and the username textbox

611
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,280
and enters.

612
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,920
Right, you can make it make sense. Read.

613
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,320
Another thing is okay,
but is this making sense to everyone?

614
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,240
And the really cool thing was that
a lot of you guys would give me answers

615
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,040
right now that are not incorrect.

616
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,360
Okay.

617
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,680
If you can, Gerald, you can ask

618
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,400
if you can
and if it makes sense, then you can count.

619
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,800
It definitely can. Cool.

620
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,200
Okay.

621
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,040
Now, a lot of you guys were giving answers
that make sense

622
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,120
that that actually would work.

623
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,000
And I want to talk about one like this.

624
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,800
So this is the scenario that we had.

625
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,320
We simplified it, right?

626
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,640
We made it make sense.

627
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,280
Nods clear, right.

628
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,080
It makes more sense.

629
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,720
Which way is preferred? Way for Madison?

630
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,840
Cucumber of creating a spreadsheet,
you mean which way is preferred

631
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,960
for like either writing
the classic mail test cases or cucumber

632
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,760
scenarios?

633
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,040
I think if you asked me this is easier,

634
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,200
right?

635
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
You don't have to go through the whole
hassle of like,

636
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,960
you know, our task,
which is cut more today.

637
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,000
A lot of types are be used. But

638
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,040
but cucumber is is very popular

639
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,480
is cucumber is very popular.

640
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,120
Okay.

641
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,400
All right.

642
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,880
So okay, so let's

643
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,320
now now we fixed this very good
job, guys. Run!

644
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,320
APPLAUSE, Run! APPLAUSE.

645
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,240
You guys are smart.

646
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,480
Okay,
I'm going to tell you what. This is it.

647
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,320
This is the best batch we've ever had.

648
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,480
All right, So the thing is now, right?

649
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,400
Let's make this scenario, guys, as a team.

650
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,200
Let's grab this scenario
and let's simplify it.

651
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,880
Okay?

652
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,200
To make it easier. Okay.

653
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,680
What is cucumber?

654
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,000
Once again, please?

655
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,480
Okay,

656
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,480
so let's grab this scenario.

657
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,680
Let's

658
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,360
let's simplify it.

659
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,040
Cool.

660
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,080
My words. It's okay.

661
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,840
You can read the notes that I sent
you guys.

662
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,240
It'll help you out.

663
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,480
Can we use press enter button swimming
keyboard?

664
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,280
No, you don't want to use that.

665
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,120
You don't want to.

666
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,520
You don't want to use it
unless the acceptance

667
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:40,320
criteria says that the user should
that that function should work.

668
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,400
If one presses the interval, get

669
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,960
by default,
everything should be done by clicking

670
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,880
cool.

671
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,080
Like, you know, when you're filling
a form, whenever you're filling a form,

672
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,880
you can actually press the tab button
to go to the next to the next field.

673
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,200
Right?

674
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,440
Right.

675
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,120
These are
what we call keyboard operations, right?

676
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,360
You can when you hit tab,

677
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,800
it goes to the next,
it goes to the next to the next field.

678
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,400
Right.

679
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,560
If you had into a on windows
or you had return on a mac

680
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,960
that sometimes will like submit
a form or process something.

681
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,480
Right.

682
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,920
We don't we don't use that.

683
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,800
We don't use that
unless the acceptance criteria

684
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,440
specifically specifies, hey, you have to

685
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,760
you have to be able to do this
and the user should be able to log

686
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,040
in by pressing enter
when entering the password.

687
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,760
Okay.

688
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,560
We don't

689
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,880
necessarily test those keyboard operations
unless those are business requirements.

690
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:50,480
By default,
a website can allow that to happen.

691
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,080
Does it need to make sense?

692
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,080
It needs to make sense to everyone, the
business analysts, actually to their work.

693
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,000
We had to share all of our cucumber
scenarios with our client

694
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,560
because they're going to do the testing.

695
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,240
Right.

696
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,320
And we had to share the cucumber
scenarios.

697
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,440
12 of them with all of them.

698
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,600
So how bad would it look if they read it?

699
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,480
And it doesn't make sense, right?

700
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,120
They're going to start to think
a few things.

701
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,040
They're going to be like, wait a minute,
they're writing their scenarios like this.

702
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,440
It doesn't make sense.

703
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,480
So how are they testing? Right?

704
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,680
That's that is the

705
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,240
the number one question, the number one
thought that will come to their head.

706
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:33,720
Right.

707
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,680
Whether you write
the manual classic test cases.

708
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,520
Right.

709
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Or you write a cucumber scenario
that doesn't make sense

710
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,680
to them, the first thing they're going

711
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,600
to think about is, wait a minute,
how are they testing this scenario?

712
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
Doesn't make sense.

713
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,520
This is the test case
that they have to follow,

714
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,560
but it doesn't make sense.

715
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
So how are they testing?

716
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,680
You know, like you know what I mean?

717
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,040
So is that is
that is everyone understanding that

718
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,240
everyone understand where I'm trying to

719
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,520
right now?

720
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,360
You don't need to stay away
from certain terminology.

721
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,400
What I'm saying is that

722
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,640
if you're writing scenarios
that don't make sense

723
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
and then you show them
to the rest of the team. Right.

724
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,800
And when they read them
and it doesn't make sense.

725
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,920
That is going to be a big concern

726
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,360
because you need to show what you are
testing through documentation.

727
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,120
Right.

728
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,160
And these you will be writing
any document, either zero or

729
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,040
something like that.

730
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,800
You will be writing,
but this is going to be documented.

731
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,520
Okay.

732
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,000
Does that make sense to everyone? Right.

733
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,440
So what you're testing is going
needs to be documented.

734
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,480
You can't just say, yeah, I tested this.

735
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,920
It works, right?

736
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,080
It needs to be documented somewhere.

737
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,280
It needs to be documented.

738
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,800
In this case, we're creating
the testing areas of Cucumber Center.

739
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,520
So the test cases,
they need to make sense.

740
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,440
Okay,
but does everyone understand that concept?

741
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,480
Like if this isn't making sense,
is there someone checking

742
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,920
the test cases after that, doesn't it?

743
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,680
Yes, I was going to talk about that now.

744
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,520
So in our project right in my project.

745
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,920
So I didn't tell you this, but

746
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,760
I'm currently a tour manager.

747
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,560
I lead the automation development
for over 30 applications

748
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,920
within the National Institutes of Health.

749
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,480
Right.

750
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,120
And I oversee different teams
of about 30 testers.

751
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,760
Right.

752
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,440
So we can

753
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,080
we have weekly test case reviews.

754
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,040
We conduct weekly test case reviews

755
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,480
to make sure that test cases

756
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,920
that we're writing make sense.

757
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,440
Okay.

758
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,840
Because you remember when I told you
that these were going to manually

759
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,560
write them, right?

760
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,240
We're going to manually write them.

761
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,440
And then once they're ready to automate,
we literally just copy

762
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,360
and paste it into our job of coding
that you will learn later.

763
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,280
But the thing is that
if this is a poorly written scenario

764
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,600
and then we automate this scenario, then

765
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,040
our automation is going to be poor.

766
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,840
Does that make sense?

767
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,600
Our automated
test cases reflect our manual test cases,

768
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,240
and we have a poorly written
manual test case or cucumber scenario.

769
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Then that means your automation
is going to be poor.

770
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,880
Okay, does that make sense, guys?

771
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,240
Does that make sense to everyone?

772
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,200
Okay, cool.

773
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,600
Right.

774
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,160
So, yes, to answer your question is yes,
we have test case reviews

775
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,120
and your project, if it's organized,
they will have test case reviews

776
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,040
because at the end of the day, yes,
sure, you're going to be writing these,

777
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,080
but you're all the team
at the end of the day.

778
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,160
And you guys need to make sure

779
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,480
that you guys are presenting yourselves
well to the client.

780
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,400
Okay, cool.

781
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,040
Okay.

782
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,640
So do we have any more questions
on these cucumbers and errors before

783
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,480
we simplify it?

784
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,640
Okay, so we can write the last two.

785
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,240
Okay, so let's simplify it.

786
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,800
Okay, We have one, two,

787
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,000
three, four, five, five steps.

788
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,320
Okay, Let's stick to this one. Right.

789
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,520
Given a user's on the syntax
h mess homepage

790
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,200
for going to say simplified.

791
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,160
Simplified.

792
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,200
Okay.

793
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,960
It's going to be like this.

794
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,760
Right? Cool.

795
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,600
Okay, what else?

796
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,400
And I saw Jeremy send that somewhere.

797
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,560
I was just responding to something else.

798
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,480
Right? And I saw some of us on the right.

799
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,360
So what was what can be my second step?

800
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,840
What can be my second step?

801
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,920
Ahmed says when the user logs
in with valid credentials.

802
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,160
Yes, right.

803
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,080
That is true.

804
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,640
Jeremy also said the same thing.

805
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,720
I believe so.

806
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,240
I'm going to copy this.

807
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,080
Okay.

808
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,120
When the user logs in with
valid credentials, right,

809
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,960
then the user should be logged in right?

810
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,160
You see this?

811
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,040
Does this make sense?

812
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,720
Does this make sense?

813
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,200
It perfectly makes sense, right?

814
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,200
When you are entering the username
and the username textbox and you're

815
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,920
entering the password into the password
textbox in your clicking log.

816
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,280
And what does all you're doing here
is logging in right?

817
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,640
That's all you're doing, right?

818
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,960
So we can simplify this even more
and say when the user logs

819
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,560
in with valid credentials,
if it's too long for you,

820
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,480
then then you can even simplify
it even more.

821
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,920
We want.

822
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,080
But it is perfect.

823
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,280
Yeah, this is good.

824
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:57,600
Does this make sense for everyone?

825
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,280
Right?

826
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,000
Is this is this clear to

827
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,200
everyone?

828
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
That's it.

829
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,560
We simplified it.

830
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,800
Now, was that to say that
this one was incorrect?

831
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,200
No, we didn't say
we didn't say this one was incorrect.

832
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,680
We just said,
hey, let's simplify a little bit more.

833
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,880
Right. That's it.

834
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,320
Yeah.

835
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,920
And what was the acceptance criteria?

836
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,400
Let's go back
and read the acceptance criteria.

837
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,480
Look at this.

838
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,040
Look at that.

839
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,920
Because we're like,
I think, guys, I would hire

840
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,680
absolutely every single one of you.

841
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,640
Every single one of you.

842
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Not even joking, Right?

843
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,680
What is the acceptance criteria? Right.

844
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,560
When I say act
because you know what, acceptance criteria

845
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,600
as an admin,
I should be able to log in with syntax.

846
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,840
It's a system
that is almost without credentials.

847
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,840
Is this satisfying
that acceptance criteria?

848
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,440
Right?

849
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
Yes. Right.

850
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,480
There you go.

851
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,000
That means test case review past.

852
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,200
Very good job.

853
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,640
The results round applause. Right.

854
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,240
Give yourselves applause.

855
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,760
Give yourselves a round of applause.

856
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,360
Right.

857
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,320
Cool, cool, cool.

858
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,360
Does this make sense, Drew?

859
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,800
One right Again,
The first one was okay, too.

860
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,640
There's nothing wrong with it, right?
We just changed the wording a little bit.

861
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,560
We made it make sense, right?

862
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,240
We have to. We had to write this code.

863
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,680
Cool, cool, cool.

864
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,080
Okay, Keep it simple, basically.

865
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,880
Yeah, Keep it simple.

866
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,680
Unless asked to elaborate.

867
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,720
I like that, Marianne.

868
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
Like that.

869
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,880
Okay Cool. Keep it simple.

870
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,680
Keep it simple if you can go.

871
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,000
So basically reword.

872
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,120
We didn't reword. Yeah. If that helps you.

873
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,280
If you want to think about it
like that, sure.

874
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,920
You just got to write it
in separate steps, right?

875
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,200
So that's really good. Very good.

876
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:02,760
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
gentlemen and ladies.

877
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,840
All right, class number three.

878
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Okay, so before I start this
class, can everyone, everyone in the cell

879
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,000
and she said that
all of you should have had

880
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,280
or should have received your access
to JIRA.

881
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,320
Okay? You should have received an email.

882
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,240
I believe, with your credentials.

883
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,680
And I believe that your username is.

884
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,160
First of all,
did you guys receive any email?

885
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,360
Are you sure?

886
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,840
Because they're saying
that anyone received

887
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,080
any email, any notification
or like anything.

888
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,600
Can you please just
log in real quick and check?

889
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,400
Just log in real

890
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,920
quick and check.

891
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Not one has it.

892
00:42:52,920 --> 00:43:11,960
All right, cool.

893
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,280
All right, That's fine.

894
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,120
That's fine. That's okay.

895
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:20,040
So listen,
you will receive access to JIRA, right?

896
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,680
And then next week,
we're going to get your heart.

897
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,360
Okay? Does that make sense?

898
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,160
We're going to be very hands
on. You're going to work.

899
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,040
It's going to be a lot of fun.

900
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:28,920
All right.

901
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,480
So it's going to be JIRA,

902
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,080
not Gyro Zero a thing,
I think Hasim think you're hungry to see?

903
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,120
I think that's a thing.

904
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,000
You're hungry, right?

905
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,120
So good.

906
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,680
So today, let's talk about what is about

907
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,920
what we already talked about,
what is about. Right.

908
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,120
And then we're going to talk about a bug
lifecycle.

909
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,000
All right.

910
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,720
We're going to talk about what
what that means,

911
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,800
what that is, how to approach
a bug and everything like that.

912
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,480
So what is a bug?

913
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,840
We already talked about this, right?

914
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,640
A software bug.

915
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,760
This is the Wikipedia definition,
by the way.

916
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,240
A bug can be described as a mini.

917
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,640
We're talking about a software bug,
by the way.

918
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,640
Right?

919
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,040
Can be a system error,
a failure, a fault, something.

920
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:20,640
Right.

921
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,240
Does it necessarily
have to mean that something is broken?

922
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,040
Right.

923
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,960
That does it
does it necessarily have to be like.

924
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,720
Like something's broken
or anything like that?

925
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,480
All right.

926
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,920
It could mean that the application's
working just fine.

927
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:37,840
Right?

928
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,240
And when I

929
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,280
talk about the different types of bugs
that we're going to be talking about,

930
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,000
okay, so bug examples,

931
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,560
software doesn't do something
that specification says it should do.

932
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,160
A user was not able to
log would not code then Charles software

933
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,320
does something that specification says
it should not do

934
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,080
user was able to log in
with invalid credentials right.

935
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,080
Aside from this being a bug,
this could be like a security breach.

936
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,520
It could be really bad.

937
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,320
These software
bugs can lead to a very big,

938
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,560
you know, big problems sometimes.

939
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,280
Okay.

940
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,960
For example, what if I was able to log in

941
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,040
to your bank account
with invalid credentials?

942
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,400
How big of a problem would that be?

943
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,280
Well, first of all, if you had no money,
I don't think it would be a problem.

944
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,360
Right.

945
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,600
But if you had money,
then then it be a problem for sure, right.

946
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,720
So these bugs can

947
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,320
take can play a big, big role.

948
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:35,920
Right.

949
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,360
So bug examples can

950
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:44,600
software

951
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,560
does something that specification
does not mention software

952
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,480
allow user to add
two spouses to the policy.

953
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,960
Right.

954
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,640
This can happen
like with different forms. Right.

955
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,120
For example,
if you're signing up for insurance, right.

956
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,160
Or for health care or something,

957
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,680
I think you can only have one spouse,
right.

958
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,880
Legally or something.

959
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,920
But the application is,
you know, taking that information.

960
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,440
What if it's what if it's

961
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,880
allowing you to add more than two spouses?

962
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,400
That would be a bug, right?

963
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,080
At least here in the US.

964
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,280
I know what a lot of
you guys are going to say.

965
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,880
You know, maybe we should have thought
about a different example.

966
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,360
Software doesn't do something.

967
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,720
That specification doesn't mention
when it should log

968
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,240
in, but is in between
the username and password fields.

969
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,960
So how weird would it
look if the log in bind was right here?

970
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,480
Like in the middle?

971
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,600
It look weird right? It

972
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,800
it would look. It would look weird. Right.

973
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,400
But it works, right.

974
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,800
But it's still it's still a bug, right.

975
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,240
It looks obviously it's it's it would be

976
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,000
an issue.

977
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,200
So why do bugs happen?

978
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,520
Why do they occur?

979
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,280
What do you guys think?

980
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,200
So someone says bad mess.

981
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,520
Okay.

982
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,280
Would you like most of the bugs

983
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,000
that are detected

984
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,200
happen during the requirements phase?

985
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:25,800
Okay.

986
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,800
Then a lot during the design phase

987
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,480
and then some during
the development phase.

988
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,520
And what does that mean?

989
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,280
It all starts from the requirements
and a misunderstanding

990
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,720
and requirements.

991
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,280
And this can happen in different projects.

992
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,000
It happens less in agile environments,
but it can happen like in Waterfall.

993
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,080
It does happen in agile environments too.

994
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,720
But it all happens
because the whole team thinks that

995
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,920
something is supposed to happen
the way it's the way a certain way, right?

996
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,920
But because they assumed one,
because they guessed to

997
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,280
because they thought
that something was going to be some

998
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,680
some way, they went ahead
and they developed it right.

999
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,280
And then when they came time
to present it to the client,

1000
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,200
they're like,
Hey, this is not what I want it.

1001
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,960
This is not what I
this is not what we wanted.

1002
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,240
This is not what what, what we ordered.

1003
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,120
This is not what we want it to happen.

1004
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,960
You know?

1005
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,720
And guys,
I have been in a lot of these projects

1006
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,400
and a lot of these situations where
literally we developed the whole module

1007
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,680
and the client's like, it's
not where we want it, you know?

1008
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,800
And then it's like, dude, you know,

1009
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,400
like we spent all this time, right?

1010
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,640
You know, and so forth, right?

1011
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,840
So it happens.

1012
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,640
And everyone is at fault with this, right?

1013
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,360
Because your company.

1014
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,640
Right. Your team should be
the one always should be

1015
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,080
the ones to be always following up.
Hey, is this correct?

1016
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,160
Is this good?
But it's also their fault, too.

1017
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,320
You know, they're going to be
the ones that need to review the product.

1018
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:05,640
They need to see that they need to have
a good understanding on these things.

1019
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,920
Right. And that's what happens.

1020
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,480
So the main reason
is because of requirements.

1021
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,080
And believe it or not, the last reason
is because of development phase.

1022
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,040
Okay, A lot of bugs happened
during the development phase,

1023
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,640
meaning that something keeps
breaking or something, you know,

1024
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:27,920
So some stuff, it all depends, right?

1025
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,720
So why do bugs occur? So

1026
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,680
let's see.

1027
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,560
And this is the road
to cost of fixing defects.

1028
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,200
This is a really nice chart here.

1029
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,280
Actually, where if you find bugs early,

1030
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,320
you're you're your client doesn't
really lose much money.

1031
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,120
A lot of corrections
can still happen. Right.

1032
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,400
This is why you see this little arrow here
very low.

1033
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,960
You guys see this right
here? Right. It's very low, right?

1034
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,200
If there's a misunderstanding.

1035
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,520
If there is, if you can find, like,

1036
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,320
a flaw in the system right here,
then the requirements phase right?

1037
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,560
It's a easy fix.

1038
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,800
It's not in production right now.

1039
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,600
You know what production is, right?

1040
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,320
Wow. You see, now
you understand this terminology.

1041
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,360
You guys are.

1042
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,640
I t professionals, right?

1043
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,920
So this right here is
it's not in production yet.

1044
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,080
So you find that it can be fixed, right?

1045
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,040
But what if you keep waiting, right?

1046
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,360
If you wait and you find this bug
like right here in this phase.

1047
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:24,640
Right.

1048
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,600
Literally, it went through all of this.

1049
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,160
It went through the requirements phase.

1050
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,760
It went in the design space,
and then you found the bug here, you know,

1051
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,960
like it's you waited all this time

1052
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,440
and time equals what time is what

1053
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,240
time is money, right?

1054
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,400
Time is money, right?

1055
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,560
And then look and then what happens
is you find a bug here, right?

1056
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,280
Look.

1057
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,320
And you the basically the longer you wait
to find the bug,

1058
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,720
the more expensive it costs.

1059
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,480
The overall project in general.

1060
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,160
Okay, that makes sense.

1061
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,800
Cool.

1062
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:12,000
Go. All right,
so you're testing an application, right?

1063
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,520
What company you want?

1064
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,560
What example should we get? Google?

1065
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,160
How about we give this?

1066
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,440
You guys like Disney?

1067
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,120
Guys like Disney, Apple?

1068
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,560
Well, let's say Disney, right?

1069
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,240
Say, let's say Disney.

1070
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,640
All right,

1071
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,080
we're working for Disney

1072
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,720
and you're testing the homepage, right?

1073
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,760
Let's go to Disney. Is it Disney Plus?

1074
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,320
Because none of the Disney
Plus or Disney World.

1075
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,920
Walt Disney World. Let's see.

1076
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,760
That was Walt Disney World. He's

1077
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,080
right here.

1078
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,720
Okay. Walt Disney World. Okay. Bam.

1079
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,120
We're on the homepage right now.

1080
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,240
I'm visiting this website
as a regular user.

1081
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,240
Okay.

1082
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,080
As as a regular user.

1083
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,560
And I'm scrolling
through the web page, Right.

1084
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,240
And these companies, right, they do a
very good job at marketing, right?

1085
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,640
Because that's how
they're going to make their money. Right?

1086
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,920
So what happens if I come here, right?

1087
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,160
If if I if I come here
and then I scroll down and you see

1088
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,040
all these advertisements here that you see
here, like, you know, stay here,

1089
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,760
the magic Disney resorts, blah, blah,

1090
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,120
what if this wasn't displaying
to the user?

1091
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,240
Again, this wasn't displaying to the user.

1092
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,520
Like I just scroll down
and it's a blank page

1093
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,960
or maybe it's a broken image, right?

1094
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,600
I won't be able to see
what's being advertised.

1095
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,160
That could lead to the company
losing money, right?

1096
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,000
So I don't see what it is I see here.

1097
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,360
I keep scrolling down and
and stuff like that.

1098
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,840
Right.
So everything seems visible. Okay, cool.

1099
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,760
Right.

1100
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,920
So here

1101
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,080
what do we do?

1102
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,240
We're testing
and we're testing the home page.

1103
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,040
Okay?

1104
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:01,880
We're the ones.

1105
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,720
We're responsible
for testing the home page.

1106
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:09,120
Let's say we're responsible for testing
to make sure that that we can check in.

1107
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,320
Right. Let's check in.

1108
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,360
Let's say we're going to get there October
30th and we want to check out,

1109
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,000
I don't know, like

1110
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,240
default, Right? Okay.

1111
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,360
Then let's say we want to take

1112
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,240
five adults,

1113
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,800
two children, right.

1114
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,200
And then fine resorts.

1115
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,680
Right.

1116
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,440
We'll go is going to find that it says

1117
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,080
enter each child's
page at the time of travel.

1118
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,480
So let's say

1119
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,880
11, say 12.

1120
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:46,640
Okay.

1121
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,720
And we're going to go ahead
and find resorts. Right.

1122
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:49,760
All right.

1123
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,000
So you're testing this, right?

1124
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,840
You're the tester.

1125
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,800
You're working here.

1126
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,880
You see the results, right?

1127
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,720
And and okay, cool.

1128
00:53:59,080 --> 00:53:59,480
Right.

1129
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,480
So you're testing it and then
you find the bug and you find the bug.

1130
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,120
Okay.

1131
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,880
What is the first thing you should do,
let's say and I'm going to make this up.

1132
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,400
Let's say when I
when I search for something

1133
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
and I filter by price range

1134
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,080
and I say 0 to 175, right.

1135
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,520
If I click on this and there's not here
obviously because they would never

1136
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,640
I don't even know why
they have that option.

1137
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,760
And they want to make it seem
like this is affordable for

1138
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,200
syntax.

1139
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,720
Students I'm just kidding. Or,

1140
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,520
you know, just let's just say over $250.

1141
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,760
All right. So, okay, cool.

1142
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,240
So let's let's
think about something, right? So

1143
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,320
now what have you found the bug, right?

1144
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,760
Like, what do we do? Right?

1145
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,880
So we get here and we're saying,
okay, we'll filtering by something and

1146
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,840
and the results don't come up.

1147
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,680
All right?

1148
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,040
But you know that
there are packages for over $250 waiting.

1149
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:07,320
Okay.

1150
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,280
So once I reported
someone said documented and reported.

1151
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,880
Okay, cool.

1152
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,440
You know what
you have to do in the testing environment?

1153
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,600
You actually have to reproduce the bug.

1154
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,560
Okay.

1155
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:23,200
This is where we're going to talk
about the bug lifecycle.

1156
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,040
What do you do when you find a bug?

1157
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,880
The first thing you do
is you reproduce the bug.

1158
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,360
You try to reproduce the bug.

1159
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,440
In this case, I made up
what's in there, right?

1160
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,440
I said that I'm trying to filter
by price range of packages over $250,

1161
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,680
but nothing puppies.

1162
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,360
Yes. Reproduce means do it again.

1163
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,440
Okay.

1164
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,440
So what were the exact steps
I took to reproduce this bug?

1165
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,720
I went and I typed in Walt Disney World

1166
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,480
right in the search engine box.

1167
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,160
Okay.

1168
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:02,080
I clicked on the link on Google. Right?

1169
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,120
I came here.

1170
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,480
I waited for the page to load.

1171
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,960
I insert the dates, right,
that I wanted to travel from.

1172
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,360
There you go. It's already selected.

1173
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,440
I enter the information
and then I clicked on find results.

1174
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,920
I mean, find resorts

1175
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,880
to find resorts.

1176
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,760
And then once it went on to there,
I went to price

1177
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,440
range and I click on deals over $250.

1178
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,520
Okay, cool.

1179
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,080
Okay. That is reproducing the bug.

1180
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:41,040
Does that makes you
does that make sense that when we talk

1181
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,640
when we say reproduce the bug,
that means make it happen again?

1182
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:45,840
Okay.

1183
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,840
See if you can make the bug happen again.

1184
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,320
And the best way to do
that is to take the exact

1185
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,560
same steps you took to reproduce the bug.

1186
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,280
Yes. Basically repeat again
the same procedure.

1187
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,000
The exact same steps
do not change anything.

1188
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,560
Right. Recheck it

1189
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,520
and to make sure that it is a bug.

1190
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,600
Okay. To make sure that it is a bug.

1191
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,520
It's good practice to reproduce it
at least five times.

1192
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,760
At least five times.

1193
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,680
Cool.

1194
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,160
At least five times.

1195
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,800
Because what happens
if you're able to reproduce it two times,

1196
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,040
but then the third time it works, right?

1197
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,080
Then the fourth time it doesn't work,

1198
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,360
and then the fifth time it does work,

1199
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,320
right?

1200
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,600
So do you know what those kind of bugs

1201
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,840
are called,

1202
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,000
where they don't happen all the time,

1203
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,640
but they happen sometimes.

1204
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:49,760
They are.

1205
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,600
Those are called
and those are the very famous ones.

1206
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,320
They're not called glitches spread,
but they're called intermittent bugs.

1207
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,760
Intermittent bugs.

1208
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,000
Okay, cool.

1209
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,880
This means that it happens sometimes
and that happens all the time.

1210
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,320
And guys,
these bugs are the very famous ones

1211
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,240
and very difficult to reproduce sometimes,

1212
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,440
especially for very big applications.

1213
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,440
Okay.

1214
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,720
The reason for that is, is because,

1215
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,560
you know,

1216
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,680
think, think of you like,
have you ever applied for a credit card?

1217
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,320
Have you ever applied or filled out a form
a long form of something?

1218
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:29,760
I don't know.

1219
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,720
Maybe something very important. Right.

1220
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,480
And then like at the end,
something happens,

1221
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,240
like it doesn't let you submit it
or it's saying something weird, right?

1222
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,320
And the user spends
all that time into the form, right?

1223
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,600
And it doesn't work,
but it doesn't happen all the time.

1224
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:52,160
Maybe next time you try it out,
it's going to work, right?

1225
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,280
It is a bug, but
it's called an intermittent bug, right?

1226
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,160
It doesn't happen all the time.

1227
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,000
Okay, cool.

1228
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,880
Does that make sense?

1229
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,400
Good. Happens all the time.

1230
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,720
And I'm sure you guys have experienced
a lot of intermittent bugs.

1231
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,360
Okay, A lot.

1232
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,600
Why did this happen?

1233
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,120
Because there could be
something wrong with the code.

1234
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,440
Okay?

1235
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,960
It could be. It could be.

1236
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,840
No, it's not. It's
not there for a purpose.

1237
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,240
No one never,
ever wants to do that on purpose.

1238
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,000
It's just there because

1239
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,240
it's not acceptable.

1240
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,560
Absolutely not.

1241
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,800
The truth is that with these intermittent
bugs,

1242
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,440
you have to report them and the developers
have to try to fix them.

1243
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,920
But I've actually been on projects where
we've had some serious intermittent bugs,

1244
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,040
but the developers have never been able
to find a solution for it.

1245
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,560
And it's it's really it's
it's really tough for the development team

1246
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,720
because out of 20 times
it would happen three times.

1247
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,040
But those bugs were so big, okay?

1248
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,080
And they really went down.

1249
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,160
And then we're trying to find out
why is it happening, why is it occurring.

1250
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,240
And and it was very,
very difficult to reproduce.

1251
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,360
But what we do know
is that those bugs are exist

1252
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,760
like they do exist,
but they're intermittent.

1253
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,480
Okay.

1254
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,280
So some people are going to ask,
why don't we just try to fix it?

1255
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,200
Well,
the truth is that in an agile environment,

1256
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,600
you have to keep moving on, right?

1257
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,480
And you can't spend so much time
trying to fix

1258
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,480
a bug that you can't even fix
when you have so much other work to do.

1259
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:29,600
Okay.

1260
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,480
Does that does that make sense, guys?

1261
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,040
Okay.

1262
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:37,080
So and we're going to talk
about prioritizing and stuff like that.

1263
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:37,680
Okay.

1264
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,640
But the whole point

1265
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,920
is that the first thing you have to do is
you need to try to reproduce the bulk.

1266
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,640
How many times you tried to reproduce it
just to be safe, How many times?

1267
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,560
At least five times now,
the next thing before you report a bug.

1268
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,560
Before you report a bug,
the first thing you need to do is check

1269
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:02,360
the requirements, read the user story
under under the acceptance criteria,

1270
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:08,040
and see if what you are considering
a bug is actually a bug.

1271
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,320
Okay.

1272
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:13,560
See, and I told you that a bug doesn't
necessarily mean

1273
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,200
that needs to be a showstopper.
Like your application breaks.

1274
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,760
It could be anything. Right?

1275
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,960
Do you guys remember
this example gave you with this hamburger?

1276
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,960
Bring you here?
This one right here. Right.

1277
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,240
Google wanted this with three lines,
right?

1278
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,080
You see this? There's three lines here.

1279
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:34,280
But if we develop the with four lines
and it works, you can click on it.

1280
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,320
It does what it has to do.

1281
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,040
Right.

1282
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,080
And obviously, the applications working,
it's still a bug, right?

1283
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:46,000
We agree that it's still a bug
and you're going to report it.

1284
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,080
But before you report it,
you should try to,

1285
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,520
see and read the requirements
and see if this is actually a bug.

1286
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:54,560
We're not see of the acceptance criteria.

1287
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,320
Clearly states

1288
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,920
you know, developed this bug with three
lines develop this one with three lines.

1289
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,160
Does that make sense?

1290
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,000
Cool.

1291
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,880
The next thing you do is you report it.

1292
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,960
And that's exactly
what we're going to talk about next.

1293
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,080
We're going to talk about
how reporting works,

1294
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,160
what should be included
in reporting and everything.

1295
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,600
Okay. So when you report a bug

1296
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,120
reporting a bug

1297
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,920
reporting, so we're going to say the bug

1298
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,680
lifecycle kind

1299
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,280
lifecycle, what is the first step we do?

1300
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,960
Step number one is what?

1301
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:40,520
Step number one is what?

1302
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,640
What is it? Produce the bug. Right?

1303
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:47,360
We're producing the bug at least
how many times, right?

1304
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,640
At least five times.

1305
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,840
Right? At least five times.

1306
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,560
Okay, let's say
you're able to reproduce it.

1307
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,280
Okay.

1308
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:54,920
Good for you.

1309
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,960
Right here to reproduce in what is next?

1310
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
What should you do next, Right.

1311
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,360
To make sure that this is a bug?

1312
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,400
What do you do?

1313
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,240
What about requirements
you read the requirements, right?

1314
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,080
You read the requirements.

1315
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,880
Okay.

1316
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,880
The requirement scope

1317
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,160
and step number three.

1318
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,160
Right. Okay.

1319
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,200
It is a bug.

1320
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,320
Okay, then we have to document the bug.

1321
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,480
Document the bug?

1322
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,000
How do we do it and how do we document it?

1323
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,720
Okay, cool. So

1324
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,120
when you document the bug you have to

1325
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,120
you're going
to have to tell your development team.

1326
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,920
You're going to have to tell the team

1327
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,920
and you're going to have to give them
instructions

1328
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,200
of the exact steps,

1329
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,400
exact steps you took to reproduce the bug.

1330
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:51,480
So you're like,
it's going to be like a test case,

1331
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,040
but without the expect the results
or the actual results, you're literally

1332
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:59,640
going to write the exact same steps
you took to reproduce the bug.

1333
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:04,680
So it's going to look like this
step number one gain.

1334
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,440
You can say

1335
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,520
no right in safari.

1336
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,520
I'm going to talk about the bug
that I just. Reporter All right.

1337
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,440
And safari browser engine in safari

1338
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,640
browser engine

1339
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,240
search engine.

1340
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,720
Walt Disney
World. Right? Walt Disney World.

1341
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,160
Okay, Step number two.

1342
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,960
Step number two. Guys, What did I do?

1343
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,080
What was dev number two?

1344
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,040
What was step number two?

1345
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,880
Have you paid attention
to what I was doing?

1346
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,840
What was step number two?

1347
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,720
Reproduce is not testing.

1348
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,400
No, you're going to click click on.

1349
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,280
And what was it?

1350
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,200
If I go back here

1351
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:54,360
to reproduce the bug,
I clicked on the the first link.

1352
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,480
Okay, the first link.

1353
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,000
I'm going to say the first thing,
not the ad one,

1354
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,040
the first link and to specify
that you're going to say this.

1355
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,760
Okay, click on the first link

1356
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,720
and to say non advertisement.

1357
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,600
Okay.

1358
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,680
Advertisements. Right.

1359
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,400
Step 311. Step three. Nice.

1360
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,840
Step three.

1361
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,120
After I click this

1362
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,440
right. Step three

1363
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,360
was what I do.

1364
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,760
You clicked on the reservation so

1365
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,640
I, I selected reservation dates.

1366
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,200
Right.

1367
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,760
I select the reservation dates.

1368
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,040
Select

1369
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,680
reservation dates.

1370
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,920
Okay. And you know what?

1371
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,880
To be more detailed with this test case,
you have to actually specify the dates

1372
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,800
you chose. Right?

1373
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,880
So I'm going to say over
what did I say, October.

1374
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,120
I was going to be something
that October ten to November six

1375
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,600
or six, 2021.

1376
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,160
All right, Step number four,

1377
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,560
Step number four.

1378
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,800
Okay, specify

1379
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,360
what do we say? Five.

1380
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,560
Those

1381
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,080
select

1382
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,560
and say select five adults

1383
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,840
and two kids. Right.

1384
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,720
Two kids.

1385
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,800
Okay.

1386
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,360
I'm going to say the kids age are

1387
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,160
15 and 13.

1388
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:37,800
I'm just making this up

1389
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,200
15 and 13

1390
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,680
years old.

1391
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,280
Years old.

1392
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,480
Then step number five, then number five.

1393
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,280
What was it
When I do first step number five,

1394
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,200
let's say

1395
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,400
I was here, click find resorts, right?

1396
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,560
That's what it was.

1397
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,640
Click

1398
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,600
find resorts.

1399
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,000
Okay. Watson Right.

1400
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,520
So when I clicked on that,
I'm going to click on this

1401
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,320
and what else did I do?

1402
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,400
I select a price range

1403
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,560
right?

1404
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:28,280
Step number six. Step

1405
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,160
to select

1406
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,160
the price range

1407
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:42,880
to be greater.

1408
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,080
See, what was it that I selected
price range

1409
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,200
to be over $250, right

1410
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,000
to be over

1411
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,840
over $250.

1412
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,560
Okay, cool.

1413
01:07:59,280 --> 01:07:59,960
All right.

1414
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,520
And then start number seven.

1415
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,480
Step number seven.

1416
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:06,960
I did.

1417
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,640
I clicked on find resorts,
right? Actually, I didn't do anything.

1418
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,640
Okay, that's it.

1419
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:18,320
I just for this And the result,
the results are populated automatically.

1420
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:24,240
See now they automatically put

1421
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:25,960
All right

1422
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,080
so now

1423
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,320
and then when you can have here

1424
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,800
as the last step is you're going
to have the expected results.

1425
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,800
Okay. And I'm just going to make this up.

1426
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:42,480
Expected
result was many options should display.

1427
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:43,240
Okay.

1428
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,800
To display actual results.

1429
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,240
Actual results only, two options.

1430
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,080
Just put it.

1431
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,120
I'm just making this up.

1432
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,560
Okay, cool.

1433
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,120
All right.

1434
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,440
Now, this is how

1435
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,720
we need to report a bug,
but we're not done yet.

1436
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,920
You see how descriptive
and this and specific

1437
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,200
we were with

1438
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,440
reporting the steps to reproduce, Right.

1439
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:20,440
This is exactly how like this is exactly

1440
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,640
how much information
you need to provide the development team

1441
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,880
so that they can know how to fix this bug.

1442
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,080
Now, you don't need to.

1443
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:33,040
Okay, You don't need to.

1444
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:37,400
So the thing is, with this information,
we're still not done yet.

1445
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,520
Okay?

1446
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,560
We're still not done.

1447
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:42,680
You need to enter this

1448
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,880
information browser, used

1449
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,080
browser, used safari.

1450
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:49,760
Okay.

1451
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,280
We're going to say the time. What time?

1452
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,840
What time do we test this

1453
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,880
are going to say around eight.

1454
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,120
Around? I'm going to say around

1455
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:04,800
8 to 815,

1456
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:07,480
8 p.m.

1457
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:11,400
to 8:15 p.m., East Eastern Standard Time.

1458
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,600
Okay, Does that make sense?

1459
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,720
See, I even included the browser.

1460
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,120
I even included the time.

1461
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:18,840
Okay.

1462
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:23,480
Now, as a good tester, yes,
I should try to reproduce the bug

1463
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,560
in other browsers as well
to see if this only happens in safari.

1464
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:30,160
Okay.

1465
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,160
Okay. Cool.

1466
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,320
Oh yes. Very good.

1467
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,440
Very, very good. Mohammad.

1468
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,360
That is a very important one, right?

1469
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:40,080
So operating system.

1470
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,640
Operating system was iOS, right?

1471
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,720
And what is the operating system? iOS.

1472
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,800
But something big or something like that.

1473
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,320
And then the date.

1474
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,160
Yes, the date.

1475
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,120
What is the date today?

1476
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,640
The date is October. What?

1477
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:58,880
October 13.

1478
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,160
Right. 2021.

1479
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,200
So a bug when you report

1480
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,360
it should have as much
as information as possible

1481
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,080
okay,

1482
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,640
does that make sense? Goes

1483
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,520
that as much as information as possible.

1484
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,600
So when you report a bug,
this is how you report it.

1485
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:22,520
Okay,

1486
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,800
cool.

1487
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,240
Yes, go with that.

1488
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,160
This just makes sense.

1489
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,440
You guys get the gist of this.

1490
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,560
So you guys understand this, right?

1491
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,880
This is how you report a
so you document the bug.

1492
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,840
This is only step three of the development
lifecycle.

1493
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,000
So first was reproduce
the bug at least five times.

1494
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,360
Then step two, read the requirements
to make sure that the bug you are

1495
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,840
reporting is a bug.

1496
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,280
Step three document the bug. Right.

1497
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,200
And then step four.

1498
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,160
Step four

1499
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,760
The bug needs to be fixed, right?

1500
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,240
The bug needs to be fixed.

1501
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:01,240
Okay.

1502
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:06,160
And step five, step five
what is step five?

1503
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:09,880
Once the developer is playing that
they fix the bug, you say, okay, cool.

1504
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,440
What do you do?

1505
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:10,920
What do you think?

1506
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,440
Step out of this.

1507
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,720
Yes, exactly.

1508
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,840
I see very.

1509
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,520
But do retest to make sure

1510
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,600
to ensure bug does not exist anymore.

1511
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,200
Okay.

1512
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:31,240
And then step six
once your testing is passed, once

1513
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,360
you your testing passes,

1514
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,920
passes, we can close the controls

1515
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,080
pool.

1516
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,840
That is the bug lifecycle.

1517
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,000
Okay, cool.

1518
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,240
So let's go back here.

1519
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,440
Okay? Okay.

1520
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,320
Does that make sense to everyone?

1521
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,760
Does that make sense?

1522
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,720
We got

1523
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:00,000
okay, Do we have any questions on that any

1524
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,240
more?

1525
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,040
Step six again, what was step six guys?

1526
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:10,400
Lower Step six, What was step six?

1527
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,720
How do you close the bug?

1528
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,360
I will show you how we work with zero.

1529
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:19,880
Okay, but subsections once.

1530
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,760
Once your testing passes, you can close.

1531
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,640
Okay, moving on.

1532
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,560
Right already.

1533
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,680
And severity of bugs.

1534
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,360
Okay.

1535
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,400
Priority and severity of bugs.

1536
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,120
Okay.

1537
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,000
What is the difference between priority

1538
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,320
and what is the
difference between severity?

1539
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,440
Severity is defined as the level of impact

1540
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:45,920
that the bug has on the functionality
of the application.

1541
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:46,760
Okay.

1542
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,760
We're talking about how severe it
is, right?

1543
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,320
So users
not being able to check out on amazon.com,

1544
01:13:54,920 --> 01:14:03,480
is that a severe bug?

1545
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,160
Yes. Right.

1546
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,120
It's severe.

1547
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,000
It's very, very, very severe.

1548
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,560
Right.

1549
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,680
You and that you're not being able
to log into your bank account,

1550
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,000
is that severe?

1551
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,200
Right.

1552
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,800
Exactly. And

1553
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,200
priority is defined the order
in which the defect should be fixed.

1554
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,120
Okay.

1555
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,760
The higher priority,
the sooner the effect should be resolved.

1556
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:28,880
Okay.

1557
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,080
And now let's talk more about this.

1558
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,880
Okay. Let's let's talk more about this.

1559
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,080
Let's talk about priority.

1560
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:34,680
Okay.

1561
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:38,200
There's different levels
of different types of priority, right?

1562
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,520
We have a showstopper go.

1563
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,360
We have a showstopper bug.

1564
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,320
A showstopper bug.

1565
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,800
It's like an Amazon.com
user not being able to checkout

1566
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,920
you, not
being able to log into your bank account.

1567
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:51,720
What else, guys?

1568
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,200
Give me some other severe bugs
that you have experienced.

1569
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,680
What else is a severe bug
with any application?

1570
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,840
Okay, well, what else?

1571
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,840
What else can you think about?

1572
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:11,760
What else can you think about?

1573
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,040
Site not loading.

1574
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,200
Okay, that can be one, right?

1575
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:19,320
Can deposit your check online sign in
button missing when you need to sign in.

1576
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:20,520
Right.

1577
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:26,360
Data not saving,
unable to pay by something right.

1578
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,760
Right. OTP not generated. You'll get it.

1579
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,720
That is a very good one.

1580
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:31,920
That's a very good one.

1581
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,120
First time I heard that in syntax class

1582
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,320
people can log in
with invalid credentials.

1583
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,280
Is that a loss?

1584
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,360
What is that?

1585
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,720
A cross-site scripting. Scripting?

1586
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:47,760
Is that what it is?

1587
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,920
Not not able to update your password?

1588
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,600
That is that is a very big one.

1589
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,400
Can't get medical
records. Very good. Right.

1590
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:59,040
It's basically showstopper.

1591
01:15:59,040 --> 01:15:59,600
Right.

1592
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,960
And then after that
some projects have major

1593
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,880
like major functions are not working,
but you're still able to like test

1594
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,280
the application. For example,

1595
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,680
let's say

1596
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,840
where you log in again,
you see the log in button, right?

1597
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,200
And you see the forget password,

1598
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,880
but you see the login button.

1599
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,200
But it's like the colors of some things
different.

1600
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:28,280
Like it looks weird, but it still works
when you click on it, right?

1601
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:30,800
So you're able to proceed.

1602
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,240
So that makes sense.

1603
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:34,720
You're able to to proceed, right?

1604
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,160
Sometimes that happens and start.

1605
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:41,680
It's some companies considered major
but you can continue to test that's fine

1606
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:45,720
a minor right
the bug does not result in a termination.

1607
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,640
It does not damage anything. For example,

1608
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,320
you log into Amazon.com and

1609
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,120
they have like a happy Halloween
picture there, right?

1610
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,880
It's just a picture.

1611
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:00,280
But but the picture doesn't display.

1612
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,440
So is that a showstopper?

1613
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,400
Is that, like,
serious bug, Right? Is that.

1614
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,960
No, it's not right.

1615
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,400
That picture was just there to say
Happy Halloween or

1616
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:13,800
Eden Bar or Merry Christmas or whatever
it is like.

1617
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,840
But it's just a picture, right?

1618
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,920
They have these are their images change

1619
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,920
based on holidays and stuff
they're not really doing doing much.

1620
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,080
And then there are the cosmetic issues.

1621
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,120
What is an example of cosmetic issues?

1622
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,720
Cosmetic issues are when like

1623
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,920
something is spelled incorrectly,

1624
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,520
right?

1625
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,400
That could be images,
something could spell that,

1626
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,280
something can be spelled incorrectly, like

1627
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,520
it's like, you know,

1628
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,080
for some reason
you find that says, like Mary Chris

1629
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,800
there Chris nurse and it's spelled like,

1630
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,760
like this with two S's by accident

1631
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,240
right It's a cosmetic bug, right?

1632
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,560
It's just that they obviously
they have to fix it,

1633
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:08,880
but it's not affecting,
you know, it's not affecting anything.

1634
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:11,360
Does that make sense for.

1635
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,520
Got it.

1636
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:14,680
Right.

1637
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,560
Good. All right. So cool.

1638
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,400
And then severity, right?

1639
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,680
We have low severity. Meaning?

1640
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,760
Meaning severity and high severity.

1641
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,440
Okay. Low.

1642
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,200
It's okay.

1643
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,520
It's has low severity.

1644
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,400
The repair can wait. Right.

1645
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:35,040
But perhaps there are other more severe
bugs that can be fixed first, Right?

1646
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,640
The medium ones,
the real ones are the ones that

1647
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,000
that will eventually be
could become higher.

1648
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,280
They don't get fixed. Right.

1649
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,400
And then the high severity models

1650
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,600
are like the showstoppers, right? Yes.

1651
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,880
But Jimmy, you're also going to get these

1652
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,560
you're also going to
get these slides as well. Got

1653
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,080
to be good.

1654
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,880
All right. So

1655
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,360
this like lighting can be a bug.

1656
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:07,760
Yeah.

1657
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,920
Especially if you have your Wi-Fi is good,

1658
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,280
especially if every other website
that you've been using loads fast.

1659
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:14,840
Right.

1660
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,760
But for some reason,
when you visit the website, it's lagging.

1661
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,080
Then that's application specific, right?

1662
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,840
It can definitely be a bug, but

1663
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,880
so then examples

1664
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,000
high priority and high severity users
unable to log into their bank account.

1665
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:30,640
Okay.

1666
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:35,960
That's in this case is Bank of America
high priority and low severity.

1667
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:40,600
Bank of America logo on the front page
misspelled as Bank of America

1668
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,200
with a K right high
priority and low severe.

1669
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:49,080
Okay, it's not that severe, but Bank of
America folks have this as high priority

1670
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:53,800
because they want to fix the name
that America spelled right.

1671
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,800
High severity and low priority on syntax
acknowledges website

1672
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,000
on their campus section,
not able to scroll view pictures.

1673
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,680
I don't know if that bug still exists.
Maybe to fix it.

1674
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,840
I don't know.

1675
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,720
Low priority and low severity.

1676
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,520
Any cosmetic issues.
Image playing on top right.

1677
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,520
Instead of center right or spelling issues

1678
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:19,080
we use is trying to make sure there's
always acknowledge message or something.

1679
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,040
Right. Just very very small.

1680
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,280
Good.

1681
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:22,920
Does that make sense?

1682
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,720
Right. One

1683
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:27,840
Q Google.

1684
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,120
All right.

1685
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,520
All right.
So the next is the bug lifecycle.

1686
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,320
We've already talked about this.

1687
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,320
We went through this a lot

1688
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,800
and I wanted to understand
something as well, right?

1689
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,360
All this

1690
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:52,920
all this terminology
that we've been using, all these bug

1691
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:56,520
lifecycles, everything,
it's it's like this for all projects

1692
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,680
ready for most projects.

1693
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,360
But some things always change
and things are always different

1694
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,520
from project to project.

1695
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,400
Nothing is the same anywhere you go.

1696
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,680
Okay,
I want you guys to understand that. So

1697
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,160
and maybe
in the bug lifecycle in a project

1698
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:14,480
is slightly different than what
you've learned or something like that,

1699
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,680
maybe you're going to realize that
you're going to work on multiple projects.

1700
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:22,400
As you move on with your career, you're
going to realize that it's different

1701
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,640
with, you know, in different projects.

1702
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,960
Okay, New A new bug is a new bug
that is in person for the first time.

1703
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,920
It could be a sign.

1704
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,960
It's a sign. The status of new

1705
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,760
this is a big one, by the way.

1706
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,200
Rejected.

1707
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:45,000
Rejected feels that the bug is not real
or genuine or a big deal.

1708
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,040
So the developer rejects the bug.

1709
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:49,840
Okay.

1710
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,440
Then the state of the bug
is changed to reject it.

1711
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,560
So you reported a bug, but

1712
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:58,760
the developers say no, that's not a bug.

1713
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:01,800
But you are very sure that it is a bug.

1714
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:03,960
Okay.

1715
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,440
What do you do that

1716
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,560
can and we're going to talk about that.

1717
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,720
We are going to talk about that.

1718
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,520
Take take the fall entry.

1719
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,440
What does that read?

1720
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:26,280
Someone said fighting, fight, fix it
anyway.

1721
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,360
You can fix it.

1722
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,600
You're not the developer.

1723
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,560
You can't fix bugs. You're just testing.

1724
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:31,080
That's it.

1725
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:35,520
You're not going to be a developer.

1726
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,920
Okay, So

1727
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:42,120
usually if your bug gets rejected

1728
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:46,760
and you are very sure that that is a bug
and your developer

1729
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,080
rejects it, your developer
the developer is not your lead.

1730
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,920
He's not your manager, he's
not your project manager.

1731
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,080
He's not the program manager. He's
nothing right.

1732
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,840
He's not the product owner.

1733
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,880
If rejects it and you're very sure
that it's a bug, you can kind of,

1734
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:03,680
you know, say, Hey, this is a bug.

1735
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:06,000
And then he says, No, it's not.

1736
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,320
Then you

1737
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,280
you reach out to your
to your business analyst, right?

1738
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,600
Say, hey, is this a bug?

1739
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,120
And then the business analyst can say,
yeah, this is about right.

1740
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,240
If the developer still rejects the bug,

1741
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,920
then obviously the next person to schedule
the meeting with is the

1742
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,040
the program manager.

1743
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:25,720
Okay.

1744
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,720
And I don't know how good you guys are
with confronting people,

1745
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,600
but at the workplace
you have to look out for your job, right.

1746
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,880
So if there's a bug
and you're sure it's a bug reported,

1747
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:39,640
if you're not being listened to, scheduled
that meeting with the program manager.

1748
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,600
Right. And then hash it out.

1749
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,400
Hash it out. Right.

1750
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,880
That's all you got to do.

1751
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,240
You got to say, hey, this is this is a bug

1752
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,680
fight professional.

1753
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,000
I like that.

1754
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,160
So you're

1755
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,200
just going to say, hey,
this is what the requirement says.

1756
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,600
This is how things have to be like.

1757
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,000
This is the understanding.

1758
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,280
The business analyst
also agrees that this is a bug you know,

1759
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:06,840
it's our guys.

1760
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:12,600
I have experienced this so many times
with different types of developers, game

1761
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,440
developers are either going to be
a very good friend of yours

1762
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:18,600
or they're going to like
not like you at all.

1763
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:24,680
And that's
just the truth about about testing.

1764
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,440
Yeah, there are going to be times

1765
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:29,560
where you're going to give developers
a hard time.

1766
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,600
Okay, But there are

1767
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:35,040
some developers that you're going to
that are going to be very helpful.

1768
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,800
They're going to be understanding
and so forth.

1769
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,200
Okay, cool.

1770
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:45,960
So a sign and this will all make sense
once we start working with JIRA

1771
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,600
and stuff like that.

1772
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:48,640
Okay, I'm gonna talk about a sign
that all that stuff.

1773
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,360
Cool.

1774
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,880
What if my stapler was adding to the Hub?

1775
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,800
I don't understand that.

1776
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,200
His way about his behavior
the last ten years.

1777
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:00,880
Business party.

1778
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,400
Good luck with that.

1779
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:03,720
Right.

1780
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,720
So we talked about the bug lifecycle
and we're going to talk about

1781
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,920
we're going to talk about more.

1782
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,760
There's a rejected bug ever come
with an explanation of why it's rejected?

1783
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:14,640
Sometimes
not most of the time, no. Joseph.

1784
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,880
So you kind of have to

1785
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,840
because here's thing right

1786
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,880
And one thing
you really have to understand

1787
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,280
and also this is a question to you, but

1788
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,760
if he's saying it's not

1789
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:31,480
a bug right, he rejects it
and you don't stand your ground.

1790
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:35,600
And then the bug is found in production
and the client finds out,

1791
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:39,160
who do you think is the first person
that they're going to reach to

1792
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,400
when they find a bug

1793
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:43,680
within, they go to you.

1794
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:44,880
Then they go to developers,

1795
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,720
they're going to go to the testers.

1796
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:51,720
And that's very unfortunate
because that is actually true.

1797
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,560
There have been many bugs. Guys.

1798
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,040
My project
manager woke me up one night at 3 a.m.

1799
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,280
on a Saturday night
because they found the bug and production.

1800
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,360
Okay, We did very heavy testing that week.

1801
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:08,880
We all passed it and something happened
and that's how some says

1802
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:12,720
how serious some bugs can be.

1803
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:13,840
That's not so serious.

1804
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,760
Some some bugs can be.

1805
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,560
Sometimes your job will not just be a
9 to 5 thing,

1806
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,720
especially when you work
for a big project.

1807
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:26,400
Go. You're not just going to leave
your laptop open 8 to 4.

1808
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,160
You may have to be available on call
whenever they call you.

1809
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:29,680
Okay?

1810
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:34,200
So these bugs can be very serious, but
the point is that they're going to come to

1811
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,520
you and the first thing they like to ask

1812
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:40,200
is, Hey, did you guys not test this?

1813
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,840
Did you guys miss this? Right?

1814
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,560
Like and then it all
depends on the situation, right?

1815
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,720
If you're saying, well,
actually we did a test this,

1816
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,440
you're going to get in trouble, you're
going to say, why didn't you test this?

1817
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,880
You know,
and that actually happened one time.

1818
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,360
But the point is,

1819
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:59,640
when something like that happens,
you need to do everything you can

1820
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:03,400
to cover your back because your team
is not going to get your back.

1821
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,560
There is not
I don't want you thinking that, you know,

1822
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:08,280
even though your team
is going to be helpful and everything,

1823
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,520
you can really trust people and everyone.

1824
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,160
So you got to look out for yourself.

1825
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:16,960
Does that make sense to everyone?

1826
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,880
You have to kind of make sure
that you're doing your work right, that

1827
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:23,080
you document everything that you report,
everything you cover your back.

1828
01:27:23,080 --> 01:27:24,600
This is your job, right?

1829
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:28,000
You're working so hard
to make a great salary to get your first

1830
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:32,200
six figure paying
job, 80,000, 90,000, 100,000, whatever.

1831
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:34,640
Right. Cover your back. Right.

1832
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,440
You know, do do whatever you can to
to document everything.

1833
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,080
All right.

1834
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,120
Remember, we talked about communication.

1835
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:45,480
The difference between word of mouth
and email, right?

1836
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,160
You guys
remember when we talked about that,

1837
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,640
like the first class
we had together? Right.

1838
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:54,480
If you think something is is, for example,
if really saying that this is not a bug,

1839
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,400
you know what you can say to them to
to cover your back, you can say, okay,

1840
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:02,160
I understand, can you please send
an email, CC management

1841
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:05,880
and the bay and indicate in that email
that it's not about please.

1842
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:06,920
Right.

1843
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,120
And then get it in writing.
And there you go.

1844
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,320
That's your evidence. Right.

1845
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,200
So if they find that bugs say,
hey, there's an email about it,

1846
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,320
right?

1847
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,840
You see everybody CC Somewhere in a cell.

1848
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,000
All right.

1849
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,400
CC And you can

1850
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:25,680
write

1851
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,800
Who does that?

1852
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:29,920
Does that make sense, though?

1853
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,520
This point is this point made, right?

1854
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,080
You got to cover your back, right?

1855
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,280
And even though you had
you have an amazing team, people

1856
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,480
can be good, right?

1857
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:45,120
Still like cover your back
and do what you can to to, you know,

1858
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,480
stay on top of your stuff.

1859
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,160
Mohammed, They reject the bug
because they don't think it's a bug.

1860
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,880
They think that it's really not a bug.

1861
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,040
Like it's like

1862
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,160
they just don't agree with you or like,
you know, and it could be anything.

1863
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,680
It could be could be different, Right.

1864
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:04,000
Get test or insurance now.

1865
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,160
All right. So it's 830.

1866
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:11,080
Come back at eight 4840.

1867
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,280
Cool. It's all right.

1868
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:17,760
I bet you anything that someone in like
a minute is going to ask

1869
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,560
me, are we on break?

1870
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:21,960
All right,

1871
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,160
so go ahead.

1872
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:27,920
Go on, break it.

1873
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:33,360
I'm going to be here to answer
any questions you guys have right?

1874
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,840
Homework from class. What?

1875
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,640
Office space

1876
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,360
you with with the right attitude
and right mindset.

1877
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:55,320
You can do anything you want.

1878
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,360
No, they don't have insurance.

1879
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,480
This is not like
they're not going to fire you.

1880
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,280
You know, like

1881
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,520
I'm just saying that

1882
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,560
the whole point is just come back.

1883
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:11,680
It's not that hard.

1884
01:30:11,680 --> 01:30:12,520
I wrote notes.

1885
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,480
What do you mean I wrote notes?

1886
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,400
Hammock

1887
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,120
Lifecycle reporting.

1888
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,360
Yes, I will share those notes after class.

1889
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:29,920
I wrote all of them here.

1890
01:30:30,320 --> 01:42:08,720
Everything cool?

1891
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,920
So, guys, we're back. Or we're back.

1892
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:12,360
Or back. We're back.

1893
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:16,320
Or are we back?

1894
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,440
So a cell sent

1895
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:21,720
the instructions to how to log into JIRA.

1896
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,480
She posted them in the course
announcements channel,

1897
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:29,080
so go and review
the course announcements channels

1898
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,000
so that you can

1899
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:38,400
know how talented your listen are.

1900
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,840
Please, please.

1901
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:44,400
Okay, just log in.

1902
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,360
If it works, it works.

1903
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:51,160
But please do not do anything in JIRA.

1904
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:54,120
Okay. Does that make sense?

1905
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:58,760
Please do not do anything in JIRA.

1906
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:00,840
Okay.

1907
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:03,080
Does that make sense?

1908
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:06,280
Because the thing with JIRA
and we'll talk about it next class

1909
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,920
is that it's a project management tool.

1910
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:13,280
And the really interesting thing
about these tools, because you work about

1911
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:16,480
you'll work with it in your project, is

1912
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:21,160
if anyone does
absolutely anything in zero,

1913
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:27,040
there is a history area
where we can see exactly who did what.

1914
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:27,840
Okay,

1915
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:31,240
so now that you have logged in
and we'll know who

1916
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:34,320
your we'll know your username, okay?

1917
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:38,560
I'm telling you right now,
please don't do anything in JIRA,

1918
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:42,840
okay? Or,

1919
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,600
or you know, I'll ask you,

1920
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:52,160
why didn't you follow instructions right.

1921
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:56,000
Cool.

1922
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,560
Does that
does that make sense? Guys, just.

1923
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,200
Just log in.

1924
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,520
See if you logged in that You logged in.

1925
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:05,480
Cool. That's all you have to do.

1926
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,200
Okay.

1927
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,280
That's all you have to do.

1928
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:11,560
Cool.

1929
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:12,360
Got it.

1930
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:16,480
And if some students come late
or we have some friends in this class,

1931
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,200
please tell them the same thing to say.

1932
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:21,040
Hey, log in. Okay. And that's it.

1933
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,400
Okay. Okay. That's it.

1934
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,720
You logged in. That's all you had to do.

1935
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,600
Now log back out and we'll touch that.

1936
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,360
We'll touch it next week.

1937
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:34,800
Okay, Cool.

1938
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,360
Go. Cool, cool, cool.

1939
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,000
All right.

1940
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:45,920
So, no, you don't have to get an email.

1941
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:50,360
You have to read the course announcement
channel and you'll know how to do it.

1942
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:54,040
So just go ahead and do it and you'll see.

1943
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:55,600
All right.

1944
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,800
So all right, let's let's continue.

1945
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:59,280
Let's continue this. Continue.

1946
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,680
Are you ready
or are you ready, guys? We're taking this.

1947
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:03,720
We're going to next dimension enough.

1948
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:06,640
You guys are the smartest batch
we've ever had.

1949
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:08,400
You guys are making this so easy.

1950
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:10,680
So we're going on five levels higher.

1951
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,200
Okay, Are you ready? Yes or yes?

1952
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,680
You ready or are you ready?

1953
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:17,400
Lewis, are you there?

1954
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,000
Anthony, are you there?

1955
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,240
Dominic, are you there?

1956
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:24,120
Alexis, are you there?

1957
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:27,840
Jimmy, are you there?

1958
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:28,720
Where's.

1959
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:30,720
Where's Louie?

1960
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:32,320
Louie, Are you there?

1961
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,400
Dominic Is there.

1962
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:36,720
Who was that?

1963
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,800
We have What was her name

1964
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,720
too? Tamanna, Are you there?

1965
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,400
Miriam?

1966
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:47,240
You there?

1967
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,080
I'll remember your names.

1968
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,040
That's fine.

1969
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,720
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

1970
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:55,680
Ready?

1971
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:58,480
All right, here we go.

1972
01:45:58,480 --> 01:45:59,280
Okay.

1973
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:01,680
What's going
on? We're moving on. We're moving on.

1974
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,480
We're moving on. Ready?

1975
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:07,320
All right,
so now we're going to move to talk about

1976
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:13,120
the different types of testing we can now,
this is going to get very interesting,

1977
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:16,200
but it's going to make a lot of sense.

1978
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:17,040
Okay.

1979
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,480
We're going to learn about functional
and nonfunctional testing.

1980
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:25,000
We're going to learn about the software
testing hierarchy.

1981
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:25,640
Right.

1982
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:27,720
We've already covered
hierarchy before. Right.

1983
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:29,080
So we're going to talk about that.

1984
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,440
We're going to talk about
regression testing.

1985
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,520
We're going to talk about ad hoc testing.

1986
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,520
We're going to talk about smoke testing
and finally, compliance testing,

1987
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:42,640
white boxes, but black box testing right
now, these are all buzzwords you

1988
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:45,520
but they're all going to make sense
by the end of the class code.

1989
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:48,120
What is the requirements
for stability matrix?

1990
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:51,200
We are going to come back after
once we work with zero.

1991
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:51,840
Okay.

1992
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:54,680
So these this list is like this.

1993
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:56,480
I will come back to it. Okay. All right.

1994
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:58,760
Are you ready, guys?

1995
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:00,960
Are you ready? Yes. Yes. Okay.

1996
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:02,520
All right.

1997
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:04,720
Let's keep it simple, All right?

1998
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:09,480
There are only two types of

1999
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:18,120
only two types of testing Can.

2000
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:22,040
How many types are there?

2001
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:23,400
Only two.

2002
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,160
Okay.

2003
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:28,160
Functional and non functional.

2004
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:31,560
Okay. Functional.

2005
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,600
A non functional.

2006
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,160
Yeah.

2007
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:35,520
Does that make sense?

2008
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,680
We're going to talk about what that is.

2009
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,320
All right.

2010
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:45,440
How many types of testing are there?

2011
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,480
Functional testing.

2012
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,320
What is functional testing?

2013
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:53,360
Okay, Functional testing is a type
of testing where we test the functionality

2014
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:58,440
of an application game.

2015
01:47:58,440 --> 01:47:59,880
What are we testing?

2016
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:03,800
Buttons, dropdowns, text boxes,

2017
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,760
links?

2018
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:10,920
What else, what else functionalities,

2019
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:13,080
anything, functionality
on the web application.

2020
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:13,760
What else do you do?

2021
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:18,320
Are are buttons, dropdowns, text boxes,
radio buttons,

2022
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,480
checkboxes,

2023
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:24,920
you know, small menus,
you know everything.

2024
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,880
Everything, everything. Everything. Okay.

2025
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,040
That is what we call functional testing.

2026
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:31,360
And there's a lot of functional testing

2027
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:35,160
that we are going to be doing
because it is also very important.

2028
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:39,120
Yes, it could be verifying text,
it could be verifying layout, too.

2029
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:40,680
Sometimes. So that's an extent.

2030
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,400
And we're going to talk about that
as well.

2031
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:45,360
Okay.

2032
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:50,240
So first thing we do when a code
or new functionality comes from developers

2033
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,520
is we make sure
that the functionalities are working okay

2034
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,520
to business requirements
and that there are no bugs.

2035
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,880
Functional testing is performed

2036
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:03,960
by manual testers and by automation team.

2037
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:04,360
Okay,

2038
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:09,480
who does that make sense so far?

2039
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:11,640
And we're going to talk more about
about how that works.

2040
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:16,800
Term functional tests can be being able
to log in with valid credentials

2041
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:20,760
right in that test case, what you're doing
is you're going to the text boxes,

2042
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:25,200
you're typing in characters,
you're clicking a button, right?

2043
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,680
That's you're
testing those functionalities out.

2044
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,280
Does that make sense?

2045
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:32,040
Okay,

2046
01:49:32,040 --> 01:49:35,280
there are some weird bugs
sometimes with some real projects

2047
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:38,520
where you try to enter something
in a username box or something like that

2048
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,840
and nothing is being in the box,
nothing that can be about read

2049
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:45,280
the functionality there is not working.

2050
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:49,120
Okay, Now all of that is done
manually, right?

2051
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:52,320
You're typing manually,
you're clicking manually,

2052
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:55,400
but that test case can also be automated.

2053
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:57,960
Right now I want to show you
the automation test. Last class

2054
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:01,000
number, I showed it yesterday.

2055
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,360
I showed you guys
automation execution. Right?

2056
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:06,560
But if I were to do that
manually, it's going to be like me

2057
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:10,640
clicking me typing, entering,
you, doing things manually, right?

2058
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:16,560
So those functional test
cases can be automated.

2059
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:21,840
Does that make sense to.

2060
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,480
All right, cool.

2061
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:27,720
Then there is non functional testing.

2062
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:32,120
Okay, There is nonfunctional testing
and what does this mean?

2063
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:36,400
So we know the functional testing is
but now there

2064
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:39,280
a different type of testing
that's called nonfunctional.

2065
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:41,400
Okay.

2066
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,880
It focuses on the way
that a system operates

2067
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,320
rather than specific
behaviors of the system.

2068
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:49,080
Okay, so what is an example for this?

2069
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:50,400
Okay.

2070
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:56,520
So I'm going to give you example
of a nonfunctional testing scenario.

2071
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:57,800
Okay. Okay.

2072
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,240
You know what?

2073
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:01,440
Functional testing is clicking
and logging in and checking out.

2074
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:03,920
You know, you're clicking
buttons, all this stuff.

2075
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:07,280
But there are other types of testing
that take place.

2076
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:11,680
One of those types of testing
is what we call performance testing.

2077
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:17,840
We and you will not perform
that kind of testing.

2078
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:19,240
Okay.

2079
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:22,600
Usually this testing is done by developers

2080
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,640
and this performance testing

2081
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:33,200
is basically testing the performance
of an application by trying to see

2082
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:37,800
how many users
the application can hold at once.

2083
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,040
Okay.

2084
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:42,160
So for example,
we talked about environments last class.

2085
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:46,200
And one thing that Amazon does right
is that they run,

2086
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:49,240
they do some type of testing
that's called performance testing.

2087
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:54,600
And what they do
is they basically run this test

2088
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:57,920
that will

2089
01:51:58,440 --> 01:52:00,560
add like thousands of users

2090
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:03,320
at once to the application

2091
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:08,200
to see if the application will break
or anything like that.

2092
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:11,160
Again, the reason for this is because

2093
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:14,520
they want to make sure
that their application can hold thousands

2094
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:19,080
and probably thousands
and millions of users of that application.

2095
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:23,040
It doesn't test the whole infrastructure,
but it tests the performance

2096
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,640
of the application. Okay.

2097
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,120
Let me give you an example.

2098
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,120
Do you remember?

2099
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,120
Yes, exactly.

2100
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:33,320
Developers only do nonfunctional testing
very well.

2101
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:37,800
So the thing is that do you guys remember
like last Black Friday?

2102
01:52:37,800 --> 01:52:38,520
Right.

2103
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,240
And I don't know if you guys like
to shop there in Black Friday,

2104
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:44,920
but obviously everyone was
closed because of COVID and

2105
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:48,280
Costco had some great deals.

2106
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:51,120
Right? Costco had some great, great deals.

2107
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:56,400
And everyone was looking for
the online sales and everything like that.

2108
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:00,160
Well, the thing is that
when I went on the Costco website,

2109
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,880
the website was down, okay?

2110
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:06,840
And the website was down
because too many users

2111
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:09,960
tried to use it at once.

2112
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:10,840
Okay.

2113
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,480
Walmart was down, too.

2114
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,520
Okay. There you go. Okay.

2115
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:17,880
So what that showed me, right

2116
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,720
as a tester or any developer
that wanted to go on Costco, Costco

2117
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:24,840
is that their application obviously

2118
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,320
cannot handle many users at once.

2119
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:28,680
Right?

2120
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:31,440
Maybe the performance team,

2121
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:34,720
maybe the developers
didn't run the right performance testing.

2122
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,240
Right.

2123
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:43,120
But it just the system was down right?

2124
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:46,360
Okay. It was. It was down.

2125
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,840
Yeah.

2126
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:51,840
Now, imagine during Black Friday

2127
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:55,560
where Amazon makes a lot of their
money and Amazon was down,

2128
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,240
Right.

2129
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:59,680
Well, what happened then?

2130
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:04,280
How much money would they lose?

2131
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,960
They would lose so much money.

2132
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,720
A lot of money. Too much money. Right.

2133
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:13,080
So we are very sure

2134
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:16,160
that Amazon is doing some next level.

2135
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:19,720
And same thing
with all these big companies, Disney,

2136
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:25,280
you know, Amazon, now Netflix.

2137
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,960
So software test.

2138
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,240
So software
testers can log stress testing.

2139
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,480
No, we don't do stress testing.

2140
01:54:31,480 --> 01:54:34,360
We're going to talk more about that type
of testing journal in just a second.

2141
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:35,360
Okay.

2142
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,600
Facebook, Instagram, right.

2143
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,680
You you name it. Right.

2144
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:45,200
These applications need to be able
to hold so many users at once.

2145
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:48,240
Okay. Does this make sense so far?

2146
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:51,800
That is a type of nonfunctional testing,
right?

2147
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,760
You're not testing functionalities.

2148
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,760
You're not testing to

2149
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:58,920
then you're not testing
to see how like a button,

2150
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:01,440
if one is working,
a dropdowns are working,

2151
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:08,440
the developers are using different
programs to perform this kind of testing.

2152
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:11,840
Don't worry,
you don't have to know how to do it.

2153
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,000
Okay.

2154
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,920
But you should just know
what performance testing is.

2155
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,640
Okay. Does that make sense

2156
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:20,640
code?

2157
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:23,640
So that is just one example.

2158
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,560
Okay, that is just one example

2159
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:28,840
code.

2160
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,640
So software testing hierarchy.

2161
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:33,400
Okay, cool.

2162
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:37,160
So this hierarchy right here is

2163
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:40,920
is is kind of it
is exactly what we actually talked about.

2164
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:41,920
Okay.

2165
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:46,720
But it's one so that you're responsible
for not you guys will be doing

2166
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:51,000
nonfunctional testing but different types
of nonfunctional testing.

2167
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,360
Okay. You guys will be testing rest APIs.

2168
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:58,040
You guys will be doing API testing,
you guys will be doing backend testing

2169
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,320
with sequel.

2170
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,520
When you guys start

2171
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:04,200
writing sequel queries and everything
that is nonfunctional testing.

2172
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:06,560
We're going to talk
more about that in just a second. Okay.

2173
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:10,760
So this right here, this nugget,
this hierarchy, you guys are right.

2174
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,120
When we talked about one, two,
three, four, right.

2175
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:17,360
So in this diagram right here, we have
what's called unit testing.

2176
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:19,920
Okay,
So what I didn't tell you last class is

2177
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,040
unit testing.

2178
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,840
Developers

2179
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:32,880
develop their code and what environments,
what environment and the dev environment.

2180
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:35,480
Right. Very, very good.

2181
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:37,560
But what they also do,

2182
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:41,360
right, what they also do is they do

2183
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:44,880
what's called they perform
what's called unit testing.

2184
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:45,960
Okay.

2185
01:56:46,360 --> 01:56:49,560
And Unit testing is done by developers.

2186
01:56:49,880 --> 01:56:53,720
And what unit testing is, is
they test in a development environment,

2187
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:57,280
but they're really testing their own code.

2188
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:58,480
Okay.

2189
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:02,200
They have some different testing
techniques to test their own code.

2190
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:05,200
There's a lot of different types
of testing techniques that they use that

2191
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:07,160
they have to make sure that their code

2192
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:09,760
satisfies certain requirements
and something like that.

2193
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,640
Right. You don't need to know that.

2194
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:15,360
You just need to know what unit
testing like, what kind of testing

2195
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:18,640
developers do and it is done
in development environments.

2196
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:20,200
Does that make sense?

2197
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,920
Okay.

2198
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:23,880
Okay, cool.

2199
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,040
Then comes integration testing.

2200
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,880
Okay. And in this phase right here,

2201
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:33,560
we have integration
and this is the dev environment.

2202
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,560
Now this is the Q8 test environment.

2203
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:38,760
Now you guys will be doing
functional testing, but

2204
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:43,200
we also call it integration testing.

2205
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:47,040
It's not done by developers,
it's actually done by the Q team.

2206
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:52,000
Some developers can do it,
but it's done by the Kuwaiti dev.

2207
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,320
And what does that mean?

2208
01:57:53,320 --> 01:57:55,600
What is integration testing?

2209
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,120
That is a very good question.

2210
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:01,080
So what integration testing is

2211
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:05,160
okay, is this
and this is where you're going to start

2212
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:08,720
to to realize the magic
behind these applications.

2213
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:11,880
Yeah, let's think about Amazon.com.

2214
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:13,080
Okay?

2215
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,040
When we go to Amazon.com, right,

2216
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:20,880
we think like, oh, we're on Amazon, right?

2217
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:21,520
Yeah.

2218
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:23,600
When we go here, we click anywhere.

2219
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:27,600
As a user, we still think that we're on
Amazon.com, right?

2220
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:32,280
But the thing is that this is not just one
application.

2221
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:36,480
There are a lot of modules
that were developed separately

2222
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,440
that at the end were integrated

2223
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:43,760
with the Amazon home page.

2224
01:58:43,760 --> 01:58:48,640
So, for example, if I come here
and I click on Prime or if I come here

2225
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,960
and remember that test is now run
and we click prime video

2226
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:57,160
and it takes us to the preview homepage,
this is a separate module

2227
01:58:57,200 --> 01:59:02,720
that was developed
separately from the Amazon.com home page.

2228
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:05,280
Okay, This is a separate component.

2229
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:09,320
But what they did
was they integrated this with

2230
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:13,680
so that we can access it
from the Amazon home page.

2231
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:15,640
Does that make sense?

2232
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:19,800
So you guys will be performing
integration testing

2233
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:23,960
without even knowing that you guys are
performing integration testing.

2234
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:24,840
Okay.

2235
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:28,160
For example, here Prime
video is a different component

2236
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:31,200
that has been integrated the Amazon home
page, right?

2237
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:35,320
The toys and games section, the Kindle
books, the version of pharmacy, the books.

2238
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:37,920
Right.
The books is also a different component.

2239
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:39,200
Okay.

2240
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:43,200
And Amazon has so many development teams

2241
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:46,080
that work
on all of these different modules.

2242
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:48,440
They don't have one team
that works on everything.

2243
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:50,520
They have so many different teams.

2244
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:53,120
I mean, so much work
goes into all of this.

2245
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:56,240
So, so much work goes into all of this.

2246
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:56,520
Okay.

2247
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,760
Does that make sense to you guys?

2248
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:01,400
Does that make sense?

2249
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:05,720
So let's talk more about other types of
integration testing that we'll be doing.

2250
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:07,120
Oh, Facebook.

2251
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:08,640
Who has Facebook

2252
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,920
who has Facebook?

2253
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:15,600
If you want to message
someone on Facebook from your phone,

2254
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:19,760
you know, you have to download
an application called messenger, Right?

2255
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,760
And that messenger application
is that messenger

2256
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,560
is actually a separate application.

2257
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:28,240
Right.

2258
02:00:28,240 --> 02:00:32,600
But the way it works is that it's
integrated with Facebook app, right?

2259
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:33,960
So that when you go on Facebook

2260
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:38,560
and you want to message someone,
then the messenger application opens.

2261
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:41,040
Does that make sense? Right?

2262
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:44,720
Do you guys understand that?

2263
02:00:44,720 --> 02:00:45,960
Cool, same thing?

2264
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:49,440
And you can think of many other types
of applications.

2265
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:52,240
Okay, cool.

2266
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:52,680
All right.

2267
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:57,120
So you guys will be doing a lot
to talk more about this in just a bit.

2268
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:57,760
Right.

2269
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,440
So then after that call system testing
and we put this with the

2270
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:04,160
with the weight testing team, right,

2271
02:01:04,560 --> 02:01:07,840
with the world stage testing the UHC,
what does Unity stand for?

2272
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:11,640
You guys remember I told you guys,
what does your weight stand for?

2273
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:15,480
What unity stand for

2274
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:17,960
with this?

2275
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:23,520
Come on, let's see your notes and we'll
learn about that to user acceptance.

2276
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:26,720
What user acceptance? What

2277
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:29,920
user acceptance? Testing.

2278
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:31,560
Nikolai That's right.

2279
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:34,000
Okay. User acceptance testing. Right.

2280
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:38,960
And what they do is who does unity?

2281
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:41,280
Who does unity testing

2282
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:43,320
the client.

2283
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:43,960
Right.

2284
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:48,240
But do we know exactly how the client
is going to test their application

2285
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:51,600
so we know exactly how they're going
to test it now right.

2286
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:55,440
But we do know that they're going to test
what we said pass, right.

2287
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:56,040
Passes.

2288
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:58,800
They're going to make sure of that. Right.

2289
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:00,840
They're going to do this type of testing.

2290
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:02,040
Those system testing.

2291
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:04,560
They're going to test everything,
the whole system. Right.

2292
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:06,920
There's a lot of testing
that goes onto system testing.

2293
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:09,240
We may have to help with that.
That's fine.

2294
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:09,800
Okay.

2295
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,040
And what does that mean?

2296
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,320
That actually means a lot.

2297
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,520
For example,
the Amazon account page, right?

2298
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:18,240
When you do system testing,
they're going to test Amazon.com.

2299
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:20,160
They're going to run so many tests.

2300
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:24,360
But a of other testing needs to know that
a lot of other testing needs to happen.

2301
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:27,000
One unit testing, right?

2302
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:30,640
Developers have to test the code
performance testing we've to make sure

2303
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:35,080
that millions of users can use the
they can use Amazon.com

2304
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:40,320
without Amazon breaking
three security testing right.

2305
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:43,640
They actually have
to run their security scans.

2306
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:47,440
They have to see that the security
engineers have to see if they can

2307
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:51,960
hack the system, see if see if it's

2308
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,240
if it's if it's secure.

2309
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:57,360
We actually have a penetration tester
here.

2310
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:01,400
Lewis In class,
who can talk more about that,

2311
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,880
who has a lot of experience doing that.

2312
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:08,400
But they do a lot of this testing.

2313
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:11,000
They've got to make sure
that they're doing all of this testing.

2314
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,200
Okay.

2315
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,880
And what they also do is they

2316
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:23,800
these applications are hosted
on a cloud server these days.

2317
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:24,720
Right?

2318
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:27,880
You've probably heard buzzwords like NWS,

2319
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:32,160
you know, Microsoft Azure,

2320
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:35,280
different servers,
all of that stuff, right?

2321
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:40,560
Everything that is integrated
or that the application uses.

2322
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:44,760
Okay, is what is going to be tested.

2323
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:46,880
Everything,
not just the application process.

2324
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:48,840
Absolutely everything.

2325
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:49,320
Okay.

2326
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:55,800
Does that make sense to everyone?

2327
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,080
And you may be

2328
02:03:58,200 --> 02:03:59,800
you may be assisting with that system.

2329
02:03:59,800 --> 02:04:03,560
That's obviously the testing
that you will do is, only going

2330
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:07,360
to be part of that system, testing
all the functional testing that you're

2331
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:09,640
going to be doing, all the integration
testing you're going to be doing.

2332
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:13,640
All of that is going to be part
of the system testing

2333
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:16,120
that will be done as a whole.

2334
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:19,480
Does that make sense? Cool.

2335
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:24,000
So everyone takes part of this, everyone
takes part of system testing everybody.

2336
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:25,680
Okay, cool.

2337
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:26,480
And then acceptance.

2338
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:29,600
We left it up here because then the client
just will do what they need to do.

2339
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:30,240
Okay.

2340
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:33,880
So let's talk about unit
testing again, unit testing is

2341
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:37,400
is is there's two type of tests and I'm

2342
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:40,760
going to talk it's going to call white
box testing and black box testing.

2343
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:41,400
Okay.

2344
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:45,000
Unit testing is considered
a white box testing.

2345
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:50,880
White box testing is a type of testing
where you are actually testing

2346
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:53,800
the internal parts of the application,

2347
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:57,320
meaning you need to understand the code,

2348
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:01,440
You need to understand the code
that the application was developed with.

2349
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:05,680
You need to be able to test
and actually know how this code works.

2350
02:05:06,080 --> 02:05:09,960
Who else knows that other than developers
write only they know it.

2351
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:12,680
They're the ones that are developing
the application.

2352
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:14,320
Does that make sense? Right.

2353
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,520
So they perform white box testing.

2354
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:18,640
They're the ones that perform unit
testing.

2355
02:05:19,240 --> 02:05:23,640
Okay, We do not perform unit testing.

2356
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,800
Game developers perform DNA testing in
the done environment integration testing.

2357
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,160
We're really talked with this.

2358
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:35,520
You will learn you can read more of this
of this testing system testing.

2359
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:38,000
We talked about everything red everyone

2360
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:41,760
has to do part of of

2361
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,360
system testing, your manual testing,
your automation,

2362
02:05:45,800 --> 02:05:49,320
everything that is part of system testing

2363
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:52,840
and then acceptance testing.

2364
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,480
We all know what it is.

2365
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:56,640
We already talked about that. Okay, cool.

2366
02:05:56,640 --> 02:06:00,960
So how many types of testing are there?

2367
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,040
Only two, right?

2368
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:05,880
There's functional and nonfunctional,
but now the different types

2369
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:09,800
of testing
that we just discussed are types

2370
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:15,160
and they fall under either
functional or nonfunctional testing.

2371
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:16,720
Does that make sense?

2372
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:22,640
Okay, so there's only two,
but system testing, integration, testing,

2373
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:26,760
all of these, they either fall
under functional or nonfunctional.

2374
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:27,120
Okay.

2375
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:31,400
But in the end, only two types of testing
that are functionality nonfunctional.

2376
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:33,760
And we're going to talk
more about this now.

2377
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:34,600
Okay.

2378
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:39,360
There are different types of testing
that you guys be hearing a lot

2379
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,720
that you guys will be conducting a lot
and some of them you won't.

2380
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:45,120
One of them is called smoke testing.

2381
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:47,560
One is
one of them is called regression testing.

2382
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:50,600
We have performance testing
and we have ad hoc testing.

2383
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:53,160
Okay, Smoke testing.

2384
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:54,600
What is smoke testing?

2385
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:57,320
Okay. A smoke test is a quick

2386
02:06:58,760 --> 02:06:59,240
sometimes it

2387
02:06:59,240 --> 02:07:02,280
can be a long, but it's a quick test

2388
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:04,920
and it's a it's a small number of tests

2389
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,240
that actually test the most important

2390
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:11,600
basic functionalities of the system.

2391
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:15,240
Okay.

2392
02:07:15,240 --> 02:07:20,640
So, for example, logging in with valid
credentials, being able to check out.

2393
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:21,440
Right.

2394
02:07:22,080 --> 02:07:25,160
And purchase something, being able to,

2395
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:27,120
you know, something,
you get the idea, right?

2396
02:07:27,120 --> 02:07:31,640
So very basic,
but important functionalities can

2397
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:34,720
this okay.

2398
02:07:34,720 --> 02:07:37,720
So in a real life scenario is

2399
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:41,920
like when you get in your car, right,

2400
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,160
your car has so many features
that are very, very important, right?

2401
02:07:46,520 --> 02:07:49,720
It actually has so many features,
but it actually has a number of features

2402
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:52,080
that are more important than others,
right?

2403
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:57,000
You get in your car, you make sure that
that the lights are working right.

2404
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:59,880
You make sure that the windshield
wipers are working.

2405
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:01,800
You make sure that the brakes are working.

2406
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:06,240
You make sure that the view mirrors
can move, that you can put your seatbelt.

2407
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:06,800
Right.

2408
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:10,320
So all these things would be something
that's considered a smoke test

2409
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:11,280
right there. The most

2410
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:15,480
important functionalities
of, in this case, your car.

2411
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:19,360
But what about testing the radio
to see if it works

2412
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:21,520
right?

2413
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:25,560
Is that like, important functionality
that you would consider,

2414
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:29,520
like as as like checking your brakes
or your seatbelt?

2415
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:30,880
Right.

2416
02:08:31,800 --> 02:08:34,200
What about like,

2417
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:37,560
give me something else in your car
that's not like a big deal.

2418
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,600
You know what?

2419
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:42,760
What else would be considered
a low priority in your car?

2420
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:45,000
AC There you go.

2421
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:45,720
Okay.

2422
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:47,760
Wipers are a big priority, right?

2423
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:49,480
If it rains, you're needed.

2424
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,360
Okay. Seats moving or not.

2425
02:08:51,360 --> 02:08:54,440
If your Bluetooth is or
not that your seat reclining,

2426
02:08:54,600 --> 02:09:00,240
these are not as important as you know,
making sure that the brakes are working,

2427
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:04,320
making sure that the directional lights
are working, that your mirror is working.

2428
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:06,840
So that similarly we do this

2429
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:11,400
with with
applications we call them smog testing.

2430
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:12,360
So for

2431
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:15,720
with my project
I work, we actually have smog

2432
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:18,600
test cases
that are executed every single morning.

2433
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:24,600
And these are test cases
that cover logging and a user being able

2434
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:29,000
to like check out to perform
certain important functionalities.

2435
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:31,280
And it's not many test cases.

2436
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:33,720
It's actually for one application.

2437
02:09:33,720 --> 02:09:35,760
We have like ten test cases executing

2438
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:37,440
that.

2439
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:40,560
That's all we have.

2440
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:43,320
But for example,

2441
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:47,240
an image to verify that an image
displays, right?

2442
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:50,000
Is that as important
as someone being able to log in?

2443
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:53,040
It's not right.

2444
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:55,360
It's not sure it has some importance,

2445
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:58,280
but it's not as important
as being able to log in.

2446
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:00,840
Okay, So it makes sense.

2447
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:04,400
So those kind of tests,
the ones that I just talked about,

2448
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:07,800
like checking of the
images, they're checking of

2449
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:12,120
if I don't know what is something
that is not super high priority

2450
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:16,080
on an application, the spelling,

2451
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:19,680
checking, certain spelling, what else?

2452
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:21,120
What else is there?

2453
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:22,240
Colors.

2454
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:25,640
Maybe colors can be a big deal
and I'll talk about that in just a second.

2455
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,640
What else?

2456
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:29,560
A picture or design?

2457
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:30,600
Something like that. Right.

2458
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:34,080
So all of those are actually what we call
regression

2459
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:37,280
tests, cases of regression testing.

2460
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:39,880
Okay.

2461
02:10:39,880 --> 02:10:43,560
There are certain functionalities
in the application that if they are

2462
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:46,800
broken, okay,
then it's not going to be a showstopper.

2463
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:50,400
It's not okay

2464
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:53,680
if they're just it just depends
on the product that you're working with.

2465
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:54,720
Cool.

2466
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:58,080
Those test cases are still important.

2467
02:10:58,320 --> 02:10:59,720
Okay. Important.

2468
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:03,120
And and you know, they should pass,

2469
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:06,120
but they're not really in most places

2470
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:09,400
as important as smoke test cases.

2471
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:13,760
For example, if tomorrow
we checked our automation report

2472
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:19,160
and we saw that our smoke test filled,
that is a very big red flag, right?

2473
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:22,800
Because that's an indication
that one of our most important

2474
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:25,560
functionalities
in the application is broken.

2475
02:11:25,720 --> 02:11:27,720
Something is fairly good.

2476
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:30,240
So lots of big, big, big red flag.

2477
02:11:30,760 --> 02:11:33,120
Okay.

2478
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:36,240
Now when we run our all regression
test cases.

2479
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:39,680
So as you mentioned, I told you that our
smoke test cases, our smoke

2480
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:43,560
testing, we
think we have 10 to 15 smoke test cases.

2481
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:44,160
Okay.

2482
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:47,040
But you know how many regression
test cases we have?

2483
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:50,400
We have about 300 for one application

2484
02:11:51,120 --> 02:11:53,960
that that are being that are automated.

2485
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:55,040
Okay.

2486
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:59,640
So we run the whole regression
automation, right.

2487
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:02,120
And if something fails,

2488
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:06,000
it's not going to be like a super big
red flag again.

2489
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:07,880
Who decides which kids are Smoke?

2490
02:12:07,880 --> 02:12:08,680
That's the team.

2491
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:11,440
You guys discuss it and we're going
to talk more about that later, actually.

2492
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:12,200
Okay.

2493
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:16,800
But you will you will talk more about that
when you start automating

2494
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:18,320
and stuff like that. Cool.

2495
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:21,160
So the regression test case could fail

2496
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:24,840
and it's not going to be
like a super red flag, you know,

2497
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:27,960
But we it's still going to be a failure
and it should still be addressed.

2498
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:32,000
Does that make sense, guys?

2499
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,480
So that makes sense.

2500
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:35,440
Okay, cool.

2501
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:41,160
Okay, So here's the thing.

2502
02:12:41,160 --> 02:12:46,840
So, okay, when we execute our smoke test
cases, right, we're making that.

2503
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:49,320
We're testing
the most important functionalities.

2504
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,120
Okay?

2505
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:55,640
Now, the reason that we have a regression
of the rest of the regression testing

2506
02:12:55,640 --> 02:13:00,600
is whenever developers do something,
whenever they move their code,

2507
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:04,240
they introduce new changes
to the application.

2508
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:07,920
Okay, We run our regression testing

2509
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:11,120
to make sure that nothing else

2510
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:13,680
existing from the application

2511
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:16,920
was affected by the new changes.

2512
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:18,520
Okay.

2513
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:21,200
Does that make sense?

2514
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:21,800
Okay,

2515
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,520
so every time
there is an update to the code, right,

2516
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:31,840
we need to run our regression
test cases to make sure that nothing else

2517
02:13:32,240 --> 02:13:34,320
was affected by the application.

2518
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:37,560
I remember one time for one project

2519
02:13:37,560 --> 02:13:40,320
developers introduced some new code.

2520
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:43,080
Okay.
And this was for like a new form. Okay.

2521
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:46,040
For a new form that users had to fill out
and stuff like that.

2522
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:51,520
But for some reason, for some reason,
that affected

2523
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:56,760
the forgot password functionality
from our application.

2524
02:13:57,200 --> 02:13:57,880
Okay.

2525
02:13:57,880 --> 02:14:02,000
These two components completely separate
from each other, right?

2526
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:04,560
You know,

2527
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:07,840
you're talking about a form
that users can fill out, right?

2528
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:10,760
That code was introduced,
but for some reason

2529
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:15,240
when that was introduced, the forgot
password functionality was broken.

2530
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:20,520
Users were not able
to reset their password.

2531
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:24,240
That broke
because of the new code changes.

2532
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,040
Do you understand that?

2533
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:29,200
Like, even though things like that
are very different,

2534
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:31,920
they can still have an impact on something
else?

2535
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:32,640
Okay.

2536
02:14:32,640 --> 02:14:37,080
Does that make sense?

2537
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,400
So it makes sense. Okay.

2538
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:39,240
And it can be anything.

2539
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:41,640
And you'll find
you'll find a lot of these things, right?

2540
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:46,560
Amazon can be updating some things
for their for their Halloween

2541
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:49,080
or for their Thanksgiving,
you know, everything like that.

2542
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:52,400
But and not to smoke.

2543
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:55,080
It doesn't work that way.

2544
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:57,360
It cannot end up to to smoke.

2545
02:14:57,880 --> 02:14:59,920
No, it doesn't know

2546
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:01,480
you're smoke.

2547
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:04,800
Test cases should always pass
no matter what.

2548
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:05,440
Okay.

2549
02:15:05,480 --> 02:15:08,120
And there are also other functionalities,
right,

2550
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:12,480
that we talked about like a regression
test is can be like verifying

2551
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:16,440
that an image is displaying
or verifying that a certain text display

2552
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:18,360
is the way it is. Right.

2553
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:19,000
Where do you start?

2554
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,720
Testing and regression of the website
is huge.

2555
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:23,520
That stuff you will come to learn later.

2556
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:26,600
Mohammed Okay,
just understand the concepts right now.

2557
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,200
Okay, cool.

2558
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:31,880
For example, in the car
scenario that I provided, right?

2559
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:36,440
Verify that radio works
or that you can connect to your Bluetooth,

2560
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:38,720
that would be considered a regression
test case.

2561
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:43,760
Okay, cool.

2562
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:44,240
Right.

2563
02:15:44,240 --> 02:15:47,960
So that can be considered a regression
test is at the end, even though

2564
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:52,080
it's not as important as your seatbelt
or your directional lights

2565
02:15:52,480 --> 02:15:57,120
or your brakes working, it's
still a future that makes the car right.

2566
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:59,000
And it should work.

2567
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,840
So it needs to work and it needs to be
addressed and fixed, right?

2568
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:05,360
I don't know.

2569
02:16:05,360 --> 02:16:08,080
But what if sometimes, like

2570
02:16:08,080 --> 02:16:11,280
it's like someone doing an oil
change to your car

2571
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:14,640
and this is not going to happen,
but it's like you're taking your car

2572
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:15,640
to the mechanic shop

2573
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:19,240
and they're fixing like the tires
or something or changing something.

2574
02:16:19,240 --> 02:16:22,080
But for some reason
your radio isn't working anymore.

2575
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:22,800
Okay?

2576
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:25,960
Those two components are like very,
very separate

2577
02:16:25,960 --> 02:16:28,480
from each other. But

2578
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,240
but that's just what happened.

2579
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:32,760
And does that make sense?

2580
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:35,280
And it can happen to these
kind of things just happen.

2581
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:38,080
And that's why regression
testing is important.

2582
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:39,600
Okay.

2583
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:43,040
Performance testing, we already talked
about performance testing.

2584
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:43,880
Okay.

2585
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:46,520
Will you be performing performance testing

2586
02:16:49,960 --> 02:16:51,480
what you know you want?

2587
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:51,840
Okay.

2588
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:55,120
And just FIA performance testing.

2589
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:57,560
Okay.

2590
02:16:57,560 --> 02:16:59,520
Performance

2591
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:04,320
testing is the same thing as load testing.

2592
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:05,360
Okay.

2593
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:08,280
And the same thing, test stress testing.

2594
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:11,040
You may hear these terms,
you may see these terms,

2595
02:17:11,040 --> 02:17:15,000
you may come across them
like they're the same thing, right?

2596
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:15,920
Load stress test.

2597
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:17,880
So you want to stress the system

2598
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:22,000
with many users
to see if your website will break temp.

2599
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:23,560
Cool.

2600
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:25,760
Does that makes sense. It's
all the same thing.

2601
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:28,560
Can it's all the same thing.

2602
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:30,880
Security testing is a little different.

2603
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,480
Yeah.

2604
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:34,760
Cool. All right.

2605
02:17:34,760 --> 02:17:37,760
It can be called spike testing,
load testing,

2606
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:41,000
endurance testing, volume testing,
scalability testing.

2607
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,440
These
all these words are the same thing. Okay.

2608
02:17:43,440 --> 02:17:43,880
All right.

2609
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:44,840
So questions up.

2610
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:47,680
So right now.

2611
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:52,000
Dozens of thoughts right now.

2612
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,360
And we are crushing it today, right?

2613
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:56,440
We are crushing it.

2614
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:57,640
All right.

2615
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:01,400
The next type of testing
is called File a testing.

2616
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:04,080
And by the way,
this is the type of testing

2617
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:06,640
that is actually really, really cool.
Okay.

2618
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:09,120
It's really cool.

2619
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:12,480
You mostly likely will not be doing it.

2620
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,920
Okay. Depends on your project.

2621
02:18:14,920 --> 02:18:15,600
Okay.

2622
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:19,400
But far away compliance testing is a very

2623
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,440
unique and special

2624
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:27,680
type of testing.

2625
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:30,120
There is a law
that's called section 508, right.

2626
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:33,160
Which is a requirement
for government websites

2627
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:36,480
and actually not just websites

2628
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:41,400
for all websites

2629
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:44,600
and in general, like federal departments
and stuff like that.

2630
02:18:44,600 --> 02:18:46,360
So what is by the way.

2631
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:48,160
So this type of testing.

2632
02:18:48,160 --> 02:18:50,640
Okay. And it's and it's

2633
02:18:50,960 --> 02:18:53,400
and it's really enforced
by the government.

2634
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:54,920
Okay.

2635
02:18:54,920 --> 02:19:00,520
This is to basically make sure
that everyone

2636
02:19:00,920 --> 02:19:03,440
can use your application

2637
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:08,160
and when you are developing
an application, when Amazon is developing

2638
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:12,120
an application, Amazon, Target,
Walmart, Disney, everyone read

2639
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:14,960
they are making an application

2640
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:17,680
that is for the general public.

2641
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:18,840
Okay?

2642
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:23,920
That means that the general public
includes people like you and myself,

2643
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:25,040
right?

2644
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:29,320
And what this means
is that people with disabilities

2645
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:32,040
are also part of the general public,

2646
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:37,800
people who are blind, people who are deaf,
people who have hand injuries

2647
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:40,960
that can use the keyboards
or they can use the mouse.

2648
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:44,080
Okay, people
that have some sort of disabilities,

2649
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:48,640
they should be able to use your website.

2650
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:49,480
Okay.

2651
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:51,520
This is called accessibility testing.

2652
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:53,440
Yes, that's true. Okay.

2653
02:19:53,440 --> 02:19:57,320
And there are different tools
that is used for this testing.

2654
02:19:57,440 --> 02:19:58,160
For example,

2655
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:01,400
some of you guys were mentioning something
about colors and stuff.

2656
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:02,200
Okay, I'm

2657
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:06,840
in order for your website to be five
way compliant,

2658
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:10,760
there are some rules that you need
to follow that developers need to follow.

2659
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:13,960
Like, for example,
your colors can be so like,

2660
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,120
like hard, too difficult to tell.

2661
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:21,000
Usually the problems are
when it comes to like white and yellow,

2662
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:22,000
you know what I mean?

2663
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,480
Or some colors that may seem very similar.

2664
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:29,520
Also text and may seem very small
or hard to read or something like that.

2665
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:34,200
If you guys have a Windows, if you guys
have a windows, you can go do this.

2666
02:20:35,760 --> 02:20:37,880
I want you guys to do this.

2667
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:39,680
How to turn on.

2668
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:43,320
NARRATOR On windows ten,
if you guys have a Windows

2669
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:48,520
press, the Windows
logo key, the Windows Key,

2670
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:52,600
press control and enter
and put the volume up.

2671
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:53,600
Okay?

2672
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,600
What this does is it's
going to turn the narrator on.

2673
02:20:57,040 --> 02:21:01,280
So what you're going to see
is that whenever you press a key, it's

2674
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:04,840
going to your computer's going to read you
the key that you're pressing.

2675
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:06,360
Okay?

2676
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:10,080
So if you press like G is going to say,
gee, if you say if you press backspace,

2677
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:13,040
it's going to say backspace
actually going to read it to you.

2678
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:15,720
Okay, The volume needs to be up.

2679
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:16,720
Okay.

2680
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:17,760
That's how you turn.

2681
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:20,000
NARRATOR On with windows. Okay.

2682
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,920
And if you want to turn it on with Mac,
you want to turn on with Mac,

2683
02:21:26,360 --> 02:21:28,000
you need to

2684
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,320
press command f five

2685
02:21:33,360 --> 02:21:35,640
you or you can use Siri.

2686
02:21:35,640 --> 02:21:37,840
So something like turn voice over on

2687
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:41,400
or something like that. Okay

2688
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:43,880
Go ahead and do it.

2689
02:21:43,880 --> 02:21:44,280
Okay.

2690
02:21:44,280 --> 02:21:46,680
And see that whenever you press a key,

2691
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:52,920
okay, you're actually going to to,
I don't know, Google it for Chromebook.

2692
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:56,720
I think it uses an Android OS probably.

2693
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:59,080
Okay, so

2694
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:02,520
Google it and and you're going to see that

2695
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:05,640
put the volume up whenever you press
a key is going to read.

2696
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:06,400
The key back to you

2697
02:22:06,400 --> 02:22:10,360
is going to say like, you know, it's
going to tell you where you're typing.

2698
02:22:10,360 --> 02:22:13,520
Similarly, there are different tools

2699
02:22:14,920 --> 02:22:16,840
that that can test these things

2700
02:22:16,840 --> 02:22:19,960
for these websites can now,

2701
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:23,040
there was an incident
a few years ago where

2702
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:26,840
a lot of
companies were not taking this seriously.

2703
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:28,080
Right.

2704
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:34,480
And so one day a customer,

2705
02:22:34,480 --> 02:22:38,200
a customer
accidentally bought something like

2706
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:42,320
they checked out on the target
website, customer with disabilities.

2707
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:45,360
And this transaction
was for a lot of money.

2708
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:49,080
It was for like thousands
and thousands of dollars.

2709
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:51,840
And this user happened to have that money.

2710
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:54,480
So it was charged.

2711
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:58,160
The user never wanted
to make that purchase and the user

2712
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:03,400
the user sued

2713
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:05,200
because of that

2714
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:07,320
and because of section five or eight,

2715
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:12,120
Target lost millions of dollars
to this user to this customer,

2716
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:16,680
They lost a million
like multimillion dollar lawsuit.

2717
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:22,160
So what happened was right,
as all great companies out there,

2718
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:25,200
they learn from the mistakes of others,
right?

2719
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:28,640
So Amazon, Google,

2720
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:32,840
Disney, Netflix, all these companies,

2721
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:37,840
this what they did,
they started hiring 508 testers.

2722
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:38,360
Right?

2723
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:41,520
They wanted to have a508 compliance team

2724
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:46,480
and they needed to make sure.

2725
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:48,720
And they're still making sure that

2726
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:52,080
that, you know, companies
don't run into this problem.

2727
02:23:52,400 --> 02:23:53,160
Okay.

2728
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:54,040
Because again

2729
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:57,560
and if you ever think of developing
an application for the general public,

2730
02:23:57,560 --> 02:24:01,200
you need to make sure and remember
that the general public includes

2731
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:05,120
everybody, right
even those with disabilities.

2732
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:06,960
Does that make sense?

2733
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:09,160
It can be disabilities of any type

2734
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:12,880
colorblind, blind hands, injured.

2735
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:15,080
You know,
there are folks with no hands, right?

2736
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:17,520
There are folks with with no arms.

2737
02:24:18,520 --> 02:24:20,160
And honestly, if you ever have.

2738
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:21,720
That's a good question, Gerald.

2739
02:24:21,720 --> 02:24:23,760
You can become a fireblight tester.

2740
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:27,760
Once you're in the testing field,
it'll be easy to transition

2741
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:28,920
over to five way tester.

2742
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:32,160
There's different classes
you can take, but it's

2743
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:36,000
actually a type of testing
that is very rewarding.

2744
02:24:36,320 --> 02:24:41,760
Okay, There aren't a lot of people
that do this and it pays very well.

2745
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:42,120
Okay.

2746
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:45,280
I have a friend
who is a five weight tester

2747
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:50,040
and he makes about 200,000 a year salary.

2748
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:51,360
Okay.

2749
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:54,080
So that is that is big money, right?

2750
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:56,400
It's a big, big money, dude.

2751
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:59,240
I know. I didn't even know about this.

2752
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:02,600
And There
are a lot of roles out there in I.T.

2753
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:04,280
that are just as important.

2754
02:25:04,280 --> 02:25:07,400
But this is the type of testing
that is very, very important.

2755
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:08,840
Does that make sense, guys?

2756
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:11,600
Does that make sense?

2757
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:15,280
Okay, cool.

2758
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:17,400
Right.

2759
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:19,440
So just keep that in mind, right?

2760
02:25:20,120 --> 02:25:22,520
So if you ever have the opportunity,
you want to do it

2761
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:24,760
now, I heard it's kind of boring, but

2762
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:28,720
last time I heard making 200,000

2763
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:31,920
a year is not boring.

2764
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:33,280
It's actually a lot of fun.

2765
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:39,200
So anyway, ad hoc testing,
what is ad hoc testing?

2766
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:42,600
Okay,
Another type of testing is ad hoc testing.

2767
02:25:42,600 --> 02:25:47,480
And this is what we call
what is also known as exploratory testing.

2768
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:49,840
Okay. Ad hoc testing.

2769
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:54,240
Exploratory testing.

2770
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:58,840
And really what this is and

2771
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:06,560
and is testing without documentation.

2772
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:10,080
Right? What does that mean?

2773
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:12,720
That means just go and randomly test

2774
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:16,640
the application,
like just go and randomly test it.

2775
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:17,840
Okay.

2776
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:21,520
And after you run your test cases,
especially when there's going to be

2777
02:26:21,520 --> 02:26:24,120
like a big release
to production and stuff like that,

2778
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:29,920
whenever you're testing, you're going to
be performing this kind of testing, right?

2779
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:31,720
You educate all your test cases.

2780
02:26:31,720 --> 02:26:33,920
Let's say they all pass, right?

2781
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:36,720
But just to make sure they're going to ask

2782
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:40,000
the whole team to just go and test
the application, like just

2783
02:26:40,280 --> 02:26:44,120
and randomly test
the application, go and try to break it.

2784
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:46,960
Everyone does
this kind of testing in the project.

2785
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:48,920
You will do it, developers will do it.

2786
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:52,160
Your base will do your
the clients will do it.

2787
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:53,040
They go

2788
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:57,120
and they perform this kind of testing
to make sure that everything works okay.

2789
02:26:57,160 --> 02:27:00,200
Does that make sense, guys?

2790
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:01,640
Does that make sense?

2791
02:27:01,640 --> 02:27:05,120
They go in
that this is a different type of testing

2792
02:27:05,640 --> 02:27:09,920
call.

2793
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:12,120
Okay, cool, cool, cool. Right.

2794
02:27:13,200 --> 02:27:15,240
So plus, exactly.

2795
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:17,920
It's it's like you just go
and see if you can find.

2796
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:21,480
Okay. Retesting.

2797
02:27:21,480 --> 02:27:23,040
Do we know what retesting means?

2798
02:27:23,040 --> 02:27:28,800
What does retesting mean?

2799
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:29,520
We talked about this.

2800
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:32,480
We were talking about the bug lifecycle

2801
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:34,400
to test again

2802
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:35,600
for hard.

2803
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:38,040
You are so smart, man.

2804
02:27:38,040 --> 02:27:40,360
So to test it again tomorrow. Wow.

2805
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:42,120
Unbelievable.

2806
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:43,640
Unbelievable.

2807
02:27:43,640 --> 02:27:46,640
Right. Unbelievable.

2808
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:48,480
Amazing. Right.

2809
02:27:48,480 --> 02:27:49,320
It's retesting.

2810
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:51,360
That's what it is,
guys. Just test it again.

2811
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:53,680
And when do we do a lot of retesting?

2812
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:57,360
Whenever there's a bug, we find a bug
when the bug gets fixed and we retest.

2813
02:27:57,360 --> 02:27:57,960
Right?

2814
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:01,080
That's it. Plain and simple.

2815
02:28:01,080 --> 02:28:02,800
Different testing techniques.

2816
02:28:02,800 --> 02:28:05,360
Okay, so why bugs testing?

2817
02:28:05,360 --> 02:28:06,360
We talked about it.

2818
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:08,360
We basically said that it requires you

2819
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:12,640
to know the internal structures of the
applications and we're the only ones.

2820
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:13,120
I know that

2821
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:15,400
we're the only ones I know that.

2822
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:16,480
That's right.

2823
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:21,360
And what kind of testing
the developers perform.

2824
02:28:21,360 --> 02:28:24,320
So what kind of testing the developers
perform?

2825
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:26,680
Unit testing.

2826
02:28:26,680 --> 02:28:28,400
Very, very good. Right?

2827
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:30,880
Then there's black box testing.

2828
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:34,760
Black box testing does not require you

2829
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:37,600
to know
the internal structure of the application.

2830
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:41,640
If anything, it's testing
as testing the functionalities like that.

2831
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:45,240
What do you think will be doing
that kind of testing?

2832
02:28:45,240 --> 02:28:49,200
We think we do that kind of testing, yes.

2833
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:50,800
Right. They're waiting.

2834
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:52,920
Right, guys, Give yourselves one applause.

2835
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,360
Give yourselves around applause because
you were able to put one and one together.

2836
02:28:56,760 --> 02:28:57,400
Okay.

2837
02:28:57,640 --> 02:28:59,760
Very Very, very good.

2838
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:00,760
Okay.

2839
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:04,240
They're very good code positive testing.

2840
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:05,000
Okay.

2841
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:06,800
A positive test case is.

2842
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:08,640
And here and here it goes Right.

2843
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:11,840
Being able to let's say
the acceptance criteria says something

2844
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:14,880
like being able to log in
with valid credentials.

2845
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:15,840
Right. Okay.

2846
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:17,440
You log in with our credentials.

2847
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:18,960
Bam, That's it. Right.

2848
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:21,440
But to negative test that. Right.

2849
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:22,440
If you want it to.

2850
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:23,480
If you want a negative test

2851
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:28,080
that tried to see if you can log in
with invalid credentials.

2852
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:30,160
Okay. And you shouldn't be able to log it.

2853
02:29:30,800 --> 02:29:32,520
You shouldn't be able to log it.

2854
02:29:33,800 --> 02:29:36,200
Does that make sense to everyone?

2855
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:37,560
You shouldn't be able to log in.

2856
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:41,280
Now, if you do log in
with invalid credentials,

2857
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:45,160
then your negative test case cells can,

2858
02:29:45,240 --> 02:29:48,080
if you want your negative test case
to pass in that scenario,

2859
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:53,280
you should not be able to log in
with invalid credentials then. Okay.

2860
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:58,440
And then we have a boundary value analysis
that's also known boundary testing.

2861
02:29:58,760 --> 02:29:59,520
All right.

2862
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:02,280
So there's this type of testing
where you're going to work with

2863
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:06,000
applications that have text boxes,
text fields and so forth,

2864
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:10,400
and The requirements would say something
like, okay, in this

2865
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:13,440
and maybe you've already use
these applications where there are

2866
02:30:13,440 --> 02:30:17,040
some text boxes, some fields, right

2867
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:21,360
but they have a character maximum, right?

2868
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:24,640
Like you could not like

2869
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:27,720
you can't enter
more than 500 words, right?

2870
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:31,920
Or this text box
will not allow more than ten characters.

2871
02:30:32,040 --> 02:30:37,880
Have you guys ever used or experienced
that with any application?

2872
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:41,400
Have you guys you know, so
what if there's like a form, right?

2873
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:45,440
And it says that, okay,
this form cannot have more than 500 words?

2874
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:49,320
I actually to go in there and type
500 words

2875
02:30:49,920 --> 02:30:52,520
like, okay, one,
two and I'm going to manually count it.

2876
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:55,560
Now what you're going to do
is you're going to put you know,

2877
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:56,520
you're going to think right,

2878
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:58,920
you're going to put your thinking cap on
and you're going to Google.

2879
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:01,720
You're going to
you got to type in word counter,

2880
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,240
word counter.

2881
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:08,400
You click on any link
you want, any link and type of word.

2882
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:11,120
Right. You can type in three words, right?

2883
02:31:11,640 --> 02:31:17,560
What do you think I'm going to do?

2884
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:21,280
Allen Then that says that you're ready
for the market, right?

2885
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,760
You're ready for the market.

2886
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,440
You're ready.

2887
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:27,760
The market. Okay,

2888
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:29,560
You're ready for it.

2889
02:31:29,560 --> 02:31:31,760
Right on that. Right on.

2890
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:32,960
Okay. Okay.

2891
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:38,760
So now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to pull out.

2892
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:40,840
I want to get to almost 500 words.

2893
02:31:40,840 --> 02:31:43,200
I'm at 388. Okay.

2894
02:31:43,600 --> 02:31:45,080
So 492. Right.

2895
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:47,920
So I'm going to type one, two, three,

2896
02:31:48,520 --> 02:31:50,800
four, five, six,

2897
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:53,480
seven Okay.

2898
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:54,520
Eight. Right.

2899
02:31:54,520 --> 02:31:56,760
So I have exactly 500 words. Right.

2900
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,200
So what I'll do is
I'll type a different word,

2901
02:31:59,200 --> 02:32:02,480
so I'll type in
whatever I'll say difference right.

2902
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:04,840
And now I have 501 words.

2903
02:32:04,840 --> 02:32:08,760
If I'm going to test the field,
that will only allow 500 words.

2904
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:09,920
What I'm going to do

2905
02:32:09,920 --> 02:32:14,520
is I'm going to copy all of this
and I'm going to paste it in that box.

2906
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:17,040
Right?
I'm going to paste it in that field.

2907
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:20,160
If I see the word different,
does that mean

2908
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:26,120
that it's a line more than 500 words?

2909
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:29,600
Yes. Right.

2910
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:31,320
That's what some people are saying.

2911
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:33,880
No. And yes, let me repeat that question.

2912
02:32:33,880 --> 02:32:36,120
If I'm testing a field
that will only allow

2913
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:39,600
500 words right here,
we have how many words?

2914
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:41,840
We have 501. Right.

2915
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:45,120
501. But

2916
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:49,000
if I copied all of this
and I pasted this into a field

2917
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,720
that will only allow 500 words,

2918
02:32:52,520 --> 02:32:54,840
but I see the word different here.

2919
02:32:54,920 --> 02:32:56,160
I see the word different.

2920
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:59,040
This word
that I typed in different in that field,

2921
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:04,840
does that mean that it allowed
more than 500 words?

2922
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:05,640
Yes. Right.

2923
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:08,400
It allowed 501 words.

2924
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:09,440
Okay.

2925
02:33:09,480 --> 02:33:14,760
So is that a bug? Yes.

2926
02:33:14,760 --> 02:33:17,040
Is that a showstopper? That

2927
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:19,320
Not really. Right.

2928
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:21,160
Or it's a bug. Right.

2929
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:23,760
So in the application, still working
and still functioning,

2930
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:24,800
everything is still working.

2931
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:26,880
But look, this is a bug, right?

2932
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:29,280
So this make sense,

2933
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:30,720
right? This this is a bug.

2934
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:31,320
Does that make sense?

2935
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:34,320
I want Coca-Cola.

2936
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:34,840
Right?

2937
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:37,680
So that is called boundary value analysis.

2938
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:38,640
It could be with anything.

2939
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:40,920
Like even the password
feels like the password

2940
02:33:41,320 --> 02:33:43,080
should not be more than ten characters.

2941
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:47,040
Still read the forces that try
to create a password with 11 characters

2942
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:50,640
see what happens.

2943
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:52,520
By the way,
I like to say that one of the worst

2944
02:33:52,520 --> 02:33:56,040
websites I have ever used
is the DMV website.

2945
02:33:56,800 --> 02:34:00,240
You know these people in the DMV,
these people, they hate work.

2946
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:00,600
They're

2947
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:03,880
you know, they hate to work there.

2948
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:08,920
For some reason, I went to the DMV
and I was like, why are you working there?

2949
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:12,320
Like, you're like, pissed off I came here.

2950
02:34:12,320 --> 02:34:15,160
I said, Hey, how's it going? And like,
he was pissed off.

2951
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:17,760
I was like, Oh, it's

2952
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:20,440
like it's
they're forcing you to work there or,

2953
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:22,920
I don't know, like, it's

2954
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,120
it's bad, you know? Let me tell you.

2955
02:34:26,600 --> 02:34:30,560
Can you imagine a world where they provide

2956
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:34,840
good customer service, a DMV.

2957
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:37,280
Imagine that, right?

2958
02:34:37,480 --> 02:34:39,440
Imagine that.

2959
02:34:39,440 --> 02:34:43,520
And imagine a world where they provide

2960
02:34:43,800 --> 02:34:46,520
great customer service at the DMV,

2961
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:48,280
Right?

2962
02:34:49,560 --> 02:34:51,320
It'd be amazing.

2963
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:53,040
Yeah, but I don't know.

2964
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:54,240
I don't know why they're so unhappy.

2965
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:57,600
I don't get I've never I don't even know
anyone that works at DMV.

2966
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:00,040
But if I ever do know someone,
I'm going to ask them straight up.

2967
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:03,720
Why do you hate working there
and why do you work there hate it so much?

2968
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:06,840
You know, I really want to ask that.

2969
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:08,680
Yeah.

2970
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,200
Okay.

2971
02:35:10,320 --> 02:35:13,080
Why? Box testing techniques.

2972
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:13,720
Okay.

2973
02:35:14,880 --> 02:35:16,240
Requires programing skills.

2974
02:35:16,240 --> 02:35:18,720
Dito. Programing skills. I'm
talking at the developer level.

2975
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:19,120
Okay.

2976
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:20,400
Most done by developers

2977
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:23,440
when they execute their code
before it goes to the environments

2978
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,960
they conduct, unit testing,
the internal internal

2979
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:30,920
structure of the application
is only known to the developer.

2980
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:34,120
Okay. Yeah.

2981
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:35,960
I agree with Eugene.

2982
02:35:35,960 --> 02:35:38,640
There's a lot of people in the US
that that hate their jobs,

2983
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:40,840
you know, but

2984
02:35:42,600 --> 02:35:43,720
I don't know, man.

2985
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:47,280
That's, I guess that's kind of hard. So.

2986
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:51,400
But you're here, right, Eugene
And that's all that matters, right?

2987
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:53,920
And let's hope you like it.

2988
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:55,720
All right. So

2989
02:35:57,960 --> 02:35:58,800
all over the world.

2990
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:01,240
Yeah. So requires.

2991
02:36:01,240 --> 02:36:04,640
So do Q8 testers perform
white box testing?

2992
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:05,800
Do they?

2993
02:36:05,800 --> 02:36:08,000
Yes. Or they don't.

2994
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,920
Exactly. They don't.

2995
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:13,320
They don't, Right. They do not.

2996
02:36:13,320 --> 02:36:16,960
That is actually write it down
That is an interview question.

2997
02:36:18,040 --> 02:36:18,520
And I'm

2998
02:36:18,520 --> 02:36:21,560
interviewing
people with 1050 years of experience.

2999
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:23,800
And this is one of the questions
that I ask them.

3000
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:28,080
Can this is one of the questions
that I ask them.

3001
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:32,120
Okay, So black box testing requires

3002
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:35,840
no knowledge of internal structures
or anything of the application.

3003
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:39,120
Tester doesn't need to know.

3004
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:41,640
The question is,
what is the difference between white box

3005
02:36:41,640 --> 02:36:43,240
testing and black box testing?

3006
02:36:43,240 --> 02:36:46,680
Okay, black box
testing that Tester doesn't need to know

3007
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:48,160
how the application was developed.

3008
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:51,080
They're testing
basically the functionalities.

3009
02:36:51,080 --> 02:36:52,720
Everything else

3010
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:55,520
is diagram to help you out.

3011
02:36:55,520 --> 02:37:00,200
Okay, So what is the difference between
white box testing and black box testing?

3012
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:00,960
It's very simple.

3013
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:02,280
It's very on. It is very simple.

3014
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:04,280
Very, very easy.

3015
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:06,760
Cool. All right.

3016
02:37:07,440 --> 02:37:12,480
So when earlier when we said to eight,
it was just for positive and negative.

3017
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:15,920
So when earlier we said,
what is the question?

3018
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:25,760
They say, I don't I don't understand.

3019
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:27,240
What is the question? It's

3020
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,440
Q Team does only know.

3021
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:32,880
I don't want you to think about that.

3022
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:35,920
Positive and negative testing
is part of the testing that we'll do

3023
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:39,600
when we perform functional testing right?

3024
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:42,760
Does that make sense? Right, Exactly.

3025
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:45,280
So it's just a different type of person
that we have to do.

3026
02:37:47,160 --> 02:37:50,400
In my box testers should partially, no,
not partially.

3027
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:53,920
Nicolae and white box testing

3028
02:37:55,200 --> 02:37:58,520
the tester
who would be the developer needs

3029
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:02,280
to really know
the internal structure of the application.

3030
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:05,560
Okay. Does that make sense?

3031
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:09,120
So. So Q8 test developer's done? Yes.

3032
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:13,080
Negative and positive testing
are just techniques. Yes.

3033
02:38:14,520 --> 02:38:17,040
This idea from Florida

3034
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:20,320
helping show from Fairfax,
that's like the coolest thing ever.

3035
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:25,000
So what is the difference between smoke
testing and black box testing?

3036
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:25,760
You tell me.

3037
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:29,120
You tell me for hard

3038
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:33,000
When when I tell you
about the smoke test cases

3039
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:36,560
that we have to execute
like logging in, right?

3040
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:39,840
Making sure that we check out so smoke

3041
02:38:39,840 --> 02:38:43,520
testing is a type of black box
testing as well.

3042
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:46,200
Does that make sense?
They are the same thing.

3043
02:38:46,200 --> 02:38:49,720
Cool, cool.

3044
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:53,480
But then again, how many types of testing
are there really?

3045
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:55,560
How many types of testing are there?

3046
02:38:55,560 --> 02:38:57,160
There's only two, right.

3047
02:38:57,160 --> 02:38:59,400
And what are they?

3048
02:38:59,400 --> 02:39:02,400
What are they? What?

3049
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:03,280
What are they?

3050
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:06,240
Functional and nonfunctional.

3051
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:07,000
Right.

3052
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,120
And all the techniques,
all the different types

3053
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:13,280
of testing that we're talking about,
they fall under those categories.

3054
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:14,840
Does that make sense?

3055
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:17,160
They fall under those categories.

3056
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:18,360
Okay, cool.

3057
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:21,360
So white box testing, is it

3058
02:39:21,360 --> 02:39:24,600
a nonfunctional testing
or is it part of functional testing?

3059
02:39:25,720 --> 02:39:26,800
Why box testing?

3060
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:30,000
Is it nonfunctional or functional?

3061
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,680
Guys, guys, white testing.

3062
02:39:34,680 --> 02:39:35,720
Very good.

3063
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:37,360
Okay.

3064
02:39:37,360 --> 02:39:41,040
Are you sure why box testing is functional

3065
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:46,760
or nonfunctional testing?

3066
02:39:46,760 --> 02:39:48,920
What? Why? Why box testing? Right.

3067
02:39:50,080 --> 02:39:50,760
Very good.

3068
02:39:50,760 --> 02:39:52,920
It's nonfunctional.

3069
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:55,160
Okay. Right.

3070
02:39:55,160 --> 02:39:56,400
Black box testing.

3071
02:39:56,400 --> 02:40:00,040
Is it functional or nonfunctional

3072
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:03,480
Black box tested? Yes.

3073
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:06,080
Developers perform
nonfunctional testing, right?

3074
02:40:06,560 --> 02:40:08,960
They're going to test their code.
When they're testing, they're called.

3075
02:40:08,960 --> 02:40:11,280
That's not testing the functionality
of the application.

3076
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:13,800
They're not testing to make sure
that buttons work.

3077
02:40:13,800 --> 02:40:15,960
That dropdowns worry
that the textbooks are working.

3078
02:40:16,200 --> 02:40:18,920
They are testing their code.

3079
02:40:18,920 --> 02:40:21,000
So again, is white box testing

3080
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:26,280
a type of functional nonfunctional?

3081
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:30,760
Nonfunctional Is black box testing
a type of functional or nonfunctional?

3082
02:40:32,120 --> 02:40:33,520
Functional? Exactly.

3083
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:35,160
Does that make sense?

3084
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:40,080
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

3085
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:42,000
Exactly. Mikel That's right.

3086
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,400
Okay. Positive testing.

3087
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:46,800
We already talked about some positive
test cases. Let's see

3088
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:50,840
if you are doing positive testing
for blind functionality.

3089
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:52,920
You are only used valid credit card

3090
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:56,320
number and expiration day
like enter only numbers, right?

3091
02:40:56,920 --> 02:41:01,360
So in this field it says enter
only numbers a type a different way

3092
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:05,440
to negatively test that is insert
characters instead of numbers.

3093
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:06,720
Right.

3094
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:08,040
Have you ever

3095
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:10,840
like gone to an application?

3096
02:41:10,840 --> 02:41:14,760
And for fun, try
to see if you can enter like characters

3097
02:41:16,480 --> 02:41:19,680
like in a number textbox like say, oh,
it only allows numbers.

3098
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:24,840
Let me see if I can type
some characters in there right.

3099
02:41:24,840 --> 02:41:26,560
You listen like a good girl.

3100
02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:28,720
Okay, that's

3101
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:31,880
that's interesting.

3102
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:33,200
It's good to know.

3103
02:41:33,320 --> 02:41:41,120
But has else done that?

3104
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:43,560
Okay. Yeah. So just.

3105
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:46,200
Just just

3106
02:41:46,720 --> 02:41:47,400
you asked it.

3107
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:49,000
We put other characters. Yes.

3108
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,560
Like if you enter, like.

3109
02:41:50,560 --> 02:41:52,680
Like, for example,
if this is only numbers,

3110
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:56,000
have you ever tried to enter characters
to see if it allows characters

3111
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:57,920
once that type letter?

3112
02:41:57,920 --> 02:42:00,560
Oh, instead
it was frustrated that it wouldn't work.

3113
02:42:01,480 --> 02:42:04,720
Oh, as I said, no, I do as I'm told.

3114
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:08,320
Oh, okay.

3115
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:09,240
So cool.

3116
02:42:09,240 --> 02:42:09,840
That makes sense.

3117
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:12,720
Give me an example of a negative testing
that you can do.

3118
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:15,200
What literally anything like

3119
02:42:17,320 --> 02:42:18,120
what else?

3120
02:42:18,120 --> 02:42:19,080
Give me an example.

3121
02:42:19,080 --> 02:42:21,800
Let's think about like let's

3122
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:24,800
let's think about there's a fields

3123
02:42:26,040 --> 02:42:27,560
on the

3124
02:42:28,440 --> 02:42:31,160
when you're when you're up
when you're entering

3125
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:34,360
a credit card or when you're applying
for credit card application.

3126
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:37,400
And let's say it's asking you to enter

3127
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:41,800
a phone number right?

3128
02:42:41,800 --> 02:42:43,640
And it only allows numbers.

3129
02:42:43,640 --> 02:42:45,960
What is a way to negatively test that

3130
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:51,720
entering letters, Right?

3131
02:42:51,720 --> 02:42:53,760
Exactly right.

3132
02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:58,800
What about a field
that says enter valid email?

3133
02:42:58,800 --> 02:43:02,880
How can you negatively test that?

3134
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:05,040
Enter a valid email address,

3135
02:43:06,440 --> 02:43:07,480
enter invalid.

3136
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:10,800
But how would you make it invalid?

3137
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:14,120
How would you make it invalid? Yeah.

3138
02:43:14,240 --> 02:43:16,720
Okay, good.
So you can make an email invalid, right?

3139
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:20,240
Just like saying like for example,
like a valid email would be like

3140
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:22,680
email test dot com.

3141
02:43:22,680 --> 02:43:24,240
Right.

3142
02:43:24,240 --> 02:43:27,080
Maybe you can enter like this
email dot com.

3143
02:43:27,080 --> 02:43:29,280
See if it works. Right?

3144
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:31,920
You can say email at the test icon.

3145
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:34,560
Right. See if it works right.

3146
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:36,000
Does that make sense?

3147
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,400
Just go ahead and see if you can.

3148
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:39,960
Or maybe you can do this.

3149
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:45,480
You can also do email at test
but don't at the dot com.

3150
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:48,840
Right. See what happens.

3151
02:43:48,840 --> 02:43:52,800
Cool.

3152
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:57,400
Will be your gmail with gmail part
I tried with gmail that doesn't work.

3153
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:03,960
Will be your gmail.

3154
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:06,000
Gmail that doesn't work. Okay. Yep.

3155
02:44:07,040 --> 02:44:08,280
Cool. Cool, cool.

3156
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:09,000
All right.

3157
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:11,840
All right
so we've covered this boundary testing.

3158
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:12,800
All right.

3159
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:18,960
So we've already talked about this.

3160
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:22,160
Another type of boundary testing
is when you're entering like, a number,

3161
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:27,360
like it's saying like it's there's a field
is verification code negative?

3162
02:44:27,560 --> 02:44:29,080
What do you mean verification code?

3163
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:36,520
Negative testing would then mean.

3164
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:39,520
What do you mean verification code

3165
02:44:46,600 --> 02:44:48,720
one time password explained like

3166
02:44:48,720 --> 02:44:50,760
what do you
what do you testing in that scenario

3167
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:54,800
and how would how
would that be a negative test is explain

3168
02:44:59,120 --> 02:45:02,320
when you try to log in some application
they sent a verification code.

3169
02:45:02,360 --> 02:45:02,920
Okay.

3170
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:05,160
And what what's your point

3171
02:45:09,240 --> 02:45:12,040
you get a verification code

3172
02:45:12,520 --> 02:45:13,720
and what

3173
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:16,920
how can it be

3174
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:19,840
how what do you

3175
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:22,200
what do you negatively testing
in that scenario.

3176
02:45:23,560 --> 02:45:23,880
Right.

3177
02:45:23,880 --> 02:45:26,520
If you're
if you get sent a verification code

3178
02:45:26,520 --> 02:45:30,240
with most applications,
that means you have already test it.

3179
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:33,000
That means you have already entered
a valid username

3180
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:36,200
and you have already entered
a valid password.

3181
02:45:36,200 --> 02:45:41,760
Right then only once that works,
then you will be sent a one time

3182
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:44,840
passcode right.

3183
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:45,480
Cool.

3184
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:50,800
Right.

3185
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:51,280
Exactly.

3186
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:54,560
So what what is
what do you or what was your question?

3187
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:57,080
I didn't understand it just to.

3188
02:45:57,080 --> 02:46:00,800
Okay, maybe what you can do is
if you get that one time passcode right,

3189
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:07,040
enter the wrong entry, wrong code
and see if it works right.

3190
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:11,200
So, for example, if the 110 passcode says
one, two, three, four, five,

3191
02:46:11,400 --> 02:46:17,440
but I enter 37296
and that works is that like is that bad?

3192
02:46:17,440 --> 02:46:20,960
It is, right, because at that
point it accepted any code.

3193
02:46:22,600 --> 02:46:22,880
Right?

3194
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:25,600
And that at that point
you can negatively test that scenario.

3195
02:46:26,280 --> 02:46:28,880
Does that it does that make sense

3196
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:32,400
that that that answer your question.

3197
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:34,280
Yup so that that would be bad.

3198
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:35,160
That would be

3199
02:46:35,160 --> 02:46:40,160
yes that is a negative test case
entering the wrong one time passcode.

3200
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:40,560
Right.

3201
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:43,160
That can be
that can be a big a very big risk

3202
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:44,800
because at that point
that future didn't work.

3203
02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:47,320
It literally just took anything.

3204
02:46:47,640 --> 02:46:50,960
Okay, cool.

3205
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:52,080
All right.

3206
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:54,000
Very, very good. Okay.

3207
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,040
So we learned a lot today.

3208
02:46:56,280 --> 02:46:58,400
Let's recap what we learned.

3209
02:46:58,400 --> 02:47:01,040
How many types of testing are there

3210
02:47:03,240 --> 02:47:08,360
and what are they, too?

3211
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:09,480
Okay.

3212
02:47:09,480 --> 02:47:14,040
And can you tell me in your own words,
like what is performance testing

3213
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:21,720
like using your own words?

3214
02:47:21,720 --> 02:47:24,720
It's a type of nonfunctional
or functional test performance testing

3215
02:47:25,360 --> 02:47:27,880
Is performance
testing type of nonfunctional?

3216
02:47:27,880 --> 02:47:29,880
Functional, nonfunctional.

3217
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:32,240
Yes, it is considered low testing.

3218
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:34,080
It is nonfunctional. But what

3219
02:47:35,520 --> 02:47:37,440
what what exactly is done

3220
02:47:37,440 --> 02:47:40,360
with performance testing

3221
02:47:42,760 --> 02:47:45,560
is testing to see if the system can fail.

3222
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:46,800
But how?

3223
02:47:47,240 --> 02:47:48,960
Right. They test to see if they can.

3224
02:47:48,960 --> 02:47:52,760
If the application
can can handle many users.

3225
02:47:52,760 --> 02:47:53,360
Right.

3226
02:47:53,640 --> 02:47:55,360
And it doesn't crash.

3227
02:47:55,360 --> 02:47:57,720
Right. Exactly.

3228
02:47:58,320 --> 02:48:05,840
What is a small testing?

3229
02:48:05,840 --> 02:48:08,040
What do you mean important

3230
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:10,240
to quick testing, Quick Testing.

3231
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:12,520
What though?

3232
02:48:12,520 --> 02:48:16,000
Quick
testing of some of the most important

3233
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:19,040
functionalities of the application. Right.

3234
02:48:19,040 --> 02:48:26,320
What is regression testing?

3235
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:32,920
What is regression testing?

3236
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:35,400
Second priority test. That's good.

3237
02:48:35,400 --> 02:48:37,200
That's a very good answer. Lorna.

3238
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:37,520
Right.

3239
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:41,880
And you would usually run it after
developers introduce new code, right?

3240
02:48:42,520 --> 02:48:43,080
Right.

3241
02:48:43,080 --> 02:48:46,680
And then you do your regression testing
to make sure that nothing else

3242
02:48:46,680 --> 02:48:49,760
broke based on the new changes were to do.

3243
02:48:49,760 --> 02:48:50,400
It's right.

3244
02:48:50,400 --> 02:48:53,160
And we talked about we talked about

3245
02:48:53,160 --> 02:48:56,920
how new changes can break
other parts of the application.

3246
02:48:56,920 --> 02:49:01,800
Right goes for example,
maybe a new change was made on some form,

3247
02:49:01,800 --> 02:49:05,520
but for some reason that broke the forgot
password feature, right.

3248
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:09,000
That that can happen as well.

3249
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:09,360
Cool.

3250
02:49:10,400 --> 02:49:13,440
All right.

3251
02:49:13,440 --> 02:49:15,640
White box testing versus black
box testing.

3252
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:18,680
What is white box testing versus black

3253
02:49:18,680 --> 02:49:28,680
box testing?

3254
02:49:28,680 --> 02:49:30,000
White box testing.

3255
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:38,360
White box is only done by the does.

3256
02:49:38,360 --> 02:49:42,480
Okay, but with white box testing,
what do you need to know?

3257
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:45,120
Black box testing don't need to know
internal structure that's good

3258
02:49:45,480 --> 02:49:49,080
with white box testing,

3259
02:49:49,080 --> 02:49:52,560
white box testing.

3260
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:53,480
What do you know?

3261
02:49:53,480 --> 02:49:55,880
You have to know the internal structure,
right?

3262
02:49:55,960 --> 02:49:58,600
You have to know the code red

3263
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:03,440
by box testing is like back in testing.

3264
02:50:03,440 --> 02:50:05,480
No, is not.

3265
02:50:06,120 --> 02:50:06,640
Okay.

3266
02:50:06,680 --> 02:50:09,200
We'll talk more about that later.

3267
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:10,840
Okay, Cool.

3268
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:11,960
All right, guys.

3269
02:50:11,960 --> 02:50:13,480
Very good class today.

3270
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:15,080
All right. Very good.

3271
02:50:15,080 --> 02:50:17,080
We crushed it next week.

3272
02:50:17,080 --> 02:50:19,360
We're all going to be hands on zero.

3273
02:50:19,360 --> 02:50:22,360
And at this point, there's really nothing
new we're going to learn

3274
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:24,960
which is going to work with JIRA.

3275
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:26,640
We're going to create test cases.

3276
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:29,280
We're going to use a lot of this
terminology already learned

3277
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:32,040
is going to we're going
to we're going to finish

3278
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:35,200
we're going to add more color
to to these topics.

3279
02:50:35,200 --> 02:50:35,520
Okay,

3280
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:37,440
cool.

3281
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:39,120
To the point where

3282
02:50:39,440 --> 02:50:41,960
to the point
where you understand it and stuff.

3283
02:50:42,680 --> 02:50:46,200
And then for those of you that don't
really understand this, that is okay,

3284
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:50,160
because at the end of the course
we're going to review all of this again,

3285
02:50:51,480 --> 02:50:53,400
it's not like
we're just going to learn this

3286
02:50:53,400 --> 02:50:55,440
and we're just going to put it behind us.

3287
02:50:56,160 --> 02:50:58,120
We're going to learn this right now

3288
02:50:58,120 --> 02:51:00,240
that you're going to continue
learning everything in class.

3289
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:03,840
And then at the end,
when we review everything, okay,

3290
02:51:04,200 --> 02:51:08,760
like it'll probably and most likely it's
going to make a lot more sense at the end.

3291
02:51:09,400 --> 02:51:09,960
Okay.

3292
02:51:10,200 --> 02:51:12,680
So what program are

3293
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:15,240
we sending the link to download?

3294
02:51:15,240 --> 02:51:18,600
What program are we talking about?

3295
02:51:18,600 --> 02:51:19,480
Me The

3296
02:51:21,720 --> 02:51:23,920
you don't download
JIRA, it's just a website.

3297
02:51:25,240 --> 02:51:25,760
Yeah, it's

3298
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:29,560
just a website and a
please read a sales course.

3299
02:51:29,560 --> 02:51:32,360
Announcements. Okay. Yeah.

3300
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:33,760
So just log on if you can log in.

3301
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:35,680
That's it. Don't do anything else.

3302
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:37,440
All right, guys,
have a great weekend. All right.

3303
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:38,440
And have a great week.

3304
02:51:38,440 --> 02:51:41,640
Keep up your Java skills, All right?

3305
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:43,520
No homework.

3306

Just relax or not. Just relax.
