1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,720
See her experience.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,600
Can you see my screen?

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:20,840
Everyone?

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,960
Great

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,760
and great.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,520
And I will send you the equity that will
definitely help you in that case.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,120
So yesterday,
what was the first thing, guys?

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,640
We don't.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,960
Tell me what was the very first thing
that we implemented

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:55,920
and we.

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,560
That's great.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,200
That's great.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,600
This this is something I'm
looking forward to.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,360
This is something I look forward from
you guys.

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,440
Yeah. Jamal. Correct.

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,480
First, right, we need to identify

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,160
whatever the operations in our framework,
whatever the operation in our framework,

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,040
we are using again and again, right
When we identify

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,520
that these are the operations,
these are the commands

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,320
I will be using again and again
in my framework.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,400
What I will do, basically, I will keep
all of these functions in one class.

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,520
I have one platform right?

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,920
So instead of calling

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
and instead of using

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,520
those commands, let's
say 1000 things in my framework plate.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,560
So it doesn't make any sense. Right?

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
But if I can drive
this particular command,

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,520
this particular function,
it will take from it one place.

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,160
In my framework, I can utilize
the same function again and again.

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,800
All I need to do is
I just need to change the element array.

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,040
For example, click operation.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,400
So to perform,
click on any of the element,

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,080
I don't need to call the entire driver
defined element by dot dot click.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
It doesn't make any sense.

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,640
So the very first thing, what we did,
we put all these common functions,

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,320
all these common methods, for example,
sending the data files in text,

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,560
clicking on operations of click bait
for applicability.

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,880
So grateful click ability
and then JavaScript executable click.

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,720
All of these methods
to put where in common methods

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,560
so that we can utilize these methods.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,000
We can utilize these functions again
and again.

42
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,560
All we need to do
is we just need to update element.

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,560
That's it, right?
This was the first thing.

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,760
The second thing, what we did yesterday
was creating the object repository, right?

45
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,840
The principle of page
object, modern design, python.

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,520
That's what we know why we need this page
object model design python.

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,960
So the very first requirement is
if you are using

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,680
if you're using your locators again
and again,

49
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,360
if you are trying to use your locators

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,960
and in case if your locator change,

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,720
then what happened?

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,880
What would happen in that case, you have
to change your locators at 1000 places.

53
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,200
If you have written them
1000 business rate.

54
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,160
Instead, which object model allows you

55
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,640
to write your object repository
in a particular class,

56
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,000
in a particular feature
that belongs to a particular screen.

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,960
And then you can use the key
for that particular locator.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,880
So now this time you can use the same key
for 1000

59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,960
different classes in different packages
at the same time.

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,560
If your locator changes,
what you need to do is basically

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,640
you just need to update one key like this.

62
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,160
For example, if I have this user name
so I'm not going to use this I.D.

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,160
everywhere.

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,840
I'm going to use this key everywhere
because I made it public.

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,680
Right?

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,680
And then in future, if something changes,
I do need to change it 1000 places.

67
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,880
I would change it here only.

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,000
And then it will be applicable throughout
my project whenever I utilized it.

69
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,920
Correct.

70
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,560
This is what we discussed.

71
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,440
Next thing is.

72
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,240
Next thing is how?

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,920
How are we actually using this page object
model design?

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,800
So basically we are going to initialize

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
the elements by our page
three concept, right?

76
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,280
We generally utilize initialize
these elements,

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,320
how we define the constructor of the class
and inside the constructor of the class,

78
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,600
we write this speech tree, this element.

79
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,800
So init element is the command
to initialize the elements.

80
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,880
Whatever the objects we are writing
and the functions we are writing inside

81
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,040
one class.

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,560
This particular command
allows us to initialize all these elements

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,800
when the moment, the moment we create
the object of this particular class,

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
it allows us to initiate
all these elements, initialize

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,960
all these elements in any other class,
and then we can use all of them

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,760
there, right? For our writing

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,000
that that's what we call framework.

88
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,920
Doesn't matter which website you're using,
the fundamentals,

89
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,840
the basic fundamentals will always be
same, will always be same.

90
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,600
So if you're working for next website,
what would happen?

91
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,880
You will change the you are an objective
state where in configured properties

92
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,680
you have the setup right there
different log in bind.

93
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,120
You can go and put different

94
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,040
user name and different password,
find different locators.

95
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,200
Fine, you can change the pages
according to the application.

96
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,800
For example,
you might not be able log in page,

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,200
you might be having the registration page
or sign signup page as opposed to it.

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Right.

99
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,240
So you can write the code for sign
a patent registration page here,

100
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,120
create a new page for that,

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,560
and then whatever, if you're
working on two websites at the same time.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,680
All right.

103
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,360
So these are two different projects,
let's say.

104
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,640
Right?

105
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,200
If you're handling two different websites
and these are two different projects,

106
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,600
remember, you can't do much to project
in single framework, right?

107
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,560
So if you're handling two projects,

108
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:45,240
then you you'll be heading
to different frameworks.

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,920
If yeah, there are two scenarios, right?

110
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,400
IGLESIAS Let me tell you this.

111
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,480
This is the question, right?

112
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,720
When came to
the explanation came in my mind right now.

113
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,120
So it's going to create a new model
Whenever you go in a frame,

114
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,480
whenever you go and join a new project,
then you have to do it right.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,800
Either
they will give you or you have to create.

116
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,240
Now, no too many of this sentence.

117
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,880
If you're working on two websites, see
two environment and two projects, right?

118
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,280
Blue Project means two different web
application for two different customers

119
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,480
or for two different products.

120
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,960
Basically right there,
obviously you have to use your different

121
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,760
projects, different frameworks,
different syntax, different approaches.

122
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,920
Everything would be different
because customer is different.

123
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,640
But if we talk about same website,
if we talk about same project,

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,880
but you're testing it on test environment,

125
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,680
you are testing it on stage environment,

126
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,880
you are testing it on a site environment,
right?

127
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,720
So these are the three environments
belong to same application,

128
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,840
getting their point.

129
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,720
What we generally do is in for example,
in my current project,

130
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,400
we first test everything on GW1
environment quality,

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,400
then we test everything on site
and land certified.

132
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,240
Then we test everything
on test environment

133
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,280
and then we deploy it onto the product.

134
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,320
And so how many And my mix we have,
we have five environments.

135
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,640
Dev served one test and tried

136
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,240
strategy.

137
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,240
You don't need to copy anything, right?

138
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,280
You just need to understand the concepts,

139
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,520
what you really need
in your framework, right?

140
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,080
This is just to open up
all the avenues right for you

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,760
so that you can create the picture
in your mind.

142
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,320
You can visualize the things you might
because copying

143
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,120
the configured properties
is not a big deal the way maybe.

144
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Yes. Yes. Correct. Subject Correct.

145
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,520
That's what architecture does best.

146
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,000
Architect, Technical architect.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,920
That's what the people do.

148
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,440
If you know the concept,
if you know how things work,

149
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,240
you are able to and you will be able
to create this from scratch.

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,360
All right.

151
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,960
So now in this case, right
where you're testing the same application

152
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,480
in testing one and the same application,
same coding decision,

153
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,880
when we then you need to create
two different frameworks.

154
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,560
No, you don't need to do that.

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,720
What you need to do is you just need
to a bit worried that you need to pass

156
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,960
to a different audience from your content
or property is fine and that is correct.

157
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,160
But if my environment is best,
then take this.

158
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,000
You are in.

159
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,760
If my environment is this big, this
you are like this

160
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,040
and then you will be dealing
with my people.

161
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,480
The way we're passing it for
browser is of no right.

162
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,880
Similarly, you can pass the same thing
for your multiple environments.

163
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,160
Your architect is a high level stuff.

164
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,280
Architect is a high level

165
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,440
engineer is basically a person
who writes the automation script,

166
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,600
but this artist architect is the person
basically who creates the framework,

167
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,160
identify the requirements from technical
point of you, set up the testbed

168
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,320
provides everything to create a readymade
working framework for Kuma engineer.

169
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,600
And what you engineer does
basically start writing

170
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,000
the code and integrate the reports
in the existing framework.

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:37,160
That's what the engineer does.

172
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,720
Yeah, you don't need right now
because we are using the framework, right?

173
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,200
We're using the existing framework.

174
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,560
So we will not.

175
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,080
Then the next topic was bossing
the data layer data provider, right?

176
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,080
So in the advanced degree
I told you right area of it

177
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,200
we created to the Eric yesterday
and we were passing the data

178
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,080
providing data provider
to verify the error rate.

179
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,320
So this was our data provider?

180
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,160
Yeah, correct.
Correct. Many of you guys will not

181
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,720
remember.

182
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,400
Don't call it a website.

183
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,840
This is a project right in the industry.

184
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
When you go, you call it project.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,080
This is my project.

186
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,280
This is your project, right?

187
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,080
Or if this project belongs
to your organization,

188
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,000
it means this is your product, right?

189
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,720
You build in-house things when you will.

190
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,680
In-house things
you develop in-house things.

191
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,960
This is product.

192
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,160
When you build things, then you develop
the things for customer recall project.

193
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,040
This is the difference between project
and product.

194
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960
Product in general itself.

195
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,240
You build in-house
and you try to sell right?

196
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,360
For example,
Amazon Prime Video, Alexa, Netflix,

197
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,880
these are products of these companies
right at the same time projects

198
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,640
if they guys are giving the contract
to other companies

199
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,760
to develop this things
for those companies, these are projects

200
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,840
and that's the difference
in European project and product

201
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,480
all great.

202
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,200
Also let me give you
because we are discussing this thing.

203
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,960
So let me give you another important
information.

204
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,840
Two types of industries we have in I.T.

205
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,120
The first is product based
and the second is service based.

206
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,040
You know, what is the difference between
product based organization and service?

207
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
But organization

208
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
in I.T., in I.T.

209
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,000
industry, technical part,
we have two types of companies

210
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,080
because this product based
and second is service based

211
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,760
product with company,
for example, Facebook I.T.

212
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,560
Company.

213
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,680
But they have their own product, Facebook

214
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,520
messenger, they have their own product,
but they have their own product.

215
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,080
Cisco that is also product
based organization, right?

216
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,760
They have their own products, static.

217
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,240
On the other hand,
the second one is for example, Accenture,

218
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,520
Cognizant Gap, Gemini, right.

219
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,200
They are service based organizations. Why?

220
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,240
Because they think the projects
for different clients,

221
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,640
they work for different
client. For example,

222
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,080
Department of Health and Security, DHS,
D.O.D.,

223
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,280
Bank of New York,
Ally Bank, Jp morgan Chase.

224
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,880
Right.

225
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,440
So these companies take projects
from these clients and they give their

226
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,800
services to those clients.

227
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,160
So these are service
based organization, right?

228
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,680
So two types of industry.

229
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,600
Always remember product based and service
based.

230
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:14,680
Fine, Let's proceed for the device. Yes.

231
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,560
If you want to work on a different
right now for testing.

232
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:18,880
Right.

233
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,680
Right now for learning purposes,
you can utilize this one only.

234
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,360
Right.

235
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,160
But when you go in the organization,
then yes, if there is no framework

236
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,040
in place already, then you're supposed
to create the new one from scratch.

237
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,360
In that case.

238
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,440
All right.

239
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,840
So now now,
let me ask you one thing, guys.

240
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,360
This one hour right.

241
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,080
This one hour, what we are going to
discuss is extremely important, right?

242
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,040
So I just want you to pay
your complete attention for this one hour.

243
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,880
The first thing, what I will do
basically, is I can see here

244
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,520
all in my
this normally first guess, right?

245
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,120
I am writing this discourse
like this. Fine.

246
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,200
But am I using any particular group

247
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,600
or I am utilizing
any text injured or text? Yes.

248
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,480
No. Right.

249
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,560
So let's execute it quickly
using one extended or take symbol.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,440
Right.

251
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,080
Let's create some group
and using that group.

252
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,800
Execute this particular test

253
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,800
in just one minute or 2 minutes
and then we'll switch on to the new topic.

254
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,560
All right.

255
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,960
So tell me, guys,
if I'm going to add some employee,

256
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,920
what type of group would that be?

257
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,840
This test because belong to which group?

258
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:44,280
Any idea?

259
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,200
Obviously smoke, right.

260
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,680
So let me.

261
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,640
Right smoke right now.

262
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,680
Now, tell me strengths
how we can how we can create this

263
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:08,360
and you don't exemplify
how we can do that.

264
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,320
Right? Let me create

265
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,160
correct

266
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,040
right click on the project.

267
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,160
It says create a standard or text symbol.

268
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,040
Select this and it will create your test
and neurotic symbol.

269
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:31,800
You'll see.

270
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,960
Are you getting what I'm doing?

271
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,000
All right now, command.

272
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:48,240
Everyone knows for Windows users
control out and for automatic.

273
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,280
Let me not include the method name here.

274
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,120
Right.

275
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,600
And not take this class.

276
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,760
Also, I'm taking the simple class

277
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,040
now I'm giving

278
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,720
this name as I'm giving this name

279
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,440
as my smoke protect symbol fight.

280
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:07,920
Fine.

281
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:15,160
So this is my smoke
because I need a proper segregation.

282
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,200
Why you do not have you?
What do you have to do?

283
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,040
Basically is just click here
or for plug ins.

284
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,200
Right?

285
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,960
Right here, plug ins.

286
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,680
And here you have to select this one,
create test and examine.

287
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,680
Right in India.

288
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,040
And Masood, in market place,
you have to search for create, test

289
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,080
and do not examine.

290
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,200
For example, if I. Right.

291
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,880
Create this test and examine right.

292
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,200
And when I write this create

293
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,920
test into x email because it is already
installed in my machine.

294
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:50,840
Right.

295
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,760
It will give you a one green icon
like this here to install.

296
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,680
When you click on install,
just click. Okay.

297
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,320
And then after this restart
your intelligent idea.

298
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,040
Right. Intelligent.

299
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,720
Here you will be able to create a new test
and you detect someone fine.

300
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,120
After that, you will get that option.

301
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:22,760
All right.

302
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,520
Negates control all l

303
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,040
All right.

304
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,360
If you're a mac user, then it will be.

305
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,800
Come on, option.

306
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,120
Come on.

307
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,480
And like that, fine. No,

308
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,520
no. After this,

309
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,760
we have to include artist tickets, right?

310
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,680
Based on grouping.

311
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,840
So which group it is right?

312
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,360
The groups here

313
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,440
I'm going to write

314
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:08,720
in this particular test.

315
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,240
And inside this group,
I have to write the run

316
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,280
it since

317
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,760
I'm going to write

318
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,880
including name as

319
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,640
small

320
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,000
guys.

321
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,480
Any confusion in this?

322
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,960
I wrote it right
so that you guys can also write with me

323
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,320
which group I want to include smoke

324
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,720
right in this particular class,
whatever that is.

325
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,840
Because this belong to smoke,
I will be able to execute all of them

326
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,640
from here.

327
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,520
Correct.

328
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,800
You can change this.

329
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,160
You can change these classes from packages
also.

330
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,760
Right.

331
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,080
So inside your test cases, for example.

332
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,720
Right.

333
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,680
In in your this test cases because now
in out of the work we know one thing

334
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,200
all the test cases are available
inside this test

335
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,320
because this package only right
so if I want a single distribution

336
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,280
I don't need to mention any class
I can mention.

337
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,160
This package test gives this In whatever
the test cases belong to small category,

338
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,200
it will execute all those tests
to get this right.

339
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,960
So to do that, if not classes,
then I have to write what I have

340
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:43,840
to write packages, statements
if I want to use only packages.

341
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,360
And then here I will write

342
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,920
package name is equals to

343
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,040
statistic assets.

344
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,080
So now

345
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,320
with this setup, with this setup,
what would happen?

346
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,240
It will execute all the test cases.

347
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,360
Even if I have to test case 100 or 200
test cases belong to this particular

348
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,480
group Smoke, it will execute all of those
first guesses.

349
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,560
Right.

350
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,960
So let's see how many test cases
you can execute.

351
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:29,520
For me for smoke.

352
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,440
Yes, Correct.

353
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,040
And then when you created this test case
for error, employed? No.

354
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,840
Remember we called
this log in is fit inside the test case.

355
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,040
We already call that log in
step right inside.

356
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,560
So that's why it will execute

357
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,520
beyond the you showed.

358
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
That's what I am saying.

359
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,240
This is this segregation rate.

360
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,160
Now we are doing a high level
segregation rate.

361
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,640
So we are not going inside every class
and every method.

362
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,160
Intel, this one to execute
this will not be execute.

363
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
We are saying, hey,

364
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,440
go ahead

365
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,160
in your whatever the classes you have,
whatever the test gives

366
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,600
us, you have I want to execute
based on two separations.

367
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,360
The first one is the smoke.

368
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
The second one is regulation point.

369
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,800
I will create smoke,
not examine the way I created.

370
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,680
Right.

371
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,560
I will pass my package there
because I know

372
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,240
now I don't have to execute
all the classes.

373
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,000
All of my best guesses are available
inside.

374
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,520
Just one package contains this, right?

375
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,840
So I'm passing this.

376
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,000
This package gives package
and it will execute

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,840
all the smoke related scenarios.

378
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, I will go.

379
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,480
Yeah, this is the best of it.

380
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,680
That's why we are using framework now.

381
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,400
Now what I will do basically is
see it executes an employee test.

382
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,360
You go you I just added one thing here.

383
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,040
This group smoke. That's it.

384
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:05,520
I didn't get any of that thing.

385
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,560
All right, now,

386
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,640
now the next thing you see,
this is my small symbol.

387
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,680
Correct.

388
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,320
Now, let me create another
another test and define.

389
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,480
And I will give
I will give this final name as

390
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,640
I'm creating another

391
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,440
test and do not like symbol.

392
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,560
And I will do

393
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,440
this by name as

394
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,720
integration vortex me.

395
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,840
Now when I give integration DOT
accepted here again I will do one thing

396
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,400
instead of writing packet classes
I will write.

397
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
I can just like

398
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,520
again all the packages
and then here I will write

399
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,040
exit name

400
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,200
has to get.

401
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,040
Then this time.

402
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,280
This time if I want to include any group,
I want to include any group.

403
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,880
So what I will write simply is

404
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,520
in this regression vortex symbol
I will execute only those test.

405
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,760
Is this there belong to a regression?

406
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,400
Sure, sure, sure.

407
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,520
I'll give you a time.

408
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
See, this is your smoke.

409
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,400
Right in your suitcase.

410
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
This is your smoke.

411
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,480
First done with this part.

412
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,280
The smoke part.

413
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:43,320
And then I will open the creation
also for you. Yes.

414
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,880
Just click.

415
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,720
Okay. It means it's done.

416
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,040
It's already created. Click. Okay.

417
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,320
And then just right
click on your project to reload from this.

418
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,800
And then you will find this test

419
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,560
and neurotic simplified
renaming to smoke and regression.

420
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,200
Right.

421
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,320
And then pass this
group tag in both of the file

422
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,280
all project level.

423
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,800
You don't need to do this
because see where you need to identify

424
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,000
with all of your test
to get this out of all your test because

425
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,360
it's available throughout your project
or just inside one package.

426
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,280
Where are they?

427
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,160
Because you already already collected

428
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,960
all of them inside one package, right?

429
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,720
So that package waiting here. Right.

430
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,720
The whole intention
is to simplify the process, right?

431
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,080
So we already made it highly simplified.

432
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,160
You don't need to

433
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,800
to go throughout your project, otherwise
it will probably lead to confusion.

434
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,600
Right.

435
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,520
You're having all of your test cases
inside one package that is test kits.

436
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,360
This this time.

437
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,200
This time you have to focus on
just one package and take it.

438
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,000
You're passing in your smoke
and both the same package you're passing

439
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,560
and segregation will be done right

440
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,480
based on your group.

441
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,600
I didn't I didn't do that.

442
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,720
Yes. Yes.

443
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
Correct. Correct.

444
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,600
So now let me do one thing.

445
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,200
I will go inside of my essay test
and I will make any test.

446
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,080
For example,
this because I will take it as

447
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,560
group score

448
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,160
integration.

449
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,240
So my one test
because belong to regression here.

450
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,200
One test because belong to.

451
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,320
Yes. Right. That's what I write. Correct.

452
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,880
Now same package I provided integration
and is multiple this time

453
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,280
when you execute this a smoke
doesn't matter if you have 1000 smoke test

454
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,000
get this in your test because this package
it will execute all of them.

455
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm not doing anything.

456
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,880
I'm not doing anything at all.

457
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,160
I'm just explaining the things right.

458
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,440
I didn't execute anything.

459
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,480
I didn't do anything.

460
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,640
I just added this part here,
the one liner, because I forgot to

461
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,440
do that.

462
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,720
So I just did it
and I came back again on this part.

463
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,520
Now I'm giving you the time.

464
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,400
See, the smoke detector
symbol implement is done.

465
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
This is your regression or similar.

466
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,920
And here you can write

467
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,640
does this look

468
00:28:47,720 --> 00:29:10,880
and eight.

469
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,440
That's what I'm thinking already.

470
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,200
It's a bit surprising for me also

471
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,760
I'll invite all north

472
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,720
by all just smoke this to get suspected

473
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,520
vi all there is no point date of execution
All there is

474
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,880
the point of segregation,
the distribution point, this group.

475
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:36,960
Right.

476
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,960
And when I'm specifically mentioning
that this distant symbol

477
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,160
has to execute, only those test cases
belong to small category date.

478
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,240
So it really never execute
all the test cases,

479
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,840
but only those belong
to this particular part.

480
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
Smoke

481
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:26,800
Then everyone.

482
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:55,560
And then.

483
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,760
Welcome back.

484
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,040
You already cross,

485
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,880
but maybe there

486
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,080
it will execute

487
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,560
because you're mentioning this right
with a direct test annotation.

488
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,480
The point of creating this test,
this package is

489
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,400
you are having all of your test cases
inside one package.

490
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,000
Great.

491
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,160
So now you found one
execution point that whenever

492
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,360
in this logic test, if you come right,

493
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,560
then admin log in here to put that in line
number 13.

494
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,120
All right.

495
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:53,480
So now you whenever you think that
okay I need to write new test case.

496
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,120
So where would you write in the framework
you know you have one package

497
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,440
you will always write your new test
kits inside test kits.

498
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,040
This package. Right.

499
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,640
And this part you've already parsed in
your smoke as well as in your regression.

500
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,520
Right.

501
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,720
So now all you need to do is just
you need to specify the group name

502
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,280
with your test case.

503
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,040
That's it.

504
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,200
And when you execute

505
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,800
this to detect single file,
it will execute

506
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,920
all of your test cases
below the smoke and ignition

507
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,760
category

508
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,960
of Actually,
this is the issue with the application.

509
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,440
Mike Sometimes I can say yes.

510
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,920
Machine also a

511
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,480
did some error. Yes.

512
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,960
Yes. Yeah.

513
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,600
My to be clear because you can see right
even when I execute

514
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,640
test cases on each right,
sometimes it gets weird.

515
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,360
So yes it happens.

516
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,400
Technically correct

517
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,920
followed.

518
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,960
Now guys,
shall we move on to our next topic,

519
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:38,280
which is super important?

520
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:58,240
They take me, do it.

521
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:06,000
So now, now, guys, remember

522
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,320
when we're passing this data to way
right here?

523
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,440
When I'm passing this data
away to the class, if you see

524
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,440
what is the problem, you can see here,
the problem is for small volume of data.

525
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,040
For small volume of data, two users,
three users, five users of users.

526
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
It is completely fine. Right?

527
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,040
But if I am having data 1000 users,

528
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,480
then this data provided is applicable.

529
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,440
This data provided is visible only.

530
00:34:37,440 --> 00:35:06,080
It's not visible.

531
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,920
If you need to check

532
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,960
access groups

533
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,280
in integration, you put it

534
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:41,120
on, everything is fine

535
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,920
then money doesn't work,
nor does it work on you.

536
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,080
Executive Which one

537
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:49,960
should

538
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,880
I will. I will change that.

539
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,960
I will look into this.

540
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:14,000
What is the purpose?

541
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,960
Oh, come on, you'll see when you mention
this is equal to integration.

542
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,000
Right in that package name.

543
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,280
This is equal to regression.

544
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,120
You need to change it.

545
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,840
This slash rate after double code
slash out.

546
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:27,680
Right.

547
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,600
You're putting slash inside.

548
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,880
Getting my point.

549
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,960
If you see in your regression vortex

550
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,520
single file you put package
name is equal to post cases slash.

551
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,840
This should not come with test cases.

552
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,720
It should go out right in double code,
just name of the package.

553
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,960
And after double code it should be slash.

554
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,960
That's the issue.

555
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,360
Then you fix it you will be

556
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:00,720
able to execute your test, correct?

557
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,120
Correct.

558
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,600
All right.

559
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,680
So now

560
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,480
now my requirement is

561
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,080
because when you work in the real life
situations, your life project, right,

562
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,400
you always deal
with a large volume of data,

563
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,800
over 1000 users, tens, 2000 users
you need to test.

564
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,880
And the data is also dynamic.

565
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,960
Sometimes you are having three
or four for you

566
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,080
and sometimes you are having seven,
eight, six,

567
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,960
sometimes you are having ten or 12 pains.

568
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,280
Right here,
we know the fields are constants.

569
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,440
We are passing three, three, three, three.
That's fine.

570
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,600
What if we have to pass three things
here, four here, seven here, nine here?

571
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,360
What would happen in that case?

572
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,720
Data provider will not work.

573
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,480
Great, because your data volume is fixed.

574
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,240
Volume of the small size is fixed,
data provided is visible.

575
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,800
What if everything is dynamic?

576
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
Data provided is not a good option
in that case.

577
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,360
So what is the good option
in that scenario?

578
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,440
For example,
let me tell you this my application

579
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,520
and in

580
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,000
this application, when I right here,
let's see,

581
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,040
it means

582
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,440
I will go and try to add employee, right?

583
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,560
Yes. Yes.

584
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,080
So now now, if you see here,

585
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,840
here I have to enter first name, right?

586
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
I have to enter last name.

587
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,120
I have to intermittently

588
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,320
I have to choose photographer as well.

589
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,120
Right.

590
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,200
So why photograph?

591
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,680
Because I have to
I have to upload one picture

592
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,800
then I have to select
this create log in details.

593
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,200
I have to enter user name,
password, confirm password and save.

594
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,240
Fine.

595
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,640
So how many data I employed in case.

596
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,160
123456.

597
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,480
Right.

598
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Let's a password control password right
the way you guys were saying earlier,

599
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,120
three belong to same thing.

600
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,280
Let's consider not seven, just six.

601
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,560
All right.

602
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,080
In this case.

603
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,840
In this case, when you work in the actual
right there, you might be having

604
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,320
1000 employees or 2000 employees and 3000
employees, right?

605
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,360
Maybe some of them are operating just
for the same last thing, not meeting them.

606
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,440
Some of them are providing all the names.

607
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,680
Right. Everything.

608
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:46,320
But the volume of data is not right.

609
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
The volume of data is large.

610
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,360
At the same time, when you have to provide
immediate support,

611
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,360
except Egypt, you don't see
and you don't give up to one minute.

612
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:01,360
So you have to test this part also
that you have to upload one image, right?

613
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,840
How you can upload the image
there is another point

614
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,880
how you can provide the data
in the same fields, right?

615
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,240
But for multiple sets of data,
you can pass in one scenario.

616
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,560
So these are the things these are
the things we have to perform.

617
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,840
And then we need one particular platform.

618
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,200
We need one for taking that we to check

619
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,720
and to save all this data
in my application.

620
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,080
And then at the same time I can keep
my data safe and secured, right?

621
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,000
So the physical solution is to have

622
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,800
one data, part
one fine for having the test data, right?

623
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,200
All just to keep all of your data
at one place in a particular file

624
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,240
and then read this data, read this

625
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,720
data rate, read this data in one function,
and then call this particular function

626
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,400
in your class in your test case, correct.

627
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,080
Understood the
approach. What I will do see,

628
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,360
let me explain to

629
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,440
you from this table.

630
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,280
Now, what I'm saying basically is
in this one particular fight, right.

631
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,160
I will keep all of my data right.

632
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,200
For example, my first name will be here
and then will be your last name will be

633
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,760
right, photograph would be here.

634
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,280
The user name will be here,
password will be

635
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,320
right.

636
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,560
When I keep all of this things
here, right?

637
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,360
I will.

638
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,320
I will do one thing.

639
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,920
I will write one function right.

640
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,440
I will write one function dysfunction
this function

641
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,000
and read read all the data

642
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,520
right from this particular file.

643
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,440
It will read all the data
in this function.

644
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,400
All right.

645
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,600
And then after this,
this is my actual test case, for example.

646
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,960
Right. So we don't want

647
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,640
this is my best guess, right?

648
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,440
While writing my test case,
I will call this particular function here.

649
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,600
Right. And based on the key.

650
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,440
Based on the key,
I will pull all this data in my function.

651
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,400
Correct.

652
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,360
So this part is separated
that I keep all of my test data.

653
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:29,040
These park is separated in my framework
that I'm reading all my data from fight.

654
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,800
These part is separated
where I'm calling the function

655
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,040
to read the data in my test case. Right.

656
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,520
So if anything changes, for example,
something change

657
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,080
in your data point noise,
you just change your function, right?

658
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,320
And then call this function in your test.

659
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,400
It will read the data
according to your form.

660
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,640
If next time your test scores
change, fine.

661
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,400
In your new test case, call this function
and your new test will work

662
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,800
only if you want to change something
and improve something in your function.

663
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,520
Fine. Just improve that function.

664
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,280
That new function will really work
as data use

665
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,080
that function in your test case
and it will get the data from your flight.

666
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,240
So these are three different

667
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,960
things will be available
in your framework, right?

668
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,640
In your framework.

669
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,560
And then no, you don't need to know.

670
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,400
That's what I'm saying.

671
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,520
This is the concept of dynamic testing,
right?

672
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,520
We call it data
driven test by Data-Driven test.

673
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,880
When we call it
data driven test, let me write it

674
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,040
when we execute

675
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,120
our test case.

676
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:44,440
Right.

677
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,200
Or I should write

678
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,800
STEM test is

679
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,960
across

680
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,920
people sets of data.

681
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,720
We call it

682
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,160
data driven testing.

683
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,800
All right, now, now

684
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,200
let me come here in my framework

685
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,400
and I will go to my notes.

686
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,200
Right. Couple of things.

687
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,880
Couple of things.

688
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,760
First, I would like to write here
and then we will go for the implementation

689
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,720
Part three.

690
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,040
So now what are the things I want
right here?

691
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,560
The first thing is

692
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
we have seven, right

693
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,240
as a big automation tool, correct?

694
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,680
We have MAVEN,

695
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,400
we have testing, right?

696
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,800
Testing as a tool

697
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,360
for testing 23

698
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,040
to grow

699
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,480
or test cases.

700
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,280
Correct.

701
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,720
To perform

702
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,840
batch testing.

703
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,640
Guys, remember to get the force

704
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,640
right.

705
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,320
And then we will
be having we are having ball

706
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,440
which are designed by then.

707
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,080
Why are we using this arm
as our design? Then

708
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,240
maintain

709
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,840
speed element to maintain simple

710
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,120
hosting?

711
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:43,440
Right.

712
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,040
If you want to write,
I can write in detail also.

713
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,160
For example, how are we using them

714
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,280
and how are we writing everything right
there?

715
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,520
For example,
using at the rate defined by page 50.

716
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,480
But every page we create a separate
Java class.

717
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,200
We create

718
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,280
separate Java class for

719
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,880
every page in form based object model.

720
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,800
Now, now we have data
driven test in our framework.

721
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,800
My framework supports data driven testing.

722
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,280
It means for

723
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,760
testing the same

724
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,920
functionality right

725
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,320
across

726
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,440
my people or

727
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,880
in different states.

728
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,520
All data, different sets of data.

729
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,440
This is the first thing.

730
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,560
This is what they said
they want test best.

731
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,760
Alright, how we can do it.

732
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,200
So basically using

733
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,160
the data provider.

734
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,160
And the second thing is using Excel,

735
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,240
correct?

736
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,960
Correct.

737
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
We have Maven.

738
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,280
I told you why we are using Maven.

739
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,720
We have tested.

740
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,880
I told you why are we using We have all

741
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,040
we have data driven framework.

742
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,080
So now if someone asked
what kind of framework

743
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,120
you have, so you have to explain

744
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,880
what my framework supports
data driven testing,

745
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,440
then they will ask
what is declarative want testing?

746
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,840
So you will understand
what your data driven testing is.

747
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:36,520
Something when I can execute, I can test
my single and same functionality

748
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:41,240
across multiple sorts of data
or across different sets of data.

749
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,320
For example, if a log in functionality
is there, I can send

750
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,320
valid username password in,
but it is a name password, blank

751
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,120
username, password, write, error
verification, everything I'm passing.

752
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,960
It means like multiple
or different sets of data I'm

753
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,920
passing to test to this same admin
admin log in functionality.

754
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,560
This is what we call detected event based.

755
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,440
If they ask well how many of
is blasting their data from?

756
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,560
So you can see we can pause the data,
our framework data for later

757
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,280
or you can pause their data point.

758
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,360
Right.

759
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,120
So data provider,
we have already seen a next point

760
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,720
which we have
seen now is using excellently

761
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,040
our data

762
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,920
driven test and is data driven.

763
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,000
But if I knew this of

764
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,160
the comparison rate,
when we will create another framework

765
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,560
called Cucumber, then I will give you
another approach is driven.

766
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,240
Here it is detective and rate.

767
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,000
That's what we call the driven
developing entity

768
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,560
of data is not that crazy in the market
right Obviously data driven test.

769
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,960
And the another one which is coming
that is more crazy in the market

770
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,560
even way beyond this just in the next one
which is coming.

771
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,920
So we'll compare all of these
different approaches when we learn that.

772
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,560
But also that is what we call BDD

773
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,920
behavioral driven development.

774
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,680
All right.

775
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,880
That one also, we will look.

776
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,760
All right.

777
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,720
So now, now, without wasting further

778
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,720
time to explore it further,
then we guys are I said right.

779
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,280
I already identified the scope
that I have to parse this data

780
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,760
to earn an employee,
so I have to add firstname with the name.

781
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,920
Last point I have to add the photograph,

782
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,280
the part of the photograph find username
password again, phone password.

783
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,440
These are the details I have to pass.

784
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,440
So let's see.

785
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,080
I want to add five employees, right?

786
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,760
Using Excel. Correct.

787
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,480
Now I tell you how this Excel file
will work,

788
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,240
but before that create one excel, right?

789
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,440
Let's create an Excel.

790
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,640
Find that we will keep in that symbol.

791
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,200
Now tell me if I want to keep my test
data safe and secure

792
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,680
in my framework, which is the place where
I can keep this data safe.

793
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,000
It which place I can keep

794
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,880
my data safe.

795
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,320
First of all,

796
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,720
creating the Excel file,
inputting that this data inside

797
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,200
the light is Java or non Java

798
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,880
non c, C

799
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,920
is data is not A configuration
B have to keep it in mind data sources.

800
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,760
So what I will do is I will create
I will create

801
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,600
another directory called

802
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,400
NS data.

803
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,000
Right?

804
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,280
And inside this is data,
I will keep my excel.

805
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:51,520
All right.

806
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,040
What I will keep
I will keep my Excel point here.

807
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,520
Okay, now, now remember this.

808
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,000
There are two types of Excel.

809
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,600
Find the older more general ways.

810
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,520
Using grade
B data is will be having DOT excellence

811
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,800
and the new over gen you guys are using
that you will be having dart excel

812
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,920
liquidated here.

813
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,600
Dart excellence and dart excel.

814
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,680
This is the new with one new login.

815
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,960
When you create the file
you will be having this extension.

816
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,560
Right?

817
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,720
So let's create one point

818
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,400
I already have one, right?

819
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,800
But I'm going to create the new one.

820
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,520
So let me create

821
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:42,440
new a complaint from here.

822
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,400
Thank.

823
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,480
This is my new Excel file I opened.

824
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,640
You guys can also open UNIX
and find everyone can open

825
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,200
this.

826
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:05,160
Everyone can open a new Excel file
and then you will see, Guys,

827
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,520
are you doing it with me?

828
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:16,040
Everyone?

829
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,040
Yeah, sure. Yes. Yes.

830
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,720
We are passing their data.

831
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,040
We will going to pause their data from you

832
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:28,960
next.

833
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,560
What we are going to add on right now.

834
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,560
So now, now I'm going to write C first

835
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:39,800
I need to identify from here.

836
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,920
First name, middle name, last name,

837
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,280
photograph, user name, password.

838
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,000
Right.

839
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,640
These are the fields I have
and I need to pass these data

840
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,200
in my application through these fields
I have to pass.

841
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,800
So let me write them one by one.

842
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,160
I will write it as

843
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,280
first name, fragrance, and then

844
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,840
middle name.

845
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,880
And then

846
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:20,040
the last name.

847
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,120
And then

848
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,160
photograph.

849
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,920
I will tell you how to use this photograph
as well.

850
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,360
After this I will pass some username

851
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,440
and then I will

852
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:42,480
pass.

853
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,120
Correct? Correct.

854
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,600
We will put the if.

855
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,240
Now, if you see here guys,

856
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:56,560
what flexibility you have when you use X
and this is your one file, right.

857
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,600
This is your one Excel workbook inside
one workbook,

858
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,160
even if you have two files, data
belong to different department.

859
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,000
You don't need to create multiple Excel
workbook.

860
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,520
You can have multiple sheets.

861
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,880
They can you see this is my sheet one.

862
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,200
Okay, this is my sheet one.

863
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,200
You can have shoot to shoot three shoot
for in number of shoots.

864
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,560
You can have inside one workbook. Correct.

865
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,600
So next time what you need to do
is when you are going to read the data

866
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,560
for any other department,
the same file will read data.

867
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,360
From here.

868
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,520
You just need to click. For example,
this is mine.

869
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:36,600
Let's see, I'm going to rename it and I'm
going to give the name s employee data.

870
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,360
Right?
So this is my employee data. Correct?

871
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,000
Categories.

872
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,920
First name, last name.

873
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,000
So now I want to add just three employees.

874
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,280
Not much.

875
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,600
So yes.

876
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,760
And the ADL companies
use the Excel Files and sequel.

877
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,680
If there is a database connectivity
required in the Use sequel.

878
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:01,080
My sequence
sometimes Oracle or any other MongoDB,

879
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,080
but if the data they have
they kept it in the actual they use Excel.

880
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,000
So let me create some user guys
I'm requesting.

881
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,040
Don't use this user,
which I will be using.

882
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,920
Yes, right.

883
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,640
To add the employee,
otherwise it will not work.

884
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,400
So I will create some combination here.

885
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,800
I'm writing.

886
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,600
Yeah, right.

887
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,560
Don't worry,
I will change the last moment.

888
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,600
So let me take first to use it as and

889
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,080
middle name as sure.

890
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,480
Last name is

891
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,280
fine, right?

892
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,640
Is there to use

893
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
correctly correct. Right.

894
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,520
This is the first name.

895
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,240
Last name and really fine.

896
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,760
And then user name.

897
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,440
So let's say user
name would be I'm going to write is

898
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,040
and that should

899
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,080
one correct.

900
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:04,560
Great.

901
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:05,880
Okay.

902
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,920
And the password I'm going to write

903
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,520
password is not an issue.

904
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,680
So I'm going to write this same password.

905
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,840
This is the password.

906
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:18,920
Angry.

907
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,720
Now let's take the second one.

908
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,840
Black

909
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,320
mania.

910
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,720
Lena.

911
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,120
It would be black men there.

912
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,040
One, right.

913
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,400
And then the same password again.

914
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,800
I'm using now.

915
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,040
Now I'm writing for about 30 user

916
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,640
Michael

917
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,080
Andre

918
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:15,120
Jamal.

919
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,720
Mike the one

920
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,160
and then the same one.

921
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,080
So guys, I want to add, right?

922
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,520
These three employees,

923
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,280
both name last name and written name.

924
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,840
Now I need photograph
for these three, correct

925
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:35,680
names.

926
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,360
Can you
see I need photograph for these three.

927
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,800
So I have these photographs already
available with me if you want.

928
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,200
Right.

929
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,520
What you can do simply
is because your application

930
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,800
says if you go here

931
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,680
jpg image it accepts.

932
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,280
Right? Fine.

933
00:57:53,280 --> 00:58:04,720
So you just go.

934
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,280
You just go here and write

935
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,200
images

936
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:18,800
from here.

937
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,000
You will find so many images, right?

938
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,560
You can download
any JPEG image from here, correct?

939
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,920
I have already downloaded images,

940
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,080
so let me show you
those images that I have available

941
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,040
on my desktop.

942
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:46,760
No, not in my data store.

943
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,400
If you add image three, right.

944
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,040
Image to an image, these are the images

945
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,000
I have

946
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,600
the actually correct.

947
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,120
So this is my image one, right?

948
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,600
This is my image too.

949
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,480
This is my image. Three.

950
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,880
Right. For all the three users.

951
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,000
For all the three users,
I will use this images to upload.

952
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:10,680
Correct.

953
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:12,960
Is it correctly?

954
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,280
Nice. So as of now.

955
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,480
As of now,
let me put away the part right from here.

956
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,400
So how can I provide the path
for these images

957
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,520
simply going to property right click
and it will give you the path.

958
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,640
So this is the part it is giving me.

959
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:31,920
Funny,

960
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,320
I know image one.

961
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,480
Image two, Image three.

962
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,440
I will keep it.

963
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,080
So let me go back to my Excel sheet.

964
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,560
There you go.

965
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,520
And here simply I'm writing this part

966
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,840
now. If you see inside photos,

967
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,880
the first one I have my image, dark

968
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,680
image, which image?

969
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,440
It is jpg I'm using.

970
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,760
Correct?

971
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,080
Is this correct?

972
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:10,360
And image two here I'm using this one.

973
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:15,320
Image three I'm using this one.

974
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:19,600
Fine.

975
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:19,880
Sure.

976
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,920
You just need to click on you
just write, perform right, click right.

977
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,160
It will give you the complete on Mac. Also

978
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,800
you will see other copy portrait prints.

979
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,200
There you will find that

980
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,160
the guys so far in editing this data,

981
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,240
there isn't any confusion.

982
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,440
All clear

983
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,200
now let's try to save it now.

984
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,320
So I'm going to save it anywhere because
anyway, I'm going to put it in my project.

985
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,200
So let me keep it inside or

986
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,320
anywhere on my desktop.

987
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,200
I'm going to keep it.

988
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,000
As of now.

989
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,600
So this would be my HRA.

990
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:18,040
This is data.

991
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,200
Yeah, I will give you time.

992
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,280
I will give you time. Don't worry.

993
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,240
I'm just trying to add
this file in the project

994
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,080
and then I'm going to give your time
so that you can also do the same thing.

995
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,600
Okay, So it's hard to miss this data.

996
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,200
Okay, let's save it.

997
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:44,880
Some of it.

998
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,040
Let me right here

999
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,680
magically correct

1000
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,880
it saves each item is data batch time.

1001
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,960
Let me check where I have this

1002
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,600
this is the file.

1003
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:17,840
I'm going to copy this file from here.

1004
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,920
I'll be

1005
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,680
and then

1006
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,480
I will simply paste

1007
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,480
my file here in my is data.

1008
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:34,680
Put the actually correct correct.

1009
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:40,080
Now if you guys see in my project right.

1010
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:45,520
If you guys see in my project, I'd better
make this data when I added this fight

1011
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,840
it is having the extension dot
excellent six right.

1012
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,720
This is the newer file format for Excel

1013
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,240
dot excellent six dot excellence we had.

1014
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,800
It was the previous for

1015
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,440
project

1016
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,280
of Stepney.

1017
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:10,480
You just need to copy the file
from your wherever you have stored

1018
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,360
that same copy and paste it here.

1019
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,800
And then when you pasted inside your test
data just posted by you can see this dot.

1020
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,120
It's an extension of your file.

1021
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,000
This is the Excel file
where you kept all of your data.

1022
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:29,640
All right.

1023
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,240
Okay.

1024
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,000
So now please are download free images.

1025
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:35,240
Like I said, right?

1026
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:40,280
The location I gave you the JPG extension
and when you are done

1027
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,400
with preparing the test data,
do let me know

1028
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,800
up a sure sign, right?

1029
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,440
You just right click on your image.

1030
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,960
Go into the properties right right.

1031
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,200
Click on your images.

1032
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,760
Going to the properties, for example
here, right click.

1033
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,760
Go into the properties and great exists.

1034
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,160
And then this is the location, right?

1035
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,160
You need to keep this location.

1036
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:37,880
And remember when you copy this location
and when you paste it in your file

1037
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,680
here, slash
the name of your file with the extension.

1038
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,600
So for example, image.

1039
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,440
Image two, image three I have.

1040
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,800
So I kept all this three here

1041
01:04:50,760 --> 01:05:06,600
getting my point.

1042
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,560
All right.

1043
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:18,600
And then in this point, notice
Stefano, brick by brick time.

1044
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:18,880
Sorry.

1045
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,240
Today something very important
we are going to discuss

1046
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,560
right now.

1047
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:30,200
It says jpg It will accept the JPT
so we should go with JPG as of now.

1048
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,120
Should

1049
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,960
you see it says JP during

1050
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,640
JPG don't be injured or if so, because no

1051
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:44,640
jpg is of now right.

1052
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,600
This okay.

1053
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,320
All right now

1054
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,200
I'm giving you the time because

1055
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,600
the next 1520 minutes are very important.

1056
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,040
Not I don't think so

1057
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,160
but JP did the smallest small
one is the correct one.

1058
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,280
I think so.

1059
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,360
Just take the small one.

1060
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:10,440
Next 25 minutes or half an hour.

1061
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,240
I need your complete attention, guys,

1062
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,680
because the code
which we are going to write and the what

1063
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:18,360
the concept, which I'm going to explain
this is very important.

1064
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:22,960
All right.

1065
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,800
So let me do once you guys are done
with providing this file

1066
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:30,760
in your framework and passing the data
in your Excel filing everything

1067
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,760
in this point,
when you reach when you can see this data,

1068
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,520
which I did this
rank and file, do let me know

1069
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,120
and then you don't need to create it.

1070
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,040
You have already created this file,

1071
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,600
Save it in your machine
and just copy paste it.

1072
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,680
Simple.

1073
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:32,080
Copy this file better
when it is a stored and saved here.

1074
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:34,360
A biscuit here.

1075
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:47,440
All right.

1076
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,960
I told you already. Right.

1077
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,880
Long enough will have you can find.

1078
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,160
Find the part.

1079
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,240
All right.

1080
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:04,800
No, didn't should be doing. Yes.

1081
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:10,920
We need to identify that reason.

1082
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,440
Another thing you can do
is maybe you can try, but I can drop.

1083
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,120
All right.

1084
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:22,960
Just drag it from there
and drop it inside of this data.

1085
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,240
And I.

1086
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:36,040
Can you try drag and drop operation?

1087
01:08:36,040 --> 01:09:17,160
Okay.

1088
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,680
Alright, let's connect
after the session. Right.

1089
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,240
And then we'll see
what is the issue with it Intelligible.

1090
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,240
We'll look into that part.

1091
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,440
Okay.

1092
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:29,240
We'll see that for sure. All

1093
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,320
right. My

1094
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,080
hope.

1095
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:37,640
Yes, we're doing ready.

1096
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,280
Great.

1097
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,200
So to all the geniuses now,

1098
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,200
we have

1099
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:51,520
we have one thing already in place,
isn't it?

1100
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,240
We are done with this part, Correct?

1101
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,160
I'm giving you the overview. Right.

1102
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,040
We have one data point.

1103
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,640
We kept all of the data.

1104
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:08,840
One place we stored it in our framework
and this part is done or not.

1105
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,000
So I need your full energy
now for the next half an hour.

1106
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,360
It'll be very interesting, Right?

1107
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,360
Done.

1108
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,720
Now, now the next time.

1109
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,280
Next thing.

1110
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:23,760
This part that's taken by this part,
we are going to make

1111
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,480
what we are going to make.

1112
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,400
We are going to make a function.

1113
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,240
We are going to make a function

1114
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,640
that will read my X
and find doesn't matter how many rows,

1115
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:37,360
how many columns, how many fields has
what kind of data it is.

1116
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:42,720
These single function, universal function
will read all kind of data

1117
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:46,600
from my Excel file and give it to me
so that I can use this data to.

1118
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,360
My best guess is right.

1119
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,480
This is the most important point.

1120
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,880
Mentioning data here is not a big deal

1121
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,160
using data here in
this case is not a big deal.

1122
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:56,800
Trade.

1123
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,280
The most important point is writing
this function, which will act

1124
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,400
as an intermediary
in between these two parts.

1125
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,920
So let's go ahead
and try to work on this particular

1126
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,440
point.

1127
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,000
Let's start.

1128
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,640
So inside my utility again, I'm going

1129
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,240
right inside of my utility.

1130
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:28,080
I'm going and I am writing another method,
another class, right.

1131
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,400
A separate class to read my Excel data.

1132
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,560
Separate class to read my Excel data,
fine.

1133
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,440
Let's go ahead and create.

1134
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:40,920
So the name of my class,
I'm going to write simple one call,

1135
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,560
Accelerating class, right?

1136
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,760
Correct.

1137
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,920
Correct.

1138
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,160
It is accelerating class by

1139
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,440
I got this class here

1140
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,240
now. Now, tell me one thing right.

1141
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,160
First
I have to open my file before reading.

1142
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,960
Write Whenever you read any book,
what do you generally do?

1143
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,400
You open the book first and then you read.

1144
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,680
Without opening, you can't read anything.

1145
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:21,600
So my first math would be public
void, open

1146
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:23,960
exit.

1147
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:29,480
Correct.

1148
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:29,880
Guys,

1149
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,720
Now this method will ask.

1150
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,760
All right, I have to open the Excel file.

1151
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,240
I said Yes, it says
which with which excel fighting it open.

1152
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:43,200
So I will say I'm going to provide
you defined but simple.

1153
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,360
All right.

1154
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,520
Now, delegates, this part
the part of my this Excel fight.

1155
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,880
If I want to provide that,
I have to provide this part

1156
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,240
to provide the part of my file,

1157
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,880
which is the best place I have

1158
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,400
in constants. Correct.

1159
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,480
Because the bias part is final.

1160
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,200
So I will copy this path from here.

1161
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,560
Let's copy the path now.

1162
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:12,360
Go In your constraints,
isn't it very easy right names

1163
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:16,680
to identify where we need to add the
But why are we going to add the path here?

1164
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:20,600
And there is entities can be
because framework

1165
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,120
is allowing you to do
all of this things correct.

1166
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:28,280
So I'm going to write
a public static line. Then

1167
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,600
all this

1168
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,440
data you able to find your exam point

1169
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:45,240
right.

1170
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:53,800
Sean, can you see the Excel file
you have here?

1171
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,280
And then I'm going to give the name as

1172
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,760
is data file

1173
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,160
social.

1174
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:18,680
Basically what you some you do.

1175
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:22,600
How did we add you simply copy your file
it best to here.

1176
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:30,000
That's it.

1177
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,800
Now guys, tell me to come out to this to
achieve this particular project directly.

1178
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:36,640
Right.

1179
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:42,280
Instead of writing the hard coded part,
can I use this particular part?

1180
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,320
Can I use this button?

1181
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:47,040
Authenticates.

1182
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:47,640
Right.

1183
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,840
So let me write here.

1184
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:53,120
System dot

1185
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,960
good property

1186
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,800
user talk, dear.

1187
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,440
Right.

1188
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,600
Let's

1189
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,720
in double quotes.

1190
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:06,360
Right.

1191
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:09,440
You have to provide the same path
for the resources.

1192
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,920
Correct.

1193
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,240
So and the resources
and the resources here

1194
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:17,640
inside of

1195
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,400
resources you have what can we days

1196
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,840
inside resources you have here

1197
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:30,280
is data write slash complete name h.r.

1198
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,840
And this data badge.

1199
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:37,920
Then don't extend this x

1200
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,600
so far in this part.

1201
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,640
Any compute instruments?

1202
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,880
How did i provide this data file? But

1203
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:56,280
everything is clear.

1204
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,760
So for everyone

1205
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,560
I know,

1206
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,600
even if you're not writing this part
or even if you're not getting this part,

1207
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,840
are you able to understand
how I provided this data file?

1208
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,680
But okay, just don't worry about adding
the file.

1209
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,560
I take care of that.

1210
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,440
I'll tell you how to how we can.

1211
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,160
We will definitely find some way for that.

1212
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,240
All right, great.

1213
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,520
So now we have added to instead of fine.

1214
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:25,800
But this time when I go in my Excel

1215
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,520
reading right here, the very first thing
which I'm going to make

1216
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:36,000
what I have to here is
I have to write this to open the

1217
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,760
Excel file or any other file.

1218
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,040
Right.

1219
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,360
I have to use if I is file input stream,

1220
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,720
correct

1221
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,040
post existence of workbook rule, right?

1222
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:49,720
That is for sure.

1223
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:52,400
But right now must file input stream.

1224
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,360
So I'm going to write file
inputs in which file.

1225
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,440
So I already have a perimeter file, but

1226
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,480
guys see it is again giving me the error.

1227
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:06,760
What is the error?

1228
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:07,560
Catch block.

1229
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,520
I have to write for that.

1230
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:09,840
Right?

1231
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,120
Since we have already done this part,
right?

1232
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:17,720
Since we have already done this part
and telling you how we are doing it.

1233
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,320
File not found exception. Right.

1234
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,600
So this one would be a file

1235
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,320
not found exception E

1236
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:29,640
and then you can write it or print

1237
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,320
this file.

1238
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,160
Not inside this inside this.

1239
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:34,760
Right.

1240
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,720
I have to open
my workbook. So let me write

1241
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,200
workbook book is equals to new.

1242
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,080
Remember?

1243
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:51,960
I remember
it is giving you a workbook and x workbook

1244
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:57,040
when you are using dot x
and A6 when you're using dot x

1245
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,720
and as x extension file,
you have to use X's workbook.

1246
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,120
All right.

1247
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:06,280
And when you are using dot X

1248
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:10,720
and as extension of Excel find,
you have to use edge as F workbook.

1249
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,280
Make sure this gateway
to keep this point in mind.

1250
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,840
I'm not sure you're using this audio
to sing topics to this, but yes, accesses

1251
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,040
if in which case when you're using dot
Excel is extension and

1252
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,840
F workbook,
in which case when you're using DOT

1253
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,600
excellent extension clear.

1254
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,000
And then here the if I have to find

1255
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:38,000
so I will write if I use

1256
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,640
all right again it is giving me the error

1257
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,360
why it says add catch clause
fine for an exception.

1258
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,720
So I get the catch plus

1259
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,040
correct.

1260
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,520
This is the function C is
I am writing functions.

1261
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,000
Right.

1262
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:56,520
Okay.

1263
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,320
All right.

1264
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,720
So take it

1265
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,120
or not excel A6 you use

1266
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,040
it as s f

1267
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:13,320
workable excel A6 you use excessive

1268
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,200
workbook correct?

1269
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,720
It is file input string guys.

1270
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,480
Why we use file input string

1271
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,720
if I s is the object.

1272
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,640
I'm not sure
whether you have seen it or not already.

1273
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,320
Let me show you.

1274
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,360
Can you see this file input string?

1275
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,880
If I is, I have control here. Right

1276
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,360
to read file we need file
input string should be correct.

1277
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,320
So the object of file input
stream is a files which I'm calling here.

1278
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,920
Now guys can see

1279
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,960
this is the very segregated function
I have written very clean function

1280
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,320
to open device.

1281
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,560
So right now I'm just opening.

1282
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,000
I didn't read anything right now.

1283
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,200
Now let's talk about the possible cases.

1284
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,480
What are the possible cases?

1285
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,680
In my one Excel file,
I can have multiple shapes, right,

1286
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,400
guys?

1287
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:17,040
I can have multiple shoots in my one
file or not, it could be possible three.

1288
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,720
So let me write another method.

1289
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,920
So I'm going to write another method
for the

1290
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,240
I forgot to make it static method three.

1291
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:29,040
Now again, I'm going to write
one more method public static void

1292
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:31,160
and see get shape.

1293
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:32,760
Fine.

1294
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,560
So here, here.

1295
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,400
I need the sheet name guys.

1296
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,720
Remember the sheet name
I have provided here?

1297
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,840
Can you see employee data?

1298
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,320
This is the sheet name.

1299
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,200
You can provide.

1300
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:48,320
Some X was issued name, but right now
because we are trying to add employee

1301
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:54,680
so I am providing the name as employee
data.

1302
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,880
It gave me this addition.

1303
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,880
So I just took next edition
from your setup.

1304
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,720
If you want to write it,
you can type it as well.

1305
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,240
No issues. All right.

1306
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,440
So now again, guys,
because everything is dynamic.

1307
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,560
We are passing these files,
but also. Right.

1308
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,680
So we will pass this sheet
name as well from here right.

1309
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,000
So I'm going to write a simple sheet name

1310
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:19,040
and then I will say, right,

1311
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,760
I will write like this sheet.

1312
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,080
The sheet

1313
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,640
is equal to from which sheet.

1314
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,760
So from book now, because this object

1315
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,920
I have created for workbook inside this
method, can I use it inside this method?

1316
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,080
Also this

1317
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,640
is this book

1318
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,400
object created for this workbook
is available in this particular method.

1319
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,640
Can I use it here also?

1320
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,320
Yes. So I'm going to make it.

1321
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:54,000
I am going to make it as a

1322
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,600
and that's correct.

1323
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,000
And let's make it static.

1324
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,040
So this is my estimate.

1325
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:05,360
Similarly, similarly for book, right?

1326
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,760
I have sheet also.

1327
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:10,040
So let me make another one as starting for

1328
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:12,760
sheet.

1329
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,720
So another object for sheet,

1330
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,160
it will ask for import.

1331
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:23,960
So I will imported fine.

1332
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,320
Now see it says book dot.

1333
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,800
Right book dot get sheet.

1334
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:29,880
So which sheet.

1335
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,800
So I am seeing, I've already provided
one better with that from here. Correct.

1336
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,520
So this would be my get sheet function.

1337
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,720
Now what I am doing in this two functions,

1338
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:45,240
I opened my excel, I took the sheet.

1339
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,400
Now in this sheet, in this sheet. Right.

1340
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,920
I have to read the data.

1341
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,400
Let me tell you, so far in our code
what I what we did,

1342
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,440
we opened this Excel file
and we identify this sheet name.

1343
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,400
Now we are on this particular ship still.

1344
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:05,040
We didn't read
any data so far. Is it clear

1345
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,040
what is the code?

1346
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:15,400
What I have written so far,
I hope it is clear to everyone.

1347
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,040
All right, fine.

1348
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,320
This is a very basic thing
I'm doing as of now, right?

1349
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,880
Because the more things are on the we know

1350
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:28,560
now, tell me what is the best way
what is the best way to read the data?

1351
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,040
I have to take the rules count
total number of rules.

1352
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:32,360
Right.

1353
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:34,680
Total number of rows

1354
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,920
closing. Correct.

1355
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:37,760
How many rows?

1356
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,800
I have one, two, three, four. Like this.

1357
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:46,040
I can hundred rules, thousand rules,
500 rows and rows.

1358
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,120
I don't know.

1359
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,320
So I need total number of rules first.

1360
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,160
And then I will read what the data is
available inside these rows.

1361
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,880
Correct.

1362
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,160
We don't need to be out of here.

1363
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,040
We will not use any at a right now.

1364
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:03,160
Let me tell you,
you are going to write public

1365
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,440
writing. And

1366
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,520
right when I say why?

1367
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,920
Because I'm
going to get that out of the rule.

1368
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,360
So I'm going to write, get a rule

1369
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,240
now. See now see what this method does.

1370
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,760
Let me explain this. Right.

1371
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,200
What this method does see for
common trait,

1372
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,480
I will write Hey, sheet dart

1373
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:30,760
gate,

1374
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,520
can you see there is a method

1375
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,880
called get physical number of rules?

1376
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,400
What does it mean?

1377
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,920
This method returns all the rules.

1378
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,840
Write the number of rows.

1379
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:46,560
The number of rows which is having data,
physical number of rows.

1380
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:47,320
Right.

1381
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,800
There's total number of rules
and physical number of rows.

1382
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:52,280
Different things in the rows.

1383
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,600
There we are having the data.

1384
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,520
It will return all those rules right
where you are filling the data it.

1385
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,720
So that's how you can get the rule going.

1386
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:04,240
For example,
if your data is available in ten,

1387
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:08,840
in ten rules or in 15 rules or in 20
rules, you don't have to be bothered

1388
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:12,080
about this things in your Excel,
you just call this method.

1389
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,840
And this method is dysfunction row count.

1390
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:20,600
It will return the data
which is available, right?

1391
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,280
Exactly. Exactly.
So you'll see how many rules we have.

1392
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,800
You still,

1393
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,280
if I run this function across this

1394
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,480
file, across this sheet,
how many it will return?

1395
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,520
What would be the count for count?

1396
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,480
Correct.

1397
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:38,560
It. Now, similarly,
let me proceed further.

1398
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,720
I'm going to get public.

1399
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,840
I think

1400
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,600
public static end gate.

1401
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,480
I'm going to get

1402
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,600
one stop right after row after row.

1403
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,720
I need to get column count.

1404
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:06,160
So tell me, guys,
how can change the column?

1405
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:09,160
We do not have any better
get physical number of columns.

1406
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:13,880
No. How can we get the column count

1407
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:16,800
again?

1408
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,360
Somebody gets

1409
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:29,880
it. Yes.

1410
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:34,520
And what I will do basically is
I will pass the row index,

1411
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,200
for example in this rule,
in this particular home.

1412
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,040
Right.

1413
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,960
How many physical number of cells
available.

1414
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,560
Right.
How many physical seats in this rule?

1415
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,960
This is one cell.

1416
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,800
This is one cell.

1417
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,680
This is one cell digit, 110.

1418
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,720
So if I had one, two, three, four,

1419
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:55,000
five, six, six,
physical number of cells are available.

1420
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,360
It means how many columns I have inside
want to

1421
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,160
write understanding for every row.

1422
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:05,880
For every row
I have in possible index inside that rule,

1423
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,920
how many physical number of cells
available I will identify

1424
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:14,400
this physical number of cells
means your number of columns.

1425
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:15,080
Right.

1426
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,800
So here
in this function I will write in beta

1427
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,480
row index.

1428
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,040
Right.

1429
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:26,880
And here this function returns me,
but it prevents me from the sheet

1430
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:38,160
to get.

1431
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,040
All right,

1432
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,600
so from where
I'm going to get lateral index.

1433
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,200
Right.

1434
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,920
And in this rule
I'm going to get physical number

1435
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:50,480
of six point

1436
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:51,880
heading.

1437
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,200
This is for my column count one by one.

1438
01:27:55,200 --> 01:28:00,760
I'm taking the things now this method,
this function will open my excel.

1439
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,520
This one will give me the sheet.

1440
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,840
Open my sheet.

1441
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,960
This one will give me all row count.

1442
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:08,720
This one is giving overall column.

1443
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:09,240
Column

1444
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,720
so far in this clipboard website.

1445
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,600
Yeah, I'm
going to do that. I'm going to do that.

1446
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,120
So from here I'm going to start.

1447
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,480
I'm going to write Here is

1448
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:24,680
Open Excel

1449
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,440
book correct?

1450
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,440
This one is

1451
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:37,000
open sheet.

1452
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,120
Okay, open

1453
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,760
the rules.

1454
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,240
And then this one is

1455
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,320
so great.

1456
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,680
So kind of

1457
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:59,120
correct.

1458
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:12,440
So far everything work.

1459
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:12,960
All right.

1460
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,920
Now the next important point.

1461
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,920
The next important point.

1462
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:21,360
I got the rows,
I got the columns and everything.

1463
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,960
But what I really need
in the end of the day,

1464
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,320
what I need is do I need to do
I need a column?

1465
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:32,480
Do I need self?

1466
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:39,000
Enza, I think your very best name
is Will correct?

1467
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,480
Exactly.

1468
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,280
Exactly.

1469
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,840
I need data

1470
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,560
here identified.

1471
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:46,920
Right.

1472
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,120
I need data. Correct.

1473
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,360
So not the text.

1474
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,360
Physically not fake, not the text.

1475
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,840
I will tell you how we can do that
because see, sometimes you're making the

1476
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,840
but sometimes you're getting something
else, right?

1477
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:04,320
What I will do is
and let me write here another method

1478
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:09,880
for the public safety element is
what kind of data

1479
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,840
I be expecting from my from
my every cent, what of datetime expecting

1480
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:16,640
string.

1481
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:19,000
So my method should return.
What is string.

1482
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,400
So I'm going to write get

1483
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,240
then.

1484
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:24,720
Okay.

1485
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:26,760
Get cell data.

1486
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,200
So in the cell data I need and

1487
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,040
I will pass first as

1488
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:36,160
row index comma

1489
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,280
call index that is column

1490
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:42,880
index from digital from which column
I need to get the data

1491
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,640
so this method will return
from this index.

1492
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,400
It will go,

1493
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,680
it will take the row

1494
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,400
original and the row index point.

1495
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,800
Then find which cell.

1496
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,240
So I am passing the column
index that this particular see

1497
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:07,200
now whatever the data, whatever
the data I'm getting at, really don't know

1498
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:11,400
what type of data is this going to use
one method point those

1499
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,960
Now tell me guys
what this don't do the string method does

1500
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,920
why we used auto string

1501
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,440
exactly whatever the data.

1502
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:32,880
Whatever the data I am getting right
this dot string

1503
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,240
method will convert it
into the string connect.

1504
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:39,640
So I'm using this state
hey excel sheet to give me the data.

1505
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:43,320
I don't care
what kind of data you're giving me, right?

1506
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:47,880
I will use this data as a string, so
I will convert it forced into this string.

1507
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:52,720
And then in the in my this method, my,
this method will convert this data

1508
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:53,880
as a string.

1509
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:54,480
Correct.

1510
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,400
So I will write here

1511
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:01,400
to connect the data from every

1512
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,280
in the form of its frame.

1513
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:11,400
We use this function.

1514
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,240
Is it correctness

1515
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,360
right now?

1516
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:28,560
Now, next 10 minutes,
Hardly 10 to 15 minutes.

1517
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,760
I need your full attention here.

1518
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:35,600
Just 10 minutes.

1519
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,080
Explain.

1520
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:41,160
What we are going to do is now let me show

1521
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:58,080
now yard in after this definitely break.

1522
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,560
Fine.
So now if you see guys, guys, please.

1523
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,120
All right.

1524
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,120
Just 15 minutes.

1525
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,720
I need. All right, Mike.

1526
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,840
Nobody should worry. They could object.

1527
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:10,920
I'm saying one thing here in this sheet.

1528
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,600
In this sheet. Right.

1529
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:16,240
I'm going to use a part of this data
structure.

1530
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:17,600
All right?

1531
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,600
We are going to use the part of data
structure. Why?

1532
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,400
Because now something
I'm telling you, right?

1533
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,680
Might be you guys noticed.

1534
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,960
Maybe you guys didn't notice.

1535
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:31,680
If you see the format of my Excel file is

1536
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,440
if you see this particular force to do

1537
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,440
this particular.

1538
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:40,040
First of all, tell me
what is the index for this?

1539
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:44,280
First of all, if I'm going to pass the row
index, what would be the index?

1540
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:44,640
Zero.

1541
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,160
So let me keep the zero somewhere.

1542
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:50,520
Let's say here this now.

1543
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:54,560
Now, if you see on this false two,
I'm getting false

1544
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,000
to name middle name, last name,
photograph, user name password.

1545
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,880
What is this

1546
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:03,000
correct.

1547
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,840
Jamal, you identified

1548
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:10,080
these is these are the keys, right.

1549
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:13,680
Is there any other place
in my entire Excel file?

1550
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:16,840
Is there any other place in my entire file

1551
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:20,440
from where I'm getting the keys?

1552
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:23,320
Is it any other place? No.

1553
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,480
It means what?

1554
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,360
I understood one thing from my Excel file.

1555
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,280
I'm telling you guys,

1556
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:33,240
maybe you guys are learning it first time,
but this is very interesting topic.

1557
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:35,040
You see, that's how you can read data.

1558
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,360
Even in your million dollar project.

1559
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:42,240
You can read data like this
in your first of all, you got one clue.

1560
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,760
What is that clue?

1561
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:49,040
You got one thing that in my first rule,
I always get just three, correct.

1562
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:51,960
I always good just right.

1563
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,760
So everything everything.

1564
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,800
Now, if you see every time right
here you go

1565
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,920
and you check
this is unity in the first row.

1566
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,280
This is your key, right?

1567
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:08,200
And at the same time, in the same time,
if you are going on this second row right.

1568
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:15,440
If you're going, this is your key.

1569
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,240
Now, what is this?

1570
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,400
This and then this.

1571
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:25,840
Right.

1572
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,400
So this is your key.

1573
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:28,640
This is your value.

1574
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:31,240
This is your this is your value. Correct.

1575
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,840
Again, this middle name is your key.

1576
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:37,680
And these are the values
associated to this.

1577
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,280
This again, key.

1578
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,840
So this one value
one value to a new three, 1 to 3.

1579
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,840
Similarly a new one when to value three.

1580
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:50,320
Again, this is your key,

1581
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:50,640
right?

1582
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:53,360
And this is when you value one value

1583
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:56,680
and so correct.

1584
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,280
No, no.

1585
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,960
If you see

1586
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:11,000
if you see here

1587
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,080
in clear minor, if I write like this

1588
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:17,200
understanding what is gain, what is value
we are getting from here,

1589
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:20,440
from this simply
and just for one thing, one point.

1590
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,760
Now let's try to understand

1591
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:29,040
the second point.

1592
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:29,920
When I see

1593
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:32,600
when I see

1594
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:36,960
this particular rule
is constant to gain the key

1595
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:40,000
right finds zero

1596
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,480
right after this.

1597
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:47,840
When I ask here
this particular rule forced

1598
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:52,080
this particular rule first, right
difference index one.

1599
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,160
This particular rule

1600
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,400
it means index to

1601
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,000
this particular rule

1602
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,600
it means index three.

1603
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:04,080
Right.

1604
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,840
This forget about it
because this is having only right.

1605
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,680
So every single rule,

1606
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:15,320
every single rule is giving me some values
or not

1607
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,600
this and I shall return it is value

1608
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:23,160
black Melia all in It is value every time

1609
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:27,440
my index is zero
through my index zero purpose giving what

1610
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:33,480
he my remaining rules
are giving me more values.

1611
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:34,080
Right?

1612
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:39,520
So the combination if you see with this
zero, this one, this zero with this two,

1613
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:44,280
this zero with this three,
what it is returning what it is returning.

1614
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,880
The first one is
returning me key and value.

1615
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,320
Then the second row.

1616
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:55,200
This is my first
and the second rule is again returning key

1617
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:58,200
and value.

1618
01:38:58,200 --> 01:38:59,520
The third row again.

1619
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:04,360
The third row is returning Milwaukee
And when new right

1620
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:09,600
these three rules are returning keys
and values for example.

1621
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:13,600
For example if you come here,
the first name is the key strength.

1622
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,360
Fine. This is the key.

1623
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,120
This is the value point.
This is the value.

1624
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:21,560
So the key is having
the type of what is free

1625
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,640
and is having the type of lock

1626
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:27,240
string connect You're having this thing.

1627
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:32,040
It means for every single home,
your every single rule

1628
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,280
is returning a map

1629
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:37,080
addict.

1630
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,600
Guys can you see your

1631
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:45,240
every single rule is returning one map
from the second one

1632
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:49,680
it means which index position
you need to get the map.

1633
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,480
The first one is zero.

1634
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,480
Forget about it
because it is always returning the key.

1635
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:59,880
You will start writing
the index of rules from one

1636
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:02,640
because your action values
are starting from here.

1637
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:03,600
Right?

1638
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:08,280
So we need to do see,
this is for rule one, right?

1639
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:13,080
It prevents map and string
keys and values again for all two.

1640
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:13,720
Right.

1641
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:15,160
Again, it will return one more

1642
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:18,760
map called is string and again
string for a key and value.

1643
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,080
Then for row three again
it will return another map.

1644
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,120
Right again it will return map.

1645
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,520
Now tell me one thing.

1646
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:30,240
Is it possible
that I can have two data with same name?

1647
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,200
Can I have two and two?

1648
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,840
Andre two,
Black two, Michael or three Michael?

1649
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,120
So for Michael's possible right

1650
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,120
now, I need force.

1651
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,240
The I need force.

1652
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,520
I need rules collection.

1653
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:47,520
This is a part of data structure, correct?

1654
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,240
Based understood the point
how I'm getting map

1655
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:56,680
key and value pair right now
because I'm getting multiple max.

1656
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:58,320
I'm getting multiple maps.

1657
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:02,640
I need one connection
that I can keep all these maps together.

1658
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:03,640
Right?

1659
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,360
If if I don't store this map

1660
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:08,720
and I take another map, what would happen

1661
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:13,160
if I don't see
after getting the values of this map?

1662
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:16,680
If I don't see this map,
I will take another map.

1663
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,480
It will override the value. Correct.

1664
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:24,680
So what I have to do,
I have to find a V in connection, Right.

1665
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,960
Which will not only add my map
after retrieving the value,

1666
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:33,480
but also allow me, but also allow me

1667
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:38,000
to add duplicate values as well.

1668
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:38,840
Adding my point

1669
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,520
is getting that point.

1670
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,960
So now what is the need

1671
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,560
to be correct?

1672
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,280
Right? So what is the need here?

1673
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,560
The need is to find edit

1674
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,680
after edit again, take another point.

1675
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:03,160
Added another move, find edit right.

1676
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:06,360
And then take all of these things
in terms of what

1677
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,960
we have to take it in the list.

1678
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,600
Right. So when list.

1679
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:16,000
Why in this case because this allows
duplicate elements, correct?

1680
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,120
It is a part of collection
and it allows duplicate elements.

1681
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,360
So guys understood, how are we going
to write this dynamic function?

1682
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:28,760
So next time let's say you will be having
19 keys or 20 or 25 keys

1683
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,920
and your first rule
will be having all the keys

1684
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,040
again, your remaining rows
will be having all the values.

1685
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:35,760
Fine.

1686
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:39,680
It will get the data getting physical
number of rows, but we have function.

1687
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:42,080
We have function for all the columns.

1688
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,280
Do we have function?

1689
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:48,480
We have function to get the data from
the cell and converted into the string.

1690
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,040
Do we have that function?

1691
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,320
We have the function.

1692
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:56,200
Now what we need,
we need a function that can read my data

1693
01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:00,240
in such a way
that my every rule is returning a map.

1694
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:05,040
So it will pick the map, it will add
this mapping list, it will go again.

1695
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:09,720
Check that out again Next low again,
take the data added in the list,

1696
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:12,840
then go again
in the time my rules are finished.

1697
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,680
That's
why I took all physical number of rows.

1698
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:16,520
Right.

1699
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:17,480
So do again.

1700
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:19,520
I have to use data structure.

1701
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,920
We are using collection.
We are using loops.

1702
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,480
We are using correct.

1703
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,520
Now let's
go ahead and use loops in this case.

1704
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:28,760
So remember, guys,

1705
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,760
the structure,

1706
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:34,400
the structure which we are following
is what inside list.

1707
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,960
I will be having map inside a map.

1708
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:39,560
I will be having two strings
together. Correct.

1709
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:44,880
This would be the structure
I'm going to follow list and to map.

1710
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,720
Did the explanation clear or not?

1711
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:50,280
Guys, tell me first,
is it clear what I just explained

1712
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:59,720
to everyone?

1713
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:05,240
So let's go ahead
and we will write this function.

1714
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,200
There's not much time.

1715
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,520
Right, But I need you.

1716
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,680
Attention probably is static.

1717
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:15,120
First,
I am going to add my list inside my list

1718
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:19,560
I would be having that right
and inside the map.

1719
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:20,880
Come on.

1720
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,680
What I.

1721
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:28,560
I would be having my the string

1722
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,880
comma

1723
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:40,320
external to

1724
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:46,800
this map.

1725
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,240
Now it is just important. Fine.

1726
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:52,680
I have an important message
about our students right

1727
01:44:53,880 --> 01:44:56,680
met no map into list

1728
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:01,200
every single
who is regarding what map right.

1729
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:04,080
So we are taking all this map
one by one into list.

1730
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,600
List list will be having
multiple elements. Correct.

1731
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:12,160
So first we are taking the map
and then we will add this map to our list.

1732
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,040
Two things I need.

1733
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,040
The first is to read the file.

1734
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,000
I need file, but

1735
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,720
that indicates.

1736
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:26,640
The second thing is I need my sheet.

1737
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,600
Then we days to get the file
path and sheet name right,

1738
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,880
which method we have used

1739
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:42,960
gave for file name and for sheet name,

1740
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:47,720
which method we have used.

1741
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:50,800
And you see
it says to open the Excel book.

1742
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,040
We have open Excel, right?

1743
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:57,200
And to get to open the sheet
we have to get sheet.

1744
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,800
Okay, so simple.

1745
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,960
I will call this two methods open accent
find file path.

1746
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,320
Right. And then

1747
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:10,400
get sheet and then provide this.

1748
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:14,000
Get it correct.

1749
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,160
Now I've opened my file
but I open my sheet.

1750
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:22,440
The next thing what I am going to do
is I'm going to put this list Right.

1751
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:23,880
Fine.

1752
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:30,480
Matt is playing comma is string.

1753
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,680
So I'm going to say the list to data
right.

1754
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:38,520
That I'm going to use in Let's see,
I'm going to use edit

1755
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:49,560
Okay.

1756
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:50,440
And some time

1757
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:54,440
we need to understand one thing
that we can't leave some topic in between.

1758
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:56,400
Correct?

1759
01:46:56,400 --> 01:47:00,000
Because if I'm explaining something
and it requires 2 hours

1760
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,600
to explain the complete topic, then it is

1761
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:06,840
my responsibility
not to leave that topic in between.

1762
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,120
Otherwise
the students will get distracted.

1763
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,160
Sometimes topic is more important
than break

1764
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:19,440
aggregates.

1765
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,240
No, I'm not. I'm not any.

1766
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:23,040
Sometimes you need to understand, right?

1767
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:24,680
The breaks are not that important.

1768
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:26,040
Trade topic is important.

1769
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:29,400
If you leave this topic right now,
if you don't understand this topic,

1770
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,760
if I leave this topic in between,
you won't be able to understand.

1771
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,280
Even after watching the videos. 14
or 20 times.

1772
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,440
Please try to understand this right.

1773
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:41,160
If students are insisting me
to explain this topic

1774
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:45,240
and this is something extremely important,
you are not realizing importance

1775
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:48,800
of this topic that once you're going
to the industry, you have to use it

1776
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:56,120
every now and then, right?

1777
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,160
Like I said, just ten more minutes
straight then more minutes.

1778
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:02,960
I need not much, but please
try to understand, do this for you.

1779
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:05,400
I know how to puzzle data
from Excel. Right?

1780
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:06,280
This is for you.

1781
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:10,440
Let's.

1782
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,640
All right. So now

1783
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:14,720
what we

1784
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,320
have to do is we have to add our map.

1785
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,640
Whatever Every row is returning.

1786
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:23,680
What every rule is returning map.

1787
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:26,760
I'm going to add
back in the list. Correct.

1788
01:48:27,200 --> 01:48:28,680
That's what we need to do.

1789
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,720
So now we are going to do it here.

1790
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,280
Remember my outer loop.

1791
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:35,480
I'm going to use to for loop.

1792
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:39,200
The first one is to count
all the rows, right?

1793
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:44,560
To count all the rules and then the inner
one, the one we create the map.

1794
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,360
Right? First I will go inside of my role.

1795
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,040
It will take the value from there.

1796
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:51,120
I will go inside.

1797
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:53,520
It will collect the values,
all the column face.

1798
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:54,720
Correct.

1799
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,440
So let's go ahead and do it.

1800
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:58,800
Guys, what is this symbol?

1801
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,120
Understanding.

1802
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:03,600
So let writing for

1803
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:06,000
outer loop.

1804
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,320
All right,
so I'm going to write this for loop

1805
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,280
right here.

1806
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,600
EFC, I'm going to start right.

1807
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:19,080
I'm going to start my index fund
role is equal to one again.

1808
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:23,040
Somebody did me while I'm passing
this role is equal

1809
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,760
get role count

1810
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,040
and then the role

1811
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:35,160
plus.

1812
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:59,440
Yes, correct.

1813
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:05,000
I'm going to create now I'm saying
the function is creating a map, right.

1814
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,360
For every role.

1815
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,560
The code which I'm going to

1816
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,320
integer me.

1817
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,720
So what I'm saying basically is here

1818
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,840
I'm seeing in this function
what I'm going to do.

1819
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:27,080
I'm going to create a map
for every single rule.

1820
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:29,560
This is extremely important, right?

1821
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:31,480
This is extremely important.

1822
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:34,800
So we are going to we are going to read,

1823
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,920
we are going to read every rule
and create a map.

1824
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:42,720
So the function which I'm going to write
now because we are already inside

1825
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,720
so I can draw.

1826
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,640
So from second row,

1827
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:48,680
we will start all right to exist,
go inside, create a map.

1828
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,040
Right. So let's go ahead and do it.

1829
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,480
I'm going to right here
is see in the list.

1830
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:57,240
Here in the list, I will add a map,

1831
01:50:57,720 --> 01:51:00,240
but I need to map to add something
in the list.

1832
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:00,960
Correct.

1833
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,600
So let's create this map first, I'm

1834
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:06,480
going to write here, Map eliminate.

1835
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:08,680
My key is also a string.

1836
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:10,920
My values also string. Right?

1837
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:13,480
So I'm going to create this map
equal to nil.

1838
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:17,880
I'm going to use link
hash my already discussed

1839
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:22,440
when people thinks about link the hash map
right.

1840
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:23,240
We have seen this.

1841
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:28,200
I was the only one who explained
who taught you these maps. Now.

1842
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:32,040
Now I'm going to loop

1843
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:38,640
all looping through the values,
the values of all this cell.

1844
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:43,520
It means for the next command, which
I am going to write, it will go through

1845
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:47,040
all the values of my cells, whatever sense

1846
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,760
I have right in my every single row,

1847
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:54,720
it will return the values of those rules,
all of those cells.

1848
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:55,320
All right.

1849
01:51:55,320 --> 01:51:59,800
So for another for loop,
I'm going to write C, I'm going to write

1850
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:03,040
in Integer and minutes from which column

1851
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,640
I'm going to read the values

1852
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:09,200
guys.

1853
01:52:09,200 --> 01:52:10,320
Column one or zero.

1854
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:11,000
Exactly.

1855
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,560
Column is zero
because zero means first column, right?

1856
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,960
And I'm getting the value
from the first column.

1857
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:18,200
Column is my zero.

1858
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,760
I'm going to say column
when get column count

1859
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:25,640
point and column column
depends on my rule, which I'm passing.

1860
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,200
Fine. So it's a column

1861
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:31,400
that's a plus point.

1862
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,400
Now, here, tell me, guys,

1863
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:37,320
when I'm getting the values right,
this one is giving me the value.

1864
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:41,080
I have to add, the values are starting

1865
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:44,160
to the saving right
and start to the saving the values.

1866
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,800
Okay.

1867
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,720
It started with it's giving the values.

1868
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:51,320
I have to add this value in the map.

1869
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:55,400
What is the command to add
value in the map,

1870
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:58,880
which method we use?

1871
01:52:59,480 --> 01:52:59,760
Right.

1872
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:02,760
So let me write
the map, start to put right.

1873
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:05,880
And then here, put what same data.

1874
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:09,320
Remember I have method data, right?

1875
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:13,440
So this tells
it is asking the row index date.

1876
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:15,720
This is asking row index.

1877
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:19,280
Tell me two things I need key and value.

1878
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,880
Key and value. Right.

1879
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:26,520
So first one is growing because tell me
guys, by default my rule is same not

1880
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:29,200
my rule.

1881
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:31,640
Always, always seem to get the key right.

1882
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,480
Comma, comma.

1883
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:37,480
I'm going to write this column right
in first row

1884
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:40,920
in first to get all the columns.

1885
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:44,520
It means this is my key

1886
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:48,240
guys in first row
getting all the columns is my key.

1887
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:54,480
Now, when it comes to value,
nobody gets cell data for my every rule.

1888
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:57,480
It means there I'm
plus in this draw is equal to one.

1889
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,640
From here
it will start and draw plus plus.

1890
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:03,440
So from first or second or third row,
it will take my column.

1891
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,640
Now, don't worry.

1892
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:07,440
Let me explain you why.

1893
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:08,320
Come on,

1894
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:13,080
let me take the code of this part
from here.

1895
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:15,600
Right.

1896
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:16,920
Like snapshot.

1897
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:17,920
Another one

1898
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,360
right now.

1899
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,560
Now you'll see.

1900
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:36,000
It came inside of my first rule right.

1901
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,800
It came inside my first rule.

1902
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:44,400
Correct base.

1903
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:48,360
Can you see when it came inside
my first rule, it is asking.

1904
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:51,080
It is asking to prepare the map playing.

1905
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:55,600
So to prepare that may to wait on to
the column is equal to zero.

1906
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:56,520
It means this.

1907
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:58,920
It means me.

1908
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:01,760
My first rule and column zero. Right.

1909
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,520
So let me open my Excel sheet, guys.

1910
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:07,480
My first index is based on column zero.

1911
01:55:07,480 --> 01:55:10,280
It means this value right? For this venue.

1912
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,720
It is trying to get fine.

1913
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:18,120
So now when I come here, when I come here,
it says I have to add one.

1914
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:20,440
This is my key. This is my building.

1915
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:26,680
It says in the zero rule
first column, 000.

1916
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:28,520
Right, Right.

1917
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:30,760
Guess zero common zero.

1918
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:34,000
So when it goes into zero, common zero,
what it will find,

1919
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:39,040
what it will find in zero zero.

1920
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:41,040
This is my first name.

1921
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:42,760
Correct? My first name.

1922
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:46,080
So here, if you come, zero zero will find

1923
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:49,440
first name. Similarly, get cell data.

1924
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:54,360
So it always starts from with one
right row starts from where

1925
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:58,720
one comma column is zero one common zero.

1926
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:01,920
Now let's go back. One comma zero means

1927
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:03,440
correct.

1928
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,720
So first name is my and

1929
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,160
that's how it is working.

1930
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:10,760
Correct.

1931
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,800
Then again, column change.
What rule? Same.

1932
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:17,480
So this time column is zero comma one.

1933
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,200
It means what?

1934
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:20,600
Middle name.

1935
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:21,960
Right.

1936
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:25,160
First row point but column this time one.

1937
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:30,320
So one comma one it means what one comma
one means should correct

1938
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:35,560
it will again change
and give you the excess.

1939
01:56:35,560 --> 01:56:37,600
Yes. Yes. Correct. Correct.

1940
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,280
So now see my rule.

1941
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,040
Same only column is changing.

1942
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:45,280
It means I'm getting the keys
from first row but from different columns

1943
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,000
getting my point.

1944
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,120
And here
when getting when I'm getting the values.

1945
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,440
So for getting the values right
every time my role is

1946
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:56,240
changing, column is changing, right?

1947
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:59,240
So right now
my role is one one common zero,

1948
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:02,000
then one comma one, then one, comma two,
then one.

1949
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:05,760
It means for looping
through all sense of my role

1950
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:09,960
and getting the data and converting it
interesting way I get some data correct.

1951
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:15,000
So when I'm done
with the first iteration of this part,

1952
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,280
it will return one map or not. Tell me

1953
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:23,160
this is what I am doing for wonderful.

1954
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:23,960
Correct.

1955
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:27,600
This is what I'm doing for the first title
when I'm done.

1956
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:30,560
So for the next we will put row index one.

1957
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:31,920
No, we will not put.

1958
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,640
We will not put.

1959
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:35,880
You see here we have
put this increment operator row plus plus.

1960
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:36,960
Correct

1961
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:40,160
in zero plus plus.

1962
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:41,760
Now see how it works.

1963
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,800
If this column is equal to zero column
plus plus it is increasing,

1964
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:47,360
increasing increasing rate.

1965
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,840
It says a row is equal to 40.

1966
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:51,720
Everything is done.

1967
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:54,240
It says one is less than one
in this situation.

1968
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:56,160
So situation is false.

1969
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:56,840
It will go.

1970
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,880
And now the index becomes two.

1971
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,200
This growing base becomes now.

1972
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:04,160
So again came inside again came inside.

1973
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:06,960
Column zero starts zero comma.

1974
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:12,240
It means what this is for second row again
you're getting the key zero zero

1975
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:17,040
it means false name but here this time
root index change two two.

1976
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:22,840
Right, correct and correct this time.

1977
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,720
This time your rule.

1978
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:28,120
Let me tell you for the second iteration
right now.

1979
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:29,640
This second for second row.

1980
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:31,960
It works this time.

1981
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:34,920
This time
this rule index becomes too, right?

1982
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:39,600
So this rule becomes
two column is zero zero comma zero.

1983
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:43,480
It means first
name as a key two commas needle.

1984
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:49,400
It means the first name from second row
trade in two comma one middle name

1985
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:53,920
from second row, then two comma
two made it the last name from second.

1986
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:54,760
Right.

1987
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:57,840
And that's how you will be completing
the data

1988
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:01,640
grouping second
then similarly from third row.

1989
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:02,760
But remember,

1990
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:06,120
remember in our function here,

1991
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:11,120
when I'm getting this data, when I'm
this data for every rule I told you

1992
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:14,640
after creating the map for every row,

1993
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:18,880
first we have to add this map correct.

1994
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,720
First we have to do what?

1995
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:23,400
We have to add this map,
otherwise it will overwrite.

1996
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:30,160
So I'm going to write
it is to add the map in list point.

1997
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:33,720
How can I add the map in this case?

1998
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,280
Can someone tell me

1999
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,760
this is my list object?

2000
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,480
Right?
I want to add this map inside my list.

2001
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:45,880
How can I do that?

2002
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:48,720
Mystery data don't add what I want to add.

2003
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:50,800
I want to add a map

2004
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:52,680
correct?

2005
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:53,360
Correct.

2006
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:54,840
So now,

2007
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:59,160
now it will add the data again.

2008
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:02,120
Go here, find again. It create one map.

2009
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:05,920
Edit here again, go here for another row.

2010
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,160
Again,
it will create a map edit in the list

2011
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:10,840
when it is done for all the rows

2012
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:14,600
after the after
going out of this iteration,

2013
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:19,680
when all the rules are done, what it will
do, it will simply return you.

2014
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,920
This list data, which is heavy.

2015
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:26,080
All the maps inside this list are data.

2016
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:27,000
Correct

2017
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:48,520
guys, guys.

2018
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,520
Why so silence?

2019
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:53,240
Understood. I will explain once again.

2020
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:54,160
Don't worry about it.

2021
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:57,120
But at least you understood
what I just said.

2022
02:00:57,120 --> 02:01:04,720
Clear to everyone.

2023
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:07,560
You need to check the data. Maybe cursor.

2024
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,160
Right. Maybe calibrations.

2025
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:10,640
You're putting something else.

2026
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:11,880
Something inside or outside.

2027
02:01:11,880 --> 02:01:12,840
That's fine.

2028
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:16,680
So now, now see this function?

2029
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:19,000
This is the universal function.

2030
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:19,440
I have.

2031
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:23,360
That doesn't matter how many rows
you have, how many columns you have,

2032
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:26,520
how many sheets you have,
how many files you have.

2033
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:31,080
You just change the file name
the sheet name it will read their data

2034
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:35,840
for all the rules in all the cells
and convert this into this string for you.

2035
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,720
Correct.

2036
02:01:39,720 --> 02:01:40,960
I recognize

2037
02:01:46,640 --> 02:01:57,120
you there, Marks.

2038
02:01:57,120 --> 02:01:59,760
I put everything right.
I put notes everywhere.

2039
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:03,520
Can you see?

2040
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:05,160
Yeah, correct. Correct.

2041
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:09,920
Mike All right, guys, if you understand
right, if you understood the things

2042
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:12,160
you actually, I will.

2043
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,360
I can understand that.

2044
02:02:13,360 --> 02:02:23,160
Let's take a break for 10 minutes
quickly for you guys.

2045
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:24,040
All right?

2046
02:02:24,520 --> 02:02:27,560
Just take a break for 10 minutes
and then we connect once again

2047
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:32,920
after 10 minutes.

2048
02:02:32,920 --> 02:02:37,880
We had we had a day
read this part to add the Excel data.

2049
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:41,880
But so far, so far, we are not using

2050
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:44,560
we are not using this in a test case.

2051
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:46,120
All right.

2052
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:51,160
So now what we have to do in this case
first, we have create a new test case

2053
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:55,360
where we will add employees
using this particular Excel point.

2054
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:56,600
Right.

2055
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:00,240
So now this is the time I remember
I gave you the overview,

2056
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:04,240
putting the Excel pilot one place
and then writing this function.

2057
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:05,360
Two things are done.

2058
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:07,600
The third thing is to use these.

2059
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,240
This function in our actual test kits.

2060
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:13,360
So now tell me if I want to add employee.

2061
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:16,200
Should I create the
new test case in which class

2062
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:28,720
inside test case is my package right now?

2063
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:31,000
Dashboard is my page.

2064
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,040
This one

2065
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:34,680
for creating the test gives us.

2066
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:39,600
I have just to log into an employee test,
so I'm going to open it and

2067
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:43,440
let me write another test.

2068
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:44,440
No, no, no.

2069
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:47,200
I'm going to write public

2070
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:50,280
and the employee I'm going to write Void.

2071
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,160
And how many employees?

2072
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:57,560
I'm putting multiple add
multiple employees

2073
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:58,400
starting

2074
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:01,760
correctly.

2075
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:05,480
Guys.

2076
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:08,520
So to add employer,
what is the first thing you

2077
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:11,040
post?

2078
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:13,800
I have to log in, right?

2079
02:04:13,800 --> 02:04:15,800
So to read the log in page, right.

2080
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,200
I can write log in page equals to new

2081
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:22,440
log in page to call the log in function.

2082
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:23,280
Right.

2083
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:27,040
So this would be my log in page
start log in.

2084
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:32,440
And there I paused the password
from config reader dart.

2085
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:35,280
You can copy the same line from line
number 16.

2086
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:36,280
Right.

2087
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:39,760
But I'm writing it so
that people can understand what I'm doing.

2088
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:41,200
This is for my user name.

2089
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:42,800
The second one is for my

2090
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:46,000
password.

2091
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:47,720
Good property.

2092
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:53,160
When I'm blasting the score here,

2093
02:04:53,160 --> 02:05:06,800
what I find

2094
02:05:08,120 --> 02:05:09,440
it is

2095
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:13,520
all log in after log in after log in

2096
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,960
to click on what race

2097
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:18,760
option and dashboard button.

2098
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:19,560
Correct

2099
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:22,680
it employee button.

2100
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:26,320
So let me can I take this an employee
retention option from here only?

2101
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,120
Can I take that?

2102
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:30,480
All right.

2103
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:31,880
I'm just trying to save your time.

2104
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:34,640
This way.

2105
02:05:34,640 --> 02:05:38,360
Navigate to add

2106
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:39,720
employee

2107
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:46,000
page. This

2108
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:52,200
now now, the most important point here,

2109
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,480
the most important point
which I am going to write

2110
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:58,720
first.

2111
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:02,880
First, I am going to write
because I need this list

2112
02:06:03,640 --> 02:06:06,000
that I'm having met

2113
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,400
there, I'm adding data, right?

2114
02:06:08,560 --> 02:06:11,480
I'm having the data to read this function.

2115
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:14,600
I'm writing as Neil

2116
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:17,520
Employees write

2117
02:06:21,200 --> 02:06:22,320
Keep this thing to here.

2118
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:25,440
I'm trying to write it as new employees.

2119
02:06:26,040 --> 02:06:27,800
What these new employees will do

2120
02:06:30,080 --> 02:06:30,600
this new

2121
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:34,480
employees will have their data,
which I'm getting from my file.

2122
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:38,400
So from which class I'm taking this case,
in which class I have

2123
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:46,400
my function is going to be.

2124
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:47,840
It says

2125
02:06:49,160 --> 02:06:50,880
accelerating

2126
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:53,120
dart, which function?

2127
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:57,200
I have to always get same data open
Excel column count

2128
02:06:57,720 --> 02:07:01,320
extending to list which function
the first one or any other one

2129
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:04,800
can be the collective function.

2130
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:08,440
That universal function is which one
we have

2131
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:13,000
on the exact same data

2132
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,240
we have already called inside X
and in the list map, correct?

2133
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Yes. The first one Excel in too
nice to map.

2134
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,800
Remember the function.

2135
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:25,440
Let me show you with

2136
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:27,640
this Excel list.

2137
02:07:27,640 --> 02:07:31,880
And to my right, you'll see here
I'm using this data here, right?

2138
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:33,240
Column and data.

2139
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:36,360
Everything I'm taking. Yes, Yes.

2140
02:07:36,360 --> 02:07:41,080
So now, now when I go
my in my employee test,

2141
02:07:41,640 --> 02:07:46,080
it is asking what it is asking itself
excellent to list point.

2142
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:49,080
So which part right
which party for providing.

2143
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:51,480
So I'm going to see my file name.

2144
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:54,120
The first thing I see from my

2145
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,320
from my constants.

2146
02:07:57,320 --> 02:08:00,600
Right. Just take the data file. But

2147
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:04,560
I recognize

2148
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:08,840
comma it says sheet name is

2149
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:11,400
what is the sheet member

2150
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:16,560
employee database.

2151
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:18,120
So employee

2152
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:21,600
data correct.

2153
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:24,640
Now my this new employees object

2154
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:27,840
having all their data from my method.

2155
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:33,240
The method is taking this data
from my Excel file right now.

2156
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:34,680
Tell me to.

2157
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:38,520
I tried to iterate the values one by one
and to check

2158
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:42,000
that I am having all this values
inside the map,

2159
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:45,360
right inside the for loop
having these values

2160
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:48,720
right or to get the values
one by one, one by one.

2161
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:58,800
Can I use a trade or not? Yes.

2162
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:02,160
Let me show you that I just provided
the name at this point of time.

2163
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:05,800
Can you see this employee data here?

2164
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:11,400
They occupy nobody's notice.

2165
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:15,720
So this employee
datasheet I already mentioned

2166
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:19,600
is in this one line, right?

2167
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:21,960
I have written this one line
only of new code

2168
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:32,080
is everyone with me so far here.

2169
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:36,120
But now know when

2170
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:40,400
to write the iterator. Why?

2171
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:43,400
I'm going to write the iterator
because I need to.

2172
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:47,640
I need to read the values
which I'm gifting inside

2173
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:51,720
my map.

2174
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:55,760
I see in this apparatus I is equals

2175
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:58,360
to which object I'm going to use.

2176
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:01,880
I'm to use my new employees object

2177
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:05,640
from where I'm getting the data

2178
02:10:10,040 --> 02:10:10,600
right.

2179
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:13,360
Everyone knows
I created a concept already, right?

2180
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:15,720
So each and everything
to get the data correct.

2181
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:17,480
Correct. Right.

2182
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:22,320
So now any guys new methods, new methods
we use for iterator,

2183
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:26,040
which are those two methods

2184
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:30,600
has next force, right?

2185
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:32,040
Which loop we generally use

2186
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:36,600
while loop.

2187
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:37,000
Correct.

2188
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,160
So I will write a dart as next line

2189
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,240
inside this next right.

2190
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:48,320
What I will do is go in my map
where you are getting

2191
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:51,840
this is free comma another stream.

2192
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:53,040
Right?

2193
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:56,840
So you are going to take this map of new

2194
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:00,720
employee is equals to it dot

2195
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:04,280
till the time
you are getting the values right.

2196
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:08,160
Just for this give new from every row
given new from every row

2197
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,800
in this particular map.

2198
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:12,440
Right
In the time you are getting the value,

2199
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:14,600
go ahead, check it in my map.

2200
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,000
The first thing

2201
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:21,840
now every single thing I am having here,
whether it is first name, last name,

2202
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:25,560
middle name, whatever the things
I'm having, I will keep it here.

2203
02:11:25,800 --> 02:11:27,760
Okay? I'm having it here.

2204
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:31,320
If I want to access those things,
If I want to access those things,

2205
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:32,760
how can I exist?

2206
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:35,440
Let me show you the very first thing.

2207
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:42,280
If I open the application,
what is my application?

2208
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:43,840
This is the first name, right?

2209
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:47,240
I have to pass
very first key is my first name.

2210
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:47,880
Right?

2211
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:50,640
Let me do this.

2212
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:53,640
I'm going to write
my assigned text. Correct.

2213
02:11:54,840 --> 02:11:55,880
First name is available

2214
02:11:55,880 --> 02:12:01,840
on which page goes to me.

2215
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:10,440
So on an employee page rate.

2216
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:11,640
No, no, no.

2217
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,920
First name my locator.

2218
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:15,240
Right. Let's check.

2219
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:16,920
I have the locator for first name.

2220
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:19,360
I have the locator form
within the locator form.

2221
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:20,400
Last name.

2222
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,080
Do I need more locators?

2223
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:25,600
Nice.

2224
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:27,520
We need more locator

2225
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:31,040
exponents.

2226
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:32,840
Are you with me?

2227
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:37,560
Everyone?

2228
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:39,880
All right, so we need more locators. Fine.

2229
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,200
Let's go ahead and check
how many locators we need.

2230
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:46,840
We need check checkbox for log in, right?

2231
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:49,080
Correct. Yeah.

2232
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:54,200
Username, password, confirm, password,
photograph, straight and checkbox.

2233
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:56,520
We need all of this lipstick.

2234
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,760
Let's take them one by one.

2235
02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:01,720
So I'm going to take for photograph.

2236
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:02,040
Right.

2237
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:02,880
First

2238
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:36,680
when it gives me.

2239
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:38,920
Is that ID photo? Fine. Fine.

2240
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:41,600
So next we take it here.

2241
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:45,160
I'm going to write this as

2242
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:49,680
mine for photo.

2243
02:13:49,680 --> 02:13:50,520
Fine.

2244
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:54,840
So I'm giving simple name as

2245
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:00,240
photograph.

2246
02:14:00,400 --> 02:14:04,120
Correct.

2247
02:14:04,120 --> 02:14:04,480
Okay.

2248
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:06,600
False name, middle name.

2249
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:08,880
Last name photograph is done. Right.

2250
02:14:09,720 --> 02:14:13,600
Let's take the another part after right.

2251
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:15,720
That's important as well.

2252
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:19,920
We are to perform this check log in option
this low by default

2253
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:22,000
it will be like this. Fine.

2254
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
So let's take this check log in option.

2255
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,280
So it says check, log in. Fine.

2256
02:14:27,080 --> 02:14:28,360
Let's take this check log in.

2257
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:31,040
Also.

2258
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:33,840
So I'm going to write it is

2259
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:37,920
create log in,

2260
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:39,360
check was

2261
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:42,760
right after three log in check box.

2262
02:14:42,760 --> 02:14:47,040
We need username password entry password.

2263
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,560
We copy this here for

2264
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:53,120
username

2265
02:14:58,720 --> 02:14:59,160
mirror.

2266
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:03,120
Make this create username.

2267
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:05,600
The second one would be

2268
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:11,040
weird password

2269
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:18,720
and the third one would be my

2270
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:22,440
password.

2271
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:24,440
Right. So now let me come back here.

2272
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:26,480
When I click here

2273
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:28,440
it says this username.

2274
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:30,920
So it is your username.

2275
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:31,800
Fine.

2276
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:38,160
I'm going to copy this idea then

2277
02:15:39,560 --> 02:15:46,800
for ideas

2278
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:50,520
password and for confirm password.

2279
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:54,120
Again I go, I will take this password

2280
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:58,480
from here.

2281
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:01,800
All right, guys,
I got all these locators. Yes.

2282
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:04,440
Can you please see

2283
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:08,920
these three pull locators
we already had earlier?

2284
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:12,280
Right now
I'm having the remaining locators.

2285
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:19,840
Wait with me.

2286
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:21,080
Let's go ahead.

2287
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:23,000
And now let's try to complete.

2288
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,200
Artist is here.

2289
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:27,560
So on this page, right on which page?

2290
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:29,280
I have all these things

2291
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:35,160
that I have to create.

2292
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,920
Be what?

2293
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:39,920
I have to create the object first.

2294
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:41,520
So let me create the object

2295
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:44,520
first here at one place,
I'm going to create all the objects.

2296
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:48,680
So I said,
an employee feet is equals to new

2297
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,320
and white page.

2298
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:55,200
Now I have to write an employee page

2299
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:58,040
start first name Correct.

2300
02:16:58,320 --> 02:16:59,400
This is my

2301
02:17:00,120 --> 02:17:01,920
now see using excel

2302
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,640
find if I need to change their data
using Excel file.

2303
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:10,760
If I need to send the data,
my is available inside this map.

2304
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:13,560
New employee. Correct.

2305
02:17:13,560 --> 02:17:16,880
So I will make my new employee

2306
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:20,360
dark gate.

2307
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:23,520
Now remember that this is the only thing
you need to remember.

2308
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:26,520
Method get everyone knows, right?

2309
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,040
Look into values via key.

2310
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:33,160
So now guys,
I should remember whatever they keys.

2311
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:36,480
I mentioned that this key
should be the same key

2312
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:39,120
which you have parsed your excel file
here.

2313
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:43,960
If you are providing something else,
it will not get your data.

2314
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:46,320
So I am passing the same key. Right?

2315
02:17:46,320 --> 02:17:49,200
What I have provided there
and I'm using that key here.

2316
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:49,680
Correct.

2317
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:52,520
Similarly, I can write

2318
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:56,520
it for ADD and right page dot or maiden
name.

2319
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:58,200
Also. Fine.

2320
02:17:58,200 --> 02:17:59,280
So do we have this?

2321
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,920
Let's check it and then

2322
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:06,240
again,

2323
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:08,880
this is the key
I have defined in my Excel find.

2324
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:11,600
So I'm calling this data from there

2325
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:15,800
and start lastname comma.

2326
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:19,200
This is the map object, right?

2327
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,360
That I'm having all the values

2328
02:18:23,320 --> 02:18:24,520
my gear.

2329
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:26,600
Right.

2330
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:35,440
So for any confusion, if so,

2331
02:18:36,480 --> 02:18:39,840
for any confusion, they send me

2332
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:46,440
no regret

2333
02:18:47,960 --> 02:18:51,280
after after getting this,
after getting this right.

2334
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:54,840
I'm writing here select checkbox.

2335
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:58,200
But now for the selection of checkbox.

2336
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:01,760
Right again, I have to perform
just one thing

2337
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:05,520
more before checking the checkbox.

2338
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:07,680
Right? First let's upload the picture.

2339
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:09,160
Send text

2340
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:11,760
and employee page dart

2341
02:19:13,440 --> 02:19:14,440
photograph.

2342
02:19:14,440 --> 02:19:18,800
So from where
I'm sending the photograph dart get again

2343
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:23,400
and then this would be the key
for my photograph.

2344
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:24,080
Let's check

2345
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:25,960
with Capital P.

2346
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:32,200
I photographed
that capital photograph, correct.

2347
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:35,240
Now, guys,
tell me before selecting the checkbox.

2348
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:38,680
Right before selecting the checkbox,
do I need to check

2349
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:42,280
whether my check box is available or not?

2350
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:48,800
Or do I need to check whether my check box
is already selected or not?

2351
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:49,760
Should I do this or not?

2352
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:50,400
Tell me

2353
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:56,040
we have to do it right.

2354
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:58,800
So let's write one condition here.

2355
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:03,920
What my if conditions is it
says if my dart

2356
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:10,440
create log in checkbox is the negative.

2357
02:20:10,440 --> 02:20:13,440
I'm saying no, it means what

2358
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:16,200
it means or not.

2359
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:17,880
I put this not here. No.

2360
02:20:17,880 --> 02:20:21,640
See sunny or displayed.

2361
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:26,000
It should be selected.

2362
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:26,640
Right?

2363
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:31,240
So if it is not selected I'm safe
because I put this not right.

2364
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:33,280
Can you see? It is not.

2365
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:36,920
If it is not, then simply click there.

2366
02:20:38,400 --> 02:20:40,280
Click on this

2367
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:43,080
3:00 in checkbox simply

2368
02:20:44,400 --> 02:20:45,800
right now.

2369
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:49,120
See when I have to write that best
guess how easy it is

2370
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:52,680
to write that test because
because everything is available every bit.

2371
02:20:52,680 --> 02:20:54,880
I just need to collect all of them
together.

2372
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:58,200
Yes, that's what I'm doing now.

2373
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:01,480
After doing this, I have to go.

2374
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:04,200
Wait.

2375
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,400
Provide

2376
02:21:06,360 --> 02:21:12,080
credentials for user correct.

2377
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,120
I have to provide credentials for user.

2378
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:17,360
It is very easy guys here.

2379
02:21:17,360 --> 02:21:19,680
I have provided false memory
to name last name

2380
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:33,240
which I should employ 80.

2381
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:36,120
We are not using embroidery as of now.
This will be your task.

2382
02:21:36,120 --> 02:21:38,280
I will give you that
the task. Don't worry.

2383
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:38,640
Right.

2384
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:41,160
I will tell you what to do in that case.

2385
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:44,040
Employee
We are not using any BRC right now.

2386
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:50,560
I am not using Employee Correct.

2387
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:53,760
General Can you see anywhere
if I'm using embroidery?

2388
02:21:54,360 --> 02:21:56,320
We are not using any BSP.

2389
02:21:56,320 --> 02:22:00,240
So now, now the next thing
what we are going to do is here

2390
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,480
we are going to perform, we

2391
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:07,920
are going to provide the username
and password and confirm password.

2392
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:08,160
Right.

2393
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:11,640
So again,
on the same page and employee page,

2394
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:14,760
start my create username.

2395
02:22:15,920 --> 02:22:20,360
So here also I am putting this data map
new employee dark.

2396
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:23,400
Okay, from there, what is the key?

2397
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:27,840
The key here is user
name with capital you.

2398
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:31,280
So I'm going to write here

2399
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:34,160
user name with capital you

2400
02:22:34,160 --> 02:22:36,600
and again same text on the same page.

2401
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:37,680
Start

2402
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:40,800
create password

2403
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:44,040
using the same key

2404
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,560
capital P

2405
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:51,120
and then again the employee page.

2406
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:52,480
Start

2407
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:57,120
the C password comma,

2408
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:00,200
you map dark gate

2409
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:04,520
and again you're passing the now.

2410
02:23:04,520 --> 02:23:08,160
But remember, I was talking about
one point with all of you guys, right?

2411
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:13,840
That if someone reads your code,
even they create password, the password.

2412
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:14,400
Right.

2413
02:23:14,480 --> 02:23:17,200
But we are passing the same string here,
right?

2414
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:22,880
Even though this functionality is seen
right by here, it looks weird.

2415
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,840
Password. Password.

2416
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:25,400
But this this is safe.

2417
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:27,680
That's why people generally don't prefer.

2418
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:29,440
But since we are using right now.

2419
02:23:29,440 --> 02:23:31,880
So we will do this like this only right.

2420
02:23:31,880 --> 02:23:35,840
And this the guys
after putting all their data

2421
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:38,680
after putting all their data
I have to say would also.

2422
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:40,320
Right. So let me play

2423
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:45,480
the save time

2424
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:47,320
now 10 minutes.

2425
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:51,160
Is this correct?

2426
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:54,960
Is this correct to add the employee

2427
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:04,120
right,

2428
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:08,760
this iterator, what this iterator will do,
I return every time.

2429
02:24:08,760 --> 02:24:11,240
Check.
All right. I'm having data go ahead.

2430
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:12,760
Use it at employee.

2431
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:16,360
Go ahead, use it
and employee again and again and again.

2432
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:21,240
I am using this particular test case
to add the data from Excel fight.

2433
02:24:21,440 --> 02:24:25,200
So now,
based on the number of sets of data

2434
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:30,480
I have in my X and find my this best case
and my this iterator

2435
02:24:30,680 --> 02:24:34,440
will add back
many employees using the same function.

2436
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:37,080
Now just go back.

2437
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:38,640
Go back one hour back.

2438
02:24:38,640 --> 02:24:41,600
I explained one topic data driven testing.

2439
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:45,440
When we see
when we test the same functionality

2440
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:50,200
across different data,
we call it data driven testing.

2441
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:52,440
That's what we are doing
as of now. Correct.

2442
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:55,600
My same test case
for adding multiple employees.

2443
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:59,840
I'm adding multiple employees
using different sets of data, isn't it?

2444
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:00,640
That's what I'm doing

2445
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,120
anyways.

2446
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:08,120
This is what I am doing or not

2447
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:15,680
right? So

2448
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:19,360
please, we want

2449
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:27,760
right now.

2450
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:43,680
This is the time to execute.

2451
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,280
Sure.

2452
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:48,680
Can you see this?

2453
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:49,560
Sure.

2454
02:25:50,840 --> 02:26:04,720
Line number 4 to 6 for me.

2455
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:06,800
Okay, let's execute this.

2456
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:24,240
Test kits support.

2457
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:26,320
Let's see if we are getting any errors

2458
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:30,840
or we are able to execute the test case
right.

2459
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:31,280
Let's see.

2460
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:33,920
I'm not sure what's going to happen.

2461
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:36,240
If we make mistakes, we will learn.

2462
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:38,920
If we execute,
we can see that we are lucky.

2463
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:43,640
Flexi? Yes.

2464
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:44,520
Correct. Correct.

2465
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:46,760
Sorry, this is your universal function.

2466
02:26:46,760 --> 02:26:48,360
It will do everything for you.

2467
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:49,600
Every single thing for you.

2468
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:54,160
It will.

2469
02:26:54,160 --> 02:26:56,320
Even if you have 1000 employees. Fine.

2470
02:26:56,600 --> 02:26:58,680
You have 100 kids. Fine.

2471
02:26:58,680 --> 02:27:00,360
You have just ten employees. Fine.

2472
02:27:00,360 --> 02:27:01,400
You have just one key.

2473
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:04,000
Find all kind of data. It will read.

2474
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:08,240
That is for sure.

2475
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:09,400
Let's see. Let's see

2476
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:24,960
if you are getting
the error with locators or something.

2477
02:27:24,960 --> 02:27:25,640
That is fine.

2478
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:34,160
We can understand.

2479
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:35,080
That's great.

2480
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:35,640
That's great.

2481
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:36,120
You want that?

2482
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:44,200
You found one bug here
and the application.

2483
02:27:44,200 --> 02:27:52,080
See, it is getting the data correct.

2484
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:52,560
Can you see?

2485
02:27:52,560 --> 02:28:09,720
It is getting the data.

2486
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:10,600
It is not.

2487
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:14,680
It was trying to add all the data
since the employee only exists.

2488
02:28:14,680 --> 02:28:20,040
That's why it didn't get the data
that was the problem.

2489
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:22,600
It should execute for the tree basically.

2490
02:28:22,920 --> 02:28:31,200
Let's check it for username.

2491
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:41,360
Fine.

2492
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:44,920
Let me do one thing
right after I iterating their data,

2493
02:28:44,920 --> 02:28:49,480
I will keep my team option here right
every time.

2494
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:50,920
Okay. Got it.

2495
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:51,680
Got it. Got it.

2496
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:56,760
Now what I'm doing is basically
right after I creating the data again,

2497
02:28:56,760 --> 02:29:00,560
I'm clicking on team option, I'm
clicking on an employee option, and then

2498
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:01,600
I'm going inside.

2499
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:03,720
Yes, he is.

2500
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:05,120
Yes, I got it.

2501
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:07,560
I got it. Yes. Accelerating fight.

2502
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:08,480
All right.

2503
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:10,240
If we should this accelerating.

2504
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:14,520
Can you see this accelerating?

2505
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:14,880
Yeah.

2506
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,560
Let's try to execute once again.

2507
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:17,880
I have figured it out.

2508
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:20,200
What happened was we were not clicking on

2509
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:23,520
an employee waiting multiple times.

2510
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:25,040
I will tell you.

2511
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:26,640
I will tell you that.

2512
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:31,680
See, in our test case,
this click option on team

2513
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:35,760
button and eight employee is, Something
we have to do every time.

2514
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:38,560
Every time before adding the new employee.

2515
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:39,520
Right.

2516
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:42,520
I was doing it outside.

2517
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:46,360
So before every application
it was not clicking on every option

2518
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:48,720
and employee button. Correct.

2519
02:29:48,720 --> 02:29:53,080
But every iteration for every operation
the flow should be same.

2520
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:54,680
That's what we need to do.

2521
02:29:54,680 --> 02:29:58,160
Okay, Now let me just do one thing before
executing it.

2522
02:29:58,160 --> 02:30:00,440
Once again. Let me change the data.

2523
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:03,560
Guys, please don't use data, other data,
which

2524
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:28,800
I'm going to use.

2525
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:29,880
Which one is already there?

2526
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:36,280
One, two, three.

2527
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:38,200
Okay, fine.

2528
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:40,280
We are clicking on save button, right?

2529
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:42,080
So it is not going on to the next page.

2530
02:30:42,080 --> 02:30:43,320
That's what you need to see.

2531
02:30:43,320 --> 02:30:45,400
All right, Let's see that.

2532
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:47,520
Let's see that way. It is not going.

2533
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:51,560
If if user is already exists, then
they should not go on to the next page.

2534
02:30:51,880 --> 02:31:05,520
That is the case case.

2535
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:09,920
I have again changed this data Now,
this time, let's try to execute this part.

2536
02:31:10,840 --> 02:31:11,920
Let's see.

2537
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:21,000
I mean, I need to once again.

2538
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:24,800
Yes, right.

2539
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:27,720
Eugene, taking this screenshot
is the next process, right?

2540
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:30,880
We will learn listeners
and in the listeners we will add

2541
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:31,560
the screenshot.

2542
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:35,040
Don't worry about it.

2543
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:39,520
I just want to show you
this execution part because when you add

2544
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:44,080
the user again, it will click on team
option, it will go the employee page.

2545
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:46,600
From there it will execute this stuff.

2546
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,640
That's what I want to show.

2547
02:31:48,640 --> 02:31:53,840
It means we're able we should be able
to pass their data from multiple files.

2548
02:31:53,840 --> 02:32:13,080
That's
what I'm just trying to explain here.

2549
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:16,360
Now if you see right
it it created the data.

2550
02:32:16,480 --> 02:32:18,240
It came on to this page.

2551
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:20,640
Can you see Jamal?

2552
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:22,440
It came on to this page right

2553
02:32:24,200 --> 02:32:27,040
now again, it is clicking here again,
go there

2554
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:30,360
uploading the file, getting data, right?

2555
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:33,120
Yes, he is. That's what I said.

2556
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:34,680
I just changed one part.

2557
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:36,640
That's what I'm trying to show you now.

2558
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:38,560
It is taking for the second iteration.

2559
02:32:38,560 --> 02:32:40,240
It means it is editing this.

2560
02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:41,000
Take an employee.

2561
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,880
This time you'll see
it has added the second employee.

2562
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:52,080
This is the third employee now, right?

2563
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:53,120
Understood.

2564
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:59,400
Is everyone.

2565
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:03,240
Now let me show you what change
I did in this code

2566
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:07,920
black.

2567
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:09,840
And we have to check why.

2568
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:13,720
So here, if you see this, click
on team option and an employee button.

2569
02:33:13,720 --> 02:33:14,040
Right?

2570
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:17,000
I didn't earlier inside this work so

2571
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:20,880
before I creation right before attrition

2572
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:24,880
I was just clicking on one thing
on team option.

2573
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:27,960
This should not be the case
after save button.

2574
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:30,480
It doesn't matter on which screen
I am. Right.

2575
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:33,400
It was trying to figure out this
first name field.

2576
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:36,480
But first name field was not there, right?

2577
02:33:36,480 --> 02:33:37,920
The first thing it was not there.

2578
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:40,800
So I have to make the full flow
once again.

2579
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:43,120
So flows is going to be my option.

2580
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:45,280
Click on an employee button.

2581
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:47,200
Then you will see first name again.

2582
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:48,120
Going to be my option.

2583
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:50,520
Click on it employee button
and then you will see full speed.

2584
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:51,200
Right?

2585
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:55,240
So every time after clicking on
Save Button every time

2586
02:33:55,400 --> 02:33:59,200
after clicking on same button,
I'm clicking on same option, I'm going on

2587
02:33:59,200 --> 02:34:03,880
to add employee button, I'm coming on
to the first name and then I will write

2588
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:06,880
I will enter all the data
to add the employee.

2589
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:08,440
This is what I'm doing

2590
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:13,440
now from the X and find we are able to

2591
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:18,120
we are able to basically execute
and add multiple employees here.

2592
02:34:18,680 --> 02:34:26,720
So far, is it correct?

2593
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:28,080
Guys understood.

2594
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:39,480
Whatever the things we did so far.

2595
02:34:39,480 --> 02:34:39,920
Great.

2596
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:43,240
Again, again, I know the topic is big,
right?

2597
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:46,680
And I will give you a quick overview
of this topic inside this session

2598
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:50,240
and then we will cover listeners

2599
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:57,600
in shorts.

2600
02:34:57,600 --> 02:34:58,280
Sure.

2601
02:34:58,560 --> 02:34:59,160
There you go.

2602
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:01,920
This is the end of my page

2603
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:09,120
on the accelerating issue.

2604
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:11,640
Line number 35

2605
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:14,160
in your accelerator.

2606
02:35:14,160 --> 02:35:17,080
Just go and check line number 35
where you are

2607
02:35:17,080 --> 02:35:22,320
making the mistake.

2608
02:35:22,320 --> 02:35:26,920
And here it says accelerating
line number 52 and then line number 47.

2609
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:31,520
So 47 line number, you're passing
the employee data insert off line,

2610
02:35:31,560 --> 02:35:32,800
but that is fine.

2611
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:37,680
The issue is on the in your Excel.

2612
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:39,240
Yeah correctly correct

2613
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:48,000
on the
we need to check that just a moment.

2614
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,920
If there is someone
available in the support

2615
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:53,720
can someone please and in that case
why is not able to see that.

2616
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:56,280
Because in the Excel file,
the accelerating pool.

2617
02:35:56,320 --> 02:35:58,560
Right. There was an issue.

2618
02:35:58,560 --> 02:36:02,000
Let me quickly commit
this code right into the repository

2619
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:05,520
so you guys can have this code with you.

2620
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:22,440
We just put it.

2621
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:24,840
Everyone can get this updated code right.

2622
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:28,920
Once you get this updated code, everything
will be working in your machine.

2623
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:33,200
Andre, just try to get this code right.

2624
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:35,760
You don't need to change the path
of any Excel. Fine.

2625
02:36:35,760 --> 02:36:37,920
You don't need to change anything
racially.

2626
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:39,920
We have a setup in such a way.

2627
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:44,960
We are using this system get property
so it will return the part of your system,

2628
02:36:44,960 --> 02:36:45,840
not my system.

2629
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:48,600
That is the beauty of using framework
array.

2630
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:51,640
The same structure, the same file name,

2631
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:54,600
the same part will be working
in everyone's machine.

2632
02:36:54,760 --> 02:37:02,200
You don't need to change anything.

2633
02:37:02,200 --> 02:37:04,880
All right. I pushed my code.
I committed my call already.

2634
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:09,960
Database? Yes.

2635
02:37:10,200 --> 02:37:12,360
Even the fight. Even the fight

2636
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:17,160
muscle.

2637
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:21,040
It will not complete constant file,
but it should be constant

2638
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:24,800
start configuration federation data paper
or test data hypothetically

2639
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:26,560
if you see constraints or file.

2640
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:30,160
But it never comes like this

2641
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:35,200
for sure.

2642
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:37,320
An employee page. There you go.

2643
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:39,040
This is the template page.

2644
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:39,840
I have my

2645
02:37:42,280 --> 02:37:45,240
it's these web driver users.

2646
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:51,640
This should be during class,
which is fine.

2647
02:37:51,640 --> 02:37:55,960
Not found exception.

2648
02:37:55,960 --> 02:37:56,560
I should leave.

2649
02:37:56,560 --> 02:37:59,400
You see this system dog property
We are using

2650
02:38:00,520 --> 02:38:04,360
this system do not get
property is returning your user directory.

2651
02:38:04,360 --> 02:38:09,000
It can means whenever
your project is destroyed this will return

2652
02:38:09,160 --> 02:38:13,720
date proper location of your project
and inside your project.

2653
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:15,200
Since everything is theme.

2654
02:38:15,200 --> 02:38:17,280
Every location is same.

2655
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:26,200
It will return that kind simple.

2656
02:38:26,200 --> 02:38:28,320
You see,
we are not hard coding the data, right?

2657
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:30,200
We are passing the database system.

2658
02:38:30,200 --> 02:38:34,120
But property.

2659
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:37,640
This one.

2660
02:38:37,640 --> 02:38:39,240
Can you please change the path

2661
02:38:39,240 --> 02:38:43,200
Mike the way you did for the configuration
file, but can you do it?

2662
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:47,120
Change the slashes in the start
one slash before this RC

2663
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:32,080
I guess I can understand.

2664
02:39:32,080 --> 02:39:33,240
No, no, no.

2665
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:35,880
This will

2666
02:39:39,960 --> 02:39:41,280
already recognize.

2667
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:43,320
So I think I'm done from my side
for today.

2668
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:51,600
If you guys have any question can ask
a delays, we can step of the session.

2669
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:55,800
All right, guys,
don't worry about the topic.

2670
02:39:55,800 --> 02:39:56,040
Right.

2671
02:39:56,040 --> 02:39:57,600
I will take you through the topic

2672
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:01,160
once again, break on Saturday
and then we'll try to cover

2673
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:04,320
and wrap up everything from the test
and your framework on security

2674
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:07,080
in the time to this
when nobody is finding out.

2675
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:08,880
I think I can take care to be one by.
