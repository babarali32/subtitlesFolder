1
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,120
Going.

2
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,520
Welcome to another day, another class.

3
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,160
What's going on, everyone

4
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,400
that started it. Yes.

5
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah.

6
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,280
I don't know why your badge comes
a little bit late to collect it.

7
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,400
Who is missing?

8
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,480
A lot of people.

9
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,000
See, I am doing well, guys.

10
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,120
Um, we've been working all day.

11
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,720
Absolutely.

12
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm sure it's, you know, people who are
who are managing this course

13
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,560
after getting a 9 to 5 hour jobs.

14
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
You know, props to you.
Just hang in there, okay?

15
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
There's going to be time.

16
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,960
We'll go by very fast.

17
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,840
So you all, we all know what you look.

18
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,440
You're only on your second week,
so just hang in there.

19
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,600
And for some of you,
I know our international students.

20
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,080
I don't know how you're doing it,
but keep going.

21
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,640
I know it's.

22
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,400
It's a struggle at this point, though,
but it will pay off. I know.

23
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,760
It's probably
I know we have some students here.

24
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,280
They agree one in 4 a.m..

25
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
Okay.

26
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,960
You have to change your thing.

27
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,200
But remember, short time,
just a very short time and then

28
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,680
you'll be good to go with this once
everything is over.

29
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,520
2 a.m. for you.

30
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,320
I like sit here. Shoot.

31
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,920
Muhammed class has started.

32
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,840
You films?

33
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:27,600
Yes, I am right there.

34
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm just waiting for everyone
to jump on us because I have a few things

35
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,480
since today is Will.

36
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,720
Technically,
yesterday was my last class with you guys.

37
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,440
I don't know if I told you
I didn't have a chance to shoot

38
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,120
because there were some issues
with some things.

39
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,560
But anyway, we'll get to that.

40
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,200
By the way,
how was how was how is the project?

41
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,520
I see a lot of you guys
did did the videos.

42
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,160
I think maybe some of them are missing.

43
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,280
But I think overall, I'm waiting on
maybe one or two more.

44
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,360
But it was awesome.

45
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,520
It was cool, right? It was. It was nice.
It was fun.

46
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,880
It was fun with all your members.

47
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,800
You got to see them.

48
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,640
So it was
we wanted the whole purpose behind it

49
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,120
was that, you know,
you guys get out of your comfort zone

50
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,680
because you know this everything
when you're online, you know,

51
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
it gets a little bit challenging
to meet people and things like that.

52
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,960
The whole purpose of it is just to get you
out of their comfort zone

53
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,920
at the same time, make you speak about it,
you know, talk about it.

54
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,880
You know, the ideas
might take some time to gel through

55
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,080
and hopefully glad
and I made all the so far

56
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,120
I think I made all the the class,
the recordings visible to everyone.

57
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,960
So you guys can you guys can check it out.
It was nice.

58
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,880
I saw some very cool ones
out there so far.

59
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,480
I think you guys are doing really well
on that.

60
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,840
Your your group is amazing.
There you go, guys.

61
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,320
That's how you started, you know,

62
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,240
wanting to break that,
you know, that that barrier.

63
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,120
Or you can say, you know, I ice breaker
for you guys later on you guys

64
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,880
can basically do this with each other
studying and things like that.

65
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,760
It was really hard without practice.

66
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,200
See, we are forcing you
into that practice. So.

67
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,560
Mammoth. Yeah,
you probably were in, I guess.

68
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,280
Is he?

69
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,640
I hope he can hear us,
but I mean, you went to the other class

70
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
or debug team is amazing.

71
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,840
I saw some of you guys
come up with a name, but a lot of you

72
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,760
still didn't come up with a name
for yourself, for your team.

73
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,600
But I guess I did.

74
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,480
Look at my my, you're in the right area.

75
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,400
Okay, so guys, really good job on the

76
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,640
on that name in the sense of
if you wanted to give a

77
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,360
a team project name or anything
for yourself if you guys came up with

78
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,360
I know some of you did it,
some of you did it, but it's

79
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,000
okay if you submitted already.

80
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,840
Don't worry too much.

81
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,240
Remember, we might do flip grids
and more projects in the future.

82
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
There will be a lot more for you guys.

83
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,880
This just the second would be great.

84
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,680
So we'll have a lot of times and you guys
will also be working with group members.

85
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,200
You'll get to know each other.

86
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,520
You know, by the way,

87
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,200
the members that you met
probably yesterday, the first time

88
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,120
you guys can do session with each other,
a group session come up with a time where

89
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,560
you guys can study together, anything like
that, you know, absolutely work. So

90
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,040
definitely do it, you know, try to do it
at times.

91
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,720
You know, someone might understand
the concept a little bit better

92
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,560
than someone, but then yourself jump
on a group, call basically a zoom one on.

93
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,360
And yeah, that's a good way
to do a practice actually.

94
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,920
So really good job, by the way.

95
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,280
I see a lot of you did, and I think
there's a couple missing at this point.

96
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,480
So if you did not is better.

97
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,120
Exactly.

98
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,600
Catalina, you learn better
when you can explain to someone.

99
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,200
That means the ideas are more clear
and this agile, this

100
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,440
and that, you know, this is basic theory,
but it's very important.

101
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,880
That's where we put an emphasis,
especially on the agile side,

102
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,560
you know, making sure that you get it

103
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,600
because you'll be working
in this environment,

104
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,480
majority of you will be working there.

105
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,640
So it was it was a good exposure to that.

106
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,840
So I'm glad that you guys enjoyed it.

107
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,440
I'm going to look at
I haven't looked at all of them.

108
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,560
I looked at majority of them, but
some of them, I'm going to look into them

109
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,240
and if there's any comments,
I'll leave them.

110
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,120
But very good practice.

111
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,000
I really enjoyed it.

112
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,200
I always like seeing, you know, the students interacting with each other, you know,

113
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,080
correcting each other in a

114
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,760
it's a good way to, you know, communicate
and bond as well, too.

115
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,680
Because remember, you guys
are going to be here for six months.

116
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,400
Are we going to start automation today?

117
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,480
Absolutely not.

118
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,120
You know, let a year, a month delay

119
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,160
for creation today, you guys are going
to get started into manual testing.

120
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,480
You will get into manual test.

121
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,920
The automation is a little bit far ahead
for you guys, maybe a little bit from now.

122
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,000
Today.

123
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,320
Basically, we have yeah, you going
to get into the stealthy part of it

124
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,080
and I won't be teaching you guys.

125
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,640
We're taking over.

126
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,600
I call him the King and Mr. Diego.

127
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,440
He's going to be taking over.

128
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,320
Actually, he's an awesome instructor.

129
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,480
He actually worked
on the mental testing part,

130
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,200
created a lot of these slides
and everything for you guys improved it.

131
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,640
So he's going to actually take over Diego

132
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,880
and then you can turn on your video
if you are able to do so.

133
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,960
But yeah, he's
the one going to be taking over for me.

134
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,520
By the way,
tomorrow is your first review class.

135
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,600
So I know last week, you know,
because the missus, Sal,

136
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,080
she wasn't able to join, but

137
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,960
because her she got sick,
we only went over one class.

138
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,320
But tomorrow's class.

139
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,720
Another instructor
Who will do your review, Mr.

140
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,880
Asger, he's
going to be basically joining tomorrow

141
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,240
to do your first review
of the first class.

142
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,600
So make sure you join that since
little bit extra practice for you guys.

143
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,160
And then, yeah,
you guys are going to be good.

144
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,680
Is she feeling better?

145
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,280
Yes, she is feeling better,
but she did get COVID,

146
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,360
so she's recovering at this point.

147
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,960
So that's why no one expected it.

148
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
But it happens, you know,
but she's definitely feeling a lot better.

149
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,400
So hopefully she will either join you this
weekend or the following one.

150
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,680
It is crazy, right?

151
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,920
You never know.

152
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,360
So. That's right.

153
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,560
So that's really about it, guys.

154
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,200
As far as myself, guys, I know I only had
a very short time with you guys.

155
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,080
Only taught you guys, what, three classes.

156
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,240
More like two classes.

157
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,360
Yesterday was more practice.

158
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,000
But, guys, I'll be here.

159
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,600
I know you guys.
Majority of you will forget me.

160
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,120
It happens all the time.

161
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,960
I usually come in the beginning
and then I go away and then I come back

162
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,320
towards the end and interviews
and I basically join you guys.

163
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
I'll try to motivate you in between.

164
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,680
I'll try to come in, motivate you
because it does happen, you know?

165
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,440
But it was he again.

166
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,640
Who was he again?

167
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,480
You mean Diego.

168
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,120
He's going to be your new instructor.

169
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,000
I, I used to teach a lot more before, but,
you know, I have awesome team members.

170
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,360
You know, they do a better job
since, you know,

171
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,400
I could absolutely teach you guys
some of this material.

172
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,800
But, you know, I haven't been outside
of the corporate field for some time.

173
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,000
It's not fair

174
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,320
for me to teach you something that's not
so irrelevant in my mind at this point.

175
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,920
You know, that's why we have Mr. Diego.

176
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,960
He's going to take over.

177
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,240
And since he is,
Diego will give you explanation

178
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,720
and he has background, you know, he
he manages a lot of teams.

179
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,040
A lot of people work under him.

180
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,720
So this guy knows what he's doing.

181
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,640
Are you retired? I'm technically retired.

182
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,280
You can say this, but I'll join
you guys towards the end in interviews

183
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,080
and in between guys, thank you.

184
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,440
Thank you so much. Not plenty to be here.

185
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,360
Time to time.

186
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,760
I do see everything, even
though you might not see me interact much.

187
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,360
But throughout the course you will see me.

188
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
Absolutely.

189
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,280
And you guys can always message me.

190
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,560
I love talking to you guys.

191
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,000
I wish we had something in person so
I could see you guys, but you never know.

192
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,160
Maybe you will figure something out
and we'll see you guys.

193
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,080
Can we DM you with questions?

194
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,840
Absolutely. Did me with questions.

195
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,120
This related stuff.

196
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,360
If it's related,
please do it out there for that.

197
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,120
And it's a long topic.

198
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,720
I used to, but I'll be happy
to answer your questions.

199
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,920
Absolutely.

200
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,800
Come to Buffalo.

201
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,680
It's a little too
cold, but I would definitely

202
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,000
know you
absolutely all will survive to me.

203
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,760
So guys, thanks again.

204
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,280
I'll basically sign up from my side
and Diego

205
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,400
he'll give you a introduction
and he will start the class with you guys.

206
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,920
All right, guys, take care
and I'll see you in between.

207
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,000
Sometimes.

208
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,360
High tech.

209
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,440
Our guys. Diego, you take care.

210
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,560
But you got this answer.

211
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,120
All right, man.

212
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,320
Thanks.

213
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,600
Let's see. Let's see.

214
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,400
Let's see. It's

215
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,680
all right, guys.

216
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,040
I'm showing my screen. Can you.

217
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,640
Can you guys hear me?

218
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,360
Can you guys see me?

219
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,320
Can you guys see my screen?

220
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,960
Yeah.

221
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,320
Let's see.

222
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,440
Who do we have today?

223
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,520
It's my first class, so I'm going to.

224
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,720
I. I start to get to know
some of you guys.

225
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,320
Nice to meet you. How's.

226
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,960
How's the class so far, guys?

227
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,400
How's everything? I was.

228
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,680
How was your first week?

229
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,600
Good, good, good, good,

230
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,720
good, good, good.

231
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,800
All right, good, good.

232
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,320
Well, it's awesome.

233
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,760
I see a lot of positive feedback,
so that. That's great.

234
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,200
So far, so good.

235
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,680
All right, Perfect.

236
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,280
Let's see. It is 713.

237
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,440
Okay.

238
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,600
I believe we have most people online, too.

239
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,760
Minor says so much fun.

240
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,200
Let's try to keep it that way.

241
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,680
Okay. Let's try to keep it that way.

242
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,080
Let's say.

243
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,640
All right, guys.

244
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,200
So let's see who else is here.

245
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,560
All right, guys. Perfect.

246
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,600
Okay, So are you guys ready
or you guys ready

247
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,760
today?

248
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,800
Like, the real class starts.

249
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,560
The real stuff starts today.

250
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,280
Are you ready?

251
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,440
Are you ready?

252
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:42,360
Ready, Ready, Prepared, motivated.

253
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,320
Jeremy, what's up, man?

254
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,320
How are you? Good. Sarah.

255
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,160
I didn't know you were taking the class.

256
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,760
What's up, bro? Are you?

257
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,080
That's cool.

258
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,920
Well, yeah.

259
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,560
Let's touch.

260
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,120
Let's touch base later.

261
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,560
That's awesome, man.

262
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,800
All right, guys, let's get started. Right.

263
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,640
Let's see.

264
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,440
Alexis is also here, right, Alexis?

265
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,040
It's time for him.

266
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,720
What's up, Alexis?

267
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,080
How are you? Congrats on Congrats on your

268
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,040
eye, on your newborn and stuff.

269
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,360
I hope that's going
well. Good, good, good.

270
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:16,920
All right.

271
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,760
So, guys, let's

272
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,760
let's get started.

273
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,400
Okay.

274
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,120
All right.

275
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,440
So today
we start our first official testing class.

276
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,880
We're going to be talking about manual
testing

277
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,880
really for the next

278
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,360
for the next month or so, kind of like
maybe a month in a week and stuff.

279
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,240
We're going to be covering

280
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,640
very important concepts,
fundamentals of testing everything.

281
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,520
And I suggest you pay

282
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,200
very close attention to these classes
because,

283
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,160
you know,
I know that later throughout the course,

284
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,320
you're going to be learning Java,
you're going to be learning different

285
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,200
test automation tools
and everything like that.

286
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,600
But if you really nailed this classes
guys, you can actually retain

287
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,960
in of knowledge to go in the market
and get a good paying job.

288
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,120
Okay.

289
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,400
Today automation is really big,
but manual testing

290
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,000
is still also very important
and there's a lot of manual testing roles.

291
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,600
Opportunities
are still available. Okay, So

292
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,400
even though you're going to

293
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,600
be very technical, you're going to learn
your Java, your selenium.

294
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,240
Yes, the classes is recording.

295
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,760
You're going to be joining your
your selenium,

296
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,040
your your Java and other tools.

297
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,520
At the end of the day,
you're going to be a tester.

298
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,720
So in this next month, we're going
to learn the fundamentals of testing

299
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,960
and how to be a good tester.

300
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,400
It's recording on my end.

301
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,680
You guys see this right here or you guys
can see it, but it's it's recording, okay.

302
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,720
It's recording code.

303
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,720
All right, So let's get started.

304
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,760
All right.

305
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,560
So today we have we're going to discuss
pools of manual testing.

306
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,880
Like what is testing?

307
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,920
Why we test and that kind of thing. Okay.

308
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,240
I'll ask you some questions
and we're going to try to see

309
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,120
how how analytical
we can think about things.

310
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,960
Okay. So perfect.

311
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,760
So the question is,

312
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,040
why do we test,

313
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,760
like, in general, like,
why do we test anything?

314
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,920
You know, like basically anything
doesn't have to be software.

315
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:31,160
Like, for example,
like when, let's say a BMW,

316
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,600
they're about to make a new car, right?

317
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,320
Do you think they just make it
and then they just sell it?

318
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,680
Or do you think that they have to test it?

319
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,760
And when they tested, they have to test it
for many things, right?

320
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,360
Like there's so much out that tested.

321
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,960
Where have you guys ever seen those videos
where where they're kind of

322
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,400
crashing cars on purpose
to see how the impact is and everything.

323
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,480
Have you seen those videos before?

324
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,000
Right.

325
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,200
So that's one type of testing, right?

326
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,160
For those kind of cars.

327
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,760
The test, the security, the the how good
the security features are of that car.

328
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,240
Right. The safety features. Exactly.

329
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,640
And it's lot of the same thing
with anything that is being

330
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,760
developed
or produced or anything like that.

331
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:17,960
Right.

332
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,360
You check the quality,
make sure it meets expectations.

333
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,000
We're going to talk about bugs
and what they are.

334
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,680
Okay and how we can identify bugs.

335
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,800
We also test to reduce the risk of error

336
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,960
and to continually improve the product
overall.

337
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,360
Okay.

338
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,720
Now we're going to be talking about
software testing in general software.

339
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,480
What is a software based
what is software? You guys know,

340
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,800
what is what is software?

341
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,320
Someone says programs

342
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,840
like feel free to Google as well,
but I'd like for you

343
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,920
to put in your own words
like what do you think software is?

344
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,920
Go Someone says an application

345
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,800
and that's okay.

346
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,440
That type of someone says a soul.

347
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,440
What? What does that mean?

348
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,920
Machine readable code.

349
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,800
Okay.

350
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,760
Okay. Okay.

351
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,680
So I see you guys are kind of like

352
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,520
given some similar answers, right?

353
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,600
Is the Instagram app a type of software?

354
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,200
Okay, what about the Facebook app?

355
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,680
Is it a type of software to.

356
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,640
Okay, what about the
the the calculator on your phone?

357
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,640
How about that one?

358
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,360
It is it is a type of software, right?

359
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,400
Okay. Very, very good.

360
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,960
Okay. So

361
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,640
we need to test software.

362
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,800
When we talk about software,

363
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,960
we're talking about like applications
in general, wherever there is software

364
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,920
development going on,
there's always going to be testers needed.

365
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,160
For example,

366
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,120
you know, Facebook, Google, Amazon,

367
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,960
really any company
and any vendor that has applications,

368
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,040
these applications are developed
and they have to be tested.

369
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,760
And let's think about this, this testing
end for these applications or not.

370
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,720
Like, for example, the Amazon develop
their application to just be like that.

371
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,080
And like that said, never change.

372
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,400
Or do they always keep changing things?

373
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Do they introduce new futures? Right.

374
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,800
Do do they change?

375
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,160
You know,
they have to keep updating stuff, right.

376
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,000
So along with that,
there needs to be testing.

377
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,360
Okay. And testing.

378
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
And I'll tell you what type of testing

379
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,600
we're going to do and everything like that
and so forth.

380
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,080
Okay.

381
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,280
Is it living software always changing
things are always changing.

382
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,080
Right? Exactly.

383
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,360
So let's talk about quality,

384
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,000
because when you apply for a jobs,
you're going to see the work quality.

385
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,440
A lot.

386
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,640
The rules are going to be called Q8
testing

387
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,760
or Q8 testers
or quality assurance engineers.

388
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,960
Quality assurance
for for quality assurance.

389
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,400
So so what is what is quality?

390
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,360
You know, and here's the
the dictionary definition on the screen

391
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,720
the standard of something as measured
against other things of a similar kind.

392
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,720
But when we talk about quality,
quality is really subjective, right?

393
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,160
For example, a good quality for
you may not be good quality

394
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,320
for for me, you know what I mean?

395
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,880
It just it just depends.

396
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,600
And we're going to talk about that
when we talk more about requirements

397
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,040
and how we know that there's
there's quality and so forth.

398
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,640
Okay.

399
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,560
Our main goal
as a tester, as a testers to make

400
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,440
better products

401
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,080
by trying to know
what makes the end user more excited.

402
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,400
Okay.

403
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,360
And when we say more excited,
we mean like, just have them

404
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,200
have them have a a better user experience.

405
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,080
For example,
if you have to go on your bank's website

406
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,200
to make your credit card payment,

407
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,360
you're probably not going to be excited
about that, right?

408
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,000
You have to make a payment

409
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,400
like that.

410
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,600
Doesn't sound so exciting,
but at the same time

411
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,840
they need to develop that application

412
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,040
and make it accessible for you
so that you can easily,

413
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,240
so that you can easily, you know, use it.

414
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,720
Right.

415
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,040
For example, let's say that you're
trying to make a payments, okay,

416
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,920
whatever bank
you have, the Wells Fargo, Navy, Federal,

417
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,920
you name it, and you can't make a payment
like something's wrong.

418
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,680
Like you're you're adding to the balance
that you want to pay

419
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,560
and then you click the paint up.

420
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,880
And for some reason the pay number
and it's not working

421
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,320
like it's just not working.

422
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,760
You restarted your phone,
you uninstall the app, you install it

423
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,600
again, it's just not working
and you can't make the payments, right?

424
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,120
How would your experience be
at that point of view?

425
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,880
It's going to be frustrating, right?

426
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,560
Let's say it's

427
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,280
let's say you had the deadline and and
you know that if you don't make a payment,

428
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,240
they're going to charge you
a late fee, right?

429
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,200
So you're going to get stressed out,
you're going to get called,

430
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,760
you know, you're going to get charge
a late fee,

431
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,320
probably you're going to have to call
and explain to them that you should,

432
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,960
you know, and so forth.

433
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,520
So this is

434
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,120
this is why we test application.

435
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,040
So it's not always for applications
that are going to make you excited.

436
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,840
Excited, right.

437
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,040
Like no one's ever
excited to make their car payments or

438
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,240
or I mean, maybe you do get excited.

439
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,520
I don't get excited personally.

440
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't know if anyone here gets excited
to make any sort of payments, but,

441
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,040
you know, you want your experience
to to be like at least pleasant.

442
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,520
Right. And that's their responsibility.

443
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,640
But then we have other applications,
right?

444
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,000
Like who likes going on
Amazon and buying stuff?

445
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,120
You know,

446
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,280
who likes going

447
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,520
on, on, you know, on anything, on, on, on

448
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,720
like websites like experience
of look flights or what else.

449
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,400
What are the websites you guys visit
that were you guys purchase something

450
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,200
that that kind of makes you excited
there's Amazon there's

451
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,280
there's like you know
oh okay crypto Coinbase

452
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,800
yeah everyone says Amazon Okay
eBay, Alibaba.

453
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,960
That's fine syntax. Right.

454
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,240
Okay. Very, very good.

455
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,520
Right.

456
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,880
And it's not always like purchasing.

457
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,840
It's always like sometimes applications
can be there to provide more information

458
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,400
to you, right?

459
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,440
Like, let's say you're doing some research
and something is broken.

460
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,880
You click on a link and when you click on
a has anyone ever clicked on a link?

461
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,040
And then it takes it to a page
and it just doesn't work.

462
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,120
Like you get an RSS. Like

463
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,840
this page

464
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,640
is not not found kind of thing, you know.

465
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,120
So that happens to. Right?

466
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,160
And it can be important information.

467
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,080
Okay, So what is software testing?

468
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,000
Right. We talked about this.

469
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,760
Okay.

470
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,320
When we talk about

471
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,440
software testing in the projects
that you'll be working in for whatever

472
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,360
company, whichever company you work for,
you really test to make sure that

473
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,760
that that

474
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,760
that whatever is being developed
meets the business requirements.

475
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,880
And I'll tell you about what that is.

476
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,840
Okay.

477
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,080
And that everything is working
as expected.

478
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,560
Okay.

479
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,240
For example,
let's say you work for Google, right?

480
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,960
And as you can see, my screen here,
if you look at my screen,

481
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,480
right,
this is Google, Google, Google slides.

482
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,080
Right.

483
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,320
Let's say
that this is currently in development

484
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,560
and and the

485
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,720
Google says, hey, we would like this

486
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,200
common history button
to have four lines, right?

487
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,200
But the developers develop it
and it has three lines.

488
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,080
Is that a bug or not?

489
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,560
Do you think that would be a bug or not?

490
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,280
Right.

491
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,600
Does that you don't think it's a bug?

492
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,360
Who says it's a bug
and who says it's not processed? Who?

493
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,200
Who says it's a bug and who's it is not?

494
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,280
So we say some.

495
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,400
Some. Yes, some.

496
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,040
Now, okay,
I'm going to repeat the question.

497
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,560
Google is the client.

498
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,960
Google is the company
that is paying you and your team.

499
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,680
Right.

500
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,600
And they're telling you

501
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,920
that they want a button
that has four lines,

502
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,080
but you give them a button
that has three lines.

503
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,880
It works perfectly. When you click it,
you can see the comment history.

504
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,000
It works fine,
but is that what they want it

505
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,560
When you go when you go to a restaurant

506
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,280
and you order like whatever,
like, let's say a burger with no lettuce

507
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,720
and they bring you a lettuce,
they bring you a burger with lettuce,

508
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,040
Are you going to be okay with it?

509
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,760
Right.

510
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,400
You're not right,
but the burger is still good.

511
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,800
So are you going to be okay with it?

512
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,840
It's still exactly right.

513
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,440
So even though it's working

514
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,680
right,
would you consider this a bug or not?

515
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,040
Yes, it would be considered a bug, right?

516
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,840
Because that is not what Google wanted.

517
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,360
And it's your job to test
to make sure that

518
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,440
what's been developed
meets the business requirements.

519
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,440
And in this case, the business requirement
was to create a button with lines

520
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,240
instead of three.
Does that make sense to everyone?

521
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,400
Does that make sense?

522
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,360
Okay, perfect. So this is what we mean.

523
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,560
And that's just a very small example of
of of

524
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,320
of of a business requirement
that you may experience in the workplace.

525
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,920
Okay. You also have to make sure that

526
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,160
that the application is, you know,
it is smooth.

527
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,200
Okay.

528
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,520
For example, let's say you're logging into

529
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,560
to Amazon, okay, let's say
you're logging into Amazon,

530
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,440
and when you're an Amazon,
you're adding things to the cart, right?

531
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,680
But when you're adding an item
to the cart,

532
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,480
you notice
that it's taking a long time to load.

533
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,760
Okay. And

534
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,560
you know,
that's taking a long time to load.

535
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,200
Like maybe it's adding maybe it's
taking like a minute to add to the cart.

536
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,440
Right?

537
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,200
And as a user,
you don't know, you probably think

538
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,560
that your network isn't working.

539
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,360
You probably think that your Wi-Fi
is not working out good connection

540
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,120
and you're on your phone on Amazon
and you keep hitting, you keep

541
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,320
pressing the add to cart button, right?

542
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,320
And you keep pressing,
you keep pressing, pressing, pressing it.

543
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,000
And then after a minute
it says add it to cart.

544
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,080
But when you go to the cart, you notice
that every single time you press

545
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,880
the button, you actually added an item
to the cart and your cart, let's say.

546
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,920
So it has like 30 items after that.

547
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,760
Would you consider that a bug?

548
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,720
Let's see.

549
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,400
You said a bug,
but a bug is not related to functionality.

550
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,040
This is more
no bugs are related to functionality.

551
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,760
So the type of testing you will be doing

552
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,120
or the type of testing you'll be doing.

553
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:31,920
Catalina is is is functional testing.

554
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,400
Okay.

555
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,160
That's the kind of testing
are you going to be doing?

556
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,600
Is that does that make sense?

557
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,160
Catalina

558
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,640
And we'll
talk we'll talk more about that too.

559
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,480
Okay.

560
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,280
Yeah. So it's a it's a functionality.

561
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,640
And the type of testing you'll be doing

562
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,920
is its functions
as it's going to make sense in a bit.

563
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,360
But you got to test those things, right?

564
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,520
It's considered a bug, right.

565
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,320
So can you give me an example now

566
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,200
that we've talked about a couple of bugs,
Give me an example of a bug.

567
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,720
You give me an example of of a bug.

568
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,680
Like just anything like
imagine any application you've used.

569
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,920
Give me an example. Facebook crashing.

570
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,480
But that's a that's a big bug, right?

571
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,440
Not being able to log in.

572
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,120
That's a that's a huge bug. Right.

573
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,840
It's a huge bug emails sending emails.

574
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,800
Okay. That's good.

575
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,840
You can check out.

576
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,240
There you go.

577
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,520
That's a that's a big bug, right?

578
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,000
Accepting wrong passwords
so like option but goes to different pages

579
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,040
can enter username right a software

580
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,120
software bug is narrow for a computer.

581
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
So tell me give me more examples.

582
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,760
You guys are mentioning great examples.

583
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,480
And and based on these answers,
a lot of your answers relate to each other

584
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,120
somehow.

585
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,560
Can anyone guess
how it's related to each other?

586
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,720
Like based on a lot of your answers,

587
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,200
they all relate to kind of like one topic,
right?

588
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,960
What?
What do you think that can upload photo?

589
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,640
Okay.

590
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,520
Doesn't print when you press print one.

591
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,040
Right. Coding errors.

592
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay.

593
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,880
End users not happy
having issues that are meta requirements.

594
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,720
Okay, that's fine.

595
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:32,040
So really
you didn't notice a lot of your answers.

596
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,960
They have to do with, for example,
not being able to log in, not being able

597
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,280
to check out, not being able
to make payment right there.

598
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,520
They all have to be somewhat related
and tied to money.

599
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,720
Right.

600
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,440
If you cannot buy something on Amazon

601
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,520
because you just can't buy anything,
like it's not letting you buy anything.

602
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,840
And let's say it's like that for an hour.

603
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,320
How much money is Amazon
going to lose in one hour?

604
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,680
Can someone take the time to Google
right now?

605
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,120
How much Google make I mean,
how much Amazon makes in one hour, Right.

606
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,040
And let me know how much that is. Right.

607
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,760
So this is why they take their testing
very seriously.

608
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,120
Right?

609
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,040
Same thing with making payments.

610
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,360
Right.

611
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,000
If you need to make a payment to your

612
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,120
if you need to make a car payment
that you need to make

613
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,520
any sort of payment,

614
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,400
who's really losing money,
obviously you're not

615
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,880
obviously have to make the pain,
but who's really losing money, Right.

616
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
It's it's the company, right.

617
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,640
The company, the like Google, Amazon,
whatever you're using, let's say Uber,

618
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,320
Right.

619
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,400
Do us know how much money yesterday,

620
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,960
Facebook, Instagram
and WhatsApp were down, right?

621
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,360
Obviously, people use that
for their personal life and so forth.

622
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,560
But did you guys also know
that many businesses around the world

623
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,720
use Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram?

624
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,560
Did you guys know that?

625
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,280
Right?

626
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,920
I don't know if any of you guys have
a business or anything like that or any.

627
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,400
Do you guys know how much money they lost
yesterday?

628
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,320
It's it's it's crazy, right?

629
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,040
It's it's a lot of money. Right.

630
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,480
And this is just to show you, right,

631
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,280
that really most of these bugs
are kind of related to to money, right?

632
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,320
That that's that's exactly right.

633
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,280
So you already know how much Amazon
makes in one hour.

634
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,040
Right.

635
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,600
And they're going to hire testers like you
to make sure that that doesn't happen.

636
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,400
Right.

637
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,960
And they'll hire
different types of testers,

638
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,240
but they'll hire you
to do a specific testing.

639
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,040
Right.

640
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,040
And they'll pay you
100,000, 100, 10,000, whatever.

641
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,880
To them, that's a good deal, right?

642
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,640
They're like,
you know what, guys? That's higher.

643
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,160
Catalina,
let's pay $110,000 a year and let's just

644
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,040
this will probably help us prevent
such a big mess like this, right?

645
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,400
Catalina Catalina's happy.

646
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,040
She's making good money.

647
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,760
Amazon is, you know,
this is a good deal, right? So.

648
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,800
So think of it like.

649
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,480
That's right.

650
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,560
And obviously, it's not just one tester.

651
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,880
There's many testers
that do different type of testing,

652
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,160
and we want to talk about that.

653
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,320
Okay. Does that make sense so far?

654
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,560
That does that kind of makes sense?

655
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,760
And guys, I want you to start thinking
like everything business.

656
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,400
Everything. Business, right? It's
not just Amazon.

657
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,960
Where do you get your car
insurance from, right?

658
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,800
Geico,
you know, you tell me Allstate, right?

659
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,640
They make money off of that.

660
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,680
Where do you make your car payments work?

661
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,920
Who do you bank with?

662
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,840
How pissed off would you be
if you're trying to log in

663
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,200
to transfer money
from your checking account

664
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,240
to another account,
but you can't log in like it's

665
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,200
not letting you and it's down
for like 6 hours, right?

666
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,560
You need to make some sort of payment.

667
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,560
Your banks website is down
and the application is down.

668
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,600
It doesn't it doesn't.

669
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,240
You know,
you're having a bad experience, right?

670
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,480
You know what's going to happen there.

671
00:42:59,480 --> 00:42:59,840
Okay.

672
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,560
Let's say, for example,
let's think of this scenario here, Marvin.

673
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:08,520
Let's say your who's your bank, Marvin,
You call you backwards guy.

674
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,280
Yeah. We're going to talk about that
SunTrust, right?

675
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,520
Marvin Let's say you want to log
to your checking account, right?

676
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,960
Just to transfer balance
from one account to the other.

677
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,200
You're not making any sort of payments,
right?

678
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,200
You're not making any sort of payment.

679
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,480
So SunTrust
is really not going to lose any money

680
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,960
because you're not going
to make any payment.

681
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,360
You honestly just want to transfer money
for whatever reason.

682
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,160
Then maybe you have to make a payment
or something,

683
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,600
but you realize that their app is down
for like 3 hours.

684
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,160
Okay?

685
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,600
And then for some reason it gets fixed
and you can use it in two days.

686
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,480
The same thing happens again in a week.

687
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,960
The same thing happens again,
right, Marvin?

688
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,120
You're probably going to be like,
I can't put a what's on trust.

689
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,400
I'm going to go bank with Wells Fargo
now. Right?

690
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,560
So guess what?

691
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,560
Now they lost Marvin as a customer, right?

692
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,560
So SunTrust ended up
losing Marvin Business.

693
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,080
Does that make sense, guys?

694
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,120
Do you guys see how all of this works now?

695
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:06,760
Right.

696
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,880
Okay, So it's time to

697
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,480
kind of I want you guys to kind of see
that that bigger

698
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,720
that that picture the

699
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,760
So what is the goal of testing
and why is testing important?

700
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,120
We did talk about, you know,
the goal of testing and so forth.

701
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,520
Here's this link I will share
with you guys, but I'll click it here.

702
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,360
Basically, let's talk about some bugs

703
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,680
that were very, very, very costly.

704
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,160
Okay, So this is Wikipedia

705
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,840
and it's bugs in every single industry,
guys you like.

706
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,600
And I'm going to share this with you guys.

707
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,680
There you go.

708
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,360
And you guys will also get these slides,
by the way.

709
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,200
But here you go.

710
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,520
You can open it on, on,

711
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,640
on, on your end.

712
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,960
And there's bugs of every single time,
of every single type

713
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,760
and every single industry. Right.

714
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,160
How big how big of a deal do you think
bugs are in the medical industry?

715
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,280
Right.

716
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,280
Like it's a pretty big deal, you know,
I mean,

717
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,400
like and now now everything is becoming
digitalized, right?

718
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,240
Everything is digital nowadays,

719
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:18,960
Right?

720
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,560
You know, we have now

721
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,280
do you guys have any family members
that have diabetes nowadays?

722
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,480
They're having digital tests, Right.

723
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,640
How big of a bug would it be
if the diabetes test tells your loved one,

724
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,480
your mom or your dad or someone
that your sugar levels are okay,

725
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,000
but realistically,
they're very high, right.

726
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,160
Do you think that's a bug?

727
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Do you think that that's a bug?

728
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,920
It's a it's a huge bug, right?

729
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,840
It's it's a huge bug. Right.

730
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,880
And and and other things like this,
like imagine

731
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,440
getting wrong information
somewhere and stuff like that.

732
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,800
There's different type of bugs everywhere.

733
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,720
AT&T, right?

734
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,200
You can read about these bugs here
and these bugs are here because

735
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,720
they're huge.

736
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,600
At the end of the day,
these bugs can be very serious.

737
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,360
Okay. And a lot of money is involved.
And you know what?

738
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,280
It's a big risk to read, for example,
that that diabetes scenario that

739
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,880
I just told you, like for medical device,
you know what can happen.

740
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,600
Let's see.

741
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,080
Mazhar and Mohammed speaking about

742
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,160
let's say Maher has a family member
that has diabetes,

743
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,560
that that family member gets the
the wrong, you know, sugar levels.

744
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,080
And then for some reason, that family
member gets very, very sick, Right.

745
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,800
Or passes away. Right. Mom,

746
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,720
as soon as she finds

747
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,120
out that that information was incorrect,
she can sue

748
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,400
the hell out of these companies. Right.

749
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,360
And it's going to cost them

750
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,480
some serious, serious money.

751
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,160
Right. And it will be very hard.

752
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,800
These companies are going to have to pay
a ton of money.

753
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,480
Right.

754
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,000
Especially and let's say
let's say they do say

755
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,680
this family member doesn't pass away,
but they were close to passing away.

756
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,840
Right.

757
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,120
She's still going to file a lawsuit
and she and that company will still lose

758
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,120
a lot of money.

759
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,360
Does that make sense for everyone?

760
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,160
That makes sense.

761
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,200
And it's literally every single industry
transportation, right?

762
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:26,520
Yeah.

763
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,240
Take a look at this Wikipedia

764
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,680
link that I shared.

765
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,080
You know, in military,
there's a lot of applications they use.

766
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,440
I used to work in a Department
of Defense project.

767
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,560
One of the applications
that we were working with was basically

768
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,200
the the software or the applications
that they use in battlefields.

769
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,000
So whenever a troop gets injured,
they kind of carry them

770
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,640
to these tents for like quick recovery
or medical attention.

771
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,520
And these applications had to be very good
to provide

772
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,760
the correct medical information
to track the right medical,

773
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,680
the right medicine, the right
diagnosis, the level of of medication

774
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,440
that they should be treating a true.

775
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,680
So bugs happened there, too. Right.

776
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,560
And it's it's a very, very, very big deal.

777
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,520
Okay.

778
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,040
Now, having this said,
can anyone think of any other bugs

779
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,080
that you can think of any
that you can think of?

780
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,640
Maybe you've seen it in the news,

781
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,320
maybe you've experienced some

782
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,080
yourself aviation software.

783
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,720
Yeah.

784
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,640
Bedbugs.

785
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,600
Bedbugs is a

786
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,000
bed make or

787
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,160
is that are you experiencing bedbugs, man?

788
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,320
Is that

789
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,560
I would

790
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,800
I would kind of

791
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,280
be careful with that a little bit.

792
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,760
Space rays.

793
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,280
Some people are saying space sex

794
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,560
because

795
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,480
any other big bugs
you can think of anything

796
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,960
anything that comes out of it
that you can think of that

797
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,720
they dupes

798
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:19,080
video games right?

799
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,800
Airplanes is.

800
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,120
But do you guys realize, right,
that as everything is becoming

801
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,920
digitalized right.

802
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,720
You're really introducing
and it's becoming modern, Right.

803
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,800
And it's becoming, you know, awesome.

804
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,400
And everything I do

805
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,360
is like all of these electric cars
and everything and all these, you know,

806
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,600
green saving energy companies
and all this like Teslas, Right?

807
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,640
You know what?

808
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,640
That opens the door of?

809
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,640
That opens the door for many mistakes,
right?

810
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,800
Many errors.

811
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:57,960
And that also opens the door
to many more jobs, jobs

812
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,080
that require a specific skill set,

813
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,160
a technical skill set like yours.

814
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,360
Right.

815
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,080
As you know, at the end of this class,

816
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,040
you guys will be some really, really,
really good test engineers.

817
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,240
You guys will know what you guys are doing
and how to test

818
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,560
different types of software to school.

819
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,160
Do we have questions so far?

820
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,880
Are we good?

821
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,280
It's just making sense.

822
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,680
Are we are we starting to think now?

823
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,280
Right.

824
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,040
So can we all agree

825
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,880
that testing is important?

826
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,000
Right.

827
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,320
All clear. Perfect.

828
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,880
All right, cool, cool, cool.

829
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,240
Very.

830
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,400
So there are three types of applications
that we're going to test that.

831
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,920
That we test that you're going to test.

832
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,120
Yeah. Catalina, go ahead.

833
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,480
Ask your question. What is your question?

834
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,000
But let's say your test is
software is okay and goes out.

835
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,520
How does it get a bug once it's running?

836
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,800
That's a very good question.

837
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,120
So let
me ask you let me ask you this question.

838
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:08,160
Do you think that there is such a thing
of finding absolutely every single bug?

839
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,280
Do you think so?

840
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,400
It's not possible, Right.

841
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,840
Did you know that
there are a lot of existing bugs

842
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,040
that exist on the Amazon website right now

843
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,960
and they know about them, but

844
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,200
they haven't fixed them for some reasons
and now we'll talk about that later.

845
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,760
Okay.

846
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,120
Perhaps they're not that serious.

847
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,760
Perhaps their business their business is
not really affected by it.

848
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:36,760
Right.

849
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,560
So they know about the bug,
but they're going to save it later

850
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,480
because they have other priority tasks
that they need to work on.

851
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,200
Okay.

852
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,760
So more to Catalina, this question now,

853
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,600
what happens if you test right
something today,

854
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,840
Let's say you're responsible
for testing a log in future, okay?

855
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,880
The requirement is that you have to
be able to log in with valid credentials.

856
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,160
Okay.

857
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,240
So you go on the website, you log in
with valid credentials and you log in.

858
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,400
It's working today.

859
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,920
Does that mean that you are 200%
sure that that's going to work forever

860
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,360
or tomorrow or Sunday
or next week or something?

861
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:20,320
No, believe it or not,
these things can break code breaks

862
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,680
for many different reasons.

863
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,400
And while you test something today, tomorrow, there's a chance that it may fail.

864
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,160
What makes it very code?

865
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,200
Code is very code
and we'll talk more about that.

866
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,800
Catalina, That's a really good question,

867
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,640
but you can't ever really 100%
trust on code to always work.

868
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,800
Okay.

869
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,560
Believe it or not,
there are applications where

870
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,640
the first 100 times that you log
in, it works.

871
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,280
But the 101 time that you log in, it
breaks.

872
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,320
And and we'll talk more about why

873
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,320
these things happen
and that kind of thing.

874
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:55,840
All right.

875
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,520
Is it interaction between servers?

876
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,760
That's can be a very big one

877
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,480
and that's what we will talk about
in the next classes.

878
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:04,680
Okay.

879
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,320
Very, very good.

880
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,560
Catalina, Catalina,
you're ready to run the market, right?

881
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,160
Looks like it looks like you're ready.

882
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,240
I think. I think you're ready.

883
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:16,840
All right.

884
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,080
So three types of applications with tests.

885
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,720
Okay.

886
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,880
Lobo's sharing

887
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,640
an Airbus bug.

888
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,880
Do you imagine a bug on an airplane
and a plane crashing?

889
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,520
Right.

890
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:40,720
So. Exactly. So.

891
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,640
All right. So,

892
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,840
okay,
there are three types of applications.

893
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,800
We test

894
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,400
web applications, desktop applications,
mobile applications.

895
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,400
Can you guys give me some examples
of mobile applications?

896
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,840
It's very self-explanatory.

897
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,520
Instagram, Facebook, Spotify,

898
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:01,720
good.

899
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:03,640
Twitter, right?

900
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,680
TikTok, right.

901
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,520
Telegram.

902
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,520
Yes, Right.

903
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,120
Good slack.

904
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,440
Right.

905
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,560
Anything that you can download
on a mobile device, You know what I mean?

906
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,080
Like on your phone's tender,
You know, that's it's

907
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,120
good to know that you know

908
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,280
bank mobile apps

909
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,640
whether apps

910
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,880
exactly right now

911
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,160
what what do you think
is a web application just

912
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,000
what do you think is a web application

913
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,440
websites okay.

914
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,520
Google.

915
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,480
Okay.

916
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,800
Google Gmail.

917
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,520
Okay. Web applications.

918
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,800
Chrome, YouTube.

919
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,160
But a lot of these

920
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,000
applications, you're

921
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,240
saying they also work on your phone.

922
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,480
So what is the difference
between a web application

923
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,080
and a mobile application?

924
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,120
Someone said browser based,

925
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,160
they're from coding.

926
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,040
Come on, guys,
let's think outside the box a bit.

927
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,600
Let me ask you this.

928
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:30,840
Does Instagram require Internet?

929
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,680
Okay.

930
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,080
How about
does the calculator on your phone

931
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,840
require Internet?

932
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:45,000
But that's a mobile application, right?

933
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,960
But it's still a mobile application.

934
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,520
Yes. Well, let me see.

935
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,160
What's his name?

936
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,160
Not. No, no.
Is that how you say your name?

937
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,120
I may have said it wrong. No.

938
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,120
Is that how you say it?

939
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,320
Okay. He brought up a very.

940
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,120
That's a very good point.

941
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,200
A web application is any application

942
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,520
that requires access to the Internet.

943
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,200
God, does that make sense to everyone?

944
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,160
So there

945
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,160
are some applications and yes,
you can use them on your desktop,

946
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,600
on your computer, on your on your laptop,
but you can also use them on your phone.

947
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,480
And while they are considered
mobile applications,

948
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,920
they are still considered web
because they they

949
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,880
they access the you know,
they need access to the Internet.

950
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,720
Does that make sense?

951
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,240
Does that make sense to everyone?

952
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:42,560
Right.

953
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,880
Does anyone have any questions
regarding that?

954
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,440
And there are a lot of mobile applications
that don't need Internet.

955
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,040
The calculator is one of them.

956
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,040
What else is one of them?

957
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:59,160
What else is a timer?

958
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,400
Not all mobile applications.

959
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,720
What's to monitor?

960
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,880
Not all mobile applications
require internet right?

961
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,360
For example.

962
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:07,960
Very good.

963
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,600
The flashlight app. Right.

964
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,560
It doesn't require internet.

965
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,800
Okay, Calendar.
The calendar. That's a good one.

966
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,080
That doesn't require internet, right.

967
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:18,600
The note.

968
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,880
Your notes doesn't require Internet,
right?

969
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,240
It doesn't.

970
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,880
But does that make sense to everyone?

971
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,320
Okay,
So while it's downloaded on your phone

972
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,120
or your iPad, it's
considered a mobile application.

973
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,200
But if it needs the Internet to work,

974
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,080
it can also be considered
a web application that makes sense.

975
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,520
And then, of course, any application
you use

976
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,000
that requires the Internet on your laptop
is considered a web application.

977
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,880
Is that clear?

978
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:48,840
Exactly.

979
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,920
Okay. And perfect.

980
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:52,440
Okay.

981
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,320
So desktop applications, what are

982
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:04,160
what are desktop applications?

983
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,240
Give me an example.

984
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,160
Okay. Someone said Microsoft. Microsoft.

985
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,160
What do you mean exactly?

986
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,760
Word. Right.

987
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,520
Microsoft Office Eclipse.

988
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,360
That's a good one. Photoshop.

989
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,960
Good Excel.

990
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,280
That's right.

991
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,640
So Can these applications

992
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,240
so what we mean desktop, right?

993
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,520
That means you have to download them,
but download them where

994
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,440
on your computer, Right.

995
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,240
You're going to download
them on your computer.

996
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,480
Can anyone talk about a

997
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,400
a desktop application

998
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,840
that will only work on a desktop,

999
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:52,200
but not on a phone?

1000
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,840
Does anyone know of any application that

1001
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,600
will work on a desktop
but not on your phone?

1002
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,040
You can download office to your phone
nowadays, right?

1003
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,440
You can download office to your phone

1004
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,000
nowadays.

1005
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,240
Okay. Java's a programing language.

1006
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,640
It's not a it's not a software,
it's not an application.

1007
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,440
Okay, So

1008
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,320
okay,

1009
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,280
a desktop application is an application
that you download.

1010
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,440
Okay. To your computer.

1011
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,160
Okay.

1012
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,360
That does not require internet to work

1013
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,360
and does not require you to use a web
browser.

1014
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,000
The moment you use a web browser
that's not a desktop application.

1015
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,200
Okay.

1016
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,080
For example,
is this Google sheets that I'm using?

1017
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:53,600
Is this a desktop application
or is this a web application?

1018
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,640
It's a web application.

1019
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,840
It's not a desktop application.

1020
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,720
It's a web application. Right?

1021
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,200
What if I open word

1022
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,440
right now, like Microsoft Word,
like right here I have Excel Open.

1023
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:07,000
So if I open this, is this a desktop
application or Web application?

1024
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,920
That is a desktop application, right?

1025
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,400
And can work
without being connected to the Internet.

1026
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,360
Right. But there's another thing, right?

1027
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,520
You should also realize that nowadays

1028
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,280
these are these softwares
are these applications today, Right.

1029
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,360
They're so modernized that

1030
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:33,960
at some point
they need the Internet for what?

1031
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,520
What do you need the Internet for?

1032
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,080
Yes. Updates.

1033
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,240
Exactly. Right. Updates.

1034
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,560
That's right.

1035
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,080
Very, very, very good.

1036
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,720
Very, very, very, very good.

1037
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,520
Okay, cool.

1038
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,120
All right.

1039
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,240
Awesome.

1040
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,960
Very, very good.

1041
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,240
Perfect. Okay.

1042
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,480
So are we good on this?

1043
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,440
Are we good?

1044
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,560
Go. Does anyone have any questions

1045
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,720
so far?

1046
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,840
Good. We talk about a web.

1047
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,400
A web,

1048
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,280
a what you're going to get.

1049
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,080
You're going to get these
You're going to get these knowledge.

1050
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,440
We already talked about it.

1051
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,240
We already talked about a desktop
application, mobile applications.

1052
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,320
We really talked about.

1053
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,760
Let's see.

1054
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,680
Okay, are you guys ready?

1055
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,400
You guys are doing it.
You guys are amazing so far.

1056
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,960
You guys are so far
the best batch we have ever got.

1057
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,000
All right. That's one

1058
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,160
plus one.

1059
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,360
Okay, bachelor, you guys,
you guys are on fire.

1060
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,640
Got this. This is really, really good.

1061
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,680
All right, So manual testing.

1062
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,760
So what is manual testing?

1063
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,160
Okay, so we already talked about testing.

1064
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,200
We talked about the different types
of testing that, you know,

1065
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,200
we talked about bugs, different types of
testing that you will be conducting maybe.

1066
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,200
And we talked about some business
requirements, some potential bugs and

1067
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,000
and so forth. Right.

1068
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,440
Okay.

1069
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,960
But what is manual testing? Yeah.

1070
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,440
So it's basically

1071
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,200
everything manually,

1072
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,840
like manually without any technology,
anything like that.

1073
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:33,240
And and what we mean is like

1074
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:37,480
you guys logging in to like let's say

1075
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:42,480
you guys have to test the log
in functionality for Amazon, right?

1076
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,520
That means you have to go on Amazon.com.

1077
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,920
You have to go to the site and buy it.

1078
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,680
To click on log
in, you have to enter your username.

1079
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,080
You have to enter your password
at the click right.

1080
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,200
You see all the manual effort
that I just did there, right?

1081
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,160
Like I actually had to go open the tab.

1082
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,200
I had to type Amazon.com.

1083
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,280
I had to go and click on, sign on.

1084
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,440
I had to enter the credentials.

1085
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:12,480
And so for assessing
what if you had to run a test where they

1086
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,840
said, Hey, can you make sure that the user
can look up

1087
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,920
anything and add ten items to the

1088
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,960
cart and then check out?

1089
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:23,760
Right.

1090
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,160
So can you shop and check out?

1091
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,320
Yes, you can.

1092
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,320
Obviously running tests
and sometimes they'll give you

1093
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,920
like fake accounts
and stuff to test to make sure it works.

1094
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,280
Yes. By the way, Eugene,
when we say manually that means

1095
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,960
literally any mail intervention.

1096
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,480
If you have to type something, you have to
click something, something, right?

1097
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,120
So let's say that they say, Hey,

1098
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,360
Shareef, you have to go on Amazon.com.

1099
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,480
Make sure to add things to the cart
and then you have to checkout, right?

1100
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,600
So, sure, it's like, okay, cool.

1101
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,000
And he goes and he does it.

1102
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,280
But how long do you think
it would take Shareef to do that?

1103
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,680
How long do you think it would take to

1104
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,200
it would take him.

1105
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,760
It would take a while, right?

1106
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,960
It would. It would literally take him.

1107
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,800
I mean, let's say it takes him like 15,
20 minutes, right?

1108
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,840
Let's just say 15 minutes.

1109
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,760
If he's fast. 10 minutes. Right

1110
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,680
at most.

1111
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,440
But what if they say, okay, cool.

1112
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:33,840
Now, Sharif, we need you to execute
200 more test cases like this.

1113
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:41,840
So how long is that going to take them?

1114
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,840
How long is that going to take?

1115
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,120
And that test case took in 15 minutes.

1116
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,240
And now he has to run 200 other

1117
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,360
scenarios or tests.

1118
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:58,920
How long you think it's going to take him?

1119
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:01,400
It's going to take him till retirement.

1120
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,960
It's going to take him a while, right?

1121
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,360
Let's say it takes two weeks.

1122
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,040
Okay.

1123
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,800
Let's just say it takes him two weeks.

1124
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,600
It takes him two weeks
to execute all of those.

1125
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,960
And then maybe he found the bug.

1126
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,240
Okay?

1127
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,080
And then they say, okay, Sharif,
we fix these bugs.

1128
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,720
Can you run all the tests again?

1129
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:22,640
Right.

1130
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,200
And sure, he's going to be like

1131
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,560
again, you know, like, I just,

1132
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,680
you know,
and it's going to take him a long time.

1133
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,640
It's going to be he's going to be doing

1134
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,520
everything manually and stuff
that by the way, that's manual testing.

1135
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,880
And there's a lot of jobs that still exist

1136
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,160
with that go.

1137
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,920
So that is what are you guys
is that starting to paint a picture?

1138
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,000
And I guess

1139
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,880
it's starting to take a picture.

1140
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,920
Okay The truth is that

1141
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,400
it and it's very important.

1142
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:56,760
Okay.

1143
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,960
It's very, very important

1144
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,880
still to make sure that we always do
manual testing and stuff like that.

1145
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,560
But this is why we do automation, okay?

1146
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:12,120
Because with automation, we can automate
these test cases using different tools.

1147
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,240
There's meant there are many different
automation tools that we're going to use,

1148
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,560
and you guys will learn different
tools here that are the most

1149
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,080
popular in the market today.

1150
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:23,640
Okay?

1151
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,120
Eclipse is not an automation tool.

1152
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,240
Eclipse is an integrated development
environment, right?

1153
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,240
In Eclipse, you can develop programs,
you can do anything, you can write

1154
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:36,520
your Java code, you can do
all sorts of thing in Eclipse, right?

1155
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:40,080
And you guys will get to know
that that's where you guys

1156
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,840
will be writing
or coding your automation scripts.

1157
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,120
Okay, next class,
what I can do is I'm going to run

1158
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,720
some automated tests right here
and show you guys how that works.

1159
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:54,000
That is of course, that makes sense.

1160
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,040
Like, would you guys like that?

1161
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:59,040
I'll actually run some automated tests
so you can see how fast

1162
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:03,000
it can actually go.

1163
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,600
So automation testing and when I show you
tomorrow, it's going to be like, it's

1164
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,040
going to be good, it's going to be fast,
It's going to be, let's say

1165
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,480
submitting a form takes
you like 20 minutes.

1166
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,320
Okay?

1167
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:21,600
Have you guys ever had like to register
somewhere or fill out a form

1168
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:25,720
of any type, like in the like
maybe for a doctor or something like that

1169
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:29,320
and it takes you like 20 minutes maybe.

1170
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,920
Like it's taking a while,

1171
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,960
right? So

1172
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:39,760
I'll show you how an automated script
can run that very fast.

1173
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:43,360
So when Shareef starts to automate,

1174
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,480
okay, instead of spending two weeks
to test those test cases,

1175
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,120
he can run everything within
like maybe two or 3 hours

1176
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,760
at most, maybe sometimes four.

1177
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:00,800
So now that seems very attractive
to these companies, right?

1178
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,840
Let's say Amazon site.

1179
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,680
That's awesome.

1180
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:09,120
Like you just tested all of this
like in 4 hours, right?

1181
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:14,000
So Amazon now knows, okay, we got to
we need to hire more people

1182
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,400
like Shari, people that know
testing people that no automation, people

1183
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:18,960
that know

1184
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,680
selenium, Java and stuff like that
because it's really helping them, right?

1185
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:26,400
So they're going to keep continuing to,
to automate that.

1186
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,160
That makes sense to everyone.

1187
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,200
Okay. But

1188
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,360
before
I don't want you guys to get confused

1189
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,840
I actually want you guys to understand
what automation means.

1190
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,160
Okay. What does automation mean to you?

1191
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,920
And feel free to Google it,
but don't copy and paste answers.

1192
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,240
Put in your own words.

1193
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:54,440
What does automation mean?

1194
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,000
That's. That's okay. Yeah,

1195
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:58,440
that's that.

1196
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,440
It runs by itself.

1197
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,880
Create the code that will check. No,

1198
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,120
no automatic motion.

1199
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,480
No automatic.

1200
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,440
Okay. That's so when they're repetitive.

1201
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,040
No, no, just tell me the definition
for automation.

1202
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,000
Notice I didn't ask you to tell me
what is automation testing?

1203
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:23,440
I just want you to tell me
what is automation?

1204
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,200
Okay.

1205
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,120
Tools.

1206
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:31,920
That means hands free access machine work.

1207
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:32,800
Okay,

1208
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,600
You're kind of almost putting

1209
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,280
everything together.

1210
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,280
Automate manual work. Okay.

1211
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:42,960
For example,

1212
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,440
do you have you
guys ever worked in an office environment?

1213
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,880
And if you're out of the office, right.

1214
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:56,240
And someone sends you an email,
sometimes that person gets an email back

1215
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,720
and it says sorry,
I'm out of the office, I'll be back

1216
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,240
this day or something like that.

1217
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,720
Have you guys ever had
that happen to you right out of email?

1218
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:10,080
So let's say I emailed,
let's say I emailed

1219
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
or months.

1220
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,320
Okay, let's say I email four months
and her mother's out of the office.

1221
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,960
Okay, I send an email.

1222
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:24,760
Does her Matt have to log into his email,
read my email, respond to me,

1223
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,200
say hey, sorry I'm out of the office,
No write today.

1224
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:31,480
You can just send
an automatic reply right?

1225
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:34,680
If I sent him an email,
I will get an email saying, you know,

1226
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:38,440
I'm out of the office, I'll be back,
you know, whenever I go that

1227
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,840
that process there, guys, is automated
does that make sense right?

1228
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,400
Nowadays

1229
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,760
when you work jobs and depends
where you work.

1230
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:53,040
And this was I also used to work in
some places back in the day

1231
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,080
where I would show up to work and
I would have to clock in my hours, right.

1232
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:02,080
And then after log,
after clocking in or logging my hours,

1233
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,800
I would have to go tell my boss like, Hey,
I logged in at this time.

1234
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:06,640
Could

1235
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,040
nowadays, if you do something like that
and you log your hours,

1236
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:16,080
maybe an automatic message
or email of some sort get sent,

1237
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:20,000
you know, saying,
hey, Diego logged in as hours, right?

1238
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,680
So that process is automated.

1239
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,760
This is this started big.

1240
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:29,160
So it started to paint a picture, guys,
of what automation is.

1241
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,080
So listen to this. Okay?

1242
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,840
Auto automation, right?

1243
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,960
Only helps us do what

1244
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,680
we are already doing better, right?

1245
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,800
For us to be more efficient.

1246
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,960
Does that make sense?

1247
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,000
It's about efficiency,

1248
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,120
right?

1249
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,000
That makes sense.

1250
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,480
Who else can give me
an example of something that is automated?

1251
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,520
Literally, anything that is automated.

1252
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,000
For example,
you guys are exactly voicemail.

1253
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,360
What about buying something on Amazon?

1254
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,000
What happens
when you buy something on Amazon?

1255
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,480
What happens is

1256
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,920
you get an email right?

1257
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,680
You get an email email confirmation.

1258
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,080
Does that mean

1259
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,000
that someone had to log in to Amazon,
see that you purchased something

1260
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,800
and then they send you an email saying,
Hey, thank you for purchasing this?

1261
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:20,960
Not right.

1262
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,880
That process is already automated right?

1263
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,560
Exactly.

1264
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,440
So is does
this what someone said about something

1265
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:34,400
locking car doors or something like that?

1266
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,720
I don't I don't know. But.

1267
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,520
Okay.

1268
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,760
Scary, right? Perfect. Right.

1269
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,120
So does that make sense
now, do you guys have an idea

1270
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,080
of what automation is?

1271
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,440
Okay, perfect. Right?

1272
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,920
It's awesome. Okay.

1273
01:12:51,920 --> 01:13:02,800
Any questions so far, no.

1274
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,520
All right, cool.

1275
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:10,040
So if I were to give you a quiz,
next class, will you pass it?

1276
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,000
Once the mom says yes?

1277
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,760
Come on, let's play a game.

1278
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,800
Okay, I'll.

1279
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,920
I'll give you a quiz.

1280
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,920
And if you pass it,
I'll give you, like, a gift.

1281
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:21,880
Okay.

1282
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,280
And if you fill it,
you kind of have to give me that gift.

1283
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,760
But let's say let's say a $50 gift card.

1284
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,280
Okay?

1285
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,960
So if you fill it,
you have to give me a $50 gift card.

1286
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:43,080
Is that is that cool?

1287
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:46,240
Guys, I need you guys to be so confident
with this material

1288
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:49,200
that you can literally play
something like squid games.

1289
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,600
But I being asked these type of questions
and you just sort confident.

1290
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:56,120
Okay, But you have to get them
you have to get them right

1291
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,080
called.

1292
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,080
That makes sense.

1293
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,240
All right, cool. Cool.

1294
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,480
All right, cool.
So how do we start testing?

1295
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,680
How do you know when we start testing?

1296
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,560
Okay, you guys already
talked about Agile, right?

1297
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,440
Agile.

1298
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,280
Cool. What can you tell me about Agile?

1299
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:25,080
What is the difference
between Waterfall and Agile environments?

1300
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:29,640
Agile is faster, Agile is quick.

1301
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:34,440
Agile allows changes right?

1302
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:40,560
Agile is flexible, speed over quality.

1303
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:42,880
Yes, that happens a lot.

1304
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,880
Agile this incremental

1305
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:50,800
waterfall is not changeable.

1306
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,600
Okay We'll talk more about that.

1307
01:14:54,360 --> 01:15:00,320
But if you go on Google right,
and you type in the definition of Agile,

1308
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,160
it's probably like going to tell you
about like development partners.

1309
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,480
To be agile
means that you can move quick, right?

1310
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,760
For example,
you can like Jimmy when, when,

1311
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,880
when Jimmy used to play soccer,
this guy was agile guys.

1312
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,680
Jimmy was top of line, solid player
and the high school.

1313
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,960
This guy had some crazy agility right?

1314
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,800
He was agile.

1315
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,000
He was able to move quick,
he was fast, pace everything right.

1316
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,880
That's the same thing
in agile environment.

1317
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,960
A lot of changes, quick changes
at any time they can happen at any time.

1318
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:31,320
You have to and you have to be agile

1319
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,840
and adapt to those changes.

1320
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,880
Okay, very good.

1321
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,880
So having that said, right,

1322
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,480
there is something else
that we're going to talk about right now,

1323
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,840
but can you guys tell me what is the

1324
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,880
what is the

1325
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,480
software testing lifecycle?

1326
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,320
I know many of you guys are going to say
SDLC, right?

1327
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,920
SDLC is acronym

1328
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:02,880
for software testing lifecycle,
but what is software testing lifecycle?

1329
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,800
And then tell me the phases in order.

1330
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:06,880
Okay.

1331
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,360
So the phases in order.

1332
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,640
Good. Okay.

1333
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,160
So let's talk about the first phase,
right?

1334
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:18,440
We have what we have requirements
gathering, right?

1335
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,640
Sometimes they call it requirements
gathering analysis, write or analysis

1336
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:23,840
done.

1337
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,440
What is the second?

1338
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:32,400
What is the second phase?

1339
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,400
Requirements
gathering someone's set planning.

1340
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,760
Okay, what is the third phase?

1341
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,320
What is the third phase design?

1342
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:48,960
What is the fourth phase?

1343
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,120
What is the fourth phase?

1344
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,320
Development exactly?

1345
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,240
Development.

1346
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,760
You can say coding code, it's up to you.

1347
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,960
Same thing. Five.

1348
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,080
What is five?

1349
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:03,200
Testing and testing.

1350
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:11,000
And lastly, maintenance.

1351
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,320
Okay.

1352
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,240
So some say that deployment

1353
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:17,720
and production and I will talk to you
about what that is and maintenance.

1354
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,800
Okay. We'll talk about
all of this to work.

1355
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,320
Okay. So

1356
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,640
what happens in the requirements
gathering phase?

1357
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,920
What happens is

1358
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:35,280
be a that's a business analyst,
but what happens like a BA is involved.

1359
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,480
But what happens?

1360
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,040
They talk to client and gather
information.

1361
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,480
Yes, exactly.
They just gather information.

1362
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,720
This information is known as this data.

1363
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,240
It's known as requirements. Right.

1364
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,280
And they analyze these requirements.

1365
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,560
Does that make sense?

1366
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:52,920
Right.

1367
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,280
I'm pretty sure
you guys already talked about this.

1368
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,520
So once they gathered these requirements,
well, once they gather this data,

1369
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,600
now they have to plan.

1370
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:04,520
But what are they planning for?

1371
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,200
What are they planning

1372
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,120
time and cost?

1373
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,760
How long it will take budget.

1374
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,800
A lot of a lot of goes in the planning
phase, right.

1375
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,680
Like, hey,
do we have enough developers to do this?

1376
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,240
Do we have a team? Do we have testers?

1377
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,000
How long will we take?

1378
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,080
Do we have any limitations right?

1379
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,400
If you work for a project like URS,

1380
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,160
they may not allow you to just use
any technology.

1381
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,440
They're okay.

1382
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,000
Every Company has its own security.

1383
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,240
Security,

1384
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,480
you know, security protocols
that everyone has to follow

1385
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:50,640
who works like at a company right now
where you can't use like Facebook, right.

1386
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,560
Okay. Or you can. Exactly.

1387
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,040
So maybe there are some restrictions
there.

1388
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,520
Like maybe you need to access

1389
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,200
website and it's not there
and now you have to find a workaround.

1390
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,880
Okay. So a lot goes into the planning.

1391
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,280
Does that make sense, guys?

1392
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,040
It looks like you guys
got this notice down, so that's good.

1393
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,720
Okay, so then the next phase is design.

1394
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,080
What happens here

1395
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:15,360
you are.

1396
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,120
You asks how long it will look like
Blueprint.

1397
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:24,600
Exactly.

1398
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,640
Wireframe.

1399
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,200
Some people are saying what?

1400
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,160
You know, a wireframe is

1401
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,040
you guys are saying you are UX.

1402
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,040
What does that mean?

1403
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,040
Do you guys are you guys
just like writing out keywords

1404
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:43,240
or are you guys actually
answering a question?

1405
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,000
You guys are saying UI. You are, you are.

1406
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,320
What do you mean you are what?

1407
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,560
What what? What do you mean?

1408
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:53,280
So if I were to ask you in an interview,
what is the design phase?

1409
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:56,280
Are you guys going to say
UI user interface and then that's it.

1410
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,240
What is going to be your answer?

1411
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:04,240
Right.

1412
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:08,080
The design phase is where they design,
right?

1413
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,200
What is

1414
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,280
they design the requirements.

1415
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:16,800
They they start to
to design the web application itself.

1416
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:17,600
Okay.

1417
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,560
Did they start to design the application
right.

1418
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,760
They'll sit down and they'll be like,
okay, we know the requirements.

1419
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,440
Okay, okay.

1420
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,480
Let's say they want this log in function.

1421
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,840
They want this here. Okay?

1422
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,360
So they're going to start designing it
right?

1423
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,680
And designers, graphic designers,
sometimes

1424
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,800
they call them
UI UX designers or UI designers, right.

1425
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,480
They will start to design this.

1426
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,880
Are they doing development
at that point or.

1427
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,840
No, But

1428
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,200
no. Right.

1429
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:47,280
They're just designing. That's it.

1430
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:51,480
And that's a whole other role
that is important in this, Right?

1431
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,760
Graphic designers.

1432
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:57,520
Okay, now let's say they design it
and they're finished designing it.

1433
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,360
They said, Hey,
we've designed a whole page, okay,

1434
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,840
let's say Jimmie's a developer,
and they go to, Jimmy, They're like,

1435
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,280
Hey, Jimmy,
this is ready for you for development.

1436
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,840
Go ahead and develop this.

1437
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,320
So the Jimmy is going to look at it
and he's going to be like, okay,

1438
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,960
now this is what they want design.

1439
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,160
So then they start the coding, right?

1440
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:19,000
He starts development,
he starts running his code.

1441
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,800
But there can be some issues here.

1442
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,960
What can be some issues here?

1443
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:28,200
What can be some issues?

1444
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,200
Does anyone know?

1445
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,520
What can be some
issues for the developers?

1446
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:33,840
No, no.

1447
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,480
At that point, let's say they designed it
right and the client likes it.

1448
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,920
Let's say mom has the graphic designer.

1449
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:44,280
She says, Hey, look, this is essentially
like we got to the requirements.

1450
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:45,960
Is this you like this?

1451
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:48,600
And they're like,
Wow, you did a great job designing this.

1452
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,120
This is exactly what we want, right?

1453
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,840
So then it's ready for development
and Jimmy starts to code it.

1454
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:56,880
The developer starts to develop it.

1455
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,440
But what can be some issues?

1456
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:02,240
There?

1457
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,840
Yes, for hot. That's a good point. Right?

1458
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,760
What if Jimmy is like,
okay, I'll start developing it.

1459
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:09,480
Right.

1460
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:12,440
But then Jimmy's
experiencing some problems

1461
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,960
and he starts to realize
that he cannot exactly develop

1462
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:22,080
what was designed right
Then they have to go back to the client

1463
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:26,080
and they're going to have to say, Hey,
we kind of made a change here because

1464
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,520
we couldn't really we

1465
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,800
couldn't really develop this due to this
and this reason.

1466
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,800
Right. Okay.

1467
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,240
But then the client says, Mom,
we were so excited that we really wanted

1468
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:40,280
this.

1469
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,440
You know, it kind of sucks
that now we can get this right.

1470
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:48,480
And now the client is starting
to get a little unhappy right?

1471
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,880
The reason could be a lot of reasons,
right?

1472
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,320
It could be that
maybe there's like security

1473
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:57,440
security issue with that, right?

1474
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,280
Maybe that it's not going to be approved.

1475
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,640
Maybe there's going to be like
a security flaw or something like that, or

1476
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,880
it could be anything read point
is that something happened

1477
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,800
or it just couldn't be developed
as it was exactly designed.

1478
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,000
Right. And this happens all the time.

1479
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,400
Does that does that make sense, guys?

1480
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,920
It happens all the time.

1481
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,920
Right? Okay.

1482
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,360
So then let's say Jimmy starts
developing it, right?

1483
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,600
He starts developing
whatever he has to develop.

1484
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:31,200
Then what happens here?

1485
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,520
This is

1486
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,480
who will get approved for the design,
The team.

1487
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,240
We'll talk more about that.

1488
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:42,480
What is your question, Aisha?

1489
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,240
What is your question?

1490
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,720
You write SDLC software
Developer lifecycle.

1491
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,360
Oh, my bad.

1492
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,480
This is software development lifecycle.

1493
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,920
Good call.

1494
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,360
But the good stuff. Good stuff.

1495
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:02,080
I said I did that to make sure
you're paying attention. So.

1496
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:05,880
So the testing phase, right?

1497
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,520
Someone said we test for bugs.

1498
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,920
Yeah, you test for.

1499
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,600
But what are you confused about?

1500
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,640
Do we have to asses?

1501
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:14,400
Is that

1502
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,040
okay? It's

1503
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,680
one of those

1504
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:26,280
we're talking about the software
development lifecycle right now.

1505
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,360
We're going to talk about SDLC shortly.

1506
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,360
We'll talk about that.

1507
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,960
We'll get there.

1508
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:32,520
We'll get there.

1509
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:32,880
Okay.

1510
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,400
Let's just finish discussing this first,

1511
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,440
because then this is where
I'm going to transition to SDLC.

1512
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,480
So the testing phase comes in, right?

1513
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,200
Okay.

1514
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,400
And someone said we test for bugs.

1515
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,600
You test to see if there are any bugs,

1516
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,560
but you also test for what?

1517
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,240
What do you test for

1518
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,120
it? Test requirements.

1519
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,040
Okay.

1520
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,560
The test functionality before you test

1521
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,120
that,
whatever was developed works as expected.

1522
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,480
Right? Right.

1523
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,600
Guys, that's where you test for that.

1524
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:14,640
Okay.

1525
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:17,240
And that's where you guys
will be doing your testing.

1526
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:17,840
Okay.

1527
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,000
And then once you guys say, all right,
testing is good, our testing pass,

1528
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,080
okay, it's good.

1529
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,920
Then it gets deployed to production
what does that mean?

1530
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,400
What does production mean?

1531
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,720
What do we mean by production?

1532
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:34,560
It goes live.

1533
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:40,160
What that mean?

1534
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:44,480
What does what does that mean?

1535
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,960
Someone said it's put to users.

1536
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,080
Where does it push to

1537
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,640
ready to be used.

1538
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,240
Okay, available on website. Okay.

1539
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,480
We will talk about more on how that works.

1540
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:58,000
Okay.

1541
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,360
This is also another topic.

1542
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,160
We have to we have to talk about.

1543
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,840
Trust me, all these questions,

1544
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:06,720
all these thoughts you have,
we will cover absolutely everything.

1545
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,840
Let's take a step back. Okay.

1546
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:12,480
And the testing phase, this is as the LC.

1547
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,000
Okay. Does that make sense?

1548
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,120
We just talked about the software
development lifecycle.

1549
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:18,680
Okay.

1550
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,160
This is just make sense, guys.

1551
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,080
Right. Okay.

1552
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,840
But then there is something else
that's called

1553
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,680
the software testing lifecycle.

1554
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,480
And the software testing lifecycle

1555
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,840
happens in the testing phase. Good

1556
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,960
software or

1557
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,520
lasting lifecycle, Okay.

1558
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,960
As TLC, as TLC

1559
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:51,480
happens in the testing phase,

1560
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,640
the SDLC, does that make sense?

1561
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,800
Does that make sense so far? Okay.

1562
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,120
So let's talk about what SDLC is.

1563
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:05,960
So we already know that the code
has been developed, the application

1564
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,840
has been developed, and now it's good
and now you got it tested.

1565
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,240
So what does that mean?

1566
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,680
So you look at my screen.

1567
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,280
Okay, SDLC is another cycle.

1568
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,520
Okay,
So process is a sequence of activities

1569
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,440
to be performed to perform testing.

1570
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:23,320
Okay.

1571
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:27,960
So as a tester,
what you're going to do is first

1572
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:30,720
is as a tester, you're going to

1573
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,040
first
see what the developer is working on.

1574
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:39,640
And you have to also understand
the requirement

1575
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:43,680
that is being that that is, you know,
that's being developed.

1576
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,400
Okay. You have to understand it.

1577
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:50,880
If it doesn't make sense
to you, if you have questions

1578
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,240
and you start testing.

1579
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,520
But you're unsure and you assume

1580
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,800
that you've figured it out and stuff
and you start testing,

1581
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,120
is that correct?

1582
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,560
Is that incorrect?

1583
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,960
Never assume 100%. Exactly.

1584
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,160
You never assume. Right.

1585
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,040
So let's say

1586
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:18,280
you are reading the requirements
and something doesn't make sense to you.

1587
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,080
Okay.

1588
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:25,880
There's some information missing.

1589
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:30,320
What do you do?

1590
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:33,080
What do you do? Yes. Someone Yes.

1591
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:37,200
To answer your question, yes,
you ask to get more information.

1592
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,680
Okay. And a development project.

1593
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,120
Who would you ask for first

1594
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,680
word, notes

1595
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,280
seems seamlessly

1596
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,120
good.

1597
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,280
If you have questions

1598
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:04,280
regarding a requirement
that you need to test,

1599
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,880
you need to test

1600
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:12,040
the ask first.

1601
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:15,760
Some people say Scrum Master Product
Owner two way lead.

1602
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,360
No, no, that's right.

1603
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,600
No idea that I pronounce your name
correctly.

1604
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,280
The thing is that
yes, you ask a VA, you ask

1605
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:31,280
a business analyst. Go.

1606
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,560
Why? Why do you ask a VA?

1607
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,120
Why do you

1608
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,960
why do you ask a VA?

1609
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:47,360
Okay. Why?

1610
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:52,320
Because they are the ones that are going
to be gathering the requirements

1611
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,160
and they're going to be

1612
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:57,160
the ones that are going to have
the most interaction with the client

1613
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,280
in most projects.

1614
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,320
Does that make sense? Right.

1615
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,120
So let's say someone let's say
she's the business analyst,

1616
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:07,720
okay.

1617
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:12,120
And in the series, a tester
and he has questions and

1618
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,080
he's going to go to the man and say,
excuse me,

1619
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,840
I don't understand this requirement.

1620
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,240
Could you clarify this a little more?

1621
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,280
Right.

1622
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,880
And tomorrow will read it
and she'll probably say, you know what?

1623
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,040
You're right.

1624
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,600
Let me make some changes
because it needs to be more clear.

1625
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,560
Right.

1626
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,680
But what if Seer didn't ask questions?

1627
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:34,680
What if he assumed
and then he did his testing

1628
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,760
and then he says, all right,

1629
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:42,920
it's good to go.

1630
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:43,080
What?

1631
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:48,440
The thing happens, what you think happens.

1632
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,040
That's the problem, right? So mistake.

1633
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,640
Let's say they find a bug later, right?

1634
01:30:55,240 --> 01:31:03,920
They're going to go to first when there's
a bug, they're going to go to Messier.

1635
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,280
They're going to say this.

1636
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,240
You say you tested this and it passed.

1637
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,600
But it's not working.

1638
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,280
Right.

1639
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:15,960
So they're going to go down to the Q8
first.

1640
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,880
Does this make sense? Does
do you understand why?

1641
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,680
Important for you to fully understand
the requirements

1642
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,440
right.

1643
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,840
But does it make sense?

1644
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:29,760
Right.

1645
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,600
It's very, very important.

1646
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,680
Okay, so let's say
you get to the requirements, right?

1647
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,520
Let's say you understand requirement.

1648
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,560
Okay, good.

1649
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,920
Then you have to do your test planning.

1650
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:40,640
Okay.

1651
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:44,200
And by test planning,
we meet, we mean like

1652
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,680
planning for your test, right?

1653
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:53,880
You start to say, okay, so I have to test
this log in functionality.

1654
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,240
Let's say the requirement
has to do with something. Log in.

1655
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:59,280
So you're like, okay, I got to test this.

1656
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,360
I have to it.

1657
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:04,880
This is probably going to take me like,

1658
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,880
like maybe a couple hours to test, right?

1659
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,080
So you start to plan for that, right?

1660
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,200
And then there is test case development
that we will talk about.

1661
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:16,240
And then there's environments
set up, test execution.

1662
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:18,760
You run your test
and there's this test cycle closure.

1663
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,200
I'm going to tell you
exactly everything about these phases.

1664
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:25,680
But you all you need to understand for now
is that this is a cycle

1665
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,040
that happens inside.

1666
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,200
What phase of SDLC?

1667
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,840
What phase

1668
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,080
testing.

1669
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:34,880
Right,

1670
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:37,200
Exactly,

1671
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,200
Exactly. Very, very good.

1672
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,520
Okay.

1673
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,080
You guys are doing very good.

1674
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,200
So it's 824.

1675
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:56,760
Let's come back at 835.

1676
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:02,760
Let's come back at eight. 840.

1677
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,880
So cool. 840.

1678
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:06,520
Yeah, go ahead.

1679
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,880
Take it to take 15 minutes. Yeah.

1680
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,800
And I'll be here
if you have any questions.

1681
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,600
But, you know, you should just go
enjoy a break right now.

1682
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:24,080
You guys are doing great,
so keep up the good work.

1683
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:24,360
Cool.

1684
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:29,160
And feel free to ask any questions
if you need to.

1685
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,080
What about Python?

1686
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:41,240
What's your question?

1687
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:44,000
ARIN is going to make some tea.

1688
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,560
Make some for all of us.

1689
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:49,920
Please.

1690
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:51,960
Persian food time present.

1691
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,720
What do we use for automated testing?

1692
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:59,840
You will learn that with time
you will learn that.

1693
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:01,000
What do you mean? It's good to have

1694
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,480
anything, you know.

1695
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:21,200
It's always going to be an advantage.

1696
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:25,240
So automation, right, is a process, right?

1697
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:27,840
That just helps us do.

1698
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,080
We're already doing
better to for us to be more efficient.

1699
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,000
Okay.

1700
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:39,040
Automation is where any manual process,
you know, has been automated

1701
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:42,360
so that there is no human intervention,

1702
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,480
no manual intervention

1703
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:51,000
for extra knowledge
as of the language of 2021, you know,

1704
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:54,240
every programing language is popular,
you know,

1705
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:57,960
So if you know how, that's good.

1706
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:00,840
I'm doing cloud after this bootcamp.

1707
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,840
What do you mean
you're doing cloud after this bootcamp?

1708
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:03,720
Jimmy

1709
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:09,320
Yeah, this is during automation.

1710
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,320
Doesn't rule. Nope.
We're going to work with you.

1711
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,760
I'll tell you exactly what it is.

1712
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,920
Java is popular.

1713
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:24,760
Think it's course Java is popular.

1714
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:25,360
It's the

1715
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,960
but we're going to do some practical
of course

1716
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:50,880
we're going to do a lot of work.

1717
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,720
A lot of work.

1718
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,960
JIRA is a tool to see

1719
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,080
if complete your sprints, get

1720
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,440
patience, Sheriff.

1721
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,480
Patience, grasshopper. Patience.

1722
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,320
Trust me.

1723
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,040
Later in the course,
you're going to start drawing gray hair.

1724
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,920
You will see

1725
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:14,360
changing.

1726
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:21,520
So anyone else happy about Sheeba?

1727
01:36:21,520 --> 01:48:23,680
Don't be surprised.

1728
01:48:23,680 --> 01:49:04,400
Can you guys hear me?

1729
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:08,880
PRC says Question In SDLC,
the planning is the first phase

1730
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:12,800
in here.

1731
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,680
They do a feasibility study,

1732
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:23,240
then only requirements.

1733
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,640
We can look more into that. PRC.

1734
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:30,040
To clarify your question further

1735
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,320
so we can be sure,

1736
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,840
of course.

1737
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:37,600
So what's up, guys?

1738
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,360
Are you guys back?

1739
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:40,680
Did you guys make your tea?

1740
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,720
Chai like green tea

1741
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:46,760
with no sugar
cardamom in there, Some saffron.

1742
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,680
If you're feeling extra good, you tonight.

1743
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:49,920
Bam. Right.

1744
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:51,920
Did you guys, did

1745
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,120

1746
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:55,720
Some coffee.

1747
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:58,360
What kind of coffee did you have for hot

1748
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,040
coffee?

1749
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:04,120
That, that anyone.

1750
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:07,320
Hey, 15 minutes isn't enough time, right?

1751
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:09,800
But you guys are all here to.

1752
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:13,200
I'm assuming you guys are all here
to improve your lives.

1753
01:50:13,200 --> 01:50:15,200
Right? And

1754
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:18,280
no cell phones.

1755
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:20,000
Too expensive. Oh, sorry.

1756
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:27,560
Maybe after you finish syntax,
you can take that kind of tea.

1757
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:30,520
It'll happen in low. Will happen,
you'll see.

1758
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:33,880
But let me tell you this, guys.

1759
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:37,560
I know that you're making these sacrifices
and stuff, and

1760
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:40,680
maybe some of you guys are like,

1761
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:43,920
Oh, this is a get rich quick
scheme, right?

1762
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:47,280
But once you start to realize how hard
this stuff is, you're going to be like,

1763
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:52,080
Holy moly, this is like you're going to
work hard for this stuff that

1764
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,560
you're going to work for this stuff.

1765
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:59,040
So, you know, again,
stay on top of your assignments.

1766
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:03,000
Don't miss any classes,
you know, stay on top of things, guys.

1767
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,080
Stay on top of things.

1768
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:05,440
Okay.

1769
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,800
It's very, very easy to lose track

1770
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:10,400
if at any moment
you're struggling with something,

1771
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,960
if at any moment
you're struggling something,

1772
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,840
if you don't think you can do it,
if you don't think that, you know,

1773
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:19,640
if you start to think like, oh,
this Java stuff is hard or whatever.

1774
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:22,960
Reach out to us. Reach out to me.

1775
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:27,080

but you can't let your self fell.

1776
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:29,840
You know, this doesn't make sense, guys.
You can't.

1777
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:30,840
There's no way.

1778
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:32,200
Time is money.

1779
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,680
It's only six months of your life.

1780
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:37,520
You know, if things will get hard,
that's okay.

1781
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,720
It'll get hard. No one said
this was going to be easy, right?

1782
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,000
No one said, Hey, it comes just easy.

1783
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,800
You're like, Then get a job. Now

1784
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,840
you're looking
to to really get a career at this point.

1785
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:49,120
Then you have to work hard for it.

1786
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:52,320
Then you're going to
you're going to be very proud of yourself

1787
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:55,960
once you start to realize that,
like you're doing very good.

1788
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:00,720
But there's only one secret
to this formula, and that's

1789
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,480
basically dedication your hard work

1790
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:07,160
and to never don't don't quit.

1791
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,560
Even if it gets hard,

1792
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:13,520

I'll show you guys how to do it.

1795
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:17,280
An easy way

1796
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:21,520
to get rich, Quick scheme.

1797
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:22,480
It definitely isn't.

1798
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:25,680
Michael I wanted to say that comment
halfway through the course

1799
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:27,960
I'm going to say, So what?

1800
01:52:27,960 --> 01:52:33,520
So really, you're not laughing now right?

1801
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:36,320
I'll just tell you
how to easily retain information

1802
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:38,200
and so forth.

1803
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:41,520
Okay,
you guys, there have been Uber drivers

1804
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:45,240
that have never worked in technology
or anything like that

1805
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:49,320
that have changed their lives completely
and now they're successful

1806
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:53,760
construction workers, you name it, dude,
it's in Texas, all type of students.

1807
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:56,360
We have a lot of students with degrees.

1808
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:57,720
Did you guys know that?

1809
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:00,640
George Mason, students, UVA, JMU, v Tech,

1810
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,920
You know the people we have with degrees
that are here for a few reasons.

1811
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:07,920
Most of them it's
because they can't find a job

1812
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:13,320
or it's because they're in a job,
or maybe they're stuck in a job

1813
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:16,680
and they can make more money and
then they realize how important money is.

1814
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:18,440
Okay.

1815
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:22,920
So we have students we have students here
that are probably working

1816
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,440
at different professions

1817
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:29,920
and they're just looking to change,
change, change their career, Right?

1818
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,560
Maybe that's something I think
we'll get to know, to know each other

1819
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:35,960
in a little bit. What's my story?

1820
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,040
My story is

1821
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,640
not that interesting,
but I'll tell you in another class.

1822
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:43,720
Okay, It's not that interesting.

1823
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:44,120
All right.

1824
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:47,520
So let's let's yeah, it's tough.

1825
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,800
So, Marvin, right?
You work in that field, right?

1826
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,040
This is your way out of it.

1827
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:54,200
All you have to do is work
six months, and then, bam, that's it.

1828
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:56,280
Okay, That this is.

1829
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,000
This is your ticket out.

1830
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,440
And one thing is that if you're here,
you're completely blessed, right?

1831
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:05,480
You're completely blessed
because there are a lot of people that

1832
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:10,200
that can that that probably won't ever
have this opportunity.

1833
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:12,920
There are a lot of people that, you know,

1834
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:16,440
that just an opportunity like this is big,
big time guys.

1835
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:21,800
The average salary for someone
coming out of this course is like 90,000.

1836
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:23,600
Okay.

1837
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:27,120
Do you know what people have to do
industries

1838
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:29,840
to make that much

1839
01:54:31,560 --> 01:54:35,640
like they have to work on a company
for like ten, 15 years.

1840
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:39,720
They have to like you guys know that
wherever you guys work,

1841
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:43,920
you guys probably already know
how hard it is to to get to that level.

1842
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:48,000
Okay,

1843
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,040
How many hours
do you have to work in a week?

1844
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:54,120
It's most of the time is like 40 hours,

1845
01:54:54,120 --> 01:54:56,360
but sometimes a little bit more time.

1846
01:54:56,360 --> 01:55:00,320
You're there.

1847
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:01,040
You'll see.

1848
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:04,760
We'll talk more about that later.

1849
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:09,720
Yes, you can be a freelance
or you can be whatever you want.

1850
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:11,880
All right. So anyway, back to this.

1851
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:16,080
So again, SDLC is a cycle

1852
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:19,080
that is a part of what

1853
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:21,360
what is it a part of

1854
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:26,320
testing?

1855
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,640
What do you mean testing?
That is part of SDLC.

1856
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:33,040
What phase of SDLC is
a part of the testing phase?

1857
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,120
That's right.

1858
01:55:34,120 --> 01:55:36,960
Okay. Very, very, very good.

1859
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:39,400
Okay, let's take a step.

1860
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:42,600
And before we go into the slides, I'm
going to add some

1861
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:47,800
some paint to or some color to the topics
we've been talking about.

1862
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:51,120
Okay, This is for you.

1863
01:55:51,120 --> 01:55:53,640
This is important for you to know.

1864
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:58,960
And by the way, we all learn different.

1865
01:55:59,240 --> 01:56:02,400
But I always tell you guys
to write your own notes down.

1866
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:03,280
Okay.

1867
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:06,720
Now I will share my notes with, you guys.

1868
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:09,800
But I write high level notes sometimes,

1869
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:13,160
and I'm not so detailed because I expected
to pay attention during class.

1870
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:14,480
Okay.

1871
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:18,240
But at the same time,
I found that to be better for you

1872
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:21,480
to take your almost on as well
because it helps

1873
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:24,200
you retain and learn the information
better.

1874
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:27,320
Okay. Does that make sense?

1875
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:29,880
Maybe you have realized that as well.

1876
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,920
Even though I'm going to give the notes.

1877
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:32,520
Okay.

1878
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:36,000
Write down your own notes
because as you write down, it's

1879
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,520
kind of like you're
repeating it to yourself.

1880
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:41,840
Okay, So so keep keep that in mind.

1881
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:47,640
So we've we've been single word
requirements.

1882
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:51,040
What been saying like the whole class
write business requirements.

1883
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,680
We've been saying business requirements.

1884
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:58,200
We've and there can be any type
of, of business requirements can now

1885
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:02,720
business requirements are can be like
hey I would like

1886
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:05,520
we want a page to

1887
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:12,800
we want our login page to have
a login functionality somewhere, right?

1888
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:16,320
I'm just giving you very, very easy

1889
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:19,200
are a business requirement

1890
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:22,120
that users should be able to log in
with valid credentials.

1891
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:22,680
Right?

1892
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:27,720
Or users should not be able to log in
with invalid credentials.

1893
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:28,440
Right.

1894
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:30,800
That can be a requirement as well.

1895
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:32,640
Okay.

1896
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:35,760
But business requirements
are usually analyzed

1897
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,600
and actually they are analyzed
into what is called

1898
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,360
an acceptance criteria.

1899
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:43,240
Okay.

1900
01:57:43,240 --> 01:57:45,600
And acceptance criteria. Okay.

1901
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:47,200
And I'm going

1902
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:50,280
to give you an example of an acceptance
acceptance criteria.

1903
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:53,040
And acceptance
criteria is basically a summarized

1904
01:57:54,680 --> 01:57:56,920
and it's summarized in a way

1905
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:59,440
to basically describe

1906
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:02,240
what the user should do.

1907
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,600
Okay. Bingo.

1908
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:08,320
So as a user,

1909
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:12,600
as an Amazon user,

1910
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:16,920
I should be able to go to Amazon

1911
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:20,640
dot com and

1912
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,920
Amazon.com and navigate

1913
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,480
navigate to navigate to prime video.

1914
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:32,560
Okay.

1915
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:35,640
And navigate to Amazon Prime video. Cool.

1916
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:36,440
You guys know what?

1917
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:39,720
Prime video's right and if not,
then you will know what it is right now.

1918
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:43,960
Okay, so this a business requirement,
maybe the business requirement

1919
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:45,600
was written like this.

1920
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:49,200
We want users to be able to

1921
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,320
access

1922
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,200
access Amazon

1923
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:58,560
prime video from Amazon dot com.

1924
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,040
Right.

1925
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:02,560
Maybe this is a business requirement
so the business analyst

1926
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,760
will gather this requirement
and we'll turn this

1927
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,600
into an acceptance criteria, stating it
as the way that a user should use it.

1928
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:14,840
So as an Amazon user, I should be able
to go to Amazon.com and navigate to

1929
01:59:15,880 --> 01:59:17,080
to Amazon Prime video.

1930
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:17,520
Okay.

1931
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,800
Now I want you to have someone say
user stories.

1932
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:22,280
Now User stories.

1933
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,400
What are user stories?

1934
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:25,320
User stories?

1935
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:32,320
What are users?

1936
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:36,440
What do you do stories?

1937
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:39,720
Do you guys know to someone set task
requirements?

1938
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:41,640
Yes, the requirements.

1939
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:43,960
Okay, User stories.

1940
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:47,200
A user story
do you have you guys learn about agile

1941
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:50,640
ceremonies and artifacts?

1942
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:52,440
Yeah. Okay.

1943
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:56,360
Just to let you know, an Agile and Agile

1944
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,400
A and Agile ceremony

1945
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:03,840
ceremony is just

1946
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,680
it's just a fancy word

1947
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:12,720
for what?

1948
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:13,920
For meetings.

1949
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,520
Very, very good for meetings. That's it.

1950
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:20,320
An agile ceremony is just a fancy word
for a meeting.

1951
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:21,000
Okay.

1952
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:22,400
For me.

1953
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,960
Does that make sense. Okay.

1954
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:29,760
And an agile right.

1955
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,400
And artifacts.

1956
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:33,960
An artifact.

1957
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:36,360
An artifact.

1958
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:39,040
I was going to say artifact.

1959
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:43,320
Artifact is just the fancy word.

1960
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,360
For what?

1961
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:49,000
For yes.

1962
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,800
Of tool documents. That's right.

1963
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:53,040
Okay.

1964
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,120
A backlog is a document

1965
02:00:56,120 --> 02:00:59,760
that, you know, a backlog is a document.

1966
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:01,360
And you know what else is a document?

1967
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:08,400
You know what else is an artifact? Yes.

1968
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:11,840
Now, a sprint is not artifact,

1969
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:15,240
but you know what else is a artifact?

1970
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,680
Yes. A burned down chart is an artifact.

1971
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:19,920
Very good, because it can be a document

1972
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:23,880
that starts good.

1973
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:26,960
A user story is also a document.

1974
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,320
Okay?

1975
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:31,200
A user story is a document.

1976
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,520
So what's going to happen?

1977
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:34,160
Listen to this. Okay?

1978
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:36,000
There's the business requirements.

1979
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,200
The VA gathered it and
and created an acceptance criteria.

1980
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:41,280
Okay?

1981
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:46,160
This acceptance criteria be inside
the user story.

1982
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:48,280
Does that make sense?

1983
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:52,280
So when you are testing a user story,
that means that you are testing

1984
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:53,760
the acceptance criteria,

1985
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:55,920
which means that you are testing
the business requirements.

1986
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:02,280
Does that make sense?

1987
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:09,240
Do you want me to repeat that?

1988
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:09,560
Okay,

1989
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:11,280
who's got this?

1990
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,320
Noted that.

1991
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:15,520
So let's take a few steps back
a user story

1992
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:16,440
is what

1993
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:21,840
a user story is, what an artifact.

1994
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:27,480
And we said that an artifact
is a document, right?

1995
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:28,160
Right.

1996
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,960
Let's let's just get in the habit
of seeing an artifact because

1997
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,560
that's how you refer
to it, an agile environment.

1998
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:39,200
So a user story is an artifact
that contains

1999
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:41,880
what is a document that contains what

2000
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:47,240
an acceptance criteria exactly Right.

2001
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:50,320
And acceptance criteria is. What

2002
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,160
an acceptance criteria?

2003
02:02:56,160 --> 02:02:58,360
No acceptance
criteria is not a user story.

2004
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:03,280
Acceptance criterias are written inside
user stories, right?

2005
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:07,520
An acceptance criteria is a summary
of a business requirements.

2006
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,320
Yes. Very, very good.

2007
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:13,640
Okay, so you are testing user stories.

2008
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:14,880
Okay.

2009
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:19,120
When you're testing a user story,
that means that you are testing

2010
02:03:19,120 --> 02:03:24,320
an acceptance criteria, which is the same
thing as the business requirement.

2011
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:27,360
So when you're testing a user story, okay,

2012
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:30,720
that means you are testing
an acceptance criteria.

2013
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,800
That is a business requirement.

2014
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:34,040
Does that make sense?

2015
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:37,400
This is why we say user
stories are requirements,

2016
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:40,640
right?

2017
02:03:40,640 --> 02:03:45,760
Is that clear?

2018
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:48,280
My goodness, is that clear?

2019
02:03:48,280 --> 02:03:49,240
It makes sense, right?

2020
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:52,560
So what I'm going to do is go, we're going

2021
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:55,480
say this, okay,
We're going to create a user story.

2022
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:58,280
Okay? We're going to say user story,

2023
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:01,680
user story.

2024
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,840
We're going to say
give it a user story idea.

2025
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:06,560
So one, two, three, four,
five, user story.

2026
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:07,720
One, two, three, four, five.

2027
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:08,160
Okay.

2028
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:10,880
This is I'm going to say right here,
this is an artifact.

2029
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:11,440
Okay?

2030
02:04:11,440 --> 02:04:12,160
An artifact is.

2031
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,360
What?

2032
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:14,520
Guys, what is an artifact

2033
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:17,320
document?

2034
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:20,280
Right. Very good. That

2035
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:22,480
and this user story.

2036
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:24,000
One, two, three, four, five.

2037
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,160
Has this acceptance criteria.

2038
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:29,200
Okay, I'm going to delete this
and I'm going to paste it here.

2039
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:30,120
Okay.

2040
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:32,280
Has this acceptance criteria.

2041
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:35,000
Okay, Right here.

2042
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,680
Okay, So the acceptance criteria here.

2043
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:40,400
So here's the thing.

2044
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:44,560
When this user story is developed,
literally, this is the user story.

2045
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:48,120
So the first person to work on this user
story, who's going to be the first person

2046
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:51,440
to work on to do the story?

2047
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:55,040
What's going to be the first person
to know the being created,

2048
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,360
the being created, The user story?

2049
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,240
Who would be the first?

2050
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:00,120
Yes, the developer. Right.

2051
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:02,040
They're going to get this user story

2052
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:05,280
right and then they're going to read it
and they're going to develop this right.

2053
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:07,640
They're going to develop this.

2054
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:11,160
Does that make sense?

2055
02:05:11,160 --> 02:05:13,160
No, no,
they're just going to develop it. Okay.

2056
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:14,920
They're going to

2057
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:19,400
develop a cool.

2058
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:20,840
So that makes sense. Okay.

2059
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:23,760
Once this developed,
then who's the next person

2060
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,160
that will work on this?

2061
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:30,840
The tester, Man, you guys are so smart.

2062
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:32,160
So smart.

2063
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:33,560
The best batch ever.

2064
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:36,160
Like, not a Tesla, just the tester.

2065
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:39,800
Okay, that makes sense.

2066
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:40,080
That.

2067
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:41,520
That makes sense.

2068
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:43,440
Cool.

2069
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:46,560
All right, cool.

2070
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:48,920
So now notice

2071
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:51,360
that this is the acceptance criteria,
right?

2072
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:57,480
Does it say something like as a tester
or does it say something like

2073
02:05:57,680 --> 02:06:00,680
the tester has to do this
or anything like that?

2074
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:05,520
Does it does it say anything like that?

2075
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:08,160
No, it doesn't. Right.

2076
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:09,920
Because

2077
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,040
very good.

2078
02:06:13,080 --> 02:06:14,600
Very good. So it doesn't.

2079
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:19,240
So basically everyone will work
on the same user stories.

2080
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:22,520
Okay, cool.

2081
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,040
Does that make sense to everyone?

2082
02:06:25,080 --> 02:06:26,840
I'm going to quiz you a little bit.

2083
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:27,800
All right.

2084
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,200
Okay.

2085
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:31,560
This is the acceptance criteria, guys.

2086
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:32,920
Go and test it.

2087
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:35,880
I want you to go and test this acceptance
criteria.

2088
02:06:36,400 --> 02:06:37,200
Go ahead.

2089
02:06:37,560 --> 02:06:41,160
Tell me what you come up with.

2090
02:06:41,160 --> 02:06:44,160
Yeah, I'm gonna give you, like, 2 minutes.

2091
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:50,880
Go ahead
and test this acceptance criteria.

2092
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,560
Someone said pass.

2093
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:53,080
Okay.

2094
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,920
Yeah. Manually.
You can't automated. Right.

2095
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:56,960
So how are you going to.

2096
02:06:56,960 --> 02:06:59,040
So obviously you can only do it manually.

2097
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,560
Go ahead and test this.

2098
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,040
I want to see
if you guys have learned anything

2099
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:08,840
someone said manually.

2100
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:12,240
I will need to have an Amazon account
to access Prime Video's

2101
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:17,400
some people they passed.

2102
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:23,640
Some people say it worked
like a sharp charm.

2103
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:27,200
Pennock Dude, Hannah
is that how you say your name? And

2104
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:31,160
and write your hand up?

2105
02:07:31,160 --> 02:07:36,120
Look round of applause
And that is 100% correct.

2106
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:41,560
What is wrong with this acceptance?

2107
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:43,440
Yes, Jimmy. That's right.

2108
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:51,720
What is wrong with this acceptance
criteria? Yes.

2109
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:54,520
You need more information, right?

2110
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:57,480
So, okay, as an Amazon user,

2111
02:07:57,480 --> 02:08:01,960
I should be able to go to Amazon.com
and navigate to Amazon Prime video.

2112
02:08:01,960 --> 02:08:03,560
I saw a lot of different answers there.

2113
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:07,800
I saw some people say pass and stuff, but
the acceptance criteria doesn't say how.

2114
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:08,680
Right.

2115
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:10,440
So let's go right now.

2116
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:12,480
Let's go Amazon.com.

2117
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:14,280
Okay. Okay.

2118
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:16,760
And that says you go to Amazon.com

2119
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:20,040
and it says that you should navigate
to prime video, right?

2120
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,920
That's what it says. Right.

2121
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:27,360
But how you don't know how right.

2122
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:28,320
You don't know how.

2123
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:32,240
So now you need you have a question.

2124
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:34,120
And what do we do when we have a question

2125
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:38,720
on of an unclear user story?

2126
02:08:39,200 --> 02:08:41,440
We asked the VA, right?

2127
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:45,760
We ask the VA and we're going to go, hey,
so this says that Amazon

2128
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:49,520
should be able to go to Amazon.com
and navigate to Amazon Prime video.

2129
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:54,160
But how exactly like how like I'm on
Amazon.com, how am I supposed to go there?

2130
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:56,680
There are so many ways to get there.

2131
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:00,480
Someone said that they have to create
an account to access Prime Video's.

2132
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:02,040
You actually don't.

2133
02:09:02,040 --> 02:09:04,080
You can go to Prime here.

2134
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:08,400
You can actually click on all
okay By the way, this right here

2135
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:13,200
you see this little button
with three stripes.

2136
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:15,320
When you click on it,
we see a menu, right?

2137
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:18,640
You guys see that?

2138
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:20,400
Okay, what do we call this?

2139
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:21,640
What we call this button? You know.

2140
02:09:22,680 --> 02:09:23,400
That's right.

2141
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:26,000
A hamburger menu. Okay.
That's what we call it.

2142
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:28,720
So we're going
to click on this hamburger menu

2143
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:30,840
and then we can navigate to prime video.

2144
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:33,920
Okay. From here, right. We can do that.

2145
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:37,640
We can also go here and type
in prime video.

2146
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:40,920
So How should we do this? Right?

2147
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:42,880
And you have to ask them.

2148
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:45,480
You have to ask to be
you have to get more clarification.

2149
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:49,840
So let's rewrite this acceptance criteria
so that it makes it make sense.

2150
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:53,720
As an Amazon user,
I should be able to go to Amazon.com

2151
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:56,760
and navigate to Amazon Prime video

2152
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:02,000
by clicking on the hamburger

2153
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:05,960
Hamburger menu.

2154
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:10,720
Navigating, Navigating to what it was.

2155
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:11,720
What was it?

2156
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:12,680
Hamburger menu.

2157
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:15,560
Navigating to to prime video.

2158
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:18,800
Okay. Navigating to

2159
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:23,600
navigate to prime video.

2160
02:10:24,840 --> 02:10:28,200
And what is the last of those?

2161
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:31,360
And clicking on prime video. Right.

2162
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:33,720
And clicking on prime video.
Let's just write this down.

2163
02:10:34,240 --> 02:10:41,320
So and clicking and clicking on Prime
Prime video.

2164
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:44,280
Okay. Now, does this make more sense?

2165
02:10:44,680 --> 02:10:48,440
Is it more clear?

2166
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:50,040
Yes. Right.

2167
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:52,720
Yes. For whoever asked
that question, should it?

2168
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:54,800
Yes, it should say hello.

2169
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:56,960
Yes. Okay.

2170
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,040
Is that more clear? Right.

2171
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:01,440
There are more details, right.
It makes sense now.

2172
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:03,480
You know what to do right now.

2173
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:05,760
You know exactly what to do.

2174
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:06,960
Okay.

2175
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:12,320
Before you guys said pass as the good,
someone said pass like a charm, right?

2176
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:15,040
Bam! Out the window.

2177
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:15,440
Right.

2178
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,960
That's how you got.

2179
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:20,840
So you get, you know,

2180
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:22,680
limited fired, Don.

2181
02:11:22,680 --> 02:11:23,280
Right.

2182
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:27,600
Also, a lot of you guys that said passed.

2183
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:31,520
You know what you guys did there?

2184
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:33,360
You know what you guys did there?

2185
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:34,920
You guys assumed.

2186
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:37,200
Right.

2187
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:41,880
And what do we say about assuming

2188
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:46,160
what do we say about assuming?

2189
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:48,400
Right. Never assume.

2190
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:52,960
And by the way, this goes for everything,
literally every situation that you're

2191
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:57,880
in, that you're making assumptions,
never assume like never.

2192
02:11:57,880 --> 02:11:58,440
Right.

2193
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:01,320
Especially when your job relies on it.

2194
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:03,360
Does this make sense?

2195
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:04,680
Right.

2196
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:10,440
Does this make sense for everyone? Yes.

2197
02:12:10,600 --> 02:12:12,040
Yes. MUHAMMAD

2198
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:14,040
Yes. And we'll talk more about this. Okay.

2199
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:15,200
So are we clear?

2200
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:19,400
Do we have do we have a good understanding
of everything, though?

2201
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:20,400
Right.

2202
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:22,440
Of course.

2203
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:24,760
It pays to be picky, is not really called
picky.

2204
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:28,560
It's called being observant
and detail oriented.

2205
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,360
Okay.

2206
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:32,160
That's what that's what

2207
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:33,920
that's what we're talking about.

2208
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:36,360
Okay, cool.

2209
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:39,480
Does that make sense?

2210
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:40,200
Okay.

2211
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:45,720
The problem here was familiarity
with the website.

2212
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:50,760
So the point is,
you should know what you have to do.

2213
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:51,720
Okay,

2214
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:56,880
cool.

2215
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,960
Okay. And in the workplace.

2216
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:03,800
In the workplace, when you go to
the business analyst and you ask questions

2217
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:07,800
and you ask them to clarify it
and they said, oh, and let's say let's say

2218
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:10,800
the ticket was like vague,
like the way we had it first,

2219
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:12,800
let's say on the business analysts.

2220
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:15,920
Alona a lot of sorry

2221
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:18,240
and I say this is
how you're supposed to do it, right?

2222
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:19,800
And Alon is like, okay.

2223
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:22,280
And she goes back and she tested right.

2224
02:13:22,280 --> 02:13:24,760
What is wrong with that scenario?

2225
02:13:24,760 --> 02:13:26,720
Like I told Ilana how to test it.

2226
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:30,480
I told her how it has to be done
and she knows and now she has to go

2227
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:30,920
and test it.

2228
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:34,760
But what is wrong with that?

2229
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:43,440
What is wrong with that situation?

2230
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:46,000
Yes, For testers, for SDLC.

2231
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,400
For yes.

2232
02:13:48,400 --> 02:13:49,160
Someone say no.

2233
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:51,560
I said So
let's say I'm the business analyst, right?

2234
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:55,800
Let's say that the that the acceptance
criteria that we had was not detailed.

2235
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:56,480
Okay.

2236
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:59,800
Alannah comes to me,
I tell her how to do it, okay?

2237
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:02,080
And she goes, and she does it well.

2238
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:04,240
What was what is wrong with that though?

2239
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:05,200
What is wrong with that?

2240
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:07,280
I already clarified it for her.

2241
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:08,960
What is wrong.

2242
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:11,160
Yes, you'll get a yes.

2243
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:13,200
Very, very, very good.

2244
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:14,800
You get it. You are on fire.

2245
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:16,440
You know what we call people like you.

2246
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:20,800
You get it in the industry, you know,
we call you does what we call your here.

2247
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:22,640
Call you.

2248
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:25,560
We call you.

2249
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:28,680
We call you a bag of money.

2250
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:30,240
That's exactly what you are.

2251
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:32,640
You'll get right a bag of money.

2252
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:35,360
Okay. Stay that way.

2253
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:36,280
Be that way.

2254
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:36,960
Okay.

2255
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:39,360
So she said it's not documented, right?

2256
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:41,880
So as a business analyst, right.

2257
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:45,360
If if Alana comes to me
and I clarify it for her,

2258
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:48,280
Alana, the right thing to do is say, okay,

2259
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:52,080
so can you please update the ticket?

2260
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:54,560
So it reflects that, right?

2261
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:59,520
You have to politely asked you say,
Hey, can you please update the ticket

2262
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:02,000
so that it reflects that, right?

2263
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,760
So that if anything wrong happens, Right.

2264
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:07,320
So anything wrong happens.

2265
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:10,360
You can say I went off of what
the user story said.

2266
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:14,000
I went over
what the acceptance criteria said right.

2267
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,960
Does that make sense?

2268
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:19,920
No. Guys, verbal word of mouth guys

2269
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:25,200
means absolutely nothing in the workplace
okay, word of mouth.

2270
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:30,680
If you're if it's something serious, guys,
you know, ask for an email, right?

2271
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:32,560
Ask for something to be documented.

2272
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:35,480
Guys Word of mouth will like
it will hurt you.

2273
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:36,760
Okay.

2274
02:15:36,760 --> 02:15:39,720
Your workplace can be like it could be

2275
02:15:39,720 --> 02:15:43,120
it could turn out to be toxic
if you don't have any documents.

2276
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:43,640
Action. Right.

2277
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:46,000
Documentation is a very safe way to go.

2278
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,320
Read emails, documents, user stories.

2279
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:53,400
You know, as for those,
make sure that you are covered as well,

2280
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:57,960
because believe it or not,
even though you have to work as a team

2281
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:01,200
when something happens
and there's a there's a bug

2282
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:04,040
that is found,
they're going to come to you first, right?

2283
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:07,920
They're going to come to you first.

2284
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:13,720
Do you think that your team
is going to stand up for you?

2285
02:16:13,720 --> 02:16:15,600
Do you think that they're
going to stand up for you?

2286
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:19,200
Like, are you really going to rely
on your team

2287
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:23,320
to be there for you and say, oh, no, no,
Mustafa Like he checked them with those.

2288
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:26,160
Like it's also our fault. Like,

2289
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:30,760
Oh man, your workplace will easily
turn to Game of Thrones,

2290
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:34,560
easily, easily, right?

2291
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:38,400
So you can be so naive.

2292
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:39,480
Very good.

2293
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:40,720
Okay.

2294
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:43,480
How exactly does that make sense, though?

2295
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:46,680
Why? It needs to be documented.

2296
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:47,440
Right?

2297
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:48,280
Okay.

2298
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:51,120
Do we have any questions on that

2299
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:55,080
or have any questions that. No.

2300
02:16:55,880 --> 02:16:59,760
Okay.

2301
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:00,240
Very good.

2302
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:05,320
Is this making sense?

2303
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:07,080
All right. Next slide.

2304
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:09,960
Requirement analysis of

2305
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:14,600
basically this is the first thing you do
when testing.

2306
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:21,920
So let's say
that you guys start about sprints.

2307
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:22,680
Okay?

2308
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:25,800
Let's say you have two weeks
sprints, right?

2309
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:27,920
And the sprint
starts, let's say, on Monday.

2310
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:29,600
Okay.

2311
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:32,480
Do you think that
testing will be ready for you on Monday?

2312
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:33,760
You think that it's the product

2313
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,800
that the feature
is going to be developed by Monday?

2314
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:38,520
It's not right. It's not.

2315
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:40,800
But does that mean that you just sit
and do nothing

2316
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:44,840
while the developer develops that? No.

2317
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:50,400
When the sprint starts right,
you have to read the user story.

2318
02:17:50,400 --> 02:17:52,440
Okay. You have to understand it.

2319
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:53,480
Okay.

2320
02:17:53,480 --> 02:17:53,880
You have to

2321
02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:57,120
make sure that everything makes sense
and you start to plan your testing.

2322
02:17:57,840 --> 02:17:58,560
Okay?

2323
02:17:58,560 --> 02:18:02,160
This is what we mean
by requirement and analysis,

2324
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:05,440
does that make sense to everyone? Yes.

2325
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:08,120
You would create test cases,

2326
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:10,240
which we will create.

2327
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:12,440
Okay. So

2328
02:18:13,480 --> 02:18:15,440
so that that that's
what you will have to do.

2329
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:18,840
Now, there's this criteria that's called
the smart criteria that you can follow.

2330
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:20,120
You don't need to know this.

2331
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:23,400
You don't need to memorize
It is there for your reference and

2332
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:27,120
and just make sure.

2333
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:30,920
So there are some times right,
some requirements

2334
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:35,280
that are so for example,
following this smart criteria.

2335
02:18:35,360 --> 02:18:37,080
Okay, they have to be specific.

2336
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,400
The acceptance criteria
needs to make sense, right?

2337
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,840
It needs to be detailed.

2338
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:42,640
You need to know what to do.

2339
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:43,640
It needs to be measurable.

2340
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:45,880
By measurable,
we can mean a lot of things like

2341
02:18:46,680 --> 02:18:49,960
how how long is it going to test?

2342
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:52,080
How long is it going to take
for us to test this?

2343
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:57,120
Okay, when we say attainable,
like can we reach these goals?

2344
02:18:57,240 --> 02:18:59,760
Can we finish this testing on time?

2345
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:00,560
Right.

2346
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:03,600
Is it relevant to anything else
that's been developed?

2347
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:04,920
Is it something completely else?

2348
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:05,760
So, for example,

2349
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:10,080
let's say you have five user stories
that are all related to the homepage,

2350
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:13,640
but then you have another user story
that's related to something else.

2351
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:16,160
Okay, You have to measure that as well.

2352
02:19:16,160 --> 02:19:18,960
And time based goes
time, time, time, time.

2353
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:23,480
Will you have enough time
to finish testing that or not.

2354
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:23,800
Okay,

2355
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:31,200
if and this is very, very important,
if you know that

2356
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:34,480
you're not going to have enough time
to finish testing something

2357
02:19:37,440 --> 02:19:38,680
like what should you do?

2358
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:40,680
Should you wait
to the last day of the sprint

2359
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:42,840
to tell your team
that you don't have enough time?

2360
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:46,960
What should you tell your team
that you probably won't

2361
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:54,680
have enough time to test one?

2362
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:57,600
Someone said ASAP
as soon as you realized, right?

2363
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:01,600
As soon as as soon as you can,
the sooner the better.

2364
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:05,600
How would it make you look if you wait
till the last day of the sprint

2365
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,680
or even the second
to the last day of the sprint?

2366
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:10,840
How would it make you look if, let's say

2367
02:20:11,960 --> 02:20:14,640
Sebastian's testing
and then all of a sudden two days

2368
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:17,720
left in the sprint he tells us
that he doesn't have enough time,

2369
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:22,080
you know, and then we're like,
did the sprint ends in two days?

2370
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:25,240
You know, like, did you
you should have known about this.

2371
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:26,280
You should have said something.

2372
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:28,080
Okay.

2373
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:30,640
So you kind of have to, you know,

2374
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:33,800
be be aware of that.

2375
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:35,160
Does that make sense?

2376
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:35,880
Cool.

2377
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:37,680
All right.

2378
02:20:38,880 --> 02:20:43,200
So test
documentation, proper documentation.

2379
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:45,120
So we're going to talk
about documentation.

2380
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:48,000
We're going to write test cases
and so forth and that kind of thing.

2381
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,760
Test planning.

2382
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:52,920
We'll also talk to you
about what is a test plan

2383
02:20:52,920 --> 02:20:57,320
and stuff like that.

2384
02:20:57,320 --> 02:20:57,880
Okay.

2385
02:20:57,880 --> 02:21:02,000
So test plan content.

2386
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:04,400
What the test

2387
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:08,640
a test plan is a document.

2388
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:09,320
Okay.

2389
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:11,240
That's

2390
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:15,680
I'm going to answer this.

2391
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:17,960
I'm going to go over this later
with you guys, okay?

2392
02:21:17,960 --> 02:21:21,480
Because I think it will
I think it will paint a clear picture

2393
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:24,840
for you
after we start creating test cases.

2394
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:25,840
Okay.

2395
02:21:25,880 --> 02:21:28,160
So let's revisit that. Okay.

2396
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:29,440
Test plans. Okay.

2397
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:30,600
And test plan content.

2398
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:32,640
We need to revisit. Okay.

2399
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:37,040
But first, let's talk about test
case development and what is a test case?

2400
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:39,600
Okay.

2401
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:42,400
As a tester,
you will also be developing test cases.

2402
02:21:42,440 --> 02:21:42,920
Okay.

2403
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:46,640
A test case is also another artifact.

2404
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:50,280
What is an artifact?

2405
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:51,200
What is an artifact

2406
02:21:52,520 --> 02:21:53,040
document?

2407
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:55,320
Right.

2408
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:58,160
That has a set of actions.

2409
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:58,920
Okay.

2410
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:03,200
A set of actions or steps
that need to be executed to verify

2411
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:04,920
a future of functionality.

2412
02:22:04,920 --> 02:22:07,200
The software application. Okay.

2413
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:09,600
Why do you need a test case?

2414
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:11,400
Test case makes the whole quick process

2415
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:13,320
more efficient,
and we'll talk more about that.

2416
02:22:13,320 --> 02:22:13,920
Okay.

2417
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:17,120
And and

2418
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:20,320
and because you guys are awesome,

2419
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:23,520
we are going to start
creating our own test cases today.

2420
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:24,080
All right.

2421
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:26,600
So you guys ready or are you guys ready?

2422
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:28,920
Okay,

2423
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,560
you guys, you signed up for this course.

2424
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:32,600
Are you ready?

2425
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:34,320
Irina Arenas laughing.

2426
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:35,920
She's ready.

2427
02:22:36,680 --> 02:22:38,760
Means like, let's do it right.

2428
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,920
Who's ready? Are you guys?

2429
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:42,480
I need you guys to be active, okay?

2430
02:22:42,480 --> 02:22:45,120
It's time to be active. That's okay.

2431
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:46,200
That's it.

2432
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:46,680
We're ready.

2433
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:49,760
Okay,
so we are going to create a test case.

2434
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:53,600
We're going to create a document
which has a set of actions

2435
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:55,400
supposedly to be executed event.

2436
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:55,920
Are you ready?

2437
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:56,760
Everyone follow me.

2438
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:58,920
So I'm going to be using Excel.

2439
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:01,680
If you don't have Excel,

2440
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:05,480
use Google.

2441
02:23:05,480 --> 02:23:07,600
Use Google sheets.

2442
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:09,880
I think it's called Google sheets. Okay.

2443
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:13,560
So whatever is going to help you
than just use it.

2444
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:18,360
Cool. Go.

2445
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:20,760
So we're going to do this.

2446
02:23:21,240 --> 02:23:23,440
I have the Excel document
right here. Okay.

2447
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:25,840
Because it can everyone see my screen?

2448
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:28,200
Everyone should be able to see my screen.

2449
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,440
Okay. All right.

2450
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:32,040
So go ahead.

2451
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:36,880
Open up your Excel, get your sheets
and give me a thumbs up when you're ready.

2452
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:40,000
When when you are ready.

2453
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,720
When you're ready to go.

2454
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:44,560
Okay.

2455
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:51,920
Are you ready?

2456
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:53,560
All right, cool, cool, cool.

2457
02:23:53,560 --> 02:23:54,160
All right.

2458
02:23:54,160 --> 02:23:59,440
So in this slide and we're going to go
based what this has a test case

2459
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:03,560
contains the following A test case B
or test scores.

2460
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:06,240
Name, precondition, steps,
Number of steps.

2461
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:08,400
E tell respect the result.
Action, results, comments.

2462
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:12,360
We're going to cover all of that
and we're going to create our own.

2463
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:14,560
Before we create this,

2464
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:16,160
I want

2465
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:19,160
you guys to see two examples of test
cases.

2466
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:19,880
Okay.

2467
02:24:20,120 --> 02:24:21,680
So a test case I.D.

2468
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:24,600
or a test case, name a precondition.

2469
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:28,320
We're going to learn about what
a precondition steps, number of steps,

2470
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:31,960
details, expected results, actual results
and comments.

2471
02:24:32,440 --> 02:24:34,880
This is a first example of a test case.

2472
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:38,880
Okay, Notice that there is the scenario
in the test case.

2473
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:40,400
I b we'll talk more about those.

2474
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:42,000
The test case.

2475
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,160
The test case description.

2476
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:46,480
Okay. The test steps.

2477
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:49,360
The test step description
expected results,

2478
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:52,120
actual results, status,

2479
02:24:53,480 --> 02:24:54,880
stars, column and comments.

2480
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:58,480
Okay,

2481
02:24:58,480 --> 02:25:01,440
here we have a test case example.

2482
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:03,880
Here's another test case. The example
you see same thing.

2483
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:04,640
There's a test case.

2484
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:07,760
I did this one has a created by
this one has a reviewed by.

2485
02:25:08,360 --> 02:25:11,600
We are going to create our own test cases
that look similar to this.

2486
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:14,840
Okay. So let's go back to this slide.

2487
02:25:14,840 --> 02:25:15,320
Okay.

2488
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:19,080
And let's create our own test cases.

2489
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:20,280
All right.

2490
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:22,880
So first, open your sheets and

2491
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:27,000
let's start

2492
02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:29,400
by saying test.

2493
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:34,480
Okay, test case by B,
what is the test case idea

2494
02:25:34,520 --> 02:25:37,040
and how do we create it
and how do we come up with it

2495
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:39,080
and that kind of thing.

2496
02:25:39,080 --> 02:25:44,560
So listen, the test IDs, this changes
from project to project, okay?

2497
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:49,840
Usually in projects,
what they do is this okay, so

2498
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:53,120
say test case idea.

2499
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:55,280
Okay, when they do this, this.

2500
02:25:56,040 --> 02:25:59,160
Okay, so

2501
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:02,440
the user story ID is one,
two, three, four, five.

2502
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:05,280
Right? You guys see that, right?

2503
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:08,120
And in most projects
what they do is they create

2504
02:26:08,120 --> 02:26:11,680
the test case
idea based the user story idea.

2505
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:16,080
So what they will do is this it will say
they will grab the user story idea,

2506
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:17,760
which is one, two, three, four, five.

2507
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:19,480
Okay.

2508
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:22,240
And then they'll probably do something
like underscore,

2509
02:26:23,560 --> 02:26:26,800
test case, underscore one.

2510
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:28,960
Okay.

2511
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:31,480
Does this make sense, guys?

2512
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:32,120
Okay.

2513
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:39,160
Does this make sense?

2514
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:39,880
Okay.

2515
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:42,760
Does anyone need clarification on this?

2516
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:46,720
And by the way,
this varies from project to project.

2517
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:48,200
It could be different.

2518
02:26:48,200 --> 02:26:51,800
But in most projects,
what they do is they create the test case

2519
02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:55,040
idea based off the user story idea.

2520
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:59,520
Okay, so we got the user story
ID, we're saying test case one

2521
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:02,800
because we can create
many test cases based off this user story.

2522
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:05,720
Okay, So we're to create this test case.

2523
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:08,760
Go ahead and just do what I'm doing. Okay.

2524
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:11,600
And we're going to base it here.

2525
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:12,240
Cool.

2526
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:14,160
Okay.

2527
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:18,360
Band test, case ID,
And what we can do is actually

2528
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:22,840
let me post this when we copy this,
paste it in another.

2529
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:24,680
So like this one.

2530
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:26,840
Okay.

2531
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:32,480
And I'm going to get this
and I'll make it import.

2532
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:33,360
Good.

2533
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:35,160
So that's readable.

2534
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:36,880
Just makes sense.

2535
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:39,680
Can you guys see
this test case ID is here?

2536
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,960
Okay, so go ahead and do this.

2537
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:44,720
Okay.

2538
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:47,200
So we created the test ID, Okay.

2539
02:27:47,640 --> 02:27:48,880
How do we create the test case?

2540
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:49,200
I think.

2541
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:52,760
Can you guys tell me, how do we create it

2542
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:55,320
in this in this case,
how do we create the test case?

2543
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:55,960
I'd be

2544
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:02,200
what would you like me to repeat

2545
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:04,360
based on the user story?

2546
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:06,320
ID Exactly.

2547
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:08,320
That's how we create it.

2548
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:10,560
What would you like me to repeat?

2549
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:11,520
I don't

2550
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:14,760
by Yes.

2551
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:16,360
Are you yelling? Catalina, Is that.

2552
02:28:16,360 --> 02:28:18,720
Is that. Are we yelling out?

2553
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:22,040
Okay, so

2554
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,080
yes, we we created this based on the user
story ID.

2555
02:28:25,560 --> 02:28:28,440
Okay, so it's user story.

2556
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:29,840
One, two, three, four, five.

2557
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:31,800
And this is the test case one, right?

2558
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:33,000
Okay, perfect.

2559
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:37,200
So now let's go back here
and it says we need a precondition.

2560
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:39,480
We need a steps number.
Okay, let's do this.

2561
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:43,440
We need a precondition
let's open up our let's create the rest.

2562
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:44,240
Okay.

2563
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:47,400
Let's say pre condition.

2564
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:50,640
Okay, precondition.

2565
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:52,200
Let's

2566
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:58,280
all going to click this to make rules.

2567
02:28:58,320 --> 02:29:00,800
So we have precondition, right?

2568
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:04,160
And we also have

2569
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:07,120
a test case description.

2570
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:07,800
Right.

2571
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:09,800
Test. Case

2572
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:12,040
description.

2573
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:14,160
Okay.

2574
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:16,200
We have a test case description.

2575
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:17,880
Just go ahead and just do what I'm doing.

2576
02:29:17,880 --> 02:29:19,920
Guys, we're going to cover up everything.

2577
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:23,120
Okay? Test case description.

2578
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:26,000
We had steps. Numbers.

2579
02:29:26,440 --> 02:29:29,440
Okay, let's see before that.

2580
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:30,240
Okay.

2581
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:32,160
The covered the precondition.

2582
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:34,680
Now need the steps,
numbers, the step details.

2583
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:37,480
Okay, perfect.
So let's start with the steps number.

2584
02:29:37,480 --> 02:29:40,680
So now this document that we're creating,

2585
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:44,200
let's go say and say

2586
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:46,200
step.

2587
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:53,400
So step number, step number.

2588
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:56,760
Let's make this bold.

2589
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:58,880
Okay.

2590
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:01,840
And what was it? Here we have the steps.

2591
02:30:02,400 --> 02:30:04,680
Detailed description.

2592
02:30:04,680 --> 02:30:05,680
Okay. Steps.

2593
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:10,840
Detail description.

2594
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:16,320
Are you guys doing this?

2595
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:19,920
Are you guys doing this or what?

2596
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:20,200
Yeah.

2597
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:22,640
Okay.

2598
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:27,320
And then what else do we need?

2599
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:31,000
We have an expected results

2600
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:34,320
and then

2601
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:39,120
we have an expected result

2602
02:30:40,480 --> 02:30:42,600
at the results.

2603
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:44,040
Okay.

2604
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:47,480
Expected result.

2605
02:30:47,480 --> 02:30:50,760
We have an actual

2606
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:54,000
results.

2607
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:54,480
Result.

2608
02:30:54,480 --> 02:30:57,440
And keep in mind, this is very simple task
is that we're creating

2609
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:00,720
good show result

2610
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:05,320
and let's include our comments.

2611
02:31:06,640 --> 02:31:07,000
Okay.

2612
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,480
And something that we forgot here is

2613
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,160
yes or no.

2614
02:31:13,160 --> 02:31:13,640
Okay.

2615
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:16,200
So we need our comments.

2616
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:20,320
Okay.

2617
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:22,320
Our comments

2618
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:26,560
that go ahead and based.

2619
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:28,320
So everything is good.

2620
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:31,560
And actually let's let's change

2621
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:34,400
this comments to a pass

2622
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:37,720
is not done.

2623
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:42,440
And then most changes to comments

2624
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:49,400
and okay, are we here yet?

2625
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:54,600
Are we there?

2626
02:31:54,600 --> 02:32:01,040
And what I'm going to do actually
does I'm going to change this.

2627
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:02,560
I'm going to stop this short these.

2628
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:05,200
Okay.

2629
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:07,320
And the test case description.

2630
02:32:07,320 --> 02:32:09,080
So I'm going to change this to

2631
02:32:11,560 --> 02:32:14,560
test test, case description,

2632
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:18,200
copy, description. It's

2633
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:26,000
okay.

2634
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:26,520
All right.

2635
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:37,600
So are we good or are we good?

2636
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:39,680
Are we good or are we good?

2637
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,240
All right.

2638
02:32:40,240 --> 02:32:43,080
Give me I'm going to give you guys
another 30 seconds all the minute

2639
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:47,520
and give me thumbs up once
you guys are done.

2640
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:47,880
Okay?

2641
02:32:47,880 --> 02:32:49,680
August says

2642
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:51,800
that she's ready.

2643
02:32:51,800 --> 02:32:53,920
It's Alanna says,

2644
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:58,240
let's do it.

2645
02:32:58,240 --> 02:33:00,880
Jimmy says Good.

2646
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:01,720
That's right.

2647
02:33:02,920 --> 02:33:04,480
All right, Ready?

2648
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:07,960
So, test case description.

2649
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:12,200
So we make this use test case
based off a user story, Right?

2650
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:15,240
And this user story,
what is the user story

2651
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:18,400
right here?

2652
02:33:18,400 --> 02:33:21,080
The user story
has this acceptance criteria.

2653
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:25,720
As an Amazon user,
I should be able to go to Amazon.com

2654
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:29,400
and navigate to Amazon Prime video
by clicking on the hamburger menu

2655
02:33:29,800 --> 02:33:33,120
and navigating to prime video
and clicking on prime video.

2656
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:38,800
Okay, So we're going to right here, okay,

2657
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:41,400
We're going to write

2658
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,680
a test case description

2659
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:46,960
where we have to write a description
to this test.

2660
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:50,320
Go Like,
what is it that we're going to test?

2661
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:51,240
I'm making it like this.

2662
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:54,000
You guys can see that right here. Right?

2663
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:56,360
So I'm looking at the acceptance criteria

2664
02:33:57,360 --> 02:33:58,520
as you see here.

2665
02:33:58,520 --> 02:34:00,760
All right.
You guys can see the acceptance criteria.

2666
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:01,720
There it is.

2667
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:06,760
So we're going to say this test

2668
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:10,360
verifies that a user

2669
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:13,960
is able to navigate

2670
02:34:15,160 --> 02:34:18,960
to navigate to prime video

2671
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:25,560
by clicking

2672
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:28,480
on that.

2673
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:34,240
What's it called on on hamburger menu?

2674
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:38,880
Must be more descriptive
of this on Amazon's home page.

2675
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:41,160
Hamburger Menu.

2676
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:42,880
Hamburger Menu.

2677
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:45,920
And navigating that navigating

2678
02:34:49,080 --> 02:34:50,920
through their menu.

2679
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:52,200
Okay.

2680
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:54,400
We're going to leave this description
like this.

2681
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:55,240
Cool.

2682
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:57,840
What I'm also going to do

2683
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:00,960
is I'm going to say Rabbit and Marsh, this

2684
02:35:02,120 --> 02:35:02,960
here,

2685
02:35:03,640 --> 02:35:06,200
I'm going to expand this.

2686
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:07,080
Okay.

2687
02:35:07,880 --> 02:35:11,040
So and center

2688
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:13,120
of text as we want.

2689
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:15,360
Good. Cool. Does this make sense?

2690
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:20,160
You guys see this?

2691
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:20,880
Okay.

2692
02:35:22,040 --> 02:35:23,160
Are we good?

2693
02:35:24,440 --> 02:35:25,400
There you go.

2694
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:26,520
Looks nice.

2695
02:35:26,520 --> 02:35:30,080
Okay,
so I gave this test, this description.

2696
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:30,960
Okay.

2697
02:35:30,960 --> 02:35:32,440
We're just going to describe

2698
02:35:32,440 --> 02:35:35,160
just a high level
overview of this test case Description.

2699
02:35:35,160 --> 02:35:36,840
It doesn't need to be super detailed.

2700
02:35:36,840 --> 02:35:39,840
Okay, cool

2701
02:35:39,840 --> 02:35:43,280
Are we good?

2702
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:45,280
Are you guys ready or you guys ready?

2703
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:47,160
Go ahead and take the time.
Copy this down.

2704
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:48,320
That's fine.

2705
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:53,440
Come and give me a thumbs

2706
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:58,360
up, guys, When you guys are done,

2707
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:07,640
give me thumbs up.

2708
02:36:07,640 --> 02:36:08,400
Awesome.

2709
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:10,960
Okay, cool. Now

2710
02:36:12,320 --> 02:36:13,560
we need to write the steps.

2711
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:17,400
Okay, so for use for user story.

2712
02:36:17,400 --> 02:36:18,800
One, two, three, four, five.

2713
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:22,720
We know the acceptance criteria.

2714
02:36:22,720 --> 02:36:23,160
Okay?

2715
02:36:23,160 --> 02:36:24,720
We know the acceptance criteria.

2716
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:26,440
We know what we need to test.

2717
02:36:26,440 --> 02:36:29,400
Okay, So now a precondition.

2718
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:32,400
What is a precondition?

2719
02:36:32,400 --> 02:36:37,080
What is a precondition?

2720
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:46,800
Does anyone know what a precondition is?

2721
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:53,360
A precondition is anything that needs
to happen knows that's not diabetes.

2722
02:36:54,800 --> 02:36:56,880
It's a precondition is

2723
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:00,360
what needs to happen

2724
02:37:00,360 --> 02:37:04,520
or needs to be available
before you execute this test.

2725
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,520
Okay, So

2726
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:12,640
so it can be something like

2727
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:15,120
like user is on the

2728
02:37:15,360 --> 02:37:19,200
on the on the Amazon home page or.

2729
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:24,680
It can be something
like user has access to either Chrome

2730
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:27,240
Safari or respective browser,

2731
02:37:28,200 --> 02:37:30,840
or it can be
something that needs to happen before.

2732
02:37:30,920 --> 02:37:31,760
Okay,

2733
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:34,160
of the test case that makes sense.

2734
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:36,800
Everyone, something is happened.

2735
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:41,520
In this case, we can read the precondition
afterwards so it'll make more sense.

2736
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:44,400
But let's start off
by writing the test case for this.

2737
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:45,400
Okay?

2738
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:48,480
So and this is where I need you guys to,

2739
02:37:48,480 --> 02:37:51,680
to know you will
you can actually set the precondition.

2740
02:37:51,960 --> 02:37:52,720
Okay.

2741
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:55,240
So and I'll show you right how to do it.

2742
02:37:55,240 --> 02:37:55,520
Okay.

2743
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:57,720
So let's let's start off
by writing this test case.

2744
02:37:58,280 --> 02:38:00,480
Okay? Step number one.

2745
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:03,600
Okay. What is that number?

2746
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:05,440
Number one.

2747
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:09,800
Step number one is okay, a user

2748
02:38:11,200 --> 02:38:13,120
navigates

2749
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:16,680
navigates to WDW dot

2750
02:38:16,920 --> 02:38:19,920
Amazon, Amazon.com.

2751
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:24,280
Okay, that is that is the first step.

2752
02:38:24,280 --> 02:38:27,600
So go ahead and write this

2753
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:29,080
right.

2754
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:31,560
This step is to

2755
02:38:37,160 --> 02:38:38,400
okay, step

2756
02:38:38,400 --> 02:38:45,640
number one,

2757
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:47,680
give me thumbs up when you guys are are

2758
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:51,880
alignment says we're ready.

2759
02:38:51,880 --> 02:38:57,120
Who else is ready?

2760
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:57,600
Very good.

2761
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:00,120
We have a few members that are ready

2762
02:39:00,120 --> 02:39:02,600
who is not doing any of this.

2763
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:08,720
I just want to know
who's not doing of this?

2764
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:11,800
I want this is anyone not not doing

2765
02:39:11,800 --> 02:39:17,840
any of this.

2766
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:18,680
Okay,

2767
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:20,720
Very good.

2768
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:22,360
Doing it. Good, good, good.

2769
02:39:22,360 --> 02:39:24,280
Okay, now listen.

2770
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:27,920
This a step, okay?

2771
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:30,520
I've got a step.

2772
02:39:30,720 --> 02:39:34,760
And the test case is an action.

2773
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:37,600
Okay?

2774
02:39:37,600 --> 02:39:39,360
That is what a step is.

2775
02:39:39,360 --> 02:39:44,040
What is an action
is an action is something that

2776
02:39:45,240 --> 02:39:45,960
an action is.

2777
02:39:45,960 --> 02:39:46,640
An action.

2778
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:48,760
Okay, What is an action?

2779
02:39:48,760 --> 02:39:50,920
Something that the user will actually do?

2780
02:39:52,760 --> 02:39:53,880
Something that.

2781
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:56,440
How did you fit
all those writings in one cell?

2782
02:39:56,440 --> 02:40:00,240
What do you mean in one? So

2783
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:03,800
if you're writing all this text
in one cell, Farhad,

2784
02:40:04,360 --> 02:40:06,440
you actually had the right here

2785
02:40:06,880 --> 02:40:10,040
to wrap the text, Okay?

2786
02:40:10,120 --> 02:40:13,280
And when you click on that,
it just wraps it like this.

2787
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:16,560
Got cool.

2788
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:22,280

is not
okay guys I see this mistake all the time.

2797
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:53,640
It is not an action.

2798
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:58,400
Okay expected result

2799
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:01,920

2800
02:41:02,360 --> 02:41:06,240
once the action has been made okay

2801
02:41:07,480 --> 02:41:11,080
Aisha amazing bag of money.

2802
02:41:11,080 --> 02:41:13,240
I said I feel

2803
02:41:13,240 --> 02:41:15,000
like you're already in the field.

2804
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,520
Are you already in the field?

2805
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:19,920
Come.

2806
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:20,560
Not yet.

2807
02:41:20,560 --> 02:41:24,200
Okay,
so Aisha says Amazon homepage displays

2808
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:27,280
when the user navigates to Amazon.com.

2809
02:41:27,440 --> 02:41:30,600
Yes, that is the expected result Amazon

2810
02:41:31,640 --> 02:41:34,320
on page displays.

2811
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:35,560
Okay.

2812
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:39,440
And for Hot,
we can wrap this text right for her.

2813
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:40,800
We can wrap it.

2814
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:43,320
Okay.

2815
02:41:43,320 --> 02:41:46,000
So we can see like this. Right.

2816
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,400
So okay, Amazon homepage displays.

2817
02:41:49,440 --> 02:41:50,600
That's the expected result.

2818
02:41:50,600 --> 02:41:52,600
That is what has happen.

2819
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:55,240
Okay. This is what is expected.

2820
02:41:55,640 --> 02:41:57,720
Okay. Now let's do it ourselves.

2821
02:41:58,680 --> 02:42:02,480
Let's go and pretend,
you know that, we're doing this again.

2822
02:42:02,840 --> 02:42:06,360
We're going on
Amazon.com home page, this place.

2823
02:42:06,360 --> 02:42:07,040
Right.

2824
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:09,880
So we're running this test.

2825
02:42:09,880 --> 02:42:10,680
Okay.

2826
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,440
And does it display? Yes.

2827
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:16,040
So now check this out. Go check this up

2828
02:42:17,920 --> 02:42:20,160
whenever you are writing this.

2829
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:22,840
Okay.

2830
02:42:22,840 --> 02:42:26,160
And the actual result is the same as you
expect.

2831
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:28,800
The result, okay.

2832
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:31,480
You can say as expected, right.

2833
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:33,720
It depends on your project. Right.

2834
02:42:33,720 --> 02:42:36,400
But in some projects,
what you do is you copy,

2835
02:42:37,800 --> 02:42:41,400
you copy the action,
you expect the result and paste it

2836
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:45,720
in the actual result.

2837
02:42:45,720 --> 02:42:47,280
Moscow

2838
02:42:48,040 --> 02:42:51,200
Cool state.

2839
02:42:52,680 --> 02:42:55,040
All right.

2840
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:55,600
Okay.

2841
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:59,880
Now they did pass yes or no
the this the that this pass

2842
02:43:00,720 --> 02:43:02,760
that the Amazon home page display.

2843
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:07,920
Yes right it did so we're going to say yes
All right.

2844
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:09,000
Cool.

2845
02:43:09,960 --> 02:43:12,400
Step number two,

2846
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:15,360
Step two, what is step two?

2847
02:43:16,320 --> 02:43:18,080
What would step to be, guys?

2848
02:43:18,080 --> 02:43:24,040
What would step to be?

2849
02:43:24,040 --> 02:43:29,160
What would step to be?

2850
02:43:29,160 --> 02:43:33,480
Okay, Very good.

2851
02:43:33,480 --> 02:43:36,120
Allen.
That is a very good descriptive stuff.

2852
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:39,840
Yes. So user clicks on hamburger menu,

2853
02:43:39,920 --> 02:43:43,640
read Hamburger menu on left corner.

2854
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:44,360
Okay,

2855
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:48,320
Top left corner.

2856
02:43:48,320 --> 02:43:50,800
Cool. We can just read this text.

2857
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:52,000
Okay.

2858
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:54,840
That is the step, the expected result.

2859
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:55,360
What is it?

2860
02:43:55,360 --> 02:43:59,720
Expect the result when they click on it.

2861
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:02,360
Hamburger menu. This place. Right.

2862
02:44:02,360 --> 02:44:06,200
Hamburger menu displays.

2863
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:08,280
Hamburger menu.

2864
02:44:08,680 --> 02:44:10,080
This place right.

2865
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:12,360
Okay. That's he expect the results.

2866
02:44:12,360 --> 02:44:15,240
Read the text. Okay. Now

2867
02:44:15,240 --> 02:44:18,560
obviously you will know
the expected results

2868
02:44:18,600 --> 02:44:22,160
before you do before you execute
task is okay.

2869
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:24,720
But what we're doing is I'm showing
you we're starting this from scratch.

2870
02:44:24,720 --> 02:44:26,520
Okay?

2871
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:29,080
If the first step did not happen,
what are we right?

2872
02:44:29,600 --> 02:44:30,960
Then you felt it.

2873
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:32,640
You felt a step.

2874
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:34,160
See? Was this pass? Yes or no?

2875
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:37,480
You would feel it. Okay, cool.

2876
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:39,480
All right, So.

2877
02:44:39,960 --> 02:44:44,280
All right,
so what happened when you click on it?

2878
02:44:44,280 --> 02:44:48,240
What happened?

2879
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:53,240
Okay, the hamburger menu displays right?

2880
02:44:53,240 --> 02:44:54,240
And actually

2881
02:44:56,760 --> 02:44:57,840
second

2882
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:00,600
actual result.

2883
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:02,760
Okay. Right. So.
So what are we going to do?

2884
02:45:02,760 --> 02:45:08,080
You can read as expected or you can copy
and paste is go see what paste is here.

2885
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:10,400
Like this
and you will read the text. Okay.

2886
02:45:10,760 --> 02:45:13,240
That it passed. Yes. Right.

2887
02:45:13,240 --> 02:45:14,640
Okay, perfect.

2888
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:16,680
All right.

2889
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:18,560
Step three.

2890
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:19,200
All right.

2891
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:22,120
Do we need to be descriptive
what happened instead?

2892
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:25,600
So I'll tell you this

2893
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:31,320
if and that's a good question.

2894
02:45:31,680 --> 02:45:34,200
If if something else happened.

2895
02:45:34,200 --> 02:45:36,800
Right.
If I clicked. On the hamburger menu.

2896
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:37,120
Right.

2897
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:39,160
And the hamburger menu doesn't display,

2898
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:43,440
that means I actually need
to write exactly what happened here.

2899
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:44,560
Okay.

2900
02:45:44,560 --> 02:45:45,480
I can say.

2901
02:45:45,480 --> 02:45:48,120
Hamburger
menu does not display something else.

2902
02:45:48,120 --> 02:45:49,920
This place. Okay.

2903
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:52,440
And because we didn't

2904
02:45:52,440 --> 02:45:56,040
get the expected result, we will failed
that step because would say no.

2905
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:56,880
Does that make sense?

2906
02:45:58,440 --> 02:46:01,160
Here we are

2907
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:03,760
we are just creating a simple task is go

2908
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:07,120
user clicks hamburger
menu on top left corner guys.

2909
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:11,240
What is the third step?

2910
02:46:11,240 --> 02:46:12,240
What is

2911
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:19,040
what is it?

2912
02:46:20,040 --> 02:46:20,920
So do you leave?

2913
02:46:20,920 --> 02:46:24,560
Expect the result Menu blank.

2914
02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:25,760
What do you mean?

2915
02:46:26,680 --> 02:46:27,640
What do you mean?

2916
02:46:28,360 --> 02:46:31,000
That's what was an email and those.

2917
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:31,280
Yeah.

2918
02:46:31,280 --> 02:46:32,640
And the region

2919
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:36,080
Do you do
you leave the expected result name blank.

2920
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:40,240
What does that mean?

2921
02:46:40,240 --> 02:46:44,320
Okay so three write
digital content and devices.

2922
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:49,480
Okay, we know that we need to click on
prime video, but we should probably say

2923
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:53,480
something like under digital content
and devices, click on prime video.

2924
02:46:53,480 --> 02:46:56,000
Right?

2925
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,480
Okay. Right.

2926
02:46:58,480 --> 02:47:01,400
So we can say user

2927
02:47:01,400 --> 02:47:03,960
user navigates

2928
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:06,600
to digital.

2929
02:47:06,600 --> 02:47:07,120
What's it called?

2930
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:12,800
Digital Can't and and devices section

2931
02:47:13,960 --> 02:47:19,200
and and clicks clicks on prime video.

2932
02:47:19,200 --> 02:47:19,800
Right.

2933
02:47:20,880 --> 02:47:22,240
Prime video.

2934
02:47:22,320 --> 02:47:23,000
Cool.

2935
02:47:23,320 --> 02:47:25,400
You see how descriptive I was there guys?

2936
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:28,240
You see that right?

2937
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:33,240
I also indicated under what section
I should be clicking.

2938
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:34,680
Did you guys see this right.

2939
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:39,320
I said user navigate to digital content
and devices section.

2940
02:47:39,840 --> 02:47:40,440
Okay.

2941
02:47:40,440 --> 02:47:43,080
And clicks on and

2942
02:47:43,480 --> 02:47:44,800
and clicks on prime video.

2943
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:45,520
Okay,

2944
02:47:46,240 --> 02:47:49,680
cool.

2945
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:52,040
What happens if it opens the menu?

2946
02:47:52,040 --> 02:47:54,200
One of the many
those open that we filled this step.

2947
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:56,640
We're just creating a test case
for the first time.

2948
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:57,280
Okay.

2949
02:47:57,360 --> 02:48:01,680
So what is the expected result
when you click on this?

2950
02:48:02,800 --> 02:48:05,200
Okay.

2951
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:08,960
Prime video menu displays, right?

2952
02:48:09,520 --> 02:48:12,440
So the expected result, right, is Prime

2953
02:48:13,400 --> 02:48:16,600
video menu

2954
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:17,880
menu of this device.

2955
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:20,800
So that's exactly what that's
what's expected

2956
02:48:22,360 --> 02:48:24,600
of. What are to the text?

2957
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:26,000
Okay.

2958
02:48:26,040 --> 02:48:29,200
So you should know
before you create a test case.

2959
02:48:29,480 --> 02:48:31,880
Now we know that
you expect the results, Right.

2960
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:34,800
But You should not expect the results

2961
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:37,800
before you actually run your test case.

2962
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:38,600
Okay.

2963
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:41,680
So what does creating
want to do from scratch?

2964
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:43,760
Everything So just follow along. Okay.

2965
02:48:44,160 --> 02:48:46,800
So let's say we're testing it, right?

2966
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:50,000
What happens when we click on prime video?

2967
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:53,240
Prime video menu displays
right so you can just copy this

2968
02:48:54,680 --> 02:48:57,120
and we can paste this right here.

2969
02:48:57,120 --> 02:48:59,440
Cool. And did it pass?

2970
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:02,680
Yes, it passed. Okay.

2971
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:04,880
Step four. What is that, Four, guys?

2972
02:49:05,400 --> 02:49:23,680
What is step four?

2973
02:49:23,680 --> 02:49:25,720
What is step four?

2974
02:49:25,720 --> 02:49:28,920
The user clicks on a video to play.

2975
02:49:28,960 --> 02:49:32,040
No, that's not step four.

2976
02:49:32,040 --> 02:49:33,960
That is not step four.

2977
02:49:33,960 --> 02:49:38,760
What is step four? Yes.

2978
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:42,480
No, no, it's not done.

2979
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,640
We're not in the prime video homepage yet.

2980
02:49:46,240 --> 02:49:47,640
Why Would we stop?

2981
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:48,720
Yes, exactly.

2982
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:50,720
Click on prime video button. Right.

2983
02:49:50,720 --> 02:49:56,280
So user clicks on prime
video button, right.

2984
02:49:56,280 --> 02:49:58,080
Say button. That's fine.

2985
02:49:58,080 --> 02:50:00,120
So user clicks on prime video button.

2986
02:50:00,120 --> 02:50:03,000
Okay, So what happens when we click
on prime video button?

2987
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:05,160
What happens, guys?

2988
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:11,240
What happens?

2989
02:50:11,240 --> 02:50:14,000
Prime video

2990
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,160
on page displays, right.

2991
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:18,680
Okay, cool.

2992
02:50:18,680 --> 02:50:22,560
We're going to cut this
and we're going to copy this.

2993
02:50:23,040 --> 02:50:25,400
We did that. So the actual results

2994
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:28,960
are the same and that it passed.

2995
02:50:28,960 --> 02:50:31,880
Yes, it did. Okay, cool.

2996
02:50:32,400 --> 02:50:35,880
And then we can label

2997
02:50:36,520 --> 02:50:39,680
step five and we can say, end of tests.

2998
02:50:39,960 --> 02:50:42,480
Okay, The end of tests.

2999
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:43,480
Cool.

3000
02:50:43,960 --> 02:50:44,960
All right.

3001
02:50:44,960 --> 02:50:48,400
So this right here, please, gentlemen,
that everyone do

3002
02:50:48,400 --> 02:50:50,040
this or not

3003
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:53,960
that everyone do this

3004
02:50:54,480 --> 02:50:55,200
or not.

3005
02:50:55,440 --> 02:50:59,240
Okay, This right here is a test case.

3006
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:00,280
Okay?

3007
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:04,280
If you didn't do it,
take a screenshot of it now.

3008
02:51:05,400 --> 02:51:10,080
Okay, But this is what a test case is.

3009
02:51:10,280 --> 02:51:13,200
Okay, Now I want you guys to notice

3010
02:51:13,200 --> 02:51:16,560
some things. Go

3011
02:51:16,560 --> 02:51:19,240
a step is an action, right?

3012
02:51:19,240 --> 02:51:23,200
Every single step right here is an action,
right?

3013
02:51:23,440 --> 02:51:26,800
We're indicating it like an action
when needs to happen

3014
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:32,600
and expect The result is what happens
when that action took place.

3015
02:51:32,760 --> 02:51:37,560
Would it be incorrect to have an action
and expect a result?

3016
02:51:38,120 --> 02:51:40,680
I see it all the time. So let's say like,

3017
02:51:41,800 --> 02:51:42,760
do you guys know what I'm saying?

3018
02:51:42,760 --> 02:51:47,160
So like
if I say user navigates to Amazon.com,

3019
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:51,840
if you guys have an action here
and expect the result, then you will fail.

3020
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:52,920
Test case review.

3021
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:56,440
Okay, so in your workplace
you will have test case review.

3022
02:51:56,440 --> 02:51:59,760
For example, in our projects
we conduct test case

3023
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:02,320
reviews to make sure
that the test case makes sense

3024
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,880
and that it's appropriately satisfying

3025
02:52:05,880 --> 02:52:08,240
the acceptance criteria of the user story.

3026
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:11,640
Okay, so

3027
02:52:11,640 --> 02:52:12,920
does this make sense, guys?

3028
02:52:12,920 --> 02:52:18,000
So an action should not be
and the expected result column.

3029
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:19,000
Okay.

3030
02:52:19,080 --> 02:52:21,400
Again, it should not be

3031
02:52:21,880 --> 02:52:24,440
in the expected result column

3032
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:26,800
and expect the result is what

3033
02:52:26,800 --> 02:52:29,440
what is it expect the result

3034
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:32,560
is what's supposed to happen.

3035
02:52:32,560 --> 02:52:32,840
Right.

3036
02:52:32,840 --> 02:52:37,560
It's what happens when you take that
action, when the user takes that action.

3037
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:37,880
Okay.

3038
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:41,720
And then you pass or you failed that test.

3039
02:52:41,720 --> 02:52:43,920
Okay, cool.

3040
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:47,400
So this is test case
one and we're going to save it.

3041
02:52:47,720 --> 02:52:48,120
Okay.

3042
02:52:48,120 --> 02:52:50,400
We are going to say we go ahead
and take the screenshot of it.

3043
02:52:50,880 --> 02:52:53,600
Okay? Take a screenshot of it

3044
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:55,120
if you haven't. Okay.

3045
02:52:55,120 --> 02:52:56,320
And congratulations.

3046
02:52:56,320 --> 02:53:00,360
Give yourselves round of applause
because you took you your first test case.

3047
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:03,960
You guys, this is it.
This is a big moment.

3048
02:53:03,960 --> 02:53:06,360
This is a big day right here, guys.

3049
02:53:06,360 --> 02:53:09,200
All right. This

3050
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:13,840
this like needs a celebration.

3051
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:16,560
All right?

3052
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:18,080
Is it's a big achievement.

3053
02:53:18,080 --> 02:53:19,960
Big, big achievement. Okay.

3054
02:53:19,960 --> 02:53:23,880
But now you need to know the rules
of creating a test case.

3055
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:26,040
Cool.

3056
02:53:26,040 --> 02:53:26,640
Okay.

3057
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:29,040
Very, very good job.

3058
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:31,760
All right, now,

3059
02:53:31,800 --> 02:53:33,400
let's go back here.

3060
02:53:33,400 --> 02:53:35,600
We wrote our test case. Okay?

3061
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:38,280
And even though it had these these

3062
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:42,120
you know what it needs to contain at work,
you make

3063
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:45,560
you may create your test cases
differently.

3064
02:53:45,560 --> 02:53:49,280
Okay, But they will follow some sort
of structure like this.

3065
02:53:49,280 --> 02:53:50,480
Does this make sense?

3066
02:53:50,480 --> 02:53:53,640
I'm not saying it's
going to be exactly like this, like this.

3067
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,160
And you project some things may change.

3068
02:53:56,160 --> 02:53:58,440
Some things might be a little different.
Okay.

3069
02:53:58,440 --> 02:54:02,000
But this is essentially
what a test case would contain.

3070
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:02,960
Okay.

3071
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:05,040
The expected result will be determined.

3072
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:06,840
The request of the VA.

3073
02:54:06,840 --> 02:54:08,360
Yes, sure. It's very good.

3074
02:54:08,360 --> 02:54:13,080
So most of the time
the VA will tell you the expected results.

3075
02:54:13,440 --> 02:54:13,920
Okay.

3076
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:17,320
We're going to talk about precondition
in another test and another test.

3077
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:20,720
We're going to talk about another.

3078
02:54:20,720 --> 02:54:23,080
So here
we have two samples of two test cases

3079
02:54:23,080 --> 02:54:25,640
that are different, that have different
values like created by,

3080
02:54:26,840 --> 02:54:30,480
you know, what we can do
here, let's add are created by

3081
02:54:31,720 --> 02:54:33,400
created by.

3082
02:54:33,400 --> 02:54:34,080
Okay, go ahead.

3083
02:54:34,080 --> 02:54:37,280
And that created by your test case.

3084
02:54:38,040 --> 02:54:41,160
Okay.

3085
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:43,000
And write your name.

3086
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,120
I'm going to say syntax and structure.

3087
02:54:45,760 --> 02:54:48,120
Okay, cool.

3088
02:54:48,120 --> 02:54:52,560
So created by
and then you go into your name

3089
02:54:53,960 --> 02:54:54,840
and that's it.

3090
02:54:54,840 --> 02:54:56,880
Let's see, what else should we add?

3091
02:54:56,880 --> 02:54:59,000
We created

3092
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:03,920
this one has a review by
because we did a test case review.

3093
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:09,480
So you can add that as well. Yes.

3094
02:55:09,480 --> 02:55:10,000
Okay.

3095
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,520
Test data, we'll talk about that
data as well.

3096
02:55:12,960 --> 02:55:13,200
Okay.

3097
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:15,800
We'll talk more about that as well. Okay.

3098
02:55:15,800 --> 02:55:16,440
Okay.

3099
02:55:16,440 --> 02:55:18,840
So does make sense go so far?

3100
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:24,240
Does this make sense?

3101
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:24,760
Well,

3102
02:55:26,640 --> 02:55:28,640
very, very, very good.

3103
02:55:28,640 --> 02:55:29,280
Okay.

3104
02:55:29,280 --> 02:55:32,080
Very, very, very good. All right.

3105
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:34,520
Let's say.

3106
02:55:34,520 --> 02:55:37,320
Okay, so this is a test case.

3107
02:55:38,480 --> 02:55:39,360
Okay.

3108
02:55:39,360 --> 02:55:43,080
And now

3109
02:55:43,240 --> 02:55:44,920
if you see this picture right here, right.

3110
02:55:44,920 --> 02:55:47,600
You see that it contains test data. Okay.

3111
02:55:47,960 --> 02:55:52,840
So we have an acceptance criteria
that requires us to or requirement

3112
02:55:52,840 --> 02:55:56,600
that requires us to log in
with valid credentials.

3113
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:57,720
Right.

3114
02:55:58,440 --> 02:56:00,720
What are we going to need?

3115
02:56:00,720 --> 02:56:02,480
What are we going to need

3116
02:56:04,040 --> 02:56:05,840
if what will we need?

3117
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:10,920
If we are required to log in
with valid credentials?

3118
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:11,440
Yeah,

3119
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:15,280
we are going to need
the credentials, right?

3120
02:56:16,920 --> 02:56:19,680
We are going to need the credentials.

3121
02:56:19,680 --> 02:56:22,040
That information is test data.

3122
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:24,800
Okay, Does that make sense?

3123
02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:28,200
We will create test cases like that.

3124
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:28,880
Okay.

3125
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:32,640
That information will be,
you know, test data and stuff.

3126
02:56:33,160 --> 02:56:36,280
Okay, let's set a prerequisites.

3127
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:38,400
Prerequisites.

3128
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:41,400
Prerequisite is what needs to happen
before the test case.

3129
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:45,400
You can say access to Chrome browser,
but we'll talk about better preconditions

3130
02:56:45,400 --> 02:56:48,120
and stuff. What the next test is
that we're going to write. Okay,

3131
02:56:49,080 --> 02:56:51,520
so as a task.

3132
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:53,440
Okay.

3133
02:56:53,440 --> 02:56:55,800
For homework.

3134
02:56:56,040 --> 02:56:57,240
All right.

3135
02:56:57,840 --> 02:57:00,640
And we're going to start
picking up a lot of this stuff.

3136
02:57:00,640 --> 02:57:00,960
Okay.

3137
02:57:00,960 --> 02:57:03,200
You guys are going to be experts at.

3138
02:57:03,200 --> 02:57:06,120
Okay. All right.

3139
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:08,440
So homework could

3140
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:12,360
create a test case.

3141
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:14,640
All of

3142
02:57:15,400 --> 02:57:18,480
user stories that

3143
02:57:18,480 --> 02:57:20,880
story, we're going to make it right now.

3144
02:57:20,880 --> 02:57:24,680
All right.

3145
02:57:24,680 --> 02:57:26,400
Let's say

3146
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:29,920
your story.

3147
02:57:29,920 --> 02:57:31,480
Your story.

3148
02:57:31,480 --> 02:57:33,600
Let's say
I'm just going to make something up.

3149
02:57:34,880 --> 02:57:37,400
That's a user story idea.

3150
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:41,520
And we're going to say that the acceptance
criteria,

3151
02:57:42,720 --> 02:57:45,320
acceptance criteria is

3152
02:57:47,240 --> 02:57:50,320
as a Netflix user

3153
02:57:50,320 --> 02:57:55,560
user, I should be able to log in

3154
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:58,360
with a valid

3155
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:05,440
I should be able to

3156
02:58:06,760 --> 02:58:08,240
I should be able to log in

3157
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:11,120
with valid credentials

3158
02:58:14,880 --> 02:58:16,640
from the home page.

3159
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:20,040
Okay.

3160
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:28,320
Let's say as a Netflix user. Okay

3161
02:58:29,920 --> 02:58:34,320
I've got Netflix dot com.

3162
02:58:34,320 --> 02:58:36,680
I should be able

3163
02:58:36,720 --> 02:58:39,160
to log in with valid credentials

3164
02:58:39,600 --> 02:58:41,600
from the home page

3165
02:58:42,280 --> 02:58:44,920
and your credentials what is different?

3166
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,080
Each organization has their own template.

3167
02:58:47,080 --> 02:58:48,480
What is the question

3168
02:58:49,160 --> 02:58:53,040
is a story can know user stories
I'll show you how those those work okay

3169
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:56,680
you don't the user story numbers up
they're generated somehow

3170
02:58:56,680 --> 02:58:58,800
and when we start working with JIRA,
you're going to see

3171
02:58:59,880 --> 02:59:02,160
I don't have an account
who wants to give me theirs

3172
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:04,920
for homework purposes

3173
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:09,760
just that.

3174
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:11,200
That's fine.

3175
02:59:11,440 --> 02:59:12,920
You don't need a Netflix account.

3176
02:59:12,920 --> 02:59:16,200
I just want to see
how you would write the test case.

3177
02:59:16,200 --> 02:59:16,920
Okay,

3178
02:59:17,920 --> 02:59:20,760
so as a Netflix
when visiting Netflix dot com,

3179
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:24,840
I should be able to log in
with valid credentials from the home page.

3180
02:59:25,200 --> 02:59:28,160
Okay.

3181
02:59:28,160 --> 02:59:31,120
Okay.
This makes sense. And I'm going to say

3182
02:59:33,240 --> 02:59:35,360
just data flows.

3183
02:59:35,560 --> 02:59:36,800
Data.

3184
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:39,080
Okay. Username,

3185
02:59:39,560 --> 02:59:42,760
username and password

3186
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:46,840
if you have a Netflix account,
use your own data.

3187
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:51,480
Okay, Don't share your username
and password or just make something up.

3188
02:59:51,480 --> 02:59:54,320
Okay? Just make something up.

3189
02:59:54,320 --> 02:59:57,320
But this is the user story.

3190
02:59:57,320 --> 02:59:58,080
Okay.

3191
02:59:58,080 --> 02:59:59,960
This makes sense to everyone.

3192
02:59:59,960 --> 03:00:03,960
So the homework is to create a test case
for the following user story.

3193
03:00:05,080 --> 03:00:05,760
Cool.

3194
03:00:06,920 --> 03:00:07,240
All right.

3195
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:09,760
And that is going to be your homework
assignment.

3196
03:00:10,440 --> 03:00:10,800
Okay.

3197
03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:13,200
Now, does anyone any questions

3198
03:00:14,320 --> 03:00:15,640
on anything

3199
03:00:18,800 --> 03:00:19,960
we already talked about?

3200
03:00:19,960 --> 03:00:23,280
What does data is
what is what is test data, guys?

3201
03:00:23,360 --> 03:00:29,000
What is test data?

3202
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:29,760
What is Tuesday?

3203
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:34,360
The test data is any data that you're
going to need to execute your test case.

3204
03:00:34,600 --> 03:00:35,160
Right?

3205
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:39,160
So in case in this case, when when we're

3206
03:00:39,160 --> 03:00:42,080
logging in with valid credentials,
you need a username and password, right?

3207
03:00:42,440 --> 03:00:46,280
So in your work environment,
they will provide with this information

3208
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:49,680
for this purpose,
use your own credentials.

3209
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:53,400
If you have a Netflix account,
if you don't just make something up.

3210
03:00:53,400 --> 03:00:55,680
I'm just really looking to see how create

3211
03:00:57,120 --> 03:00:59,800
how you create
these, how you create your test case.

3212
03:00:59,800 --> 03:01:01,800
Okay, cool.

3213
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:10,240
Does that make sense?

3214
03:01:10,240 --> 03:01:11,840
Does that make sense?

3215
03:01:12,520 --> 03:01:13,400
Okay. Okay.

3216
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:15,480
Now do we have any questions

3217
03:01:23,320 --> 03:01:25,400
how to use test data and excel,

3218
03:01:26,520 --> 03:01:28,320
but use just enter it.

3219
03:01:28,320 --> 03:01:31,920
So for example, I'm not going to
write it down because that's a homework,

3220
03:01:32,440 --> 03:01:34,680
but maybe one of the steps can be like

3221
03:01:34,920 --> 03:01:39,720
user enters username
and then you pass the data or something.

3222
03:01:40,120 --> 03:01:41,800
You figure it out.

3223
03:01:41,800 --> 03:01:43,800
Okay, cool.

3224
03:01:43,800 --> 03:01:46,360
And it should be in your steps.

3225
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:48,960
All right, where do we share homework?

3226
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:51,240
Okay, So listen,

3227
03:01:51,480 --> 03:01:56,120
I will tell you to share the homework
on Saturday or Sunday.

3228
03:01:56,240 --> 03:01:56,960
Okay?

3229
03:01:57,840 --> 03:01:59,880
I want you guys to want to see.

3230
03:02:00,480 --> 03:02:02,880
And actually, actually, you know what?

3231
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:05,320
Don't post any homework.

3232
03:02:06,240 --> 03:02:07,040
And the channel.

3233
03:02:07,040 --> 03:02:11,840
I want you guys to send me a screenshot
of your test

3234
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:15,680
directly to me,
not to the syntax instructor,

3235
03:02:17,080 --> 03:02:19,840
but to the d'ivoire's instructor account.

3236
03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:20,640
Okay,

3237
03:02:21,360 --> 03:02:23,400
I'm going to be teaching
you guys this weekend.

3238
03:02:23,400 --> 03:02:25,920
I think you guys are doing Java.

3239
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:27,720
Yes. So

3240
03:02:28,200 --> 03:02:32,200
direct messaged me
a screenshot of test case.

3241
03:02:32,720 --> 03:02:34,440
Okay, cool.

3242
03:02:34,440 --> 03:02:36,800
Yes. On slack.

3243
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:41,640
Okay, cool.

3244
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:42,320
All right.

3245
03:02:42,320 --> 03:02:46,400
So what I'm going to do okay, is

3246
03:02:47,360 --> 03:02:49,680
I don't post my notes on canvas.

3247
03:02:50,400 --> 03:02:52,400
Okay?

3248
03:02:52,400 --> 03:02:53,880
Because

3249
03:02:55,480 --> 03:03:00,040
I want you guys to pay attention.

3250
03:03:00,040 --> 03:03:03,880
Okay.

3251
03:03:03,880 --> 03:03:09,840
So what we're going to do is,
you know what?

3252
03:03:09,840 --> 03:03:11,160
Actually,

3253
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:15,640
what I forgot to do is we're going to say

3254
03:03:18,960 --> 03:03:21,160
that you test the

3255
03:03:22,560 --> 03:03:25,880
class one, get

3256
03:03:25,880 --> 03:03:29,200
went, set my own test in class one.

3257
03:03:29,200 --> 03:03:31,280
But these are the notes we took.

3258
03:03:32,360 --> 03:03:35,240
They may be very high level,
but we already had this conversation

3259
03:03:35,240 --> 03:03:38,280
earlier today right.

3260
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:40,960
Just look up, Diego and you'll find it.
All right.

3261
03:03:40,960 --> 03:03:44,960
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to share these notes.

3262
03:03:45,480 --> 03:03:48,480
What do you guys want them
on the life questions or of course,

3263
03:03:48,480 --> 03:03:51,880
announcements are where. But

3264
03:03:53,880 --> 03:03:54,720
what's easier

3265
03:03:54,720 --> 03:03:58,440
for you guys?

3266
03:03:58,440 --> 03:04:00,240
Yes, I don't post on canvas.

3267
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:03,120
I don't post on on campus.

3268
03:04:03,120 --> 03:04:04,640
I don't post on canvas.

3269
03:04:04,640 --> 03:04:07,600
So I will post the task on course
announcements.

3270
03:04:07,600 --> 03:04:09,040
Okay, cool.

3271
03:04:09,720 --> 03:04:10,920
Posted there.

3272
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:11,280
This over.

3273
03:04:11,280 --> 03:04:13,280
Does anyone have any questions?

3274
03:04:13,280 --> 03:04:15,480
Did you guys learn anything today?

3275
03:04:15,480 --> 03:04:19,280
Which by the way, congratulations
this is your first manual

3276
03:04:19,280 --> 03:04:22,240
testing course
that you guys have successfully completed.

3277
03:04:22,840 --> 03:04:24,880
Okay, cool.

3278
03:04:25,440 --> 03:04:28,960
And next class and the following classes
and so forth.

3279
03:04:28,960 --> 03:04:31,800
It's going to get very,
very, very hands on.

3280
03:04:32,440 --> 03:04:33,160
Okay.

3281
03:04:33,240 --> 03:04:35,960
So again, we are posting

Okay, cool.

3288
03:04:58,560 --> 03:05:01,160
The homework is due

Yeah, October 11th.

3296
03:05:21,160 --> 03:05:22,640
Oh, are you sure?

It's October 11, six, seven, eight,

Well, yeah, it's 11 four, so due Monday.

And I will post this task
and of course announcements shortly.

3301
03:05:36,680 --> 03:05:39,560
Okay, cool.

3302
03:05:39,560 --> 03:05:41,760
All right, guys, do we have any questions?

3303
03:05:43,480 --> 03:05:45,760
You guys will also get the slides as well.

3304
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:46,480
Okay.

3305
03:05:46,600 --> 03:05:49,480
You guys will get the slides as well.

3306
03:05:49,480 --> 03:05:50,200
Cool.

3307
03:05:50,880 --> 03:05:52,760
You guys will get the slides.

3308
03:05:52,760 --> 03:05:54,600
Slides as well.

3309
03:05:54,840 --> 03:05:55,560
All right.

3310
03:05:56,440 --> 03:05:58,920
So I hope you enjoy today.

3311
