1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,920
Good old times.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,440
Good old times, right?

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,440
For years, let's say all four months
equals to four years, right?

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,640
More than four months.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,680
Yes. I think you guys have almost all

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,480
you guys have a little over a month
that is left, right.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,520
I guess I miss you, too.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,280
I miss you, too.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,480
And it's been I hope you guys
how how is the journey going

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,920
as the journey going so far, guys?

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,560
Okay, good.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,520
Great.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,360
Good.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,400
Learn a lot.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,560
That's important. Right?

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,920
So now, now, guys, when are you going
to look back at the class Number one?

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,440
Right.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,760
Remember,
as I told you, we're building, right?

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,640
We're building our building.

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,400
And what I said on the first class that
you have to compare yourself to yourself.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,480
So now from from today,
if you're going to look back, guys,

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:10,840
did you guys learn a lot?

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,640
Oh, yes.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,120
Oh, yes. That's good then.

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,040
And and yes, guys, think of it.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,160
It's only, what, a month and a half left.

27
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,440
Maybe, maybe Max, a two month in.

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,880
Remember when you were just starting
and you said, Oh, my God, six months.

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,200
It's so long.

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,040
And then go say, go tag
time is going so quick.

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
And and I really hope guys
I mean, of course you're learning and

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,120
I really hope you guys have been enjoying
it, even though I'm sure it's

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,360
it's tough.

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,800
Right.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,800
And especially for
those that have work and kids,

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,800
you guys have to sacrifice a lot.

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,840
However, guys, trust me. Trust me.

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,840
It's a beautiful, beautiful journey awaits
ahead of you.

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,480
A lot of things to memorize.

40
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,920
Remember, guys, hard work
always, always pays off.

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,360
So the more effort, and especially right
now, guys, it's important.

It's not all of you, right?

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,000
When they used to teach your Java classes
in, however, I guess

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,120
it's still majority of you all still here.

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,760
And you guys almost made it to the end,
right?

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,120

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,560
dark circles.

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,360

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,520
Therefore, for a friend and The Bachelor

Yeah they just
they just start learning that

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,160
Java basics And you are guys all right.

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,240
There is a last push that you guys have.

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,080
And after that,
there will be another journey.

60
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,360
And just to share some good news with you

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,400

maybe now
a little bit over the in two weeks

a wage for you guys right
And I'm expecting then now wishing you

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,480
all of that right so
and think I guess another two months worth

95
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,520
of really really hard work right
Because remember

96
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,640
you guys all are going to get very high
paying jobs.

97
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,440
Very high paying jobs. Right.

98
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,480
Then when I think of a student
that is 20 years old

99
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,200
and, you know, getting in offers
$80,000 and upwards, it is crazy.

100
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,400
It's really,
really life changing right then.

101
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,000
But remember, guys,
everything requires a hard work, right?

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,360
If if it would be easy,
then everybody would be doing it, right?

103
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,960
Everyone.

104
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,400
So but it's important, guys,
that you right now putting all the vocals,

105
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,240
all the distractions you already made
more than halfway through.

106
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,680
Right?

107
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,520
And so now there's another really good
push that you guys need to do.

108
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,120
All of us are coming.

109
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,680
This offer.

110
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,840
I can come in
as long as you guys put in your efforts.

111
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,400
Jobs are there and offers will be there.

112
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,280
It is a real life
changing, life changing this year.

113
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,480
And especially it's you know,
sometimes we have husband wives

114
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
joining or sometimes we have brothers,
sisters joining.

115
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,480
So very, very exciting moments. Right.

116
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,440
So with that being said, guys, today
actually

117
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,080
will be a way for you
that you guys go into practice

118
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,240
and that's going to take your knowledge

119
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,440
even further

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,480
forward of of

121
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,320
based on the practices
that we will be doing today.

122
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,040
Right.

123
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,680
So today, guys,
we are going to explain you the project.

124
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,800
So right now
you guys just see me speaking. And

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,200
I second part,
Mozart will be speaking, right?

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,240
We will explain you how the project works.

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,800
And it's really,
really important, guys, to do with in

128
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,640
this time.

129
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,320
You guys, I know for the past few classes,

130
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,120
you guys have been learning
how to work together, right?

131
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,560
When it comes to
I give before you guys were doing

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,920
your own coding and storing on your own.

133
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,200
You have.

134
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,040
However, for the past few classes you guys
been learning how to work together.

135
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,640
So that's
what is our project is about this.

136
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,280
We kind of like are going to try to do

137
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,840
not try this project will be doing
for all previous

138
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,920
batches guys
and this project has been very,

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,320
very helpful
when it comes to the students.

140
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,040
All the students love the project.

141
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,920
They're very excited.

142
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,560
Even though the project
are not going to say it's super hard.

143
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,000
I would say probably it's a medium
level more in here.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,520
What are we trying to achieve?

145
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,920
You in here, guys?

146
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,120
That you guys learn how to work together?

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:59,080
Basically, our goal is right now to make
you experience an actual life project.

148
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,680
How it works, and the only thing
we will be making it in a shorter right.

149
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,800
You are taking bootcamp, right?

150
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,960
It's a shorter journey.

151
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,360
So the same thing we trying to squeeze
our actual actual sprint, right?

152
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,760
And we try to squeeze it
within one week as well.

153
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,440
Right.

154
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,760
However, it will be very amazing
practice for you guys

155
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,120
and you actually guys
will learn learn a lot, right?

156
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Even though everything that you know
already, you learn a

157
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,440
you know, they're ready by now,
you guys will be able to do it yourself

158
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,680
because before you guys were just fall
in instructor doing it But now you will

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,120
as a team will have to do it yourself
because it's very important guys, that

160
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,640
a framework that we developed, right?

161
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,920
It's kind of like it's a medium, medium
size, medium level framework, I would say.

162
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
And now it's important guys, that you can

163
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,920
put it this framework yourself, right?

164
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,160
But also, of course,
besides the technical part, guys,

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,440
we will be looking at the user
stories, right?

166
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,040
So what's going to happen
This I'm going to explain you

167
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,920
regarding your user stories
and how you guys will be doing the things

168
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,080
and Moazzam will explain you
how you guys will be working together.

169
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,680
Okay.

170
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,680
So let me actually all the team names.

171
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,680
One moment, guys.

172
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,840
I need I need your

173
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,280
so the file that I shared, right,

174
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,320
guys, the file that are shared.

175
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,400
So right now, guys.

176
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,920
And if some of you still did
not put your GitHub username, please

177
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,880
make sure you guys do it
because Amazon needs it so he can add you.

178
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,160
Okay, so he can it

179
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,360
right for now.

180
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,720
Okay. There's somebody is missing me.

181
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,760
We created extra projects in there.

182
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,680
Okay, so let's have a little this.

183
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,520
Let's have a look. Okay.

184
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,480
So what is going to happen this right?

185
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,440
So all of you right now,
you guys have groups, right?

186
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,360
You guys all have groups.

187
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,840
So. And groups
with two based in here, right?

188
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,160
I believe there is a ten groups
as of moment.

189
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,040
Okay.

190
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,880
I think there should be nine or ten.

191
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,480
Right.

192
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,400
So students
that are there two people or three people.

193
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,240
So I would suggest guys
try to get together.

194
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,520
Right.

195
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,560
For example, and we testers,

196
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,360
I don't know if there is the rest
of the team members do not add anything,

197
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,400
but if it's only two of you, Abdul
I probably would suggest you with

198
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,320
and we testers and with the bite Me
you guys tried to join together, right?

199
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,520
Because it's important
that you guys doing it as a team.

200
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,640
Okay, so you guys can gather together
and work on one project.

201
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,440
Okay, So and try not to go to Gene

202
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,920
right now because maybe some of you guys
forgot your access.

203
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,200
I will help you with that.

204
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
So basically, the very project,

205
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,920
the way is going to work, guys, it's fully
kind of like in two parts, right?

206
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,600
The first part where you guys actually
are going to have to do an actual sprint.

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200
And you know, guys, whenever we are,

208
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,680
whenever we are working in that Scrum
team, right, whenever we are

209
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,000
following Agile, Agile, I'm going to ask
you questions right now on this.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,600
Right.

211
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,160
So how long is this usually spring days.

212
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,520
How long?

213
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,120
Usually sprint

214
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,120
It's always two weeks.

215
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,480
It can be between two weeks
to four weeks, right?

216
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,200
So 2 to 4 weeks, different projects,
different companies

217
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,200
following their own structure,
even within the same company.

218
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,640
You guys, there can be a project
that will follow a different structure

219
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,640
is, for example, think of the Amazon guys,
Think of Bank of America, right?

220
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,200
Bank of America has multiple,
multiple projects, the same as Amazon.

221
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,320
They have multiple, multiple projects
within the same company.

222
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,520
So now those projects, my
my have different structure

223
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,720
right when it comes to following a scrum.

224
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,480
Right So now before right maybe
when just Agile came into the picture

225
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,480
probably four weeks were 3 to 4 weeks
work work.

226
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,360
Hammer However, now
because we are in the fast pace, right,

227
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,520
we in the first phase and clients
want more faster feedback, right?

228
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,960
Clients want to see a application
in a faster right.

229
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,440
So this way right now very, very common.

230
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,760
Mostly people companies are shifting
towards two weeks, right?

231
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,520
And there are some companies
that still follow three weeks.

232
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,240
Yes, there are still companies
to follow three weeks even where we hear

233
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,480
lately, guys, sometimes even companies
have a one week sprint.

234
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,760
Right. I think maybe you heard it from

235
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,480
from Suhail.

236
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,400
I think you compare his company.

237
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,440
They do sometimes a one week sprint,
which I think is pretty crazy.

238
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,560
Honestly, I don't know
what can you achieve in in one week.

239
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,760
Oh every two weeks is very common right.

240
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,760
Two which is very common
and within this two weeks.

241
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,080
Right.

242
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,880
We've let me ask you guys, for example,
if the project is for two years

243
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,680
is it means this month
it will be two weeks,

244
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,760
next months will be three months
or it's two weeks for the rest, two

245
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:44,040
years.

246
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,520
Okay.

247
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,160
It will be the same days.

248
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,520
It will be the same. Right.

249
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,680
If you are joining the project,

250
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,280
if you join in the project,
and if you stay on that project.

251
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,800
So they are following the same
because it's a set time box, right?

252
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,280
It's a set time box, guys. The company.

253
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,600
Right.

254
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,960
The team before the days before

255
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,600
you actually joined the company,
before you join the project,

256
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,520
there's actually a lot
a lot of things are happening, right?

257
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,520
So you might join on the sprint
number ten.

258
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,680
You might join on the sprint.

259
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,240
Number five, you might join on the sprint
number 15, right 20 in the middle.

260
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,800
Sometimes on the project.

261
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,360
However, even before those sprints
actually started, guys.

262
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,920
Right.

263
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,160
It means before before
the project was a sprint started.

264
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,760
So they product owner had to actually

265
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,960
talk to the client,
gather all the requirements.

266
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,560
Right.

267
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,120
Not all but at least at that time
that that they know what they want.

268
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,120
Right. All those technical part

269
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,240
has to be discussed
how the application is going to look.

270
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,200
So this takes time
before the actual actual sprint starts.

271
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,520
Sometimes a company spends eight before

272
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,160
talking
and in finalizing all the things right,

273
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,960
and then all the processes
will be discussed, right.

274
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,040
So before they start a project,
they define, okay, we're going to follow

275
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,240
two weeks sprints

276
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,680
and this two weeks sprints
will be for the rest of the project.

277
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,080
The same project, right? The same project.

278
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,480
Of course.

279
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,560
If you guys going to change projects
within the same company, right?

280
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,920
Projects
within the same company, for example.

281
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,200
Right. Let's say Google, right.

282
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,440
There's a separate team
that works strictly on

283
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,720
Gmail, there's a separate team
that strictly works on drive.

284
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,080
There's a separate team
that strictly for work

285
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,720
on other parts
when it comes to Google, right?

286
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,720
So there's a different different
different teams that work in there.

287
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,240
So different project.

288
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
So unless you move from one project

289
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,560
to another project,
then that timeline can change.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,240
But usually, usually it's always
or I mean, when you join the project for

291
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,160
the rest of the duration of the project,
your your sprint will be the same, right?

292
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,320
You will be the same.

293
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,600
Right.

294
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,520
So two weeks,
that's what usually we're looking at.

295
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,960
And as I mentioned in here, guys,
what we will do, we will we will do a

296
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,720
short spring, we will do a one week
sprint, one week sprint.

297
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,000
Usually what it is,
it's a five working days, right?

298
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,760
So now within this sprint,
right within two weeks,

299
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,000
spring,
one week sprint, three weeks sprint.

300
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,960
So what kind of

301
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,120
meetings are there?

302
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,560
What kind of ceremonies. Right.

303
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,880
We call them as ceremonies.

304
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,960
What kind of ceremonies are happening
this we, we

305
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,720
select all

306
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:59,520
very clean.

307
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,120
Okay.

308
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,840
Right. Okay.

309
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,800
So there's a several similar
ceremonies are happening right.

310
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,000
So, for example,
if we're going to take a two week sprint.

311
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,720
Right.

312
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,720
It went down.

313
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,440
I don't know why you don't,
but two weeks sprint.

314
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,040
Right.

315
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,800
So and remember those

316
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,560
on which they on
which they sprint against targets.

317
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,000
What are this thing on which they

318
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,800
now maybe I will surprise you guys

319
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,880
but sprain doesn't mean
that it has to start on Monday.

320
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,880
Your spring kills happen.

321
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,400
It can happen on any day
probably except Friday Except Friday.

322
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,680
Right.

323
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,800
Because on Friday,
a lot of people, you know,

324
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,880
people are taking times off,
sometimes people doing the things

325
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,160
probably not on Friday,
but it's very, very common.

326
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,680
Guys use Sprint can start on Monday,
on Tuesday, on Wednesday.

327
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,000
On Thursday.
It does not have to be a monday.

328
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,200
Can be any day,
but most likely not Friday.

329
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
It's not Friday.

330
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,720
So now if you're going to talk about,
for example, let's say

331
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,760
let's take that, okay,
this is where our sprint starts, right?

332
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,920
And for example,

333
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,760
there was a sprint one
today is a sprint to.

334
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,200
Right.

335
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,240
And today's Tuesday,
I mean, today's Monday.

336
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,360
But let's pretend today's Tuesday, right?

337
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
On Tuesday.

338
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,720
So usually, guys,
what kind of meetings we're going to have

339
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,400
on the first day of the sprint

340
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,960
for you guys will be on Sunday.

341
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,360
So what are we going to have?

342
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,400
We're going to have a sprint planning,
right Sprint plan.

343
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,040
And what usually happens on the sprint
planning is

344
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,680
right.

345
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,240
So on this pre planning guys, remember,

346
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,280
it's not it's not maybe
I don't understand the term

347
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,920
general summary but I remember there's one
sprint planning, right?

348
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,080
You guys will be looking at that users
stories right.

349
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,040
So where those user stories are stored,
that's

350
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,960
the one that you have to look
for this particular sprint

351
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,440
behind your back.

352
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:55,280
Look what kind of backup.

353
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,760
There's a two type of backlogs.

354
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,720
We have.

355
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,240
We will be in this frame backlog, right?

356
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,280
So we'll be looking in this spring
when and you guys

357
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,520
will be looking at this sprint backlog
right?

358
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,080
That is spring backlog
because that's where we'll be

359
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,680
all the user stories
for this particular sprint.

360
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,400
Right.

361
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,720
And then Sprint one
also has its own sprint backlog.

362
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,360
Right.

363
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,280
But when we talk about all the user
stories, where all the user stories

364
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,520
story, that's

365
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,920
I will be

366
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,920
that will be a good refreshing
to the store in the product backlog.

367
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Right? The store in the product backlog.

368
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,400
Okay. I'll just put it.

369
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,920
This is just I'm
just trying to refresh your memory.

370
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Right? So sprint linear, right.

371
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,960
That's where you guys will be looking
at the user stories.

372
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,720
Right.

373
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:01,280
And in case if the estimation is not done
before, right.

374
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,000
You guys will be looking at user
stories, will be doing the estimation.

375
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,720
Right.

376
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And besides the estimation Right,
besides the estimation,

377
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,480
what else there needs to be done, guys, if

378
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,280
you estimate right, you put those points.

379
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,880
What else we do, guys, is priority

380
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,880
really priority guys, the user stories

381
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,680
that will be in the backlog,
they already prioritize, right?

382
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,400
They already prioritize tasks. Right.

383
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,640
Remember,
guys, you will be assigning a task, right?

384
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,720
For example, there will be user story.

385
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,080
One, two, three, right.

386
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,040
One, two, three,
whatever the user's going to say.

387
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,360
Right.

388
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,480
As an admin user, I should user
should be able to do this and this.

389
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,280
Right.

390
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,280
So now this user story, remember guys,

391
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,160
there's a tasks
has to be assigned to this user stories.

392
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,640
A task will be assigned
by developers, right?

393
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,560
Because developer going to pick the

394
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,000
the story
and the task will be assigned by you.

395
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,320
Right?

396
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,040
Because developers has to do his own job.

397
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,000
You guys will have to do your own job.

398
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,240
Right So everybody
but for this user story, remember

399
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,480
this user story has to be developed uses
story has to be tested, right?

400
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,000
So for those this user story,
a developer will be assigned

401
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,520
and so a developer and developer
and the tester will be assigned, right?

402
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,160
One dev, one tester,

403
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,120
maybe there will be two to this, right
in case of the user stories to be right.

404
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,960
And now developer
going to add his own tasks and you guys

405
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,600
will be adding your own tests. Right?

406
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,960
So that's what
we guys are trying to do in here as well.

407
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,440
Okay.

408
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,280
So for we're created, right?

409
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,200
Engineer, every group is having a project.

410
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,880
That's a project.

411
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,680
So what we did in here, guys,

412
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,960
you will see a user stories, okay,
you guys will see a user stories.

413
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,120
And I'm just doing an example on, on
one of the users on one of the projects.

414
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,440
Okay.

415
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,080
I think there's a 14 user stories,
14 user stories.

416
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,720
So what do we want you to do this?

417
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,280
Okay, What do we want you to do?

418
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,600
We want you remember
you doing it as a team, okay?

419
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,920
You doing it as a team.

420
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,240
You guys will have to look at all

421
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,920
user stories, every single user story.

422
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,080
Guys, it has an acceptance criteria, okay?

423
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,520
It has an acceptance criteria.

424
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,040
And in here, guys,
you will have to add your sap.

425
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,200
Right?

426
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,400
So this 14 user stories you guys need
to distribute and lot of your team

427
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,120
members, for example, right here,
you guys are 11 team members, right?

428
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,240
So at

429
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,080
each, each

430
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,520
team member have to pick one user story,
right?

431
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,320
You guys will be picking your own user
story that you want to work on, right?

432
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,240
Nobody at actual work,
nobody actually going to tell you,

433
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,400
hey, you pick in this, you pick
and that's where you are choosing, right?

434
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,360
You are choosing.

435
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,640
So whichever user story you are
comfortable, you guys are choosing.

436
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,000
And then here, for example, guys,
there's a seven people, right?

437
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,680
We have seven studios in here.

438
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,520
So we want you guys
at least to pick one user story.

439
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,720
And then if you're done with one,
if you guys want to do another one,

440
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,000
you more than welcome to pick it up. Okay.

441
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,920
But so what do you guys will have to do
as a team, Right, As a team

442
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,520
you guys will have together on the Zoom
call, you will have to go through

443
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,560
each and every single user story
and analyze it.

444
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,600
Right. And all users stories.

445
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,880
Of course,
they're related to which application

446
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,000
they're related to our it
your most obligation, right?

447
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,080
So majority majority of the user
stories will be related to

448
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,120
they will be related to change in details.

449
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,560
Okay. Change in details.

450
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,520
You guys will be working
on personal details, contact details.

451
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,880
You guys will be working in here.

452
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,320
In here, in here.

453
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,560
Okay.

454
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,400
So all this forms,
you guys will have to seal it up.

455
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,880
Okay, so based on the user story,
so one thing I'm going to ask you guys,

456
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
please
make sure when you were doing it, testing

457
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,080
when you will be automating,
please try to use a nice data, right?

458
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,160
Not like John. One,
two, three, four, five. Right.

459
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,160
Or just any name. Right.

460
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,680
Try to use a nice data because after this
project guys, whenever you are

461
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,480
moving to learn a databases, everything
that you guys will store right now,

462
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,560
you will see it in the database and later
you guys will be doing the API tests.

463
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,280
And so you want to make sure that you work
with that nice data, right?

464
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,040
You don't want to see a name
that has just 1 to 3.

465
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,720
Okay. So

466
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,400
in here I will explain your way away
as specified this spring.

467
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,200
Woman in here and

468
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,840
and sprinkling in separate right So

469
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,720
and all of you
this is what you will need to do right.

470
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,200
Usually usually of course guys

471
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,040
as spring will be starting right,
The spring will be started.

472
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,000
However, in here
we will ask you guys to start it yourself.

473
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,080
And it's very easy. You guys just will do.

474
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,520
Create a spring and then whatever user
stories you guys are going to pick, right?

475
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,240
You guys going to pick you guys
just moving it, right?

476
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,880
Guys just went in. Woman

477
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,240
And then you want to click on
Start Spring, just select that.

478
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,800
It's the one week end.

479
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Today will be a start date, right?

480
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,080
There will be a started
and then then there will be an end date.

481
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,120
Right. So now what you will do.

482
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,200
So technically, technically,
when we're look in here guys,

483
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,600
this is your product backlog,
right? Right.

484
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,040
This is where all the user stories.

485
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,120
Then you look at the user stories,
you analyze them.

486
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,920
Everybody should understand
every single user story

487
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,920
right then
and remember, guys, one understanding is

488
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,320
you looking at the user story,
you have to go to the application, right?

489
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,800
And then once you select your user stories

490
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,960
guys, then you pick them
and you move them, right?

491
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,840
You move them.

492
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,200
This is kind of like
will be your spring backlog

493
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,680
and then you guys are going to start.

494
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,600
Yeah, there's just one.

495
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,920
Remember guys, just select your team early
because your team lead should be

496
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,760
there
when it comes specially to the get case.

497
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,320
So select one team member.

498
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,520
So whenever
but this is will be your group discussion.

499
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,760
Remember this after me and was our done
explaining you how the project works.

500
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,640
You guys will drop from this class
and you guys will create your own zoom

501
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,560
links and you guys will be talking. Okay.

502
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,200
So now another guys term.

503
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
What we will look in here right?

504
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,600
Spring planning, right?

505
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,560
Usually it happens the very first day.

506
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,080
Not usually.

507
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,760
It always happens
on the very first day of this gets.

508
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,160
So now, guys, there's another meeting
that actually

509
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,520
happening.

510
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,240
It's a spring grooming.

511
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,120
What do you do?

512
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,560
What happens on the spring grooming days?

513
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Yes, guys,
you're not going to have a classes.

514
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,040
So we are giving you a time
so you guys can practice.

515
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,320
We are not going to disturb you
with the classes

516
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,680
so you guys can put your full hundred
percentage attention.

517
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:52,840
Spring grooming.

518
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,840
Mohammad, you getting confused?

519
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,080
That's another meeting.
What could have done better?

520
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,080
Spring grooming

521
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,720
at spring more.

522
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,080
It's kind of like helping poise
this spring, right?

523
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,880
I remember this spring grooming right
when we talk about spring grooming, it's

524
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,640
you are looking at the user stories.

525
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,800
You are looking at the user stories,
right?

526
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,760
You trying to groom those user stories?

527
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,200
What do we mean by groom user stories?

528
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,960
Grooming usually guys.

529
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,280
Okay.

530
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:50,080
Usually, for example, in here,
right in the middle of the spring one

531
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,760
right here,
we might have a spring grooming session

532
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,880
and that's where we will be looking at
the user stories,

533
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,600
maybe upcoming sprints
or maybe just overall sprints. Why?

534
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,160
We want to look at the user stories
prior to this spring, because we want to

535
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,160
we want to look at them
and to make sure that everybody

536
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,120
understands, they accept this criteria
and Tim is getting suggestion.

537
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,120
He maybe what about this this scenario?

538
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
What about this scenario? Okay.

539
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,560
So that's what are we actually looking
into those user stories

540
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,000
and trying to understand them. Right.

541
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,640
Trying to understand them.

542
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,600
And if the time permits, guys,
if the time permits in the company,

543
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,120
you guys might also do estimation. Okay.

544
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,360
If the time permits
and the team has a not that busy

545
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,760
if if there is a if there's a
if you guys are following the plan.

546
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,040
Right.

547
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,000
If there's an actual if if it's a per

548
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,680
if we think of the perfect spring,
this perfect spring, usually

549
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,560
all these stories should be groomed

550
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,280
before they come to the planning, right?

551
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,680
So user stories should be analyzed,

552
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,240
entire team should understand them
and estimate them.

553
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,160
So this way, when this user story
comes to the planning, right,

554
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,680
you guys already know
what is this user story about

555
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,000
and what it makes spring planning quicker.

556
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,440
And at the same time, what do we just go?

557
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,440
We just go
and we just add our tests in there.

558
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,120
Okay, So but there's no perfect things
exist when it comes to anything, right?

559
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,280
So that's why perfect Agile also does
not exist.

560
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,840
So sometimes you might come to the spring
planning, half user stories might be

561
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,480
already will be groomed and estimated,
and some of the user stories

562
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,640
wouldn't be estimated in this way
you will have to complete them

563
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
in during the spring.

564
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,280
Planning.

565
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,240
Not understandable.

566
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:58,800
Okay.

567
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,480
And it's they're not going to change it,
but they're going to do

568
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,080
you guys go and try to discuss
in case of there's

569
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,000
any missing details
he has been a product owner will be there.

570
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,080
They will take notes.

571
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,160
They will go back to the
they will check or maybe the

572
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,280
some technical discussion
needs to be there.

573
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,840
That's why devs are there. Right.

574
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,280
So to to clear all the
all the concerns that we have

575
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,440
and for example, there will be a part

576
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,520
where you will get a suggestion,
Hey guys, what about this?

577
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,200
And then what about this, this scenario?

578
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,200
If you're going to go this way, right,
you give your suggestion and then if B

579
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,480
defines it that, hey,
it's really something that we missed,

580
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,440
they going to add it
as a part of the acceptance criteria.

581
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,960
Right?

582
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,520
So we just want to make sure
that user story is completed, right?

583
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,800
Completed in terms of the defined so later

584
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,480
it can be developed and tested. Get.

585
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,640
So that's why in here
you guys we will mentioned first

586
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,400
right sprint do spring grooming.

587
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,120
Right.

588
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,080
Spring grooming means that's where
you understand the user stories, right?

589
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,600
You analyze, you understand. Right.

590
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,880
And if you can do the estimation, right.

591
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,800
We trying to do a perfect sprint, right?

592
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,360
You're trying to do a perfect sprint
and then you guys moved those.

593
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,320
You you guys will need to analyze
You can analyze all of them right?

594
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,560
So this way you guys can select
which one you want to pick, right?

595
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,800
You guys can do the estimation.

596
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,040
After you do the estimation, then whoever

597
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,160
if you guys are comfortable,
you just drag them to the spring planning.

598
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,880
You just move them to the sprint, Right?

599
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,000
You will move them in here,
you will start your sprint.

600
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,000
And what do you guys will do in here
right.

601
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,760
Once you know which user story you speak
and then you guys will be adding

602
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,880
your tasks.

603
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,200
Okay. Yep.

604
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,960
I did something.

605
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,960
Report or delete
that something is not needed.

606
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,560
Right. Okay.

607
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,080
So that will be the part
when you guys work with the user stories.

608
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,320
Right.

609
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:05,000
And then of course, once you start
and for you guys,

610
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,160
I think you guys future testers.

611
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,000
Okay, Future testers,
I'm going to start your sprint by later.

612
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Guys, please make sure you add more users.

613
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,440
Actually, let me show you on other teams.

614
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,160
Let me see.

615
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,280
Oh, finish. Right.

616
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,160
So there's this four columns
you guys going to have, right?

617
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,600
So remember the moment you guys are going
to start your sprint, all the user

618
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:39,000
stories will be into do York will be into
the moment you assign a person.

619
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,960
Remember there's you can assign yourself
right once you look in the store

620
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,120
and make sure you assign it
to yourself. Right.

621
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,880
Because you will want to know that this is
you working on this user story.

622
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,680
So the moment you guys start doing it,
make sure you move it to

623
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,720
the progress, right?

624
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,640
Because so this way entire team knows.

625
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,480
You start working on it, right?

626
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,640
You start working on it

627
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,640
and you will you will start adding
your task.

628
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,880
You will assign it to yourself. Right.

629
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,200
And also, guys, it's important.

630
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,920
Okay?

631
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,640
You guys will be creating a
you create a step test, right?

632
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,680
So remember, guys, this gear, right?

633
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,920
Why do we call it
a it's a it's a management tool.

634
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,960
It's a management tool.

635
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,960
So entire team is looking in here.

636
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,400
Your product owner,
your Scrum Master BS is there.

637
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,360
Everybody is looking at, right?

638
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:39,600
So we want to see the progress
because every day, guys, there's a need.

639
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,560
And what kind of meeting is there
every day, guys.

640
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,800
Okay, stand up. Right, Stand up.

641
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,800
So what will happen on the stand up
and who usually in

642
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,960
Let me see Farhad I so I saw a question.

643
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,200
I'll come back to a question.

644
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,480
Who usually runs this stand up

645
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,800
a scrum muster?

646
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,600
Luckily the Scrum master. Right.

647
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Remember Scrum Master always always
in charge into those meetings, right?

648
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,920
It does not mean that Scrum Master will

649
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,160
or will participate
in the estimation or planning.

650
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,440
Right.

651
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,880
But it's if it's role of the Scrum master
to set up those meetings.

652
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,520
Right.

653
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,720
It's the role of the Scrum master
in invite all of you.

654
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,320
Right.

655
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,840
And it's a role of Scrum Master
especially when it comes to the spend up.

656
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,480
Right.

657
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,840
So usually, I mean, these days, of course,
you guys will be joining on Zoom and

658
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,600
and whenever
we used to work in the offices.

659
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:41,960
Right.

660
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,880
The Scrum master, everybody just gathers
or you guys will be joined in the zoom.

661
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,160
Right.

662
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,680
This grand master just opens
and everybody's seen this board, right?

663
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,200
This is the board of the entire team.

664
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,920
So team knows.
Okay, this story already interesting.

665
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,280
This story is still in the progress.
Right.

666
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,640
And usually in progress is this when
developers are also working on it, Right.

667
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,600
In our case,
all user stories already developed.

668
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:03,920
Right.

669
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,440
And you just guys have to test them. Okay.

670
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,560
But it's important guys to move them all
the time.

671
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,200
It's important to move them on time,
especially when you are done.

672
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,440
Especially when you are done.

673
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,400
Because remember this

674
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,880
when you are done with the user story,
right?

675
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,200
When you are done with this user story,

676
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,960
remember guys,
there is some kind of like graph we have.

677
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,360
What kind of what kind of graph
we have endured that shows

678
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,440
our work

679
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,880
burned down chart, right?

680
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,840
Burn down chart.

681
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:59,400
And what a burned down chart shows this.

682
00:37:59,400 --> 00:37:59,640
Okay.

683
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,960
What do we have on the on the vertical
and on the horizontal line?

684
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,640
It shows the progress.

685
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:18,720
It shows the progress.

686
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:18,960
Right.

687
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,640
So here it will show you a days right
here.

688
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,520
We'll show you the user stories. Right.

689
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,240
A perfect a perfect burn down
chart should look like that

690
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,120
on the day Number one, of course,
there's all user stories,

691
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,480
but the more down the spring goes,

692
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,320
the more user stories left, right.

693
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,760
And we don't want to see something
like that.

694
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,760
All user stories there, there, there.

695
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,840
And then boom, Why?

696
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,600
Why they're there
because you forgot to update

697
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,640
and then and then your burn down
chart goes like that.

698
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:51,880
Right?

699
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,680
So that's why I have to make sure
the moment user story is done

700
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,840
in does effects that chart.

701
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,280
Okay.

702
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,080
And usually Scrum Score is going to look
into this is going to look at that chart.

703
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,840
So make sure you move them on time.

704
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,520
Right.
Make sure you move them one time. Okay.

705
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,320
So after you guys analyze user stories,

706
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,040
estimate them,
drag them to your sprint, right?

707
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,240
And then

708
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,160
assign the team member, assign it,
and then you guys create the tasks, right?

709
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,000
You guys create a task usually, right?

710
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,280
Yeah.

711
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,400
It will be automatically.

712
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,240
Yep, it will be automatic. Yep.

713
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,800
So and usually right the moment

714
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,920
the sprint starts, remember this
developers start working on that, right?

715
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
Because when you own the

716
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,520
when you own the actual project,
something has to be developed, right?

717
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,360
And the developers
depend on the size of the user story.

718
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,840
Right? But they tried to be cool.

719
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,000
So some small user stories at first
so they can give some work to testers

720
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
as well, right? They will. They will.

721
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,680
They will fix some small user stories,
big user stories, medium user stories,

722
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,800
but they want to make sure they don't
leave all the testing at the end, Right.

723
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,920
That's why they
they will start mixing those user stories.

724
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,400
But whenever a developer is finished,
right,

725
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,240
whenever developer is finished
with the user story,

726
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,680
right, whenever they develop,
whenever they perform the unit testing,

727
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,720
once they see everything is working fine,
then they move

728
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,920
the user story to interesting
writing you the user story in testing,

729
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,960
and in our case, of course, guys,
we don't have a developer is right.

730
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,080
So what do you guys will do?

731
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,240
You guys will move it yourself, right?

732
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,600
So but while you are being in progress
right.

733
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,240
Why is being in progress?

734
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,360
Guess what you guys will start doing.

735
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,160
You guys will start doing air
mental test cases, right?

736
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,960
You guys will have to create
a manual test case.

737
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,480
And you in this situation, as if you want
to practice, it means excel.

738
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,240
You guys are more than welcome
to create a test case in Excel

739
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,680
or if you guys just want to write
right away your cucumber set your file.

740
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,200
It's also totally fine.

741
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,240
So depend on you guys, right?

742
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,200
So majority of the times guys, of course,
when we work, when the cucumber projects

743
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,440
they do, I mean,
whenever we follow this BDD approach,

744
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,080
this feature files, they do so they do.

745
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,960
They do play a role
as a manual test cases.

746
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,840
Right. So would you throw
this is just for the refreshment.

747
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
You guys want to do Excel,
that's up to you.

748
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,800
But cucumber feature file should be
should be enough, right?

749
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,120
Okay. So

750
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,000
can we use JIRA?

751
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,920
Okay, in here,

752
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,880
guys, That's one thing that we don't have
the latest version of JIRA.

753
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,560
There's there's a little version of gear
that is JIRA, X-ray.

754
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,840
That's where you guys can actually read
your test cases right in here.

755
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,240
Guys, we don't have this option.

756
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,120
So this way, if you will. Right?

757
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,120
Whenever you ride your camera,

758
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,920
IQ camera, feature flag,
you can just upload it in here for us.

759
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,880
So we can we can look at a look into it.

760
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,320
But whenever you guys done right,
whenever you guys done

761
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,800
preparing and writing the manual,
this is a moment.

762
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,880
You ready The moment you're ready to test,
make sure you move it

763
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,160
into the testing right.

764
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,480
Make sure you guys move it to the testing.

765
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,240
And now when it comes to testing,
remember, guess always, always, always.

766
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,400
We have to do a mental testing, right?

767
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,320
We're not going to jump right away
and do the automation.

768
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,600
Okay.

769
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:46,920
So why we don't want to do automation
right away?

770
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,720
Yeah, you want to make sure that use
this door is going to pass, right?

771
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,560
You're not going to start automation
or something that fails.

772
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,320
Right.

773
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,840
And at the same time,
I think going guys to develop

774
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,400
automation scripts, of course,
user story can be very easy, right?

775
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,080
They can take very little time.

776
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,920
But think of that user story
that will take a lot of efforts, right?

777
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,400
What if you would take one or two days?

778
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,160
So now one or two days,
you did not tested manually.

779
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,960
You were trying to do the automation
and then you automation skills

780
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,800
and now you find out
that there is a bug, right?

781
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,680
So now you will have to report it,
but you wasted two days, right?

782
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,480
So that's why it's important.

783
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,000
The moment user story
comes into the testing,

784
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,680
you have to make sure you test it
manually.

785
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,920
You see, if it's passed,
then you continue with the automation.

786
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,520
If it does not pass,
you have to send it back to the developer.

787
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,640
Hey, this user story is failing, right?

788
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,400
So this way they can start working on it
right this day, they can start working.

789
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,600
It fixes any issues and
then give it back to you once they fix it.

790
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,280
Right?

791
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,160
So the same thing we want you to do
as you want you to do that

792
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,800
manual testing, right? Manual testing.

793
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,480
And only then you guys
will be starting automation only.

794
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,840
Only then you guys will be starting
automation.

795
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,560
Okay.

796
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,000
I just said you have deer, right?

797
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,360
Everything is reported in Jurgis.

798
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,480
No, no, no.
Everything's reported. India and

799
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,480
you guys just reported there

800
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,920
and in actual companies guys also,
it will depend, right?

801
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,720
It will depend.

802
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,600
You will of course your quick you manage

803
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,960
management will push you into log
in all the bugs.

804
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,120
However sometimes there's
there's some bugs there can be very tiny

805
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,840
and small
right sometimes to fix something for

806
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,960
and for a developer,
sometimes it takes 10 minutes max.

807
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,280
Right.

808
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,840
And by time your report the actual bug,
it might take you 30 minutes

809
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,760
because you have to
you have to retest to take the screenshot

810
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,640
steps to represent to to, to reproduce
and all this.

811
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,160
Right.

812
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,960
So sometimes I remember in my work
if the bug was a little small in

813
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,120
and you know when you in the office
environment that just told my developer

814
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,000
hey can you quickly

815
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,840
fix it right so and they're okay
and they fix it within 10 minutes.

816
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,000
Right. So but that will come

817
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,640
that you guys will know
once you join the actual project.

818
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Okay so but usually usually
we try to log in in in our

819
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,800
in my last company
where I work developer hours we had a

820
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,880
we had a

821
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,520
thing is a developer something can be
quickly done within the same day

822
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,800
we were not reporting it in the however,
there was

823
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
something that we were not able to do
within the same day.

824
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,440
Then we were reporting it.

825
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,880
Okay, so but that comes from project
to project and it also comes from

826
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,160
you about your relationship
with your developers, right?

827
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,320
At the same time, remember,
guys, developers don't like to to see

828
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,920
what you report, but right, they, they,
they trying to do their work

829
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,400
and the thing that they do in it
everything amazing however we do find bugs

830
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,160
right so they try to do their work
with trying to do our work right.

831
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:24,040
But usually you guys,
you will have to look. Yes.

832
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:24,360
Right.

833
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,840
So user story, for example,
let's look at this user story, right?

834
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,320
It is.

835
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,560
As an admin, I should be able to change
employee contact details.

836
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,200
Right.

837
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:39,600
So developer already developed this user
story that's why we have seen it in here.

838
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,520
Right?
So then you go in here, contact details.

839
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,240
Okay, let me see what my user says
or my user story says.

840
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,160
So is in here right?

841
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,680
Except this criteria fallen field
must be displayed and edible.

842
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,840
Editable. Right.

843
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,720
And then you just verify
that all the skills are in there right?

844
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,000
To just verify that all it fills in there.

845
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,600
You click on edit,
you seal it up everything, right?

846
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,000
And then you click on Save.

847
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,920
It's working. It's saved. Okay.

848
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,000
It's passed right and it's passed.

849
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,760
And then once it's passed, once
you see that

850
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,520
those details have been saved, then
you just moving towards your automation.

851
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,800
Get in.

852
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,760
There was one question
one moment from for HUD.

853
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,120
Okay. Okay.

854
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,360
So for HUD, Yes.

855
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,560
If you guys are ten people, right?

856
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,160
If you guys are ten people.

857
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,600
So each of you guys just pick
one user story at first, right?

858
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,160
Pick one user story it first, analyze it,
and then if you guys have time.

859
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,240
And then if some of you wants to be extra
user stories, you guys can do it.

860
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,080
However, you don't required.

861
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,320
But we what
we want everyone to do at least

862
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,640
one user story. Okay

863
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,960
when do you moment tested?

864
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,240
Whenever you finish, whenever you
finish writing and then or test case

865
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,320
right the moment you're ready
to start actual testing

866
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,440
then you move it,
then you move it into testing.

867
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,000
And once you manual test it, once
you guys are

868
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,120
meet, automation is passed, automate it.

869
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,360
Only then you guys be moving it to them.

870
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,040
Okay, moving into that.

871
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,240
Okay.

872
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,400
So this process, this process, we want do.

873
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,720
And of course, guys, we
you guys will be talking to each other

874
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,400
every single day, right?

875
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,720
Because you guys will have you guys
besides this.

876
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,080
You guys are of course, we'll have to
do a framework which I will talk about it.

877
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:34,800
Okay.

878
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,400
And which I will talk about it
and make sure, guys,

879
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,440
every day when you gather guys practice
to do a stand up.

880
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,720
Right.

881
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,040
So what do we talk about on the stand
up this

882
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,560
right every single day?

883
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:49,840
Right.

884
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,560
So there's a for example,

885
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,440
if it's a ten working days, right spring,
there is two weeks, right?

886
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,520
Then here will be another spring,
three story, right?

887
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,160
So far, this is half right.

888
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,880
So here should be fast
then. That was done, right?

889
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,800
Three or five.

890
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,440
And here.

891
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,640
One, two, three, four, five. Okay.

892
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,760
Maybe on the first day

893
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,760
you're needed because you will be doing
this pre-planning in there.

894
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,360
Okay, So

895
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,680
You give given your update. Right.

896
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,160
And we just give an update.

897
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,960
And remember, guys, it's
not a day to give like to management.

898
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,440
You just giving an update
to your own team. Right.

899
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,520
Hey, I'm working on this. Right.

900
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,760
What I have done yesterday, right.

901
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,080
What I will be working on today
and in case

902
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,120
if I have any,
I can guess of the hammer and the issues.

903
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,240
So every single day we have our daily
stand

904
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:46,240
up, daily stand up, daily stand up right.

905
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,880
And how long is a daily stand up?

906
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:53,960
Usually guys, next 15 minutes, right, Max?

907
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,680
15 minutes.

908
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:00,080
Sometimes guys, it's even can be shorter
depending on the size of your team.

909
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,440
Right.

910
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,680
Also depend on
the size of work has been done.

911
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:04,960
Right.

912
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,920
Think of guys
after the very first day, right?

913
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,840
This is your second day.

914
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,920
So in the second day, team
cannot give that much of updates.

915
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,160
Right. What's your update?

916
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,520
It just spring planning beginning now
with right.

917
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,600
Developers will say that they start
working on such a such a user story

918
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,760
and you just going to say that
hey I started

919
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,640
I start writing my test cases, right
that that's pretty much an update

920
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,000
but here we'll update will be different
right developers will say

921
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,880
that the finish user story
the moved it then you start testing it

922
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,800
then that will be
that will be a little bit longer.

923
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,000
Right.

924
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,960
But that's usually no longer
than 15 minutes.

925
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,880
We try to keep it no longer
but could it be there.

926
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,960
Remember this perfect things are don't
exist right So could it be the longer.

927
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,280
Of course it could be longer. Right.

928
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,560
Okay.

929
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,080
So and what happens
at the end of the spring?

930
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,320
So let's say
this is the last day of this print.

931
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,560
Last date, right? That day number.

932
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,360
If it's a work in the right, we will
we will be counting working days.

933
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,600
So this is a day, number ten, right?

934
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,200
So if we started on Tuesday,
this will be day number

935
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,840
ten and it will be our Wednesday
and Wednesday.

936
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,800
So this way,

937
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,040
the next spring will start in here
and it will be another Tuesday in here.

938
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:36,120
Okay, Spring Retrospective, Spring Review.

939
00:51:36,120 --> 00:52:08,800
What's the difference?

940
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,840
Okay, so

941
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,080
it's personal things.

942
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:13,440
Okay.

943
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,400
So remember, there's usually
in the morning, right On the last day

944
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,680
in the morning, maybe around ten, 11.

945
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,520
Right. So what are we going to have?

946
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:28,760
We're going to have we call it
spring review or we call it a spring demo.

947
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,320
Right. Spring demo.

948
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,880
So spring demo, we're showing our work
to the client.

949
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,560
Right.

950
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:39,880
What kind of work has been done
for the past two weeks?

951
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,280
Right.

952
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,120
Or in our case, for the past
ten working days.

953
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,160
Right. But it's a two week spring, right?

954
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,360
So and usually this meeting
is it's usually

955
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:51,400
about four one hour, one hour.

956
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,920
And here you guys will see entire team
besides besides the scrum team,

957
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,600
there will be there will be a
is my battery day.

958
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,840
There will be project manager designers.

959
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,720
Every everybody will
come in there to get feedback.

960
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,400
And then after that, of course,
there's the

961
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,640
then the last day
we're going to have our spring retro.

962
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,600
Okay, so what do we talk about
on the spring Retro.

963
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,360
Okay, so wouldn't you

964
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:41,800
success

965
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,320
and those right so we will go Yep we'll
talk about what one Well what went wrong

966
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,960
which things we should continuously doing

967
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,400
we which don't think that's one wrong
which

968
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,600
which we should improve and make sure
it doesn't happen with the next screen.

969
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,560
Right. It's it's it's learning.

970
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,480
So the same thing as we want you to do
after you guys finished, right after

971
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,600
you guys finish with everything,
we want you to do a spring retrospective.

972
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,040
So you guys as a team, right?

973
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,960
It will be your first time
when you guys will be working together.

974
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,760
When it comes to the automation
using GitHub, the same GitHub

975
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,600
together and developing things, right?

976
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,440
So you guys will talk about,
hey, what was to us?

977
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,000
What things do you guys maybe next time
we should do, do, do better, right?

978
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,440
So this is when it comes to this,

979
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,720
this is
when it comes to the sprint, right?

980
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,240
So now there's another part.

981
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,040
Another part.

982
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,720
I guess what? We want you to do this.

983
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,320
We want you to develop a framework
from scratch, okay?

984
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,680
We want you to do it from scratch.

985
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,120
So we want you to gather the same thing.

986
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,760
Remember this.

987
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,040
And now it's a team work.

988
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,080
It's not just Hallmark.

989
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,400
Pick it up and develops everything.

990
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,160
Know this.

991
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,800
So remember before you going to start
in actual automation?

992
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,840
This. So this way you guys can decide.

993
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:11,720
Maybe you will analyze all the user
stories first and then start working.

994
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,440
Or sometimes what students do, they,
they first discuss this

995
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,720
framework, develop framework
and make sure they set up the baseline in.

996
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,920
Only then they must do
the user stories right.

997
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,320
So we want you to

998
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,960
develop a framework from scratch
because you will have to gather together.

999
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,080
You guys will need to analyze
every single part.

1000
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:35,120
We want to make sure every single team
member does understand

1001
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,640
what is framework is doing right
is, for example, it's ten of you, right?

1002
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,800
So you guys will discuss, okay,
this part of our framework.

1003
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:47,520
We need this in this and try guys please
the best part guys also

1004
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:53,480
try and I don't want you to copy and paste
anything else we want you to develop

1005
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,560
every single method from this crisis
the way you did it before.

1006
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,840
Okay, so this way, guys.

1007
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,320
It will be amazing practice for you. Okay?

1008
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,280
For example, you guys will take now while
I'm going to to take our

1009
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,120
our configs reader, I'm going I'm

1010
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,920
going
I'm going to create that that that, that.

1011
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,200
Okay.

1012
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,480
And then tomorrow
okay I'll work on the Excel right

1013
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,040
And then how you will work
on creating something else.

1014
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:22,560
Right.

1015
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,400
You know features, not features as well
I guess features will start

1016
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,320
when you guys actually will start doing
the actual automation common

1017
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:30,960
methods, right?

1018
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,880
Multiple people can work on the common
methods, right?

1019
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,200
Okay.

1020
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,400
No guys, this is setting out framework.

1021
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,960
Structure is one thing.

1022
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,760
Automating user story
that's a different thing, right?

1023
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,040
That's a different thing.

1024
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:51,080
So you guys, we want you to do a framework
together, right?

1025
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,480
We want you to everyone should contribute.

1026
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,520
And then once you have your framework
set right, once you guys have frameworks

1027
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,680
and if you guys want to do the pages,

1028
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,880
at least the beginning pages,
you guys know you will need a login page.

1029
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,920
You guys know
you will need the dashboard page,

1030
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,160
you guys need
you will need a boys page, right?

1031
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,400
It will be your base skeleton.

1032
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,560
You guys can distribute it, right?

1033
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,240
And then once you combine, you call this.

1034
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,960
Once you combine,
you could because remember, Aisha,

1035
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,560
you will be doing it on your laptop, on
extender you will be doing on your laptop.

1036
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,040
Then you guys will have to merge.

1037
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,720
You could write and then once you merge
you, then you guys will have to take it

1038
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,120
right after Merge and every single team
have to have that structure.

1039
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,040
You guys will be working on your own.

1040
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:35,760
On your own.

1041
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,720
Oh, how do we call them in GitHub?

1042
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,920
Speak my mind right now. Branches. Right?

1043
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,320
You guys will be working on your own
branches, right?

1044
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,920
So this way guys, it will be amazing

1045
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,120
experience for you
to review everything you have learned

1046
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,160
and to have an opportunity
to actually develop it from scratch.

1047
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,520
Try to do every single thing right.

1048
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,880
Somebody's going to start off

1049
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,360
setting up the name
and somebody is going to add independency.

1050
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,520
So you guys will decide how to do it
right.

1051
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,360
Once you gather together,
you guys will be decided to do

1052
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,600
it. Well, that's that you guys,

1053
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,280
you guys should be
should be able to do it a lot of times.

1054
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,640
A lot of times.

1055
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,800
So try to help each other.

1056
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,320
Guys, this is most important.

1057
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,000
Why are we going to be there?

1058
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yes, but you guys should be able to try

1059
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,600
with resolve it together
when it comes to actual work.

1060
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:27,960
Right.

1061
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,800
Remember this, your first number, Help,
of course, will be Google.

1062
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:37,400
But then and number two to help
will be your all teammates in there.

1063
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:37,760
Right.

1064
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,000
If you have two or three,
are there automation engineers?

1065
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,120
You guys will have to talk together
and you guys will have

1066
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,280
will help each other if you go into stock.

1067
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,680
Of course, guys, we will be there. Okay.

1068
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,040
You guys will be there.

1069
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,200
So this way, guys.

1070
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:57,640
Remember framework that from scratch
and then you guys will do an actual

1071
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,640
and then of course, once you guys peak
user stories, then you guys will be

1072
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,760
you guys will need your own pages,
you guys will need your own elements,

1073
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,000
but at least the skeleton will be there.

1074
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,840
Okay? Skeleton will be there. So

1075
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,720
that right And Watson will guide you guys

1076
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,200
that will guide you
because remember, we are trying to do it

1077
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,000
as it's actually
you guys going to have at your work.

1078
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:25,320
Right?

1079
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:29,560
So all the repositories will be on our

1080
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,840
on our on our GitHub, right?

1081
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,320
That's the same thing if you join,
for example, Bank of America, right?

1082
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,680
Bank of America
going to have its own repository

1083
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,720
where all the projects
will be there, Right?

1084
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,880
And then usually when you join
the company, they will send you an email

1085
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:51,640
and you guys will have to create it
and they will give you access to it.

1086
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:52,200
Right?

1087
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,080
So the same thing, guys,
we will be giving you access

1088
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,040
to your team members, all your team
members, to your particular repository,

1089
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:13,520
to a specific specific repository.

1090
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,880
I mean, if you want,
do you more than welcome back out

1091
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,960
the exhibit, you guys can just
reconnect every time, right?

1092
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:24,000
So branches, branches, branches museum
this is

1093
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
we will will going to explain key branches
what I will explain.

1094
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,040
Okay And then what do we want guys?

1095
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,640
What do we want at the end?

1096
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,800
At the end after your user stories

1097
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,800
are automated,
every every single thing is done, guys.

1098
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,280
Right.

1099
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,680
When you do your retrospective,
what do you want you guys to do?

1100
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,840
We want you actually to draw your homework
or homework.

1101
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,920
So to draw your framework
and draw your framework in the way

1102
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,360
Android in the way you guys

1103
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,640
can actually look at it
and understand it, right?

1104
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,640
For example, we have seen our students
draw their framework.

1105
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,040
They split it based on packages.

1106
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,720
Some students are split
based on even some very,

1107
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,800
very details, like pages
and then common methods and this.

1108
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,200
And this and this. Okay.

1109
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,080
So can I show you this sample?

1110
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,560
Yes, I can show you this sample.

1111
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,160
So the but the same thing, guys.

1112
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,840
Try to do it together. Right.

1113
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:29,920
Try to do together because this particular
framework you guys will be using, it's

1114
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,760
related to describing.

1115
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,800
Okay. So it will be very important.

1116
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:39,480
And you guys should understand how
the actual actual framework that works.

1117
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,080
But once you guys develop it,
once you guys work on it together,

1118
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,200
it will be easy for you and it will clear
a lot of a lot of things for you.

1119
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,000
Okay,

1120
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,120
I'm sure you guys,
you guys can do it right?

1121
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,680
You guys are working together
now, not together as a team.

1122
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,920
So a lot of you guys will help each other.

1123
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,480
You guys will help each other.

1124
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,320
Okay, So let me see.

1125
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,120
Guys, what are we doing in here?

1126
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,360
You see all the user stories

1127
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:12,600
you guys will do?

1128
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,520
Spring grooming, spring planning
on the list, each part of the framework.

1129
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,440
Right? Create a framework.

1130
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,080
You will created from scratch.

1131
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,280
Don't copy and paste. Right.

1132
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,760
Help each other.

1133
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,480
Okay. So

1134
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,920
ago, guys,
this is what we want to make sure.

1135
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,440
Right.

1136
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,640
Make sure you guys have a met.

1137
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:35,160
That's okay.

1138
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,480
Make sure you guys,
I want you to develop a methods

1139
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,840
that can handle radio buttons, checkboxes,

1140
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,280
dropdowns, alerts, frames.

1141
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,400
Right. Frames, windows.

1142
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,560
So make sure there's the code

1143
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,400
after you guys will
I will give you this Google document that.

1144
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,000
So what will happen? Right?

1145
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,240
Whenever you guys will be done
with all the users

1146
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,320
stories when they were
automation is completed, right?

1147
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,520
So what do you guys will do?

1148
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,520
You guys combine it, right?

1149
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,120
So you guys eventually will push it.

1150
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,000
You guys will push it to one
branch, right?

1151
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,400
Because that's how it should be, right?

1152
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,800
It actually work.

1153
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:19,680
You will have multiple people
working on the user stories automated,

1154
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,600
but in the end, after everything works,
everything has to be

1155
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,880
pushed and on one branch in our work
should be there.

1156
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:27,400
Right?

1157
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,560
So in once entire work is there, I guess

1158
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,880
make sure your code is executable
through Maven.

1159
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,400
So make sure guys,
your code generates reports.

1160
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,280
You guys already know those cucumber.

1161
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,840
Nice reports, right?

1162
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,160
And screenshots. Okay.

1163
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,920
And make sure all the user stories
that you pick.

1164
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,240
Right.

1165
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:49,440
They are automated in,
they are on the GitHub and here Android.

1166
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,600
That's why guys at first we tell you pick
at least

1167
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,640
one user story
because it's it's meaty thing

1168
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,640
you're going to do fast
but just because it requires a team effort

1169
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,760
right This might take some time
but I promise you guys once

1170
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:09,520
you actually do it together,
I'll ask you guys next week, how was it?

1171
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,720
And I'm sure you guys
you guys will learn a lot.

1172
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,320
Okay.

1173
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,080
And of course guys and kids
or any questions.

1174
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,960
But remember, first you discuss it
together, is the team

1175
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,640
send them in the support channel

1176
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:26,680
kids in supporting so and a few things

1177
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,000
guys a few things one wait one second

1178
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:35,280
charger just switch from the charger
to stream. Yep.

1179
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,320
So a few things, guys.

1180
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,600
Let me show you a little

1181
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:50,400
bit of the user stories.

1182
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:50,720
Okay.

1183
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,840
We will do our review class this
we will go or we will do a review class

1184
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:58,800
right on our on the project to talk about

1185
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,640
maybe maybe next Monday.

1186
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,320
That's what we will try to do, right.

1187
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,160
That we will look at the time.

1188
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,080
Okay.

1189
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,960
So one thing let me clarify this.

1190
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,280
There's a few users talk to one couple
user stories I want you to clarify.

1191
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,080
Okay. I want to clarify.

1192
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,120
So is is fine.

1193
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,160
Multiple dependance. It's fine.

1194
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:27,000
Or employees work
and then we should be able to me implement

1195
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:34,120
different skills.

1196
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:34,960
Okay.

1197
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:38,360
So now when you guys look in here, right,
I want you to look in here.

1198
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,040
So there are very similar.

1199
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:46,320
So when you look at the user story
number seven, eight and 910,

1200
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,320
11/12, okay,
they look similar, but they are different.

1201
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:56,640
So user story number seven
and also guys, what you will see

1202
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,600
we wrote
user stories except this criteria.

1203
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,120
We ordered two different ways.

1204
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:08,320
Okay, so some except this criteria guys
we wrote using a working right

1205
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:13,160
and some users stories don't have a great
because a different project

1206
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,920
you guys my experience different that's
why we tried to put it two different ways

1207
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,480
okay in some project

1208
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,520
these if they're not work
and they will be writing it in Gurgaon,

1209
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,560
but in some projects they just going
to put it in the form of bullet points.

1210
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,440
Okay, so what's the difference between
user stories?

1211
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,000
Seven, eight, nine, ten write,
make sure you follow the steps right?

1212
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:38,640
Give an admin user is logged
in when admin navigates to qualifications.

1213
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:38,920
Right.

1214
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,440
This is about user story number seven.

1215
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,680
You have to go to the qualifications
you logging in

1216
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,000
as admin,
you will go to the qualifications

1217
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,960
and then what it says in here, here

1218
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:57,440
qualifications and then select skills.

1219
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,000
Then admin is able to add
any skills, right?

1220
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,240
So this is what it talks about.

1221
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:08,320
So you go to the admin, you go to
the qualifications, you click on skills.

1222
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:09,320
Okay?

1223
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,760
And here you need to add the skills.

1224
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,160
For example. Amazing.

1225
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:19,000
Just in skills, right?

1226
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,160
Skills.

1227
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,800
I did not save it,
didn't get said need not stated.

1228
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,600
Let me show you
what I'm trying to actually

1229
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,560
okay this but I'm going to speak right so
and then of course

1230
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:34,200
you guys will have to work from this table
that you are,

1231
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,960
that your skill is saved
and your skill and safe.

1232
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,320
Now the user story number eight,

1233
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:47,040
it says as an admin user
should be able to add employee skills.

1234
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,800
So it means now after this use

1235
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,720
has been added, actually added.

1236
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,040
Now these skills can be actually

1237
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,640
actually assigned to the employee.

1238
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,080
Right.

1239
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,720
So the employee.

1240
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,640
And now where do we talk about employee?

1241
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,360
We talk about employee
when we come in here.

1242
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,120
Okay.

1243
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,560
When we come in here
and you guys will have to go

1244
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,840
to the qualifications and here.

1245
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:19,800
When you click on skills,
you click on ADD.

1246
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:24,600
And now you able to see
because without user story

1247
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,720
number seven, guys, amazing skills
you will be able to see.

1248
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:32,880
Okay, so let me see
if I'm going to delete it right now.

1249
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,880
Let me delete my amazing skills

1250
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,520
building the little

1251
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,520
okay now is deleted.

1252
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:52,080
Now I won't be able to select them here.

1253
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:57,440
Okay, so now you're going to click
on Skills and there's no amazing testing.

1254
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,240
Yes, they are dependent.

1255
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,280
You see guys two different things.

1256
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,560
At first from the admin side,

1257
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,920
you have to add them to a system itself.

1258
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,400
Once something is in the system

1259
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,640
all then you can actually assign it
to the employee.

1260
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,200
And this is related to user story,
seven eight.

1261
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:24,000
The same thing for user story number
nine and ten, you have to add it first

1262
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,640
in this way here, except this criterion
that we give to where you have to go,

1263
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,640
and then once you are able to add it,
only then you can assign it, right?

1264
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,560
Maybe I'll change word.
It should be assign. It is an admin.

1265
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,840
I should be able to assign employees
licenses.

1266
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,040
Okay. It's not at the site.

1267
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,640
It does.

1268
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,920
And so seven eight has a dependency
on seven,

1269
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,920
ten has a dependency on nine,
12 has a dependency on 11.

1270
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,880
I mean, not like a dependency, right?
You still can do it.

1271
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,520
But this is just to show you
that they are different.

1272
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,120
Okay?

1273
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,240
If they're something be added
in through the qualifications only then

1274
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:09,960
it can be assigned to the employee's
qualifications is adding it to the system.

1275
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,080
And this is assignment to the employee.

1276
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,200
Okay. All right.

1277
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,000
And I think that was for user stories.

1278
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,440
And of course, guys, I'm going to share
this with you, going to share as things if

1279
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,640
any questions,
guess how to work with the GitHub.

1280
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:37,840
Amazon was going to explain you.

1281
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,080
I will
I will share examples of doing this.

1282
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,320
I want you to let me see, for example,
and let me find it.

1283
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,920
It's always good

1284
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,200
or thing I say.

1285
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:06,840
Let me see, I can go to the rest of this.

1286
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:10,480
For example, this is
I don't know if you guys can see it.

1287
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,320
This is what. Student Oops.

1288
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,440
I don't know if you guys can see it.

1289
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,480
Freeze it. Oh,

1290
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,160
okay.

1291
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,640
This is a students from previous batch.

1292
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,080
This is how they do it.

1293
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,040
Let me see.

1294
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,640
I have another ones.

1295
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:31,440
This is another one.

1296
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:32,720
This is another students.

1297
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,720
This is how they do this new utils. What?

1298
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,360
What kind of pages?
They have features them.

1299
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,080
They finished. Right.

1300
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,400
This is what another students did and then

1301
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,840
let me see that they want everything
in all of them.

1302
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,320
Okay, so this is should be something
that you guys understand.

1303
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,640
Okay. This is this is for your team.

1304
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,200
This is something that you guys should
understand because we will be using it.

1305
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,480
We will be using it. Close it. Now.

1306
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,760
It's needed.

1307
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,640
So we

1308
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,160
select

1309
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,080
I'll I'll this all upload.

1310
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:20,120
If you guys did not see it
I'll just I'll just

1311
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,320
uploaded in the course announcement
as an example.

1312
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,320
As an example.

1313
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,000
Yeah. I'm on the big screen.

1314
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I'm sorry guys,
but I tried to make it bigger.

1315
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,280
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll share it,
I'll share.

1316
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:31,920
Okay.

1317
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,280
All right, guys.

1318
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:36,840
Right.

1319
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,040
So I think that thing
that's what I wanted to explain

1320
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,080
and let me just do as a recap, guys.

1321
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:43,800
Right.

1322
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,240
So as a recap, we created a framework
from scratch together as a team.

1323
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:55,200
One team member should speak which part
of the framework they want to work on.

1324
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:55,800
Right?

1325
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:59,360
And then you guys will have to combine
your framework, right?

1326
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:03,400
And then once you combine it,
then you guys all should take the combined

1327
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,480
code, right?

1328
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,480
And once you have that all, then

1329
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,920
you guys will start doing
the user story automation.

1330
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,760
But before the user story automation guys,

1331
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,040
you will have to do your own meetings,
right?

1332
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,400
You will have to do a spring room
in analyzing user stories.

1333
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:22,840
Then you guys will have do this
pre planning where you guys pick

1334
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,680
your user stories
and assign your tasks, right?

1335
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,720
And then before the automation
you guys would want to write your manual.

1336
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,080
Just case right.
You guys will have to read your manual

1337
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,000
this case
and you guys will have to test it.

1338
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:38,120
And if user story passed
in majority of them,

1339
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,320
there will be positives
because it's already in application.

1340
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,440
Only then you guys will be started
doing the automation.

1341
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:44,840
Okay,

1342
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:47,880
Framework, manual automation, right.

1343
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,000
And all together
this would we doing it together, right.

1344
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,800
We're doing it together
and help each other make sure this

1345
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,760
if you're stuck somewhere,
help each other, try to jump on the call.

1346
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,480
Right.

1347
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:04,880
So there won't be any classes, guys,
until I think until Sunday, right.

1348
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,200
Until Sunday. There is no classes, guys.

1349
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,800
So we tried to give you from today
and because we started today,

1350
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,880
five working days.

1365
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,400
in there that you guys
will have to do some pushing, pull.

1366
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:03,240
You guys are experts in it,
so you guys will be able to do it.

1367

Right.

1371
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,720
That we will share about
when it comes to the automation.

1372
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,200
But mostly guys,
you will be able to check with yourself

1373
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,080
if you automated all the user stories,
if there's no duplication

1374
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,280
that you guys have, when you guys merge
all the code and you core code

1375
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,960
doesn't have the issues guys.

1376
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:37,000
Okay, so you guys will be able to you
on your own, see how you guys

1377
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:41,640
are completed and all these methods
that you guys will develop.

1378
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,600
Remember guys you have to review it in
in in the actual work,

1379
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,440
you guys are going to have a code review
meetings and code review meetings.

1380
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,480
It means somebody developed something.

1381
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,720
Now you as a team reviewing it, right?

1382
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,000
If there's any enhancements,
any improvement you want to make

1383
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,120
you guys, you should be able to make
those improvements.

1384
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:00,360
Okay?

1385
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:03,800
Okay.

1386
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,760
Okay. All right, guys.

1387
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,160

1388
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:10,760
Okay.

1389
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:14,480
So I was gonna be teaching you sequel.

All right, I will share the details.

1391
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,800
Now, guys, we have a second part

1392
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,200
that that Moazzam is going to.

1393
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,960
Moazzam was going to explain.

1394
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,600
So I know.

1395
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,520
Do you guys want to take a quick,
quick break or let me ask Moazzam

1396
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,040
it Mosab,
how long is the explanation going to take?

1397
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,120
Well, it's
good to get around 20 or 30 minutes, but

1398
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,360
25 minutes.

1399
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:46,000
Okay, 20 to 30 minutes, guys.

1400
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,600
Right.

1401
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,360
Okay, guys,
let's take a five minute break.

1402
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,080
And then after the break,

1403
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,440
after the break, Moazzam was out.

1404
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:59,040
Will explain you the process,
explaining the process, how it works.

1405
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:05,280
And meanwhile,
I'm just going to send the steps in.

1406
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,760
I think that's it from my side,
guys. Okay.

1407
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,080
I'm happy to see you guys.

1408
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,080
And I'm sure you guys got it.

01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,000
All right. And please make sure you do it.

01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,200
Take it very seriously
and do it together as a team.

01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,080
I believe in you guys. All right.

1413
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,640
Guess I'll see you.

1414
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,760
I'll see you next time. 825.

1415
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,760
Yeah. Let's be back, guys, by 830.

01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:34,720
Okay, so this way, 30 minutes

1417
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:35,040
And then

1418
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,040
if you guys decide with your team,

1419
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:42,720

1420
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:43,120
All right.

Just have fun.

1422
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,240
One more thing.

1423
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:10,840
As for dinner,
remember, your username for dinner is.

1424
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,920
Yeah, I maybe up.

1425
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,760
Maybe I'll type just a

1426
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,040
status

1427
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,760
or your username for dear
guys is your gmail

1428
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:28,040
without a gmail part
and the password is syntax.

1429
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:28,920
One, two, three.

1430
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,640
I think I'll share it guys with you
just in case of some.

1431
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,920
You forgot how to log in into gear.

1432
01:19:35,120 --> 01:24:09,840
Okay.

1433
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,040
Good morning, everyone.

1434
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:24,800
Here, Marina,
I'll give you 5 minutes noise about the.

1435
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,720
Okay guys.

1436
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:30,200
So I believe that all of you
are back from break and roll.

1437
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,480
Yeah. Hello, everyone.

1438
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,440
Hide the windows

1439
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:41,520
I shot and I'm not.

1440
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:48,200
I don't have not.

1441
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,080
I'm sorry about that.

1442
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:58,320
However, the.

1443
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,320
Okay, so let's quickly begin with our work

1444
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,040
workflow that you guys be following
throughout and get.

1445
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,480
We have already discussed that
but at the end of the evening.

1446
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,920
So you think that I'm pretty much sure
that it's going to be real simple.

1447
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,800
So I believe that all of you have chosen
the team needs, right?

1448
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,040
You do have one team within your group

1449
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:28,640
of the
perfect, so we are going to do this.

1450
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,640
Then you made this meaning

1451
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,760
visibility,
maximize the like from my side.

1452
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:38,200
I think

1453
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,960
I have shared the whole

1454
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,320
you want me to please the deck face

1455
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,320
of the group.

1456
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:59,480
Okay, so now all of you, all the group
members are going to have one key.

1457
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:04,680
So a team lead one more responsibility,
which I will be sharing.

1458
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,640
The rest of you are going to be
following the same stuff.

1459
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,200
Even the team leader
is going to be following the same stuff.

1460
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,400
Only there is one more responsibility
associated with it.

1461
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,560
So first
I'm going to share the responsibility

1462
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,800
with Team Lead has to also.

1463
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:24,160
Okay, so the task of the team lead

1464
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:30,840
is to launder output
and create a broad sub.

1465
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,400
So what you're going to do

1466
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,880
if you go to your GitHub output
and you've got the repository, you know,

1467
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:41,560
when you open up
your repo, you'll see only one branch,

1468
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,000
which is me.

1469
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:48,360
And in
this box I have pushed the basic structure

1470
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,880
of the project
that you will be working on.

1471
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:56,600
It contains your former example
and simply your desktop job.

1472
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,120
That's it.

1473
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,240
So it is just the basic structure
you have.

1474
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:04,440
Pull the framework over it.

1475
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,440
Now the purpose of creation

1476
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,600
of a sub me branch was that

1477
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:14,040
that is because I don't want anyone
be merging

1478
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,240
any code into the mean,
not even your needs.

1479
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:20,760
Because what I want is that once

1480
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:24,560
you guys are done with the project,
it should be in a separate sub.

1481
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:29,440
Me I'm able to view it,
I can best it and then after that, only

1482
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,560
if that is correct
I will then be merging it into the main.

1483
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:38,240
So is the as this clear to everyone
that why do we need a sub

1484
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,560
me branch?

1485
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,120
So you guys have to stay
away from me at all time.

1486
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:47,520
Okay.

1487
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,400
So here's what's going to happen.

1488
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,880
So the task of the team, we

1489
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:55,480
the team leader,

1490
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:59,680
is going to simply
after cooling the project, create

1491
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,440
a submitted writes
and he will make a comment in that

1492
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,200
this comment is going to contain,
you know,

1493
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:14,360
nothing, just an extra comment
maybe so that he can he's able

1494
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:19,760
to actually make a comment or else
if he has just brought out something

1495
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,560
and he has not made any changes,
he won't be able to make a comment.

1496
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,440
So what he will do is

1497
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,440
he will add some elements in the board

1498
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,160
so that he can make a comment
into something.

1499
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:35,040
Right. And push it to better.

1500
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:38,400
So is this tier now to the team?

1501
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:50,800
Is the task is it clear?

1502
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,080
Okay.

1503
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:54,640
Now let's talk about the task
which I associate with the team members

1504
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,800
and now was the team

1505
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,160
you guys need to clear out

1506
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:08,880
and then make your separate boxes
to work on

1507
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,600
the particular feature user story
that you have chosen.

1508
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,400
So simply this is going to be
your apple is going

1509
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,720
to contain main and supply to matches.

1510
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,280
You are going to clone this repo.

1511
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:25,240
So when you will know that,
what do you guys think?

1512
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,280
Which what will you have in your local

1513
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,760
repository after to make

1514
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:32,320
do it?

1515
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,760
Just have them in brackets.

1516
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,320
Remember we discussed this in class
that whenever you thought

1517
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,520
only the main branch is going to be there

1518
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:43,840
and for the other branches to be there,

1519
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,880
we have to stack up

1520
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,760
right?

1521
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:54,880
Do you guys remember that?

1522
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:59,840
Okay, so when you will submit
submit contest, it's called submit seven.

1523
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,160
So why
don't you agree to clone this repository?

1524
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:05,200
You will only have in the main branch?

1525
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:09,400
Because we discussed this in class
that whenever we clone something

1526
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:13,080
some represent
because it's only going to clone for us

1527
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,280
being in order
to move to the other branches.

1528
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,920
We have the check out method for that.

1529
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,040
Okay, so

1530
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,000
let me now explain the team members.

1531
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:26,840
That's

1532
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,080
so all of you are going to clone
this rep of the tree

1533
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:38,280
and after that you will be having
this particular

1534
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,760
main branch in your

1535
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:47,480
local repository.

1536
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,440
Now you want to work on your best.

1537
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,760
The teacher.

1538
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:51,680
I don't know the story.

1539
01:30:51,680 --> 01:31:23,280
So what are you going to do?

1540
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,840
Okay, so there are two methods to do that.

1541
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:31,760
Number one,
you can either check out from Main

1542
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,680
and create a new branch or you can
check out the sub may not be any branch.

1543
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,880
So basically the code
and see one and C two, is it going to be

1544
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:42,720
almost same instead that only dealing
with some comments and C right.

1545
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,200
These two codes are going to be the same.

1546
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:45,680
Right?

1547
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,160
So it doesn't matter
if you check from sub me or me,

1548
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:51,480
that's going to be,
you know, the same thing.

1549
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:56,440
So let's say it instead of checking out
from sub main you check out from we

1550
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,000
and we started working on a feature

1551
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,480
which one.

1552
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:20,800
And you had
certain elements on all of them.

1553
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,040
Well now it's your tries.

1554
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,440
How many branches do you want to

1555
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:27,800
create

1556
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,240
from Teacher One

1557
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:32,640
If you need a more branches you can.

1558
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,920
If you think that one branch is enough,
you don't need to create

1559
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,720
another branch
to solve any issues or stuff like that.

1560
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,080
It's completely fine.

1561
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,520
You can simply go on
working with feature one,

1562
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:46,960
but if you take any other branch
it ought to resolve some issues

1563
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,480
or stuff like that that you can create.

1564
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,240
Another way here
and then merge it back to work.

1565
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,840
Now the most important thing,

1566
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:58,200
similarly, just like
someone would be talking like feature one,

1567
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,560
there will be another person
who will be working on feature two

1568
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:04,960
and there will be another person
who do not feature

1569
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:11,280
three.

1570
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,720
So I'm not going to

1571
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,560
make little comments, but

1572
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:21,600
let's assume
that you also have some comments going on.

1573
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,520
Okay?

1574
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:26,880
Once you are done
working on your property to the one,

1575
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:43,800
what should be the next step
that you will follow?

1576
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,960
Exactly. Once you are done working on it?

1577
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:49,680
Branch you check
that is were what it was working fine.

1578
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,200
You are going to

1579
01:33:52,240 --> 01:33:58,000
post branch on GitHub.

1580
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:09,240
Okay and you will push to which
branch on github.

1581
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:13,600
No, you will not proceed to sub
Christine member.

1582
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,640
I told you that some is just like me
so you are not going to be pushing

1583
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:32,120
and suddenly
you will be pushing to your own branch.

1584
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:36,920
Each of one.

1585
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:40,000
Okay, so now everyone is going
to be pushing in their own

1586
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,280
branches

1587
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:48,040
and stuff like that. So

1588
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,240
yes, if you have five members on team,

1589
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:55,080
you will be having five branches

1590
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,560
and one sub main

1591
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,400
which belongs to no one that is actually,
you know,

1592
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,920
main branch.

1593
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,000
Okay.

1594
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,960
So once that is that done,
so your interface on GitHub

1595
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,840
is going to look something like that.

1596
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,960
You will be having different branches.

1597
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,600
Each one

1598
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:19,200
feature to feature tree and you can name
your branch anything you like,

1599
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:25,200
your name maybe, or whatever
you feel comfortable.

1600
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:29,040
And apart from these feature files

1601
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:32,760
she will be working
on, there are going to be some main

1602
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:36,480
and main.

1603
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,800
Okay, I want to just tell you something.

1604
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:47,160
Who is the owner of me?

1605
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:57,160
I am the owner.

1606
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:57,960
Okay.

1607
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:03,520
So will anyone be pushing to me?

1608
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,360
No. You guys are not allowed to touch it.

1609
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,640
You open up a pull request in main.

1610
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:10,080
I'll do anything with it.

1611
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:13,200
You guys have to forget that there is.

1612
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:25,040
Who is the owner of something? Me.

1613
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,480
Okay.

1614
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:32,680
So will you guys push it in something?

1615
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,240
No, he is the owner.

1616
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:35,400
You will not be pushing him.

1617
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,160
There was a feature one

1618
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,520
members.

1619
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,520
So where the person is, he is

1620
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:47,160
the owner of that particular branch.

1621
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,720
Once you guys have finished
working on your feature,

1622
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:55,720
what you are going to do,
you are going to open up a pool request

1623
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:58,920
that I do know

1624
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:03,520
how to put a pool request right?

1625
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,760
And you are going to assign it to
your team. Need

1626
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,000
your team is going to do your phone
request.

1627
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,880
He's going to check your code.

1628
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,680
And once
he thinks that the code is correct

1629
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:19,280
and he thinks that,
okay, this is fine to merge,

1630
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,960
then tenure is going to be the person
who will merge it

1631
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,600
to submit

1632
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,520
and wild merging.

1633
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:37,400
What's the best can do it
best and most all and you know

1634
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:40,080
do the merging together.

1635
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,880
How about you didn't understand the code
you can do that too which is going to make

1636
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,120
you know life is easy.

1637
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:52,240
So similarly the person who is working on
feature of

1638
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,640
is going to open up
will request once he's done

1639
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,520
for the team weekly just for like

1640
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:02,960
everyone is going to put to request
and no one

1641
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,960
no one is going to actually push to submit

1642
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:12,800
after

1643
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,480
pushing feature one,
then we do a pull request

1644
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,040
tomorrow.

1645
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,720
Let's talk about it.

1646
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:27,840
Okay guys, so is this workflow here?

1647
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,480
Great.

1648
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:32,520
Now, once
your whole project has been compiled

1649
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,520
over the period of time in sub main,
because no.

1650
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,520
All of you

1651
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,560
people have worked on the feature.

1652
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:42,600
It's working
fine and it's always in the sub.

1653
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,320
So there is one combat project
available in sub.

1654
01:38:47,240 --> 01:38:51,040
Then once you have that you do the team,
it is going to open up a pool request

1655
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,360
and he's going to assign it and

1656
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:58,920
then I'll be reviewing your code.

1657
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:03,240
I will have to look upon it
if I find it to be correct.

1658
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:07,320
If I find that everything is fine,
only then I'll be merging it with the mean

1659
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,240
as I will not be merging with any

1660
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,040
option.

1661
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,040
Okay,

1662
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:19,080
so let's go to the key points
that I've written.

1663
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:22,760
Let's go through them quickly
so that make sure everyone

1664
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,520
has all the info written in the notes

1665
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:29,080
also, which may help you throughout.

1666
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,480
So to that you need to among yourself.

1667
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:32,840
We have already done that.

1668
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:33,960
The task of easy.

1669
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,840
This is the first step
that you will be doing

1670
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,920
longer wrap on create a blog suddenly

1671
01:39:40,360 --> 01:39:43,080
now there are some tips

1672
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,720
now said there are some tips

1673
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:49,600
after uploading and making a separate
some branch.

1674
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:53,280
Make sure to add some comments
in the course so that you are

1675
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,160
to make a commit in the segment. Right
and push it to get up.

1676
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:58,920
So at this point,
the team will be able to create

1677
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:04,320
this sub main on the guitar.

1678
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:07,600
So this is just so
that whenever anyone has done working,

1679
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:13,440
he can open up a pull request
for something.

1680
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,600
Okay, now
the task of the team member team.

1681
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:18,240
But before moving on to that is this one

1682
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:28,120
Okay, so these are

1683
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:31,400
the task which will be performed
by team members and also the team.

1684
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,520
So now what you are going to do

1685
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,120
over there are things
that people were able

1686
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,680
whosoever replica become part

1687
01:40:43,680 --> 01:40:48,360
owner that outside of that the owner apply

1688
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:51,880
make your separate branches
to on your particular feature.

1689
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,560
So now what you will be doing
all of you will be cloning the wrap will

1690
01:40:58,400 --> 01:40:59,920
and will be creating your own

1691
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:05,160
particular branches to work on
look features.

1692
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,600
Okay, now there are some tips.

1693
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,200
Make sure that you do
create your own separate branch

1694
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,720
before you switch to the branch.

1695
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:15,040
Make sure you commit everything
on that particular branch.

1696
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,520
Because remember,
if you accidentally switch the branch

1697
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,440
without committing,
it's going to mess up the repository.

1698
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:24,480
Okay, so before you switch,
make sure you comment

1699
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,280
on that particular branch.

1700
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:31,680
We can push everything all into your own
branch on the remote wrap.

1701
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:33,000
That is important.

1702
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,880
Just make sure that you will not receive
anything to submit on me.

1703
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:42,680
That is again going to mess up everything.

1704
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,320
I'm sorry I have to be done many times.

1705
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,400
Does no matter what,
still someone will push to me.

1706
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,400
I'm sure the height

1707
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,680
of the most file

1708
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:55,720
once you are done working on the part.

1709
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:59,200
Well, one of two requests
to merge across to somebody.

1710
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:01,160
Make sure to open up
all requests for that.

1711
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:04,480
Do not do it directly
the not merge it that

1712
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:08,280
the make sure that you open up
a pool request and assigned to your team.

1713
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:10,360
The and please make sure that team is

1714
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:12,240
you are the only one
who are merging the code.

1715
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:15,000
Not anyone else knew.

1716
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,040
The pool question merged after testing
to resolve the conflicts that there are.

1717
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,440
And so you know how to resolve conflicts,
right?

1718
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,240
You know how to best do good.

1719
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:26,160
So make sure you are using
that knowledge to do

1720
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:29,680
this.

1721
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,120
Okay.

1722
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:34,760
So we have already done
the examples of the projects

1723
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:40,360
of such example, which are a similar
to what you will be doing in your project.

1724
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,640
So this is someone
it was exactly almost the same,

1725
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:47,280
and I tried to cover all the scenarios
that you guys may be facing.

1726
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,440
So I'm really hopeful

1727
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:51,600
that you will not be facing those problems
while doing the project.

1728
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:54,920
And one last thing
is the women into combat.

1729
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:59,040
So sometimes what happens
is that when you are on the log,

1730
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:02,640
you are unable
to accept your common outcome or do right.

1731
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,760
So in order to accept that,

1732
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,640
you have to type file on Q or WG.

1733
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:13,680
So this is something that I witnessed
a lot of people were facing.

1734
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:17,040
I mentioned it before also,
but I think you guys forgot.

1735
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,560
So I have written it over here,
but now you are terminal,

1736
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:25,560
you are unable to exit the command,
just type in, you are WQ

1737
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,080
also if accidentally some of them
and it opens up,

1738
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:36,760
then there is something on your console
where it opens up a new window for you

1739
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:39,720
in which there are comments on the top.

1740
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,880
No, I exit that.

1741
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,480
What you need to do is
you need to press escape

1742
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:50,960
after pressing escape need to type
com WQ or Q So I'm going to show you.

1743
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,920
Let me see if I can open up the women
over here.

1744
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,680
Okay, so this is your limit.

1745
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:04,960
In order to insert something or here,
what you can do is I can write something,

1746
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:09,160
you can simply press on and,

1747
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:13,560
start typing.

1748
01:44:13,560 --> 01:44:15,840
Well, well,
this is not something that we have.

1749
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:21,120
This this I'm just mentioning it to guys
because you may have faced this problem

1750
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,400
while you are working.
You may face this limit.

1751
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,120
So I'm just giving you a heads up
how to deal with it.

1752
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:30,000
Don't be confused.
Why is not anything working?

1753
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,960
This is something related to Linux
and you guys need a few of you.

1754
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:40,560
We have to deal with it.

1755
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,440
Okay. So

1756
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:45,480
typing whatever you want to

1757
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:50,320
press ASCII and then column WQ.

1758
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:55,680
You guys see this column you are proposing
to skip down at the bottom.

1759
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:59,280
So this is to save the 5%.

1760
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,160
So WrestleMania

1761
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:05,480
file away you

1762
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:22,200
women understanding the cookie.

1763
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:26,480
Okay,
so this is how you can exist by writing

1764
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,760
column Q column WQ It will exit your file

1765
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,960
whenever it's open

1766
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,720
so that will be it

1767
01:45:36,720 --> 01:45:39,760
just not something that much important
or you will be facing.

1768
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,200
But I think that it must be mentioned

1769
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,040
so when

1770
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:58,880
okay, let's it, it

1771
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:03,080
so this is everything.

1772
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:05,640
I think
what you will be doing about cloning.

1773
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:10,920
So regarding the cloning stuff,

1774
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:13,560
these repositories are private,
they are not public.

1775
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:18,480
So only those people who have access to
it will be able to view them.

1776
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,600
So I have invited
you guys as collaborators,

1777
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:25,240
and I think this is right.

1778
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:26,840
This is future testers.

1779
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:29,000
I have invited you guys.

1780
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,920
Some has accepted and why

1781
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:34,920
and this is what is desired.

1782
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:39,200
And he has invited to invite Zamani.

1783
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:43,160
So you guys are to go to
your email address

1784
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:47,800
related to your GitHub account,
find an email over there.

1785
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:50,600
It be asking you at subject.

1786
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:55,040
You accept that particular invite
and then you will be able to collaborate

1787
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:57,000
and work on this.

1788
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,240
A group so

1789
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:08,400
this people can use

1790
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:12,720
assume that you okay casino have you

1791
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:14,880
again followed which party

1792
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,320
likely would be?

1793
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:20,400
There's only one thing.

1794
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,880
Yeah there's only one.

1795
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:32,880
Do I mostly

1796
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:35,560
I haven't sent you
that needed in white yet

1797
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,880
so you guys
may not have the invitation yet

1798
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:43,440
because your username
I still have to enter them.

1799
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:48,440
So I'll just do it real quick
after the class and all that.

1800
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,160
Right.

1801
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,720
Just to make sure one thing
it's 854 to 10.

1802
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:55,240
All of you are added
in the requisite photos.

1803
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:55,920
Okay.

1804
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,960
Because after that I want you guys
to start working on the project together.

1805
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,800
And most really I would to be able to go.

1806
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,280
I would

1807
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,400
after
that, I will be available in the morning.

1808
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:12,240
So till the time you guys have done,

1809
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:15,720
send me your user names.

1810
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:18,520
If someone doesn't have them,

1811
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,320
you already have them in the file folder.

1812
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:24,760
This would you have.

1813
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:26,000
We don't have an email.

1814
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,320
Yes, you do that because I have not

1815
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:37,040
yet sent you.

1816
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,360
Let me show it to you.

1817
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:42,160
So this is the sheet
that you guys have right?

1818
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:45,240
So I hope that all of you have entered

1819
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:48,840
your credit username, but so some of you
there are two appearing.

1820
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,280
So I just selected one randomly,
just let me know

1821
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,960
if you guys I'm not at it.

1822
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,880
And there was one group
I was having a look at that

1823
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:03,360
I ask needed.

1824
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:07,040
Okay, so eight
teams are going to be here next week.

1825
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:11,640
So I was just sending you of Blessed.

1826
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:12,440
Okay, so

1827
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,000
once you guys have successfully

1828
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,240
you know accepted and what you are going
to call it, you know how to go to do that.

1829
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,280
Right.

1830
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:27,680
And after that you are simply going
to branch your own job and start working.

1831
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:32,360
So, yeah, questions Amanda
and whoever else has questions,

1832
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:36,000
let me know
You can use them to automate all

1833
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:38,000
information to good.

1834
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,120
How whether it is going to take you
much, much time then

1835
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:45,400
you know really plan.

1836
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:49,080
How are we supposed to work on common
methods of others, pages, etc..

1837
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:53,120
Okay. So

1838
01:49:53,120 --> 01:49:57,240
I believe that common methods is going
to be divided between you guys, right?

1839
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,720
You will share that. Okay.

1840
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:03,040
How some someone can develop
a few of the following methods

1841
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,600
that a person can

1842
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:10,240
upon matters relating to the tasks
run around pages.

1843
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:15,440
You guys can decide that who is going
to be working on the low class aspects.

1844
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,200
You guys also divide them among yourself.

1845
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:24,000
But is your question related to the manner
that how you working on

1846
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,520
that and GitHub?

1847
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:27,960
Okay.

1848
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:33,360
So this is something which

1849
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:37,800
we need to discuss
and I was hoping that it's

1850
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:39,960
okay.

1851
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:43,360
So someone
I had asked a very good question,

1852
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,640
she said that
how are we supposed to work on our

1853
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:50,480
common methods and pages?

1854
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
This is something that we will all be

1855
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,520
needing right?

1856
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:59,720
So popular
methods is something that all of you

1857
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:00,680
will be

1858
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:05,880
okay.

1859
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:08,760
Now, there can be multiple approaches
to this

1860
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:12,160
method, this problem.

1861
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:15,320
You guys can have multiple approaches,
but I'm going to just give you one.

1862
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,520
Good. You guys, me, follow me.

1863
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,040
Not all of you.

1864
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:26,800
So let's say that this is our main branch.

1865
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,640
And in here,

1866
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:31,760
this is the first time

1867
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,480
I get synchronized

1868
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:43,200
with me to this problem.

1869
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,120
Okay, so now what?

1870
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:47,440
What can happen is that, let's say

1871
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:52,560
then it's all come to that.

1872
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,920
Just let me answer this question first.

1873
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,480
Let's say that this is the something that

1874
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:24,920
and yet

1875
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:29,480
none of you are right about it,
that this is the users.

1876
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:31,680
And they'd be like,
Would you do it immediately?

1877
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:35,200
But there might be a scenario
where one created

1878
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:39,920
dependent on the other,

1879
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:44,240
there might be scenario
where you need to have longer things

1880
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,840
and your friend has already done it.

1881
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:49,560
So you want to not copy, you know,

1882
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,680
do not want to make spend some time
on that one.

1883
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,880
Instead,
you want to have it on a computer.

1884
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:04,000
So having that right,
I sure let me have that too.

1885
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,760
But first, let's let's discuss that.

1886
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:07,600
Okay. Yeah.

1887
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:10,440
You can create the framework plus.

1888
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,280
Okay, so now what's going to happen?

1889
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:15,680
Let's say this is the branch created by

1890
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,320
Aisha and I

1891
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:26,880
be It's a branch out of me.

1892
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,000
And let's say that one more branch
was created

1893
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,280
by Dennis,

1894
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,720
and this was started working on their

1895
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:48,160
common methods.

1896
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:51,120
So they started working on

1897
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,840
common methods

1898
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:09,560
and they made it over there

1899
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:11,720
and then they got comfortable with it.

1900
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,160
Now this common matter

1901
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:19,840
on which I still work contains
some methods and also the Dennis one.

1902
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,120
It also contains some method,
but they are not the same.

1903
01:54:22,120 --> 01:54:22,800
They are different.

1904
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,240
It contains methods for,

1905
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:28,200
let's see, opening up
browser tools in the browser screenshot.

1906
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,840
It contains method for

1907
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:33,000
sending text and something like that.

1908
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,120
So to this point I'm a good

1909
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,840
okay, now what you're going to do is

1910
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:45,200
you guys can

1911
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,960
either choose to open up

1912
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:51,760
a pull request
for this particular Common Methods branch.

1913
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:56,520
You can name this branch as common
methods of the methods by ISO.

1914
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:56,920
Let's

1915
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:06,840
and similarly
this Common methods by Dennis

1916
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,520
so you guys can open up a pull request

1917
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:15,320
to merge it to sub me

1918
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:19,080
and then

1919
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:22,840
your teammate is going to

1920
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:25,480
resolve the conflicts

1921
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:29,680
and add the code over here
for both the files.

1922
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:33,320
So you guys know that in the attic
there will be a file common it,

1923
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,840
which is going to have the code
of common methods

1924
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:40,440
in which I just go to
and then it's called both are present

1925
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:44,560
right?

1926
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:49,920
So now let's see, there is a third user
who has not worked on common methods.

1927
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,880
Let's say you use the system under system
and have done work on common methods.

1928
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:59,520
You guys decided in a meeting that
the methodology working on common methods

1929
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:02,880
but some are not,
but do need common methods right?

1930
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,720
You need the common methods.

1931
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:05,040
So what?

1932
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:16,440
What them are not enough.

1933
01:56:16,440 --> 01:56:19,760
The man that is going to first see that

1934
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:22,880
if there is an opinion Main Yes there is.

1935
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,240
He is going to well,

1936
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:27,440
he's going to

1937
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,560
pull the sub main, the updated one.

1938
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:33,320
And after pulling the updated sub

1939
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:38,120
main going to check out
I'm new branch from here.

1940
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:41,400
So now what you have here

1941
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:44,520
will be having the common methods

1942
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:49,000
available tomorrow.

1943
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,600
So this is one of the rules
that you guys can follow.

1944
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:56,960
And other books guarantee
that while you guys are, you know,

1945
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,440
having this for you guys can decide
that you need to work on framework for us.

1946
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:05,000
And once you have developed the framework,
then you guys will be working further.

1947
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:09,160
So you can either have this team
that you can

1948
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:14,600
have framework in your some in right
or just giving you the idea.

1949
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:17,040
What you can also do is
you can have a separate

1950
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:23,880
named framework,
you can have a separate branch

1951
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:35,520
named framework, and all of you
are working on the framework, all the fine

1952
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:40,200
members are working on the framework
and they all are pushing the branch.

1953
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,480
Their branch is opening of the request.

1954
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,040
From there, let's say

1955
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:48,200
I shall have worked on the framework
that is are open to work on the framework.

1956
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:51,920
And what they are doing is
now they are opening of the quest

1957
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:55,920
to merge into framework.

1958
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,080
So then what will happen when all of you
have done working on the framework,

1959
01:58:00,080 --> 01:58:03,360
you will be having
a branch named framework

1960
01:58:03,720 --> 01:58:07,080
which will have
the whole framework in there.

1961
01:58:08,280 --> 01:58:09,240
And then

1962
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:11,840
as soon as you
guys are going to work on the user story,

1963
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:16,200
you can simply have this branch
in the local branch up from over there.

1964
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:19,640
I started working on that particular desk
is what I wanted to do.

1965
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:23,160
So this is the one of another approach

1966
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:28,200
that you guys can use.

1967
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,600
Well, it's not about the purpose.

1968
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:33,320
Is that what the matter?
Methods are correct.

1969
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:38,040
There's nothing wrong with them
of whatever find most suitable.

1970
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,320
Whatever you find more intelligent,
you get you guys to follow that.

1971
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:44,160
That's the reason I showed you.
But it's your choice.

1972
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:45,120
You are working with the team.

1973
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:49,560
Whatever helps
you collaborate more intellectually,

1974
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:52,560
just use that one method.

1975
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,720
So I'm

1976
01:58:55,240 --> 01:59:00,120
as this clear to everyone the this and
I use the workflow that will be followed.

1977
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:02,040
Okay, great.

1978
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:05,640
So now make sure of one thing is just

1979
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:09,200
using the second word.

1980
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:14,280
If we want to do something cool,
starting with like features.

1981
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:14,520
Okay?

1982
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:17,760
So that is a thing that using the,
the point that we discussed over here

1983
01:59:18,680 --> 01:59:21,520
should he should remind the framework
to submit

1984
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:24,800
before we started working the features.

1985
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,840
Well there is that both expands upon you.

1986
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,240
Even if you do it won't hurt it.

1987
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:32,520
Even if you don't, you can do it later on.

1988
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:33,320
Right?

1989
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:36,480
So that doesn't that doesn't matter.

1990
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:38,080
It's fine.

1991
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:42,960
Even if you decide to do it later on.

1992
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:43,320
Okay.

1993
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:46,920
So regarding this GitHub stuff,
that is, just make sure

1994
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:50,080
that you are very vigilant
about the rules that you have discussed.

1995
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:53,760
Okay Just do not

1996
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:57,360
try to make as much intended
commit as can use the

1997
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,320
as a platform to communicate
because when you work

1998
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:03,800
this is you will be using it
a lot to use that

1999
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:07,600
to communicate among each other issues
help each other out.

2000
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:12,360
We have discussed, I guess, all the
scenarios that you can help each other. So

2001
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:18,880
just do that and

2002
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:21,240
if you guys need any help

2003
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:25,320
regarding any topic or any of us stuff,
get up.

2004
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:29,960
Just make sure to reach out to me on Slack
and a support tag team.

2005
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:32,320
I will be there to help you out

2006
02:00:33,240 --> 02:00:38,160
so not be having any problems
and how you understand.

2007
02:00:38,240 --> 02:00:40,400
Do it in can right along with Alex.

2008
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:43,560
Do you mean to say that how I understand
whether you did it the right

2009
02:00:43,880 --> 02:00:47,320
only?

2010
02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:49,440
Well, I have your GitHub repository.

2011
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:51,600
I can see that. Right.

2012
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:56,400
So I will be reviewing
your pushes the branches and everything.

2013
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:58,400
How know whether you do it better
right or not.

2014
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:02,920
And I can also you go out on your project,

2015
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:06,120
just run it so

2016
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,200
I wouldn't do it. So

2017
02:01:09,240 --> 02:01:10,080
I'm doing all the

2018
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:13,280
repository right
this representative belongs to and

2019
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:17,880
let that this is my project

2020
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:37,040
really check all the users.

2021
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:42,240
So my main focus is not going to be
your industry of mostly focusing

2022
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:47,280
on your GitHub execution and overall
performance of your user stories.

2023
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:50,640
They are also going by civil law. So

2024
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:59,120
but I will be checking
the performance of your code.

2025
02:01:59,320 --> 02:02:03,000
I can sit through it and see that
whether your test cases are running

2026
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,600
smoothly or not

2027
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:09,800
yet Anonymous and right.

2028
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:14,880
And I want all of you
set up and start working on the project.

2029
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:17,920
So once again,
I'm going to ask a few questions.

2030
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:21,200
I really want you guys to reply to me
so that I know all of this,

2031
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:24,000
so that after joining the repository,

2032
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:27,000
after getting the invite,
what's the duty of the team?

2033
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:29,480
After getting meanwhile,

2034
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:31,760
what's the duty of the team

2035
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:37,680
launched it

2036
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:40,840
and create a summary branch
in order to create a something right.

2037
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:43,720
What you have to do

2038
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:53,720
is remember

2039
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:59,360
he has to add some comments in the code
so that able to make a comment

2040
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:01,280
into something in branch
and push it to get up.

2041
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,120
Okay.

2042
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:03,920
This is important.

2043
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:07,560
If he does not make any comments
or anything, he will not be able

2044
02:03:07,560 --> 02:03:10,080
to make the comment

2045
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:14,920
that is the meeting.

2046
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:15,200
Okay.

2047
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:18,280
So is that clear that he will be making
some comments, comments

2048
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:21,840
like you can simply open up the project
and write down testing

2049
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:25,480
and, you know, just make a comment
and let them know.

2050
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:29,480
Okay, So once the submit is there,

2051
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:34,200
what are the rest of the group members
and the team, a member team is going to do

2052
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:39,480
code repositories

2053
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:42,840
and branch out your own branches.

2054
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:46,320
Okay. Is it possible that you out for me?

2055
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:53,160
I know.

2056
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:57,120
Remember
I told you guys that the submarine and me

2057
02:03:57,240 --> 02:04:01,200
are going to have the same code right?

2058
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,720
They are going to have the same code

2059
02:04:03,720 --> 02:04:06,960
so you can either branch out

2060
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:10,560
from some men
or it will not make a difference.

2061
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:15,880
Okay, Just

2062
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:18,360
don't confuse about it.

2063
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:21,760
You can add in Roger from sub made

2064
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:25,960
on me.

2065
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:30,240
The purpose of submit
is that you guys will be opening up

2066
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:34,280
your request to merge the code in there.

2067
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:42,000
Okay. Yes.

2068
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:45,240
So let's say in the start
you are behind in

2069
02:04:45,640 --> 02:04:49,200
any framework, right

2070
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:53,720
in the starting like me, having
you guys will not be having anything.

2071
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:57,480
So you guys can graduate from anywhere
and start working on the framework.

2072
02:04:58,280 --> 02:05:03,160
But once you guys have some thing
in your some then you need to

2073
02:05:04,240 --> 02:05:10,840
do. Okay.

2074
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:14,560
So apart from that push your will get up

2075
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:17,640
in your own particular branches
that do not push to anyone else.

2076
02:05:17,640 --> 02:05:21,720
Max Just make sure of that
and open up the pull request.

2077
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:28,320
Assign it
routinely to merge into something.

2078
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:31,800
Unless the project is done,
then it is going to

2079
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:35,280
open up the request and decided Can you

2080
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:44,160
share

2081
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:46,920
completely close to me
the rest of the stuff.

2082
02:05:47,680 --> 02:05:50,280
I got one question over here.

2083
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:53,920
Is it possible for you to do it on the sub

2084
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:59,080
lunch?

2085
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:00,720
No, it's not possible for you to go.

2086
02:06:00,720 --> 02:06:04,720
The surprise member
You guys can only the only members.

2087
02:06:05,080 --> 02:06:09,360
Okay, let me do it for you guys, because
I think that there's going to be a lot of

2088
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:17,080
the guys want me to show you a demo.

2089
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:19,200
I think I can show you. I know.

2090
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:21,880
What about that?

2091
02:06:21,880 --> 02:06:22,520
Oh, okay. Here.

2092
02:06:23,640 --> 02:06:24,760
So let's see.

2093
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:27,840
I'm going to create a new repository and

2094
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:34,280
name it.

2095
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:35,520
Good project.

2096
02:06:35,520 --> 02:07:07,440
So, Jimi, I'm just walking it through,
so just give me a moment

2097
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:10,920
and I'm going to give you
a practical example of how

2098
02:07:11,520 --> 02:07:43,480
you have to proceed a bit.

2099
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,280
That's my good that

2100
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:51,640
I'm going to

2101
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:55,960
send everything to this particular piece

2102
02:07:55,960 --> 02:08:00,920
so that I can build a small demo for you.

2103
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:05,240
I'll get the items

2104
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,680
on the move.

2105
02:08:34,200 --> 02:08:39,880
What to remove.

2106
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,360
So give me more. I'm

2107
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:48,400
okay.

2108
02:08:49,000 --> 02:09:01,480
Let's.

2109
02:09:01,480 --> 02:09:02,000
Okay, guys.

2110
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,800
So now I'm going to show you a practical

2111
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:07,800
I hope that it's going to create

2112
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:15,440
more sense to have.

2113
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:18,120
So these are the repository that we have
right now.

2114
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:20,760
What you will be like, Do want to go
look here?

2115
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:23,960
Okay.

2116
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:28,920
Are you guys with me?

2117
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:34,080
Okay, so I'm going to first pretend to be
a team and I'll show you what the task.

2118
02:09:34,400 --> 02:09:34,800
Okay.

2119
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:38,960
So first of all, I'm

2120
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:41,240
making a folder named Team.

2121
02:09:41,240 --> 02:09:46,760
We from all the task and action
the team meetings to do.

2122
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:50,240
So I'm going to open up the notes
and also tell you

2123
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:54,120
how I'm going to follow them
and create a branch.

2124
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:56,120
So this is simple.

2125
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:58,160
I'll simply open up my get back here

2126
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:01,480
and use get clone

2127
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:10,640
and the URL.

2128
02:10:10,640 --> 02:10:13,440
Okay,
so it clone the representative for me.

2129
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:16,560
I'll go to there

2130
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:22,240
now check it, get status.

2131
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:26,200
Okay guys, so as you
can you tell me right now which launch

2132
02:10:26,200 --> 02:10:27,640
am our

2133
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:31,920
I'm on my end right

2134
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:35,760
and what's my task.

2135
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:40,800
My task is to the honorable which I have
and I have to create a brand subnets.

2136
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:43,800
Okay so for that I do get

2137
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:46,400
branch

2138
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:51,000
subnets

2139
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:54,160
and then get check out subnet

2140
02:10:55,720 --> 02:10:56,040
to two.

2141
02:10:56,040 --> 02:11:01,040
Now I'm in the branch subnet right.

2142
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:03,480
Okay. Now I need to push it to GitHub.

2143
02:11:04,120 --> 02:11:08,280
So what should I do.

2144
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:10,560
Get add dot and it come in.

2145
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:13,560
But first
let me show you that I do get abnormal

2146
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:17,120
and get comment dash and

2147
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:20,640
that's a new comment.

2148
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:26,160
It's not making the comment because
I have not made any changes in the file.

2149
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:26,760
Right.

2150
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,000
So I have to add something in the in here.

2151
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:34,720
So let's see, I just open up my project
and the inside of test.

2152
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:35,760
I see

2153
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:38,000
testing

2154
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:47,520
Now can I add it.

2155
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:51,280
Come commit that

2156
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:54,120
let's call it

2157
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:59,120
the sub main is ready

2158
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:03,080
and now I need to push it.

2159
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:14,840
But first that you origin sub me.

2160
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:17,240
Okay, so now everything is

2161
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:22,040
pushed into my sub.

2162
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:24,120
The task of the team is done.

2163
02:12:24,120 --> 02:12:26,160
The main branch is did the sub minutes do

2164
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:30,400
stuff?

2165
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:32,440
Open up my notes.

2166
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:35,200
This particular stuff is done.

2167
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,960
Make a committed submarine
branch and push together.

2168
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:41,400
We are good with that.

2169
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:46,280
Any questions still here?

2170
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:48,840
Awesome. Great.

2171
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:51,440
So now let's follow

2172
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:53,000
the next step.

2173
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:53,880
The thing you need.

2174
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:56,960
I'm going to place it aside
and I'm not going to

2175
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:07,440
put a ten to be team member,
so this is my team member.

2176
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:11,280
I'd love to get that here
and I set it long

2177
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:13,560
enough to that.

2178
02:13:13,560 --> 02:13:16,800
I'm going to place the link
of the graphical

2179
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:23,160
and I'm going to go inside

2180
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:25,560
to represent free of the hero air.

2181
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:29,280
Okay, So I want you to just tell me
that by default,

2182
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:33,840
which branch do I have?

2183
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,600
I only have the mean. Right.

2184
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:36,600
All right.

2185
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:40,080
We discussed this in detail
that whenever never put the branch

2186
02:13:40,760 --> 02:13:44,040
with a repository only downloads for us.

2187
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:47,080
The main books.

2188
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:47,880
Okay.

2189
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:50,240
So now if I want to have my

2190
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:55,120
some branch
also on my system, what should I do

2191
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,760
now? Jimmy, remember I told

2192
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:09,280
you guys that with the branch is
we cannot do get call.

2193
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:12,440
Remember?

2194
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:14,360
But we want a new branch.

2195
02:14:14,360 --> 02:14:15,600
We cannot do it Pool.

2196
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:20,000
What's the what's the matter
to have a branch on to look for?

2197
02:14:20,240 --> 02:14:26,760
Did we discuss that, guys
To have the a local.

2198
02:14:26,760 --> 02:14:30,280
So first of all, get branch dash

2199
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:35,280
E it is going to show you

2200
02:14:35,760 --> 02:14:39,240
which out there on your remote right

2201
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:49,760
now let's say

2202
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:54,320
you want to have this particular submarine
branch, then you are going

2203
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:58,080
to simply download it on your local
using the command,

2204
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:00,240
get checked out

2205
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:08,360
suddenly.

2206
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:12,560
Okay.

2207
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:14,360
It just revealed that for you.

2208
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:17,600
That's so that your monthly runs

2209
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:18,200
you're

2210
02:15:20,640 --> 02:15:21,480
going to

2211
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:26,480
it's just to view the number of branches
out of there.

2212
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:28,640
For example, a new branch has been added.

2213
02:15:28,640 --> 02:15:30,800
Let's feature right
And you want to see that

2214
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:34,000
or maybe you do not know
the exact spellings of submarine,

2215
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:37,120
so you can do it without branch
stacking also.

2216
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:43,520
But it's good to first see that
which is the price you want to say to.

2217
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:46,920
Okay, so let me have these commands
in the notes.

2218
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:48,440
Officer. So that's going to help you

2219
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,960
giving Branch that same

2220
02:16:00,320 --> 02:16:00,760
view.

2221
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:02,880
The branches

2222
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:05,880
that are clear on remote

2223
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:13,280
and it branch check out

2224
02:16:15,040 --> 02:16:18,040
branch name

2225
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:20,760
to download

2226
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:23,960
a particular branch

2227
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:25,880
from the GitHub

2228
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:29,840
list.

2229
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:35,160
If I did share with all of you
those commands and I'll would that when

2230
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:38,440
I think I should teach you
to do all of you.

2231
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:41,600
Yes I did.

2232
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:46,000
I showed them again
the course announcement.

2233
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,960
Okay. So

2234
02:16:49,520 --> 02:16:52,760
whenever you need to have

2235
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:56,520
whatever you need,
whenever you close the report,

2236
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:01,840
it will only download

2237
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:04,680
the main branch

2238
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:11,160
to have other branches.

2239
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:13,640
Use that for us.

2240
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:16,760
Okay guys, tonight
I that you guys will not forget.

2241
02:17:16,760 --> 02:17:34,920
Now. Okay, I'm
going to answer the question.

2242
02:17:34,920 --> 02:17:38,120
Just I Aisha and Dennis,
just ask me on what I have gone for it.

2243
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:41,040
Okay, guys,
so let's let's proceed further.

2244
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:45,360
Now, I told you guys
you have the choice to either

2245
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:49,440
check out from somebody
or either check out from me, right?

2246
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:53,720
I Just taught you
how to have go talk to him.

2247
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:56,520
Even if you want to check on some submit
now you can

2248
02:17:56,840 --> 02:18:01,760
even if you want to check up for me,
you can absolutely depends upon you guys.

2249
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:06,200
So tell me that from which approach
you want to see.

2250
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:20,120
Do you want me to show you
how to check out from, submit or make?

2251
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:21,200
Okay, so

2252
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:25,320
we will be doing some

2253
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:05,040
this one

2254
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:09,000
we learn how to clone the main branch
and then download to submit.

2255
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:09,240
Right?

2256
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:11,480
So you have that right.

2257
02:19:11,480 --> 02:19:14,960
And now if I put up my terminal,

2258
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,400
I'm in submit branch.

2259
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:21,120
So if I create a new branch over here,
this means that I will be out

2260
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:25,840
from some made into a new runs.

2261
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:30,240
Okay, so let's create a branch over here
and let's see

2262
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:35,200
that branch.

2263
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:36,640
Let's name it

2264
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:40,200
framework by modifying

2265
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:45,320
that check out

2266
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:52,120
framework by person

2267
02:19:56,200 --> 02:20:04,320
whose values are not correct.

2268
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:06,040
Okay, So

2269
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:08,040
if I show you

2270
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:09,760
the file

2271
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:11,680
file there. Right.

2272
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:15,160
The testing
is there because we checked out from sub

2273
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:38,800
means.

2274
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:39,160
Okay.

2275
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:49,560
Now what I do is I start
adding the framework stuff in here.

2276
02:20:49,560 --> 02:20:52,600
So let's see
the python, the tree is there. And

2277
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:55,240
let me quickly add the framework.

2278
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:58,200
So let's say I added a new file

2279
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:06,080
with the framework.

2280
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:09,520
That's
if there are few functions out there

2281
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:19,320
for the framework.

2282
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:22,040
Okay, so I'm done
with writing down the framework.

2283
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:24,480
So what do I have to do next

2284
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:26,600
in this branch? What should I do?

2285
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:31,320
Let's assume that I'm working
on my framework and a log was done.

2286
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:34,400
Yes, I have to first added

2287
02:21:35,640 --> 02:21:37,200
and come. I do

2288
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:41,040
my part of framework

2289
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:44,320
is done.

2290
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:46,600
But so it

2291
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:53,240
if I show you on GitHub, oh,

2292
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:57,000
what did I do.

2293
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,880
Oh I know.

2294
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:02,760
Get pushed that to origin

2295
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:06,160
framework

2296
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:10,120
myself.

2297
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:13,080
Now then now if I show you guys

2298
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:18,000
I have this framework

2299
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,120
over here that's like working.

2300
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:24,640
Now let's say that.

2301
02:22:24,760 --> 02:22:28,320
Meanwhile, I was working on the framework.

2302
02:22:28,760 --> 02:22:31,520
I was also working on the framework.

2303
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:33,480
No, not, not the pull request right now.

2304
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,400
Let's discuss it in detail.

2305
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:37,240
Let's set other

2306
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:41,160
person what's working.

2307
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:43,160
I want your concepts to be really clear.

2308
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:46,280
Let's say it wasn't

2309
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:48,360
worked for by a framework, but

2310
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:51,960
I sure that's okay.

2311
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:55,440
So in this scenario,
what's going to happen?

2312
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:58,120
It's going to be a new form or

2313
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:01,080
limitation.

2314
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:03,800
Okay, look,
I shall be working on the project.

2315
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:06,800
So he is going to have

2316
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:09,360
also this particular proposal

2317
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:14,520
is this making sense

2318
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:19,280
to all the future, this one.

2319
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:19,960
Okay.

2320
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:24,040
So I need to get the correct you'll

2321
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:29,480
get screwed on I'm pretending to be now
I shot I'm

2322
02:23:29,480 --> 02:23:32,560
going to show you first I showed you
how I was going to work on the project.

2323
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:35,240
Now show you how I finished working.

2324
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:38,840
So get see, get wrap up.

2325
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:44,760
Excuse in there.

2326
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:47,320
No, I learned it from the project demo.

2327
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:50,000
So this was a mistake.

2328
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:51,600
It did not work. Okay.

2329
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,320
Okay, Now

2330
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:01,480
I said it there.

2331
02:24:01,480 --> 02:24:02,080
Right.

2332
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:07,800
So you have this smart does it
and you only thing to be.

2333
02:24:07,800 --> 02:24:09,440
So now let's do this.

2334
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:14,160
Let's have job.

2335
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:14,960
Yeah. Yeah.

2336
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:16,160
Branch

2337
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:19,000
Dashti

2338
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:20,680
And then

2339
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:23,520
she will go to the subject branch of you

2340
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:27,480
because she also wants to work

2341
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:30,720
on the frameworks and right now

2342
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,640
she does not know what

2343
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:37,600
the framework model is, complete or not
you will start with your own frameworks

2344
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:41,200
that she'll say, get checked out

2345
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:53,080
some of it.

2346
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:56,240
So now she checked out in some me

2347
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:58,760
and over here she'll start working.

2348
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:02,200
No, sorry.

2349
02:25:02,200 --> 02:25:04,280
Not from here. He'll be at home.

2350
02:25:04,360 --> 02:25:06,600
I get branch

2351
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:08,480
framework,

2352
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:11,520
but I sure

2353
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:15,160
she'll decide to check out

2354
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:23,960
framework, but I should know she is.

2355
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:27,960
I'm not go into the project and

2356
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,040
let's say she also created a file

2357
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:34,520
framework

2358
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:43,080
and she added some code in there.

2359
02:25:43,080 --> 02:25:43,560
She's

2360
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,680
Did we have the same name

2361
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:57,200
for the framework or

2362
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,920
let's check the name of the file

2363
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:03,880
we had in framework

2364
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:07,400
framework.

2365
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:10,520
Okay. Correct.

2366
02:26:10,520 --> 02:26:13,960
No, let's assume that he has done
working on the framework.

2367
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:16,560
What she's going to do now

2368
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:27,040
is get at DOT

2369
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:32,520
if comment that I show

2370
02:26:32,520 --> 02:26:35,080
the of framework

2371
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:40,000
I'm supposed to work on is done

2372
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:43,240
in the name

2373
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:46,920
two classes and what no idea
if you have ninja classes

2374
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:50,400
differently, how
are you supposed to merge them together?

2375
02:26:50,400 --> 02:26:55,680
It's going to be higher than it will not
be able to know that it's the same file.

2376
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:57,920
It's going to be a different file, right?

2377
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:00,880
So you have to name your files.

2378
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:06,440
The should be same so that I'm just
giving you the idea of how to proceed.

2379
02:27:06,440 --> 02:27:07,480
It's very important

2380
02:27:07,480 --> 02:27:10,920
that before you begin the project,
you all sit down in the meeting you

2381
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:15,240
you have your brainstorming session
in which you decide the task

2382
02:27:15,240 --> 02:27:17,400
that each will be doing.
This is really important.

2383
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:20,760
It's not about just,
you know, the technical needs.

2384
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:24,320
Rather it's more about your team's
operation, how to work in a team.

2385
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:27,920
So it's going to be very important
for you guys to sit down in a meeting

2386
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:33,520
and decide for yourself, How are you going
to propose diverse little bit?

2387
02:27:33,560 --> 02:27:37,680
You can also make changes, not necessarily
follow the exact same things

2388
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:38,880
I have told you.

2389
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:44,720
You know the concepts, how it works,
you know how all these matters work.

2390
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:47,640
You know how this concept meets
the workflow is

2391
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:51,640
you should be able to come up
with your own workflows.

2392
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:55,160
Also, just the conditions
that you have to not push in

2393
02:27:58,560 --> 02:28:01,160
is not to make a framework in

2394
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:05,000
one branch that is well, again,
I'm saying this is your own choice.

2395
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:06,080
You have to decide.

2396
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:07,040
I'm just

2397
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:11,000
telling you guys that this is
one of the tools that I think, well,

2398
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:15,480
if you guys how to do this,
you have to in a meeting, decide

2399
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:19,720
that, okay,
we have one framework branch in which

2400
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:24,680
all the framework is going to be there
and then it's going to merge in some way.

2401
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:29,760
So that's all you
what's your intelligence, how you think?

2402
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:33,560
So this is your decision.

2403
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:36,120
So yes, similar Brussels difference.

2404
02:28:36,760 --> 02:28:39,640
Yes. So now let's make Isaac,
which are good.

2405
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:43,280
So he's going to get pushed you origin

2406
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:47,840
framework by Aisha.

2407
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:51,120
So I'm just telling you
one of the good guys, okay, remember that

2408
02:28:51,200 --> 02:29:20,840
one of the rules, but it's also there.

2409
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:23,640
Now let's assume
that the framework is complete.

2410
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:25,480
That was it for the framework.

2411
02:29:25,480 --> 02:29:27,400
The framework is complete.

2412
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:30,360
So one of the project can we

2413
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:35,120
you know,
followed by this particular process is

2414
02:29:38,400 --> 02:29:41,880
that I was unaware of all the previous.

2415
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:44,960
And I do know that

2416
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:46,720
this is our is

2417
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:49,800
as you guys move forward,
everything comes together in the end.

2418
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:52,520
You guys have a better understanding.

2419
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:54,840
So that's how the whole course laws and

2420
02:29:56,760 --> 02:30:00,960
okay so one of the approaches
that we can have a separate branch

2421
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:05,880
in which we can combine
the whole framework and then you know,

2422
02:30:05,880 --> 02:30:10,680
push towards that or what we can do it,
we are sure that our framework is correct.

2423
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:14,400
We can just simply,
you know, merge it to somebody.

2424
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:20,280
So let's
go ahead with merging this to something.

2425
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:26,520
So for that, what we will do,
we'll pull up the request,

2426
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:30,360
create the request.

2427
02:30:30,360 --> 02:30:30,600
Okay.

2428
02:30:30,600 --> 02:30:34,800
So me no,
no one is going to pull it for me.

2429
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:35,800
Remember that

2430
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:39,680
submit and then framework.

2431
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:41,240
My wasn't

2432
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:44,040
this is going to be

2433
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:46,080
in the bonus last mentioned name

2434
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:49,840
they would

2435
02:30:51,360 --> 02:30:54,560
to functions and framework

2436
02:30:56,400 --> 02:31:01,480
create a pool of rest.

2437
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:06,120
Okay so you are not going to see that
like this will not be shown to you

2438
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:09,320
or even if it is
do not have the multiple requests.

2439
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:10,080
Okay.

2440
02:31:10,840 --> 02:31:13,720
This is only

2441
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:15,240
one team need to do.

2442
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:17,040
You do not have to do this.

2443
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:19,080
The team members are not going to do this.

2444
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:21,240
Please make sure of this.

2445
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,960
If you are not synchronized on this one,

2446
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:26,560
you guys are going to have
a lot of problem.

2447
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:28,920
Please, you should do synchronize.

2448
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:31,400
Only the team leaders will do that.

2449
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:35,320
Then the other pool request
is going to be open and it's going to be

2450
02:31:35,320 --> 02:31:38,440
for our framework language
and create the pool

2451
02:31:38,440 --> 02:31:45,920
request.

2452
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:46,520
Okay.

2453
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:49,440
Now the team is going to go to the pool

2454
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:54,200
request,

2455
02:31:54,200 --> 02:31:58,720
have a creation of the same pool
across the board.

2456
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:00,440
Oh, my mistake.

2457
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:03,800
So I need to open

2458
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:09,320
this first out.

2459
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:10,760
So this date

2460
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:21,360
flows the pool request.

2461
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:36,880
This madam want is blue request.

2462
02:32:36,880 --> 02:32:39,000
So I have closed it

2463
02:32:39,240 --> 02:32:41,880
and now the favor by Mazloum.

2464
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:43,440
Yeah, this is done.

2465
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:45,560
And the other one is
should be the for the Asian one.

2466
02:32:45,560 --> 02:32:45,840
Right.

2467
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:48,040
I created the same for what

2468
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:53,000
I? Need to open up the pool request
for access framework.

2469
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:56,560
And this is going to let this

2470
02:32:56,560 --> 02:32:59,080
be a pool request.

2471
02:32:59,080 --> 02:33:02,160
Yeah. Suddenly. Sorry.

2472
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:04,480
Look, I'm also making mistakes

2473
02:33:07,400 --> 02:33:08,640
last. So.

2474
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:09,120
Yeah.

2475
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:12,400
When you guys go make the save,
when you're working with the questions

2476
02:33:12,400 --> 02:33:18,120
about her.

2477
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:20,840
Well, very honestly, like

2478
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:23,880
you guys can, but

2479
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:27,960
just make sure that don't.

2480
02:33:27,960 --> 02:33:32,440
I do not have an instructor telling me
not to do this, But you have an instructor

2481
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:36,040
telling you on the Internet
you can try to do this right?

2482
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:37,520
And I'm in a hurry.

2483
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:42,720
So the team is going to open up
this framework by Amazon

2484
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:46,320
and he's going to say,
I've been let's have a look at the files

2485
02:33:49,560 --> 02:33:50,880
of this posting.

2486
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:56,040
And he has added this function that he's
going to draw to the conversation.

2487
02:33:56,680 --> 02:33:58,920
Let me go to the same request

2488
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:02,360
and confirm

2489
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:06,120
this.

2490
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:08,880
So because of that critical purpose,
you have merged it.

2491
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:13,560
And now the second one,

2492
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:19,440
we are going to merge it to.

2493
02:34:19,440 --> 02:34:20,160
Okay.

2494
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:23,160
So now let's go to our project

2495
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:28,920
and let's have a look at our plan
with fixed.

2496
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:37,360
Yeah,
the problem is that I have merged to me so

2497
02:34:42,720 --> 02:34:43,240
okay that

2498
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:46,320
so the problem,
the mistake that outselling me not to do

2499
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,960
so I merged one of the my

2500
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:52,160
the more than one in the main box
which should not have been done

2501
02:34:52,680 --> 02:34:56,840
and I need to know and move it forward
here I can simply move it.

2502
02:34:56,840 --> 02:35:02,880
It's not going to be a problem for me,

2503
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:06,000
but I time you guys don't
need it from the top.

2504
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,360
I'll tell you how.

2505
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:08,760
So let's open up.

2506
02:35:08,760 --> 02:35:11,880
Pool request for the branch wasn't a game.

2507
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:14,480
Okay, So it's going to be something

2508
02:35:15,720 --> 02:35:18,720
and it's going to be similar by myself.

2509
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:19,320
Right

2510
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:22,680
now it's telling me
that can automatically merge it.

2511
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:25,120
Does that make sense to all of you
that why is it showing that?

2512
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:30,400
Because I showed me
word on the same one on the same file.

2513
02:35:30,560 --> 02:35:35,000
So on the same file that that's
why it's saying that it's not going to,

2514
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,200
you know, merge automatically

2515
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:45,240
to create the flow request.

2516
02:35:45,240 --> 02:35:45,560
Okay.

2517
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:47,160
A result of the conflicts,

2518
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:51,040
what you guys are going to see
the control that have been added by.

2519
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:54,080
So you guys can keep it and the function

2520
02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:57,240
that were provided by me
I can keep them too.

2521
02:35:57,400 --> 02:36:00,600
And after that you are given losses
that resolve commitments

2522
02:36:00,600 --> 02:36:04,360
and it's going to
be there in your subnet. So

2523
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:08,560
my request as formats.

2524
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:11,800
So let to show you on the diagram

2525
02:36:11,800 --> 02:36:21,600
what you did as we was

2526
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:25,000
trained by Muslim and then you similar

2527
02:36:25,240 --> 02:36:28,080
I sure but not was

2528
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:31,800
a three way merge
this this this one merge is called

2529
02:36:31,800 --> 02:36:33,160
which was

2530
02:36:37,560 --> 02:36:39,720
f f right.

2531
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:42,520
The first one will f

2532
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:45,360
and this is what now

2533
02:36:45,360 --> 02:36:50,720
is it going to be f?

2534
02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:53,200
No, this is recursive now.

2535
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:56,040
So we have we were having a conflict

2536
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:58,560
to resolve the conflict guys
who is on conflict

2537
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:04,640
to resolve that.

2538
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:04,960
Right.

2539
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:08,280
I was I really
I said that okay here is the conflict

2540
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:11,440
and I was in a meeting with,
you know I showed awesome

2541
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:19,360
facial, huh?

2542
02:37:19,360 --> 02:37:20,880
On our hiding.

2543
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:22,040
Yes. Okay.

2544
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:25,640
Now let's proceed further
and let's see that this is something

2545
02:37:25,640 --> 02:37:32,480
that the framework is done.

2546
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:34,560
Now we all have the framework.

2547
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:38,040
And now what we want to do
is we want to work

2548
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:40,960
on our user stories, right?

2549
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:45,840
Everyone wants to do that.

2550
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:47,080
So I'm going to

2551
02:37:48,560 --> 02:37:52,440
let's say I want to work on

2552
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,560
I want to work on this user.

2553
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:00,120
So what she's going to do now,

2554
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:02,280
what should be the steps

2555
02:38:02,280 --> 02:38:09,320
I want you guys to tell me
and then I'll show you.

2556
02:38:09,320 --> 02:38:10,920
This is one step on out.

2557
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:20,240
Not going to way.

2558
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:20,960
Okay.

2559
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:24,080
So I should have this

2560
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:29,080
repository.

2561
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:30,520
All right.

2562
02:38:30,520 --> 02:38:36,600
He has this repository, but

2563
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:50,280
he needs to have the whole framework.

2564
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:53,320
But he needs to have the whole framework

2565
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:56,880
in which the Muslim contributed
and he also contributed.

2566
02:38:57,200 --> 02:39:00,200
So where is that line

2567
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:04,360
that is in subdomain, Right?

2568
02:39:04,440 --> 02:39:07,600
So what he's he's going to do,

2569
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:18,120
he's going to check out to submit.

2570
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:22,440
So she is now in, submit and all let's see

2571
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:27,520
the sub that we have

2572
02:39:30,600 --> 02:39:31,760
are in submit

2573
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:43,880
templates and now off to be in the sub me.

2574
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:51,360
She's going to do such.

2575
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:55,840
So there is something in least
something that needs to be submit.

2576
02:39:56,080 --> 02:40:00,240
Cool.

2577
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:03,240
Now she is going to open up her framework.

2578
02:40:03,960 --> 02:40:06,560
This is part of file this move so

2579
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:10,200
let's

2580
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:23,120
let's look at folder.

2581
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:27,080
She just wants

2582
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:35,040
I shall I show

2583
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:37,320
let me first
show you the file in the action

2584
02:40:37,440 --> 02:40:40,560
so I show the project

2585
02:40:40,560 --> 02:40:43,080
demo associate task Java framework.

2586
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:46,160
So now I should have common methods

2587
02:40:47,440 --> 02:40:49,200
updated

2588
02:40:49,520 --> 02:40:52,840
in which the Muslim contributed
and she also contributed.

2589
02:40:52,840 --> 02:40:55,360
She has that tools framework right

2590
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:59,640
so at this point

2591
02:41:01,160 --> 02:41:04,080
the stuff main
which I still have is updated.

2592
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:04,760
Right.

2593
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:08,640
And now if you want to work on her
new user story, what she's going to do,

2594
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:10,120
she's going to check out from

2595
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:14,160
the point where she has

2596
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:17,040
the framework available
and she's going to name

2597
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:22,320
it, let's say

2598
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:28,560
user story.

2599
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:30,400
What let's say that.

2600
02:41:30,400 --> 02:41:38,160
And for that she's going to open up
terminal.

2601
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:41,280
You get check out user

2602
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:45,000
story. First.

2603
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,880
Last question is to create a path

2604
02:41:47,880 --> 02:41:50,640
user story

2605
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:53,280
one, then give

2606
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:56,320
user story one of you.

2607
02:41:56,320 --> 02:42:00,560
Now if you do the story line,
she has the access to all the common

2608
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:04,800
methods and she can simply proceed
on working with her user story.

2609
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:07,520
Having the I want just using everything

2610
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:09,400
how to

2611
02:42:10,400 --> 02:42:13,920
then you must demand
and know that were most of these

2612
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:18,400
okay guys so is this now clear to everyone

2613
02:42:19,160 --> 02:42:21,280
that's how you are supposed
to work on the framework

2614
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:24,480
and how you are supposed to work
in collaboration?

2615
02:42:24,480 --> 02:42:28,800
I really hope that now you got to not
be having any kind of problems.

2616
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:32,360
You know how to call the code,
push the code and stuff like that.

2617
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:36,240
You know how to update a particular
branch, you know how to download it.

2618
02:42:36,600 --> 02:42:39,280
And, you know,
I would think one last thing

2619
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:42,680
that I want to share with you
that's going to be

2620
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:46,760
if you get to work right
now, I'll just be sending

2621
02:42:46,800 --> 02:43:21,120
you what?

2622
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,160
Okay, guys. So

2623
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:25,000
here are

2624
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:28,640
the gift slides that we have

2625
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:31,160
that are a little bit complex like,

2626
02:43:31,320 --> 02:43:34,240
but we have all have all the things

2627
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:36,680
that I have taught you already, But

2628
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:41,760
I don't really like this structure, but
I hope that they are going to help you.

2629
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:47,160
The contains all the information
that we have already discussed.

2630
02:43:47,160 --> 02:43:49,880
You know, it's
going to be a little bit more

2631
02:43:51,520 --> 02:43:53,600
detailed. So

2632
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:57,840
I'm going to share these slides with to

2633
02:43:57,840 --> 02:43:59,640
on the canvas.

2634
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:04,960
We have some screenshots we got in GitHub
also that

2635
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:09,440
how can you work GitHub
and stuff like that on the terminal?

2636
02:44:09,440 --> 02:44:13,080
If you guys have a problem,
just make sure that you visit

2637
02:44:13,080 --> 02:44:15,280
these slides and

2638
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:20,280
and where you need to review
every concept.

2639
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:24,280
You can just, you know, for example,
if you forgot

2640
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:28,360
how to open up a full request, just go to
the political section over there.

2641
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:29,080
You'll see

2642
02:44:30,120 --> 02:44:31,680
how to open up a new tool.

2643
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:32,920
First.

2644
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:37,400
But there might be one thing
that the interface has updated

2645
02:44:37,720 --> 02:44:41,920
the got in GitHub, so you may need to find
those buttons like.

2646
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:45,440
There may be some up and down
and there are

2647
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:48,720
some slides are much less conflict.

2648
02:44:48,720 --> 02:44:50,000
So I'm going to share this.

2649
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:53,160
All of you do have them and

2650
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:57,160
see how I can help you out on the canvas.

2651
02:44:57,160 --> 02:45:04,320
Dennis I'm going to share it
with you guys on canvas.

2652
02:45:04,320 --> 02:45:07,640
Well, yeah,
everything that we have studied in detail,

2653
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:12,680
letting out what we have to discuss,
nothing is going to give them.

2654
02:45:12,680 --> 02:45:16,240
Oh, you guys are the same with,
you know, it's

2655
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:19,800
all we shared it with you on canvas.

2656
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:25,000
The slides and after that, I'm going
to quickly send all of you the invites.

2657
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:29,040
Just make sure that
if you do not get an invite within

2658
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:33,240
15 minutes, just let me know
in the student support center,

2659
02:45:33,240 --> 02:45:36,080
because after that
I will not be available for the whole date

2660
02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:41,760
if any group member of yours is left out
because I'll be having the morning.

2661
02:45:42,360 --> 02:45:45,560
Okay, So I'm going to add everyone

2662
02:45:45,760 --> 02:45:49,000

2663
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Okay?
