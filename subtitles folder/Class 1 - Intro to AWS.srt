1
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,240
Okay, So hello, everyone.

2
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,960
Can you guys hear me now?

3
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Okay. I'm really sorry.

4
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,000
I suppose somewhere in my camera setting,

5
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,080
everything just got disrupted,

6
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,440
so I had to adjust that.

7
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,640
Life is good, Murray.

8
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm not.

9
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,520
I was there, and you are not.

10
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,240
I thought that you just a left
or something.

11
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
I'm doing good for her.

12
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,840
Thank you.

13
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,280
I just said please record.

14
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,160
I am.

15
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,200
Actually. It's regarding.

16
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,160
Yeah, right here.

17
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,080
So I think the camera is good.

18
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,920
Yeah, it's good.

19
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,720
Okay, so let me start sharing my screen.

20
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,240
I'm really sorry.

21
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,280
I was not prepared for this accident.

22
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,560
And by the way, can you guys hear me out?

23
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,280
Okay, perfect.

24
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:49,280
That's great.

25
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,160
Okay, so what's up, guys?

26
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,720
How have you been doing?

27
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,320
And how many of you are
looking for a job right now?

28
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,080
Yeah, I was planning on

29
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,400
posting them somewhere.

30
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,440
Okay, so you guys are in the job market.

31
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,240
Okay, perfect.

32
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,000
So most of I knew that

33
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,360
you. You had an assignment.

34
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,440
Okay, so a little has an interview

35
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,080
as soon as looking for a job
and you started.

36
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,840
Great.

37
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,160
Okay, perfect.

38
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,200
Best of luck, everyone.

39
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,080
I hope that you guys are prepared and

40
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,000
ready for the market.

41
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,760
I don't see. I shudder.

42
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,080
I say is not here.

43
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,800
And who else is missing

44
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,080
now? Zima is eight good

45
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
flying 50 jobs per day.

46
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,160
Oh, my God.

47
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:53,480
That's going to be happy.

48
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,120
Okay, so today what we are going to do,
we will be starting our AWP session

49
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
and it's going to be
most probably two classes.

50
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,280
We will have one today and the other one
is going to be on Saturday.

51
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,800
1050. Yeah.

52
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,960
So before we jump into it,

53
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,840
I want to make sure that we know that
what we are jumping into,

54
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,280
that whatever you have learned so far, AWP

55
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,120
is a totally different thing from that.

56
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,320
It's impossible actually to cover it.

57
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,320
And, you know, even 3 to 4 months

58
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,880
because there is a lot of information

59
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,680
that you need to know in order to be able
to work efficiently with clouds.

60
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,400
But the purpose of these two classes
is that you are,

61
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,240
you know,
the basic terminologies of cloud.

62
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,920
You know, that what is actually cloud.

63
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,560
And when you are communicating with
someone, you can actually talk about it.

64
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,760
That's it.

65
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,520
Don't expect that after learning this

66
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,560
end of this thing,
you'll be able to work on cloud or,

67
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,600
you know, you will be actually able
to deploy some stuff.

68
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,560
That's not going to happen
because cloud is a whole

69
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,040
new volume domain and we have another
six months goes for that.

70
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,360
And if someone
is interested in taking that,

71
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,120
you guys are welcome.

72
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,120
How long is the class?

73
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,280
It's going to be around
3:00, 3 hours for today.

74
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,880
And on Saturday, I don't know, maybe
4 hours, maybe 3 hours, maybe 5 hours.

75
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,560
Depends upon the piece that we are on.

76
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,240
And you need a break at 750.

77
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
Okay.

78
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,920
We are going to be having a break

79
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,600
on. It's after one hour.

80
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,880
So it's going to be 730.

81
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,160
Okay, great.

82
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,680
So do
do you guys have your accounts created for

83
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,120
you? Yes.

84
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,760
Okay, perfect.

85
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
So the first step is done.

86
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,760
Let me open up the notes

87
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:17,760
and then we can start.

88
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay.

89
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
If you do not have your account
created, then

90
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,360
I would suggest
that you create an account.

91
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:33,360
So I'll

92
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,120
just go typing Google

93
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
into Bliss and then you will

94
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,000
have this website opened up,

95
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,320
click on sign in or sign up.

96
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,560
And that is going to take you to the page
where you can actually create an account

97
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,320
on any of us.

98
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,160
That's it.

99
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:06,560
Just okay,

100
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,840
So first of all, we need to understand
that what cloud is actually.

101
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,280
And then after that, you will be jumping
into some basic terminologies

102
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,280
that you will be hearing throughout

103
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,400
Altoid when we jump to cloud.

104
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:30,920
Okay, so what is a cloud?

105
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,240
The first question that

106
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,600
we should be answering to.

107
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:41,640
So what do you guys think?

108
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,240
It's a storage.

109
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,600
Okay, so then what's the difference
between Google Drive and a cloud?

110
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
If it's just a storage,
then can iCloud Google drive

111
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,080
a cloud?

112
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,360
Then we should
also call GitHub cloud, right

113
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,360
now, cloud is not just only storage.

114
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,840
We can see that
storage is one of the components

115
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:32,240
of the cloud.

116
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,720
Yes, well, that's the perfect definition.

117
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,080
Cloud. Someone else's computer.

118
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,680
Yeah, that's something that we can see

119
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,160
multiple of different types of platforms.

120
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,800
E Yeah, close enough.

121
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,680
Okay, so let's

122
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,560
discuss about what is that?

123
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,640
Let me see.

124
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,440
Okay, so basically a cloud comprises

125
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,240
of a storage location, compute power

126
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,920
and a lot of different resources
that are available to you.

127
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,800
But that also doesn't it
are the concept that

128
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,920
what a cloud actually is and

129
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,120
how is it working?

130
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,680
Okay, if it's asking for the payment info,
enter your credit card number.

131
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,720
It's going to charge you $1.

132
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,000
And if you do not do the things

133
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,640
that I told you not to do,
you will not be charged.

134
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,840
But if if you will be playing around
without my instructions,

135
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,560
you will be charged a lot. Okay.

136
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,600
The just create an account
and the credit card number.

137
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,920
It's going to charge you only $1.

138
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:56,760
That's it.

139
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,280
Okay, So let's start with
why do we need a cloud in the first place?

140
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,960
Let's imagine
that you are working in a company

141
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,520
and you have a project for which
you need a very high compute power.

142
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,200
And let's say

143
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,280
you do not have that kind of compute
or that kind of available to you.

144
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,120
So where are you going to do

145
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,280
rent it?

146
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,960
Okay, Do organization rent it,
know that they will not go for rent?

147
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,520
Most probably.

148
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,120
What they are going to do, they will just
buy you a new laptop, buy you a new PC.

149
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,640
Upgraded something like that.

150
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,400
Right.

151
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,760
So you can fulfill your project

152
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,600
depending upon the requirements.

153
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,520
But the major problem
and that is going to be that

154
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
in some other project,

155
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,840
you may need, again,
more resources, right?

156
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,680
So for that purpose, again,
the company is going to have to

157
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,520
provide you with a lot of other hardware
or compute power again.

158
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,680
And it's not going to be just with you,

159
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,120
but other resources are also going
to be facing the same issues

160
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,320
and same thing goes for the server side.

161
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
For example, you have a server.

162
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,560
You guys do understand that.

163
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:29,640
What's a server, right?

164
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,040
So for example, you have an application
that you are running on a server

165
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,800
that is, you know, located in your
your company.

166
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,680
Let's say
it's the service in your company,

167
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,120
but over the beautiful time,
what happens is that

168
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,080
the traffic load increases a lot

169
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,720
and you have to upgrade that server,

170
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,400
but you are not able to predict that.

171
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,840
How much traffic is there going to be
and you will do what

172
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,440
you will just be upgrading it
depending upon the need.

173
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,200
And there might be times
when the traffic is low for example,

174
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,640
let's say a six years oh sorry,
six months a year, the traffic is low

175
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,800
and the other six months
the traffic is high on the server.

176
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,120
But the cost that you will be paying
for that

177
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,280
particular server
is going to be the can't be constant.

178
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,200
You will have to upgrade it no matter,
even if you are

179
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,960
not using its full capacity.

180
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,000
So this is one of the major reason that

181
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,800
people prefer to use cloud

182
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,640
is the use case due

183
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:47,840
to everyone.

184
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:57,200
Any questions that you may have regarding
this particular use case?

185
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Okay, perfect.

186
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,320
Okay. So then let's discuss that.

187
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:13,880
How a cloud was formed,
Amazon and other companies out there,

188
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,280
they visualized this problem
and they came up with a business

189
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,400
that can help the world

190
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,720
and also generate profits for them.

191
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,920
So so what they did is

192
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,120
they created a data center

193
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:40,840
somewhere, let's say in New York.

194
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:59,160
And when I say data center,
what do I mean by that?

195
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:16,280
Okay,
so the data center is actually a building.

196
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,960
And in this building, what they have is

197
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,200
they have

198
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
CPU's

199
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,760
Ram and storage

200
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
and they are not like

201
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,640
just limited amount, but a huge amount
of CPU that good amount of RAM,

202
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,840
a huge amount of storage that is available
in a particular datacenter.

203
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,680
So they created these this data center

204
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,440
somewhere on let's say New York.

205
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,000
And what they did
is they connected it with the internet

206
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,640
Now to give all the peoples

207
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,840
who are working in companies
or maybe from offices or home

208
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,800
to give them an option,
that whenever you need some resource

209
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,960
you can use the resource
from their data center

210
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,360
and be them only for what you have used
are gold.

211
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,640
They are like 3 to 4 billing methods
that they have on their website.

212
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,400
We will discuss them talking.

213
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,840
So they they just said that okay,
if you want some kind of resource

214
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,800
for your company or individual, use
what you can do is instead of buying that,

215
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,280
you can just rent it out from us
and it is going to cost you very less.

216
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,160
So let's say I'm a person
who is working on some project and I

217
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,960
need a resource and immediate resource
and I'm not willing to pay for it.

218
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,200
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to connect to the Internet

219
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
and access this particular

220
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,360
data center,
and I'm going to connect myself

221
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,640
to the CPU RAM and storage

222
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,600
available in this particular data center.

223
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,040
So basically
I will be creating my own virtual computer

224
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,600
inside this particular data center.

225
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,000
I can access that computer,
I can work on it, and once I have word,

226
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,720
I can choose to quit, that I can choose to

227
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,560
not use it or not pay for it.

228
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,080
And in that sense,
I will not have to pay for extra resources

229
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,360
like my project is also, after six months,
I don't need these resources.

230
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,040
I would not be paying for them.

231
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,920
So that's how cloud saves money

232
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,640
for the people
who are actually in need of it.

233
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,080
Who wants to use cloud or work on

234
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:47,680
big projects. I

235
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,960
was under the topic all of this pricing.

236
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,160
Yeah, because

237
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,880
what are the projects?

238
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
And we still need the data.

239
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,240
So if your project has ended
and did not need the resources,

240
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,600
there are multiple options either
what you can do is

241
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,400
you can say that okay,
I don't want to quit using the resources.

242
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,960
I don't want my data to be lost.

243
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,960
I want it to be there,
but I will not be using your resources.

244
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,920
So do not charge me
until I use any of the resources.

245
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,520
So what they are going to do,
they are going to

246
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,840
keep your data over there,

247
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,000
but they will not be charging you
until unless you accessed those resources.

248
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,920
Once you access them, only
then they will be charging that.

249
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,280
And why is it beneficial for them?

250
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,720
Because they get your data
and you know, in the modern world,

251
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:54,920
data is money, right?

252
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,160
Okay.

253
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,800
So we have different kinds of payment
policies that we have on lease on demand

254
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,720
and there is a

255
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,320
a detailed listing of what
the on demand pricing means.

256
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,840
And apart from that,
we have spot instances and other

257
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,120
also I think that I'm not going detailed,

258
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,840
but I'll just give you a short overview
from the slides about what they are

259
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,120
and then you can

260
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:43,760
let me open up that the slide for you
guys.

261
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,040
Okay.

262
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,920
So you can get charge
for the amount of resources you use

263
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,880
and the amount of the time
you use them for you.

264
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,840
You will be charged
depending upon the amount of data

265
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,880
that you are storing

266
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,720
and the data transfer

267
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,440
that you download or upload,
you will be charged on that.

268
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:02,840
Okay.

269
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,440
For the models you have simple model,
which is pay as you go.

270
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,720
Simply pay
for whatever resources you are using.

271
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,800
Save when you reserve,
reserve your instances for a year

272
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,520
like this means that you say that
okay, I will be using these

273
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,520
resources for one year
and whether you use them or not,

274
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,240
you will be paying for them

275
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,240
and you get a discount in that part
from that.

276
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,960
Be less by using more.

277
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,640
If you are using a lot of resources,
you get a discount.

278
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,000
So there is like different models for

279
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,960
Amazon.

280
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,280
We are not interested in that
because most probably we will not be

281
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,800
the ones who will be taking this to see.

282
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,600
And this is totally dependent
upon, dependent upon the cloud team

283
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
to select
that which method they will be using.

284
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,760
Okay, so here's the good news.

285
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,000
We have free tier available
to us on on Amazon.

286
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,800
What is free tier?

287
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,760
Free tier is that Amazon
has given us free compute resources

288
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,600
that we can use
without being charged any amount.

289
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,480
But they have obviously some limitations

290
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,080
and we have like it

291
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,960
best featuring
do it sound 50 hours of Linux and

292
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,040
for Windows also we have t

293
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,280
to my for instance which are free

294
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,320
for one year.

295
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,040
Okay. So I'll share this slides with you.

296
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:32,600
If someone wants to go in depth of the
pricing model, you guys can achieve them.

297
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,760
Okay. Just give me a moment.

298
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,160
I need to bring my mouse.

299
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,840
It's still some water left over here.

300
00:26:38,840 --> 00:27:19,840
Just giving you.

301
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,880
Okay, So

302
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,720
now let's talk about

303
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,400
global infrastructure that how it becomes

304
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,480
more efficient
and more effective in providing resources.

305
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,200
So when they were building this floating,

306
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:43,680
what they actually did is
they did not just remain to one center.

307
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,640
So this is the earth, let's say,

308
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,000
and these are different countries
and regions on Earth

309
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:06,600
that I'm going to draw.

310
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,520
They created one of the data centers,
let's say, in New York, left

311
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,280
the other one.

312
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,320
They chose California,

313
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,960
then somewhere
on, you know, somewhere inside of Europe

314
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,480
and then India and let's
say some in Pakistan.

315
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,720
So they have multiple data centers
throughout the globe.

316
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:36,960
They all are connected with each other,
all the data centers.

317
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,440
They are connected.

318
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,160
Someone sitting, let's say, near
the data center, which is in New York,

319
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,400
when he wants to access TWC
and have some resources in that,

320
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,520
what he is going to do,
he will select that.

321
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,120
Give me the resource from the data
center, which is in New York.

322
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
You can
also select that, give me the resource

323
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,360
somewhere in India or Pakistan
or maybe in New York.

324
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,920
But the problem with
that is going to be that

325
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,040
these data centers are located
very far away from his current location.

326
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,480
So the data latency,
the response time is going to be slow.

327
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,720
So the best choice
is to choose the data center,

328
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,000
which is closest and nearest to you.

329
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,280
And apart
from that, one of the major purpose

330
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,360
of having multiple
data center is redundancy.

331
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,880
So for example,
let's say due to some economic crisis

332
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,320
or let's say some natural disaster,
one of the data center is

333
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,600
not working, it's destroyed.

334
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,000
Still, they are they have the backups
on other data centers.

335
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,520
So this whole infrastructure

336
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:58,080
of data centers
connected in a manner that they can retain

337
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,280
information, have backups, provide you
different services, storage, compute.

338
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,840
This whole infrastructure
is called a cloud,

339
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:15,200
not just the storage,
nor does it make sense.

340
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:27,720
And that's the reason it's called cloud.

341
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,960
Are these wired connections
between the dozens across the countries,

342
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,200
a belt between the regions?

343
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,680
Let's say New York and Jersey, They have

344
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,760
the cable low latency cable
that connects them.

345
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,000
And I believe that between countries, it's
not the direct cable.

346
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,840
Rather, they use the Internet for that.

347
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,440
It's like impossible
for them to lay out a whole cable.

348
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,120
Right.

349
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,240
So when it comes to regions, for example,

350
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,040
to close regions,
if they are they prefer to use

351
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,680
they prefer to lay out a cable between
both of them

352
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,280
because that is going to provide
a very high speed.

353
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,320
But when it comes to some remote location,
which is very far off,

354
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:47,160
then they connect using the internet.

355
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,200
Okay, So right now

356
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,440
we have IPv4 availability zones.

357
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,520
Availability zones
means that in 84 locations

358
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,640
we have this anyplace available

359
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,000
with 26 geographic regions.

360
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,880
The geographic regions
being covered are 26

361
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,000
and they are planning on 24
more availability zone.

362
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,920
So if you have a look at this particular
map of the earth, you can see that

363
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,480
the blue dots represents the regions
where you have eight of this available.

364
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,800
So it's in let's see,
this one is in Northern California.

365
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,360
Which one is this? Oregon.

366
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,240
I never heard about it.

367
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,960
This is U.S. West Island,

368
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,160
Europe,

369
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,880
Hong Kong, which Singapore.

370
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,600
So these are the zones where they have
their actual physical buildings available.

371
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,360
And the orange ones
are the ones that they will be soon

372
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,800
creating their infrastructure over there.

373
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,840
So they are planning on in Melbourne
and in UAE and Abbottabad,

374
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,920
which is that edge about like
it's in India, I guess it's India.

375
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,960
Okay, perfect. So

376
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,080
this is about the global infrastructure.

377
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,320
And now let's talk something about regions
and availability zones.

378
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,880
So what do you guys understand
by a region?

379
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:25,520
If I see that in this region
it abuses available,

380
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,320
What do you guys understand by that area?

381
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,680
So whenever we say a region,
it means that a specific region

382
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,720
like for example
Asia, the US you get these are regions

383
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,640
and now we are
going to talk about availability zones.

384
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,880
So let me open up the diagram again.

385
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,960
This time the earth is not,
you know, we're

386
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,520
so this particular thing is

387
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,840
a region

388
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,800
and we have another region
and we have another region.

389
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,520
Okay?

390
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,160
Now, inside every region
we have availability zones.

391
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,240
So what do you guys understand
or think that availability zone

392
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,440
can be

393
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,360
zones?

394
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,440
Availability
zones are basically the actual

395
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,560
data centers

396
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,680
that are there inside, our region.

397
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,640
So this is going to be called
one availability zone

398
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,440
and this is the second availability zones

399
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,000
and in each region.

400
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,400
We can have multiple

401
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,480
availability zones, there can be two,

402
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,160
there can be three, there can be four

403
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:29,960
depending

404
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,360
upon the structure.

405
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,720
Okay.

406
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,040
So a region
must have at least two availability zones.

407
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,480
The reason is again, redundancy.

408
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,480
If someone is us,
the other data center is not available.

409
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,040
It's facing down time.

410
00:35:50,040 --> 00:36:01,320
The other one is there to back it up.

411
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,880
Okay,
so now what we are going to discuss is

412
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,040
something technical

413
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,000
availability zones are chosen on

414
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,960
the demand of the region.

415
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:27,800
What do you mean by those
and on the demand of the region?

416
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,120
Okay.

417
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,000
If you are talking about that location,
how do they choose a location?

418
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,720
I have no idea about. It
maybe they're are that okay?

419
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,680
This is

420
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,200
the availability zone, which is

421
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,040
cheap.

422
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,280
So we should have a data center over there
and one of the techniques

423
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,520
that they do use
is that they plan on actually covering

424
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,840
the major portion
on the whole deal. Right.

425
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,360
So in their topology,
whatever technique they have,

426
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,600
they must be looking upon

427
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,920
an infrastructure that can cover

428
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,040
the most surroundings by being there.

429
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,480
So I guess that's the

430
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,960
population, no population.

431
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,400
I don't think the population is going
to be one of the factors in choosing that.

432
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,800
But rather,

433
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,400
did they predict like this that, okay, in
future we need to cover the whole globe.

434
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,320
That's how they move.

435
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,600
They do not like to see, okay,
the population is there.

436
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,080
Let's go over there.

437
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,040
They move in the sense that, okay, in
future we have to cover the whole globe.

438
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,080
So that's how they gradually move on to

439
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,240
from one place to another.

440
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:36,480
Okay.

441
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,440
So now whenever
we are going to talk about region,

442
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,120
I hope that you get the idea of an hour,

443
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:47,280
you'll see availability zone,
you will get an idea.

444
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,440
Okay, now I want you guys to do
is sign into your A.W.

445
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,320
accounts.

446
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,400
If you do not have one,
just create one by clicking on

447
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,680
by. Just click on Google eight of us.

448
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,400
Click on the first leg.

449
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,520
After that, click on sign up for me.

450
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,800
I already have signed in, so I think that
will be opening up the same page for me.

451
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,320
Oh yeah. It's not for you guys.

452
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,800
It's going to open up some page,
like create a new user,

453
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,240
create a new user over there.

454
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Oh no, it's not showing for me.

455
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,720
I already have it created.

456
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,240
So just go ahead.

457
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,600
Sign up into your accounts
and your credit card number.

458
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,840
You'll be charged $1 for that.

459
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,640
And after that, once
you are done with this, you can proceed.

460
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,760
And one thing that is important,
you guys do not need to worry

461
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,080
about whether you will be using it
for work or home offices.

462
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,240
Just select any option
that you want to set up your accounts

463
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,040
and we will be good to go.

464
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Okay, Take 4 minutes to setup

465
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,000
and meanwhile, give me 2 minutes to

466
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,120
just have some water because I think

467
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,520
it's almost the time for that for me.

468
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,280
And then we can you

469
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,960
just give me 2 minutes.

470
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,360
So new user besides admin, just.

471
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,520
Yeah, just had a new user.

472
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,960
Not not a you need to create a root user.

473
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,280
Okay.

474
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,240
If you get that option, create
a root user.

475
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,480
The admin one
you do not need to have another

476
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,200
user.

477
00:39:25,200 --> 00:41:23,360
Besides at the now,

478
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,440
I believe that all of you have

479
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
created the accounts

480
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,760
and let's go ahead and explore

481
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,160
it a little bit.

482
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:41,840
So in my account,
if you click on IT management

483
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,640
console, it's going to take you to
this particular window.

484
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,720
Is it the same for everyone

485
00:41:48,720 --> 00:42:12,840
or is it a little bit different?

486
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,720
Yeah, it's same message for you.

487
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,000
Okay.

488
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,200
It can be a little different
because it was just

489
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,320
recently changed their

490
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,200
interface.

491
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,640
This is it does not matter.

492
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,880
It's recently visited.

493
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,880
So this doesn't matter
if you do not see this.

494
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,320
They have just changed the interface.

495
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,280
If you want to go ahead and apply

496
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,560
those changes,
you might see an option above here.

497
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,760
You can click on that
and it will change your interface

498
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,000
to the same one
that you see on the screen.

499
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
If not, that's fine.

500
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,000
Okay,

501
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,080
So now let's explore it a little bit.

502
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:54,040
On the right top corner,
you can see your account ID

503
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,960
and the name with which you signed up.

504
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,840
Okay, Over here we see all the regions
and the visibility zones that we have.

505
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,160
So this US east is the region and in here
we have two availability

506
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,520
zones, one in Virginia
and the other one is in Ohio.

507
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,320
Similarly, we have U.S.

508
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,440
West, another region with two availability

509
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,120
zones and North California and Oregon.

510
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,720
And we have then

511
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,160
a list of available
regions and availability zones.

512
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,480
So I'm going to choose for myself

513
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,440
somewhere in Asia.

514
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,040
So this one is the closest to me.

515
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,200
So I'm going to use this one
wherever it is closest to you.

516
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,080
Go ahead to that one.

517
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,400
And it's going to be mentioned above that.

518
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,440
Okay, You are now

519
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,720
whatever you are going to be doing,
you will be actually doing that.

520
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,560
This particular availability zone
in this particular data

521
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:14,880
center.

522
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,200
Okay.

523
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:25,360
Are we good till this point?

524
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,880
Okay. Now

525
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,320
the first thing

526
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,360
that we need to explore is cloud watch.

527
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,560
So in this particular search bar,
just type in cloud watch

528
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,640
and there you'll see a service
named Cloud Watch.

529
00:44:45,640 --> 00:45:06,480
Click on that
and it will take you to someplace.

530
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:06,800
Okay.

531
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:15,600
Are you guys on this page?

532
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,920
Okay, perfect.

533
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,520
Now, this is the location.

534
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,360
From there
you can have the estimate of your billings

535
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,160
and whatever resources you are using.

536
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,240
So basically, cloud
watch is just like a meter in eight of us.

537
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,200
So if you click on billing Dashboard, it's
going to take you to a dashboard

538
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,840
which shows the trends off your charges,
your time that you have.

539
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,880
That particular resource
and other options are also there,

540
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,080
like alarms logs,
you can create an alarm that, okay, if my

541
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,440
use this time has

542
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,800
exceed for example, 5 hours
generate an alarm.

543
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,960
If my charges have gone up to five,

544
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,080
create an alarm from me because
I don't want to pay more than that.

545
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,840
You have logs.

546
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:11,480
Logs just makes the list of errors
and the things that are going on in up.

547
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,120
Yes. So that if you run into an issue,
you guys can go ahead

548
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,600
and have that on that we have other of

549
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,040
options also,
but we will not be having a detailed

550
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,040
look on them because they are like huge.

551
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,360
Okay, now I'm going to show you

552
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,440
something interesting off of that,
which is services.

553
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,760
So in addition to just providing you guys

554
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,720
with the resources,
the Cloud eight of us provides

555
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,600
you also with
a lot of services that it has

556
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,280
so. The services, if

557
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,840
you have a look up on it,
let me click on all services.

558
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,080
We have Alexa for Business

559
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,400
API Gateway

560
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,920
and these are something you attend.

561
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,600
We will not be familiar with, but

562
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,800
let's go back a batch Bullet Billing
Conductor

563
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,880
Bracket Budget
Certificate Manager, Chat bot.

564
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:24,120
You guys know about chat box,

565
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,240
you don't know about checkbox.

566
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,760
So have you ever visited a website
where like this

567
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,040
pop up opens up saying that, Hey,
let me know

568
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,680
if you want some help.

569
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,280
He had that one.

570
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,920
Now you know what a chat box, right?

571
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,560
So they are chat bots, basically.

572
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,560
They're all bots who can chat.

573
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,880
So let's see that.

574
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,600
Let's say
that Ekaterina is developing a website.

575
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,920
She had one online store
and what she wants is to have a chat.

576
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,760
What I would do and she does not know
that how to set up a chat bot.

577
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,360
So you can simply use

578
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,760
this chat bot which they have made already

579
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,840
and integrate her online store with this
and that's it.

580
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,400
She does not need to write down
the whole board.

581
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,440
She does not need to develop the chat bot
from scratch.

582
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,160
It's already available
for her to integrate

583
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:32,320
with her online store application,
whatever she is using.

584
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,640
But from that we have.

585
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,920
Let me show you some other

586
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:48,480
interesting services.

587
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,040
Okay, So

588
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,640
let's go with this one database.

589
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:57,000
So they have some databases
also available.

590
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,960
One is Amazon document.

591
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,320
It's Amazon, all of its own database

592
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,560
Dynamo DB Elastic, Ashi, Amazon,

593
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,160
these PCs,
these are all the databases that

594
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,240
it has for you guys to utilize.

595
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:13,680
Okay.

596
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,920
Now, one of the question
is that okay, like there were like

597
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,640
7 to 8 kinds of databases
that it's providing.

598
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,920
So can we get to know of them?

599
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,080
No, we cannot.

600
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,600
How are we going to select
the one that we need?

601
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,400
Well, just go ahead.

602
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,400
Open the one.

603
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,120
Any one, let's say,

604
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,600
and you can read about it
in this documentation,

605
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,280
that what's the advantage
of using this particular database from us?

606
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,560
And then depending upon that,
you can make a decision

607
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,520
whether you need to use this one or not.

608
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,840
So similarly,

609
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,520
any other that you want to use,
you can go ahead, have some study about it

610
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,840
and, you know, decide
whether you need this one or not.

611
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,560
So again, you will not be going in detail
off the databases one by one,

612
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,520
because that is in itself
a whole new domain

613
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,440
developer tools

614
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,320
and user computing groups.

615
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,720
Let me show you.

616
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,360
Machine learning.

617
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah.

618
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,120
Okay.

619
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,360
In machine learning, there was one of the

620
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,680
most exciting service that I

621
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,320
once went to.

622
00:50:42,840 --> 00:51:03,960
No, it was maybe in I am unable to have
that service in front of me right now.

623
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,520
But let's see, I'm going to tell you.

624
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,560
So let's say that you need to develop
an application

625
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,560
using which

626
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,480
you can scan,
detect the face of the person,

627
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,000
and depending upon if that person

628
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,120
is authorized to open up the gate,

629
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,560
you will if not, you will just not open up
that you are supposed

630
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,280
to develop this application
and you do not know how to code.

631
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,640
You do not know how to use any language
to write down this particular group.

632
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,800
You can simply go to Amazon.

633
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,880
They have this kind of application
or service already available.

634
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,920
You guys can use that application
and create such a system

635
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,280
without writing even one line of code
and your work will be done.

636
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,080
So there are like 200 plus services

637
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:01,320
that Amazon is offering right now
and they are scaling on daily basis.

638
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,880
So if someone
says that I am the expert of cloud,

639
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,120
I know all the services that are there,
he is most proudly lying about it

640
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:25,200
because that's impossible.

641
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,800
What would be mainly asked
regarding eight of us and then each of you

642
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,800
most probably you guys will be asked that.

643
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,400
Okay. Are you familiar with cloud?

644
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,000
That's it.

645
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,120
I believe that you will not be asked
in-depth about

646
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,600
anything from over here, because

647
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:47,400
usually the work of a test
or if you are planning for

648
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,320
an automation test or job,
most probably you will not be expected

649
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,760
to have an experience with,
you know, working around with services.

650
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,440
This is the main

651
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,720
responsibility of DevOps team to

652
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,320
actually work with them.

653
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,440
So you guys will not

654
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,240
be actually working with it
on the premises, even even in your jobs.

655
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,280
This is not at all

656
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,640
going to be your responsibility

657
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,000
if you are in a company
who works in a structured manner.

658
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,680
But again,

659
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,520
there can be a company was

660
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,360
not that much big
and they may expect that, okay,

661
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,600
we do not have a separate resource
for cloud.

662
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,760
So you are responsible
for also handling the cloud,

663
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,040
but obviously you will be doing stuff
which is not the part of your job.

664
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,000
Which part is good to learn.

665
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,040
So we will be targeting
one of the service of us,

666
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,360
which is easy to instance,

667
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,760
because that is the one
that is the most basic.

668
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,440
And after that,

669
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,120
if anyone wants to learn
any of the service,

670
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,920
I'm sure you guys will be able to do it
without much of the struggle.

671
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,560
So now you guys,

672
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,840
I think, get the idea
of how good the cloud is.

673
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,520
So this particular course

674
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,720
that we have, these two classes,
how we have structured it,

675
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,120
we have structured it in the sense
that you understand

676
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,000
the basics of cloud, you understand
the terminologies and one service

677
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,160
we will be teaching you in there
that, okay, if you

678
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,200
you should know that, okay,
how you can go ahead

679
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,240
and if you want to work on some service,
how can you actually do that?

680
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,960
So again,
we will give you the methodology.

681
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:42,000
If you want to go ahead, explore
the services, you will be able to do that.

682
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,040
These two classes.

683
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:57,480
Okay, Why are we learning it
if you are not using it?

684
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:04,080
I don't know how to answer that.

685
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,560
Okay.

686
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,960
This.

687
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,800
Yeah.

688
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,000
Let's assume that you guys
are not in an office with a

689
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,160
person who is who works on cloud,

690
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,280
where you have something to talk in
common on the coffee

691
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,120
machine.

692
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,520
Okay.

693
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,040
He might be talking about.

694
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,160
Well, you know, my

695
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,280
my region is down that you will apply.

696
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,920
Okay, What's our region
might be like saying that.

697
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,040
Okay, I'm setting up a VPN in New York.

698
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,480
You are setting up a VPN. Okay.

699
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,520
What's a VPN
that you guys can have a good chat.

700
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,360
Okay. Jokes apart.

701
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,680
The main purpose is that

702
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,520
you don't just like any of the thing,

703
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:57,880
if you know the basics, if you understand
the basics that okay, let's see

704
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,240
what is a cloud, For example,
if you understand that okay,

705
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,280
what is a cloud and how to,
you know, work with it on the basics

706
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,080
if you want in future to go ahead
and research

707
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,760
on something advanced on it,
you will be able to do it right.

708
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,680
So you might need it.

709
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,600
You might not.

710
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,520
This is obviously not
a part part of our course,

711
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,160
the asset goals that we have.

712
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,920
But this is an additional thing
that we have been doing since March nine,

713
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,480
I believe that we plan on including it
so that if in future you guys get a chance

714
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,360
to work on cloud, you should be capable
enough to start working on it.

715
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:43,360
Not just like, okay,
we do not even understand it, okay?

716
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,520
They asked me if I know anything
about aid abuse and doctors

717
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:55,920
as and what was your reply?

718
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,800
Did you tell them that?

719
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,320
Yeah.

720
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,680
Professional.

721
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,360
Okay.

722
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,320
Well,

723
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,680
after you are done with the classes,
the nice answer to this question,

724
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,480
let me tell you,
if someone asked you that,

725
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,920
do you know anything about aid
abuse doctors?

726
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,280
You can say, Yeah, we do know what is it?

727
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,240
Abuse and we do not What is doctors like?

728
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,440
I have not actually worked
with them a lot,

729
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,920
but I do have a little bit experience

730
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,520
working with them, with my crew members,
our coaching and teammates.

731
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,280
We have, you know,
I do have the knowledge about it.

732
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,520
So it's all this better
to have a sense of what

733
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,000
the things are rather than being like,
okay, what is a doctor?

734
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,800
Let's just right now, if I asked you
what doctor, you guys are going to not

735
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,640
be able to answer it, right?
So if a person knows about

736
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,800
10 to 15% of the stuff that, okay,
what is it?

737
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,760
How does it work?

738
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,400
Most probably

739
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,440
he can be put onto that particular project
because now the high knows that will be

740
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,440
he or she is familiar enough to continue

741
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,760
working with this in advance stuff.

742
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,200
So I think that's the whole purpose
of asking that.

743
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,280
Okay, so 730
we are going to be having a break

744
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,760
right now and after that

745
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,560
we will resume our session.

746
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,200
So the break is going to be
for 30 minutes.

747
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,480
Okay.

748
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:27,600
So I'll see you guys at eight.

749
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,200
Yes, that's right.

750
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:30,840
Okay.

751
00:58:30,840 --> 01:29:16,280
I'll see you guys at eight.

752
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,280
Okay.

753
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,920
So I hope that everyone is back now.

754
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:28,040
And let's resume from where we left.

755
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:31,000
So we were talking about the services
that it provided us.

756
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,120
So a lot of services out there.

757
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,200
We will be just learning the basics,

758
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,480
identify ourselves with the terminologies
that are widely used.

759
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,640
And one of the services
which is easy to do, instance.

760
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:46,640
Okay, so now what we are going to

761
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,680
do is

762
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:52,120
first of all, let's discuss about

763
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:55,840
the root user, and I am it
because that is something

764
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,120
that you might encounter
when you are working with it.

765
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,720
So when you logged in or signed up,

766
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:06,280
did you guys see that you got two options
like a log and has root user

767
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:12,840
or logging, as I am right, you got that.

768
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,720
Okay. So let's discuss about that.

769
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:18,000
What that is actually.

770
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,200
So a root user is actually going to be
the admin

771
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:26,520
who is administrator
of this particular account.

772
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,360
He going to have access
to all the services

773
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,560
and all the content that is there on it.

774
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,440
But when you are working
in an organization,

775
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,480
obviously it's not suitable or desired.

776
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,760
They give their workers
the admin credentials

777
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:49,840
because then they can,
you know, set up machines and work on us

778
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:53,640
and, you know,
get company being paying for it.

779
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,560
And so the reason

780
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:01,920
in order to work
this way, we have different I am

781
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,200
to log in

782
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:08,880
so an admin can create different
and log in users

783
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,880
and in order to see that
how it's done, let's

784
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,240
write down in the search bar IAM

785
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,480
and let's select this iam option

786
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:26,160
that we get.

787
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:29,360
Okay.

788
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,360
So under the IAM dashboard
we have different options.

789
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,000
Number one is users

790
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,760
roles, policies and user groups.

791
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:43,160
So we will be discussing
these four of them.

792
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:56,880
And briefly.

793
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,080
Okay.

794
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:02,320
So let's go ahead first and create a user.

795
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,280
So let's say that

796
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,480
you know, sure, each is working for me

797
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,240
in a company and I want you to work on it.

798
01:32:10,640 --> 01:32:12,680
So I'm going to create a user for

799
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,400
okay, so it's not there.

800
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,600
I'll have to create it.

801
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,320
I'll click on Add user

802
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,480
and it says that

803
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:33,640
I have a user name.

804
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:33,960
Okay?

805
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,480
So now it's saying that, okay, which kind
of access do you want to give to show?

806
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,760
Do you want to give it programmatic

807
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,200
key access
or do you want to give it password access?

808
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:48,360
These are the two types of access
that I can give to show you.

809
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,000
So I'll say the password. One.

810
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,280
Okay, So which

811
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:56,160
password do you want to use, authenticated
or custom password?

812
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:01,080
I can see that I want him to use a custom
password and I can type that down,

813
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,920
whatever it is.

814
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:12,400
Okay, so let's make it.

815
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,680
It's not strong enough.

816
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:17,160
No, it's not showing it.

817
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:17,400
Okay.

818
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:20,880
Next permission.

819
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,280
Okay.

820
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:22,800
Now it's saying that.

821
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,640
Okay, Do you want to add this user

822
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:29,280
into any kind of group or not?

823
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:56,880
So what do we mean by a group?

824
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,440
So this is some user.

825
01:33:58,440 --> 01:34:00,920
Okay, so let's call it

826
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:07,920
user one.

827
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,960
And this is a group, let's call it tester

828
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:19,520
and this is I am policy

829
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,680
and this is

830
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:36,240
I am rules.

831
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:38,760
Okay,
So first of all, let's talk about rules.

832
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,120
Rules are certain.

833
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:46,560
Permissions are advanced
that you can have in a policy.

834
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:52,320
A policy is just like a document
which have different kind of rules. So

835
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,080
you may have multiple

836
01:34:55,080 --> 01:35:08,560
rules in a policy.

837
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,280
Okay.

838
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,920
Now tell me, do you guys understand
this thing that I just talked to you?

839
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:21,120
I am policy and rules.

840
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,040
Okay.

841
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,080
Now let me write

842
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:28,440
down a rule for you in to tell you that.

843
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:32,400
What kind of rules are there
access to Amazon

844
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:39,120
EC2 instance?

845
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:40,800
This is the policy that I have.

846
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,080
Okay.

847
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,040
Let's say the policy is access to Amazon.

848
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,600
Easy to instance in there I have a rule

849
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,080
which says that

850
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:53,000
the user can

851
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,160
have read access

852
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:02,040
to easy to instance what is easy to do.

853
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,840
We will discuss that later.

854
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:09,360
Let's say it's
just one of the service provided by this.

855
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:11,600
So this is one of the rule

856
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:15,480
and the other rule is the user can have

857
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,680
a right access to easy to

858
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,160
that.

859
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,480
So this is another.

860
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:28,120
So you see we have created a policy
in which they are different.

861
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,400
I am rules

862
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:34,240
now. I did I created a user and I named it

863
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:38,080
sure you know, if

864
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:43,840
I want to work on Amazon
and be able to work with easy to do

865
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:47,360
what I'm going to do,
I'll create this policy and assign

866
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:53,640
this user one, this particular policy.

867
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,600
So now, sure, if the user one has access

868
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:02,080
to these two rules
that I have implemented,

869
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,480
he can have read access
and he can have right access.

870
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:11,080
Is it clear to everyone?

871
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:19,640
Any questions?

872
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:20,600
Okay, None.

873
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:24,360
So now let's talk

874
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:28,040
about groups.

875
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:33,720
Groups is pretty simple
so we can create a group called Testers.

876
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,120
Now what I'm going to

877
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,640
do, I'm going attach the policy

878
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:42,000
that I created

879
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,640
to this particular group.

880
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,680
Now, this group, Tester
has this policy of access to Amazon, easy

881
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:54,760
to instance, in future, whenever there is
a tester who needs this access.

882
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:57,240
What I can do instead of supply.

883
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,960
Instead of assigning him
the policy individually,

884
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,840
I can simply add that user to the group

885
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:08,160
and he will have same access
so I can have multiple users

886
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:13,080
sharing the same policy.

887
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:13,440
Okay.

888
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:22,520
It's simple, right?

889
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,000
So next time

890
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,240
when you want to work on

891
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,360
or let's say there is a

892
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,200
your team members

893
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:35,560
or your team needs says that okay,
you need to work on easy to instance,

894
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:40,600
go to the cloud department and get an IAM
rule so you will not be asking that.

895
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,720
Okay. Well what are that.
I am rule, right?

896
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:45,520
Just go to the cloud about
it and see that I need the

897
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,960
I need and I

898
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:50,960
am user who
can have access to the easy to instance.

899
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,280
What kind of access do you want.

900
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:56,320
I want the full access so he can just it
and I am rule for you and give you

901
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:59,720
the credentials to the cloud and say that,
okay, these are the credentials.

902
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:03,480
If you log in using them,
you'll have access to the easy to install.

903
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:04,600
Okay.

904
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:09,000
Makes sense.

905
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:09,240
Okay.

906
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,920
So you will not most probably be

907
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,240
creating the rules are adding the users

908
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:20,040
because that is not going to be your job
part.

909
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,720
It's the part of the cloud.

910
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:24,000
But I'm going to quickly
show you how we can do that.

911
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:26,880
So we created that user, not seen that.

912
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,920
Do you want to
add this user to some group?

913
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:31,680
We can, but we cannot.

914
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,320
But right now
we do not have any user created.

915
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,520
So if you want to add it, add

916
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:39,240
this user to the group,
we will have to create a group.

917
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:43,160
So what do you want to name
that particular group?

918
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,680
Let's say I want to name it actors.

919
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:49,920
Okay, Now it's saying that

920
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,520
what kind of policies
do you want that particular group to have?

921
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:57,480
Okay, I want you to have Amazon.

922
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:59,880
Easy to

923
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,920
full access,

924
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:05,280
so I'll check on Amazon, easy to access.

925
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:09,360
Then I'll say create the group.

926
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:13,440
Okay, So now this user has been added
to testers.

927
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,520
Okay, next,

928
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,640
this is something that we will not be
discussing these as is.

929
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:22,920
This is an option. Okay.

930
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:24,240
Okay.

931
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:27,000
So now clicking on next again,

932
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,360
we have user name 31238

933
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,080
Access type management control
Controlled access with a password

934
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,320
and groups is

935
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,800
tester and the policy is

936
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,680
I am user checkbox.

937
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:49,080
Okay, this is manage policy.

938
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:52,560
Okay groups this gesture right create
the user will create the user

939
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,960
and it's going to be there. Okay.

940
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,360
So sure you've been created
now if I if I want to give sure

941
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:04,880
you have the credentials,
this is the link that I'll give him.

942
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,000
I'll send him this particular link.

943
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,320
You can log in using this party, go live
and I'll send him the password that I did.

944
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,560
I don't remember that.

945
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,600
So the lobby using it.

946
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,080
Let me just quickly show you
when I click on this link,

947
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:23,080
it takes me to

948
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:26,840
the username.

949
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:29,160
Three, one, two, three and the password.

950
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:32,320
If I entered that password,
I will have access to Amazon.

951
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:37,280
Easy to and no other service
is going to be available to me

952
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,960
using these particular credentials.

953
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,840
So now I hope
that you guys are clear about

954
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,600
the concept of root user and

955
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,520
the but we call I am user

956
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:53,200
evil.

957
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:59,080
Okay, so now let's go ahead and

958
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:13,040
it signed me out, I guess.

959
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:13,360
Okay.

960
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,920
I have to sign in

961
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:23,440
IDPs.

962
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:23,800
Okay.

963
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:34,600
There you go.

964
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:45,720
Now, let me quickly go to the I am again.

965
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:46,600
Okay. Yes.

966
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:54,800
In that by my email address.

967
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:57,120
Okay. So how many user groups do we have?

968
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,480
We created one group.

969
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:02,280
We have one user and that three roles
have been assigned three roles

970
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:04,320
which lie under one policy.

971
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:19,640
Okay.

972
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:20,000
Okay.

973
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Now what else do we need to look at

974
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,280
by typing the blurred, blurry text?

975
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:34,520
Yeah, my set is good at six by six, so

976
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,200
I got that

977
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:40,320
and thank God I don't have to use glasses.

978
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:52,680
I hate glasses.

979
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:58,040
Okay, so the next thing that I want
to do, guys, is going to be

980
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,000
easy too.

981
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,440
Okay, Now

982
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,920
I want
you guys to click on the search bar.

983
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:14,000
Enter easy to in the search bar,
and click on this particular service,

984
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,080
which is easy to click on it.

985
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:21,080
And in your dashboard
you'll see something like

986
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:35,040
this.

987
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:43,680
Okay, is it there?

988
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:45,480
Okay. Okay.

989
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:48,720
Before we jump into exploring issue
two in detail,

990
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:51,480
let's quickly
have some theoretical discussion

991
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:56,640
about what this service is actually about
and how we can utilize it

992
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:06,560
so that easy to service provided

993
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,200
by eight of us actually is used to assign

994
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,920
compute resources

995
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:15,320
using your own computer.

996
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:18,560
You can actually create a virtual machine
somewhere

997
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,840
the cloud by
using this particular service.

998
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:25,080
So when you are going to be using
the service,

999
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:29,320
what you are actually going to be doing,
you will be creating a virtual machine

1000
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,080
somewhere in a region

1001
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,160
in our availability
so you can access this machine

1002
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,040
from your own personal computer

1003
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,520
via the Internet and you can work on it
just like you want to

1004
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,280
like you can deploy on an application,

1005
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:53,600
you can write test cases,
you can like do a lot of stuff.

1006
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:57,440
And as we will be creating this instance,

1007
01:45:57,440 --> 01:46:01,840
I'll teach you step by step
that what are the things that can do?

1008
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:05,480
You have access to it
while creating and utilizing this.

1009
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,560
And instead you want easy to.

1010
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:10,800
You have like hundreds of options
that let you

1011
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,120
scale up, scale down,

1012
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:18,480
automatically launching
it instance and etc., that kind of stuff.

1013
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:21,600
So we'll be looking upon that now.

1014
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:26,720
Okay, So open up your end of this console.

1015
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,040
Let's go go to launch instance.

1016
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:33,040
So when we are single launch instance,
it means that we are

1017
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:36,600
starting a new computer,
a new virtual machine

1018
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:40,240
on the cloud
that we are going to build on our old

1019
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,960
so let's say launch instance

1020
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:48,480
and click on this particular option
would save launch instance.

1021
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:49,680
Okay.

1022
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:58,120
Do you guys see this screen now?

1023
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:03,160
Okay, so over here,
what options do we have?

1024
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:07,400
It says that choose an Amazon machine
image

1025
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:11,680
from the following.

1026
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:14,520
And what is an Amazon machine image?

1027
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,960
Now let's have a discussion about that.

1028
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:21,480
Any idea
what do you any idea about the images

1029
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,200
that you guys may already have?

1030
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,880
And it is not a virtual machine.

1031
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,560
Actually, images are a little bit
different from that.

1032
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,760
It's worse.

1033
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,160
No, it's not at all.

1034
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,520
The less

1035
01:47:45,320 --> 01:47:46,560
Amazon,

1036
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,360
Amazon, virtual machine

1037
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:55,000
image.

1038
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,880
So throughout the classes of A.W.

1039
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:02,880
s and Doctors,
we will be carrying out this term a lot.

1040
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,800
Docker image,
Amazon Virtual Machine image.

1041
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,160
And there can be other images too.

1042
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:13,320
So with this in general life,
when we talk about images, what is that

1043
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:26,360
a reflection right.

1044
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:28,360
We can call image our reflection.

1045
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:31,920
Okay, So let's say that

1046
01:48:37,680 --> 01:48:39,600
this is a computer

1047
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,760
that has some

1048
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:49,800
OS running on it.

1049
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,800
And in this OS

1050
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,880
we have

1051
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:59,520
different softwares,
let's say Docker, let's say

1052
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,280
Java, let's say

1053
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,920
Selenium

1054
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:07,320
and anything else.

1055
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:15,400
Do you want to add?

1056
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:18,560
Yeah, Faustman And one more thing

1057
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,120
that I want to that

1058
01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:26,160
and you also have a game
called resident you, right?

1059
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,120
So we have this machine, this computer

1060
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:33,480
which is running, it has an OS and the OS
is that C

1061
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,560
It's Linux.

1062
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,640
Do you guys know about Linux? Right?

1063
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:45,920
Linux is an operating system.

1064
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,360
So creating

1065
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,960
let's say that this is a virtual machine,

1066
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,480
this is a machine on Amazon

1067
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,040
Amazon.

1068
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:59,080
Give us option
to create an image of this machine.

1069
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:02,880
What is going to be an image
image is going to take the snapshot

1070
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:06,800
or a picture of everything
that is in there inside this machine,

1071
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,640
all the softwares and the OS

1072
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:17,600
and it will save it in a file,
it will create a file

1073
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:22,080
and it will save this particular image
and it will have all the information

1074
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,400
whatsoever
you have in that particular machine.

1075
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,680
So this file is called

1076
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,520
Amazon Virtual Machine Image.

1077
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:38,640
It will have all the information
of whatever you have

1078
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,600
you had in this particular machine.

1079
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:46,200
So is that clear that what's

1080
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:53,360
machine image?

1081
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:53,640
Okay.

1082
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:58,760
Now how does it help us actually,
what's the purpose of creating this image?

1083
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:01,920
Can like predict

1084
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:08,480
this.

1085
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,000
We can access it from anywhere.

1086
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,120
No recovery. No,

1087
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:14,480
this is just a file.

1088
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,880
It does not have any storage, nothing.

1089
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:20,760
This is going to be like
a small amount of a text file

1090
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:26,040
or maybe Y.A..

1091
01:51:26,040 --> 01:51:30,680
Okay, So let me tell you how it helps.

1092
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:34,920
So in future,
let's say you want to create a machine,

1093
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:42,680
a new machine.

1094
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:47,120
But one thing is common, and that is
that you need the same software

1095
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,000
that you had on the previous machine
on this particular new machine.

1096
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:57,720
So what you are going to do, you are going
to see that you use this image

1097
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:01,720
to create everything on this

1098
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:05,280
new machine
and everything is going to be installed

1099
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:08,880
just the same way
it was installed on the previous machine.

1100
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:09,640
I know your record.

1101
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:15,120
You are just thinking that
maybe you had an image for your own laptop

1102
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:19,200
so that you could have a recovery
for everything that you lost.

1103
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:21,480
Right?

1104
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,000
It would have been easier
if you created an image for that.

1105
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,120
You just have to run the file
and everything would happen.

1106
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:27,360
There.

1107
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:30,000
But unfortunately we did not have that. So

1108
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,960
that's the purpose of image.

1109
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:38,520
Okay, so in New Machine,
we do not have to install each

1110
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,240
and every software individually.

1111
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:44,120
We can just use previously created image
and we can

1112
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:49,480
create a new machine that will be running
that all softwares which were there.

1113
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,840
So this machine is also going
to be running Linux

1114
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:56,200
Dockers, Java, Selenium
Postman and again in Resident Evil.

1115
01:52:57,680 --> 01:53:00,000
Okay, so now A.W.

1116
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,360
s by default gives you a variety

1117
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,120
of images data do

1118
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:08,760
so choose an Amazon image.

1119
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:11,480
Amazon Linux am I

1120
01:53:12,440 --> 01:53:16,000
the personal information SSD volume type?

1121
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:25,120
Do you know what is it? SSD?

1122
01:53:25,120 --> 01:53:29,200
Okay, it's solid state drive
basically your hard drive.

1123
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:35,160
So it's like the what's the type of you
are obviously not interested in that.

1124
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:39,600
It's a 64 bit arm processor
and it's there is a detail in it

1125
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:43,040
and that's all Linux
two comes with five years of support

1126
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:45,360
so that they are telling us
that if you use this

1127
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:49,360
it will have five years of support
and the Linux it provides

1128
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:53,280
and some other tools and softwares
that are already

1129
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,160
it will show you them.

1130
01:53:56,160 --> 01:54:00,040
So you can have either Amazon,
you can have MapQuest,

1131
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,600
you can have RedHat.

1132
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:06,280
It's also Linux distribution,
you can have Ubuntu.

1133
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:10,480
Also again, a Linux distribution,
you can have Microsoft even

1134
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:11,400
you can use that.

1135
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:14,080
Okay, I want Windows
so you can use this particular image.

1136
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:15,840
Deep learning.

1137
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:18,480
And this is for

1138
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:20,160
machine learning, right?

1139
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:23,320
So in this particular image
you will see by dark

1140
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,040
neurons and other graphic out

1141
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:29,360
adapters available because this is
something related to machine learning.

1142
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:35,160
And again, so you have plenty of images
that there you can use anyone.

1143
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,160
So let's if you want to go ahead
with something

1144
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:40,720
that has Java,
just go ahead and search Java.

1145
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:44,280
It does not bring you anything.

1146
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:49,560
So you can also check something
on Marketplace, our Community Images.

1147
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:53,640
Let's search for Java and the demise.

1148
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,280
No, it's not there.

1149
01:54:55,280 --> 01:55:08,080
Let's go ahead and search for topics.

1150
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:08,280
Okay.

1151
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:13,440
So regarding dockers,
we have some machine images available.

1152
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:18,080
They will have Dockers pre-installed,
so we will not have to install it

1153
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:22,600
from scratch.

1154
01:55:22,600 --> 01:55:25,400
Okay. But for now, let's delete it.

1155
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:29,160
It was just to show
you go to quick start again

1156
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:33,600
and we will choose one of the images
that appear in the first place.

1157
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,160
So let's go ahead bid

1158
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,320
this one.

1159
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,400
The first one. I selected the first one.

1160
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:47,520
Okay.

1161
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:48,120
Okay.

1162
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:52,320
Do you guys have the screen Step
two in front of you

1163
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:59,080
Now, this.

1164
01:55:59,080 --> 01:55:59,560
What is there.

1165
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:05,080
No, why? It's

1166
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:09,560
okay.

1167
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:12,120
It was. Yes. Okay.

1168
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:15,840
Now this step allows

1169
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:19,520
us to choose the type of instance
that we want to display.

1170
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:24,400
So Amazon provide us opportunity

1171
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:28,280
to select the size of the computer source
that we are assigning.

1172
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:31,000
We can have a very big computer.

1173
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,720
We can have a small computer.

1174
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:39,360
So this is the family
name T Tool d3d3 84 G

1175
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:43,040
So they have the standard family names
assigned to certain machines.

1176
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,120
These are the types
the Nano is going to be on,

1177
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:51,560
just the small one macro,
a little bit bigger.

1178
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:55,160
Small is going to be greater
than the obviously micro one.

1179
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:00,560
Then we have medium, large, extra large,
just like the clothes.

1180
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:04,000
So you know, extra large nano.

1181
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,440
But I don't believe we have nano boots,
right.

1182
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:11,240
Micro,
small, medium, large, large x, large, etc.

1183
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:13,080
And these are just the type.

1184
01:57:14,120 --> 01:57:14,400
Okay.

1185
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,920
How many CPU's are there

1186
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:21,200
in this particular machine?

1187
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:22,400
You do not know.

1188
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:25,080
Has one cpu

1189
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:29,160
e do micro also has one small also has one

1190
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,640
medium has two large has two extra
large has four

1191
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:38,360
and x large has eight.

1192
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,920
Yes, it's just like that.

1193
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,800
You are like not mine.

1194
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:44,120
You said you are creating
your own computer, okay.

1195
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:45,960
You are not paying it right now.

1196
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:47,800
You are creating it for free

1197
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:50,160
you will only pay
when you will be using it.

1198
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:51,240
That's it.

1199
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:52,400
Okay.

1200
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,680
How many memory do you want?

1201
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:56,280
0.5, one, two, etc..

1202
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:58,000
What is the storage type?

1203
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,360
EBS is like no SSD,

1204
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:06,680
but EBS is the conventional hard drive
that it has

1205
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:08,640
Network performance.

1206
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,520
What kind of network performance
do you want? IPV six support.

1207
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:12,400
Do you want that or not?

1208
01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:17,040
So basically, depending upon your need,
you can select the kind of instance

1209
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:18,080
you want.

1210
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:21,560
And let me show you.

1211
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:24,240
Look 192 CPU's

1212
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:29,520
doing 2 to 800 GB of SSD

1213
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:33,320
network speed, 100 gigabytes.

1214
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:36,920
So this is like a huge machine, right?

1215
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:41,400
You can go for for this machine,
but have your

1216
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:45,000
bank balance

1217
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:47,240
in a huge amount
because that is going to drain it down.

1218
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,800
So the free tier,
we are going to choose this one.

1219
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,600
This is free for us.

1220
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:54,880
It does not cost us anything to use.

1221
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,440
This is free for us for one year.

1222
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:58,520
So we will be choosing this
and we will say

1223
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,720
configure the instance detail.

1224
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,520
Okay, let me know if you guys

1225
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:09,360
have any questions
regarding the previous step.

1226
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:22,680
If not, then we can continue.

1227
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:31,560
Okay.

1228
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:37,600
Now these are some details that we need
to configure and these take the decision

1229
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:41,040
that there are instance is or the compute

1230
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:44,120
is going to ask you to reside physically.

1231
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,160
So number of instances means that

1232
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:50,400
how many number of machines
do we want to launch?

1233
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:55,320
So right now
we just want to launch one machine.

1234
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:59,640
Okay, Now this is a network subnet.

1235
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:03,240
This is something really important
I'll spend some time on

1236
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:05,880
discussing with you

1237
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:08,840
guys that how the network that works.

1238
02:00:09,120 --> 02:00:11,160
But for now what we are going to do is

1239
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:12,880
for network.

1240
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:16,640
We will be using the default one
and for subnets

1241
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:22,200
we will be choosing any of the available
one, one T, one, F, whatever

1242
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:27,680
you want.

1243
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:28,200
Okay.

1244
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:31,960
And apart from that,
the other options that you want to place.

1245
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:35,160
And I think other options are okay,

1246
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:40,960
we don't actually need these options.

1247
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,320
Okay.

1248
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:45,520
But before we jump into the next step,
let's have a discussion about the network

1249
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:50,000
and the subnet.

1250
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,400
Okay.
So how many of you guys have an idea?

1251
02:00:53,560 --> 02:01:12,960
What's a network? It's

1252
02:01:15,160 --> 02:01:17,200
connections, right?

1253
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,120
Yes, exactly.

1254
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:22,080
Routers, Communications.

1255
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:22,920
Perfect.

1256
02:01:23,720 --> 02:01:27,840
Okay So when I talk about computer
networks,

1257
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:30,880
do you think it's something

1258
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:39,240
physical?

1259
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:42,320
And by a physical,
I mean something that has matter,

1260
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:48,040
something You can hold something
that, you know,

1261
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:51,240
actually you can see and feel

1262
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:06,720
tangible.

1263
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,440
Okay.

1264
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:11,320
So in networks, we have segmentation.

1265
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:15,920
And this network is actually,
you know, we can see that the vision of

1266
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:19,680
a bigger thing into small thing

1267
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:23,480
is called sub networking.

1268
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:26,880
So for example, if we have a big network,

1269
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:31,760
then dividing it into small network
we call it sub network,

1270
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:34,800
but that division is not going to be
anything

1271
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,480
that is going to be physical,
it's just going to be logical.

1272
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:43,080
Okay, So let's say I'm just going to
explain you a little bit about networks.

1273
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:46,200
Anyone who is a network engineer over here
or any experience

1274
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:52,080
with networks.

1275
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:52,560
Okay.

1276
02:02:52,560 --> 02:03:00,960
Equally, you don't have anyone else, only
with syntax.

1277
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:02,520
Okay.

1278
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:07,600
So networking is what

1279
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:11,480
when I was in

1280
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:16,000
in my engineering university,
we had this networking course,

1281
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:20,400
I guess there were like about 4 to 5
regarding networking

1282
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:24,680
in which we read about signals,
we read about digital

1283
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:28,480
signal processing and DSP

1284
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:32,360
and analog
signal processing and networking.

1285
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:36,880
So it's a very complicated domain,
very complicated.

1286
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:41,800
But people who are expert of these
domains up there,

1287
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:45,200
they are in a lot like it's
the most difficult

1288
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:49,640
and the most viable jobs in the market,
but very hot.

1289
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:51,840
Trust me, I'm not even good with it.

1290
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:55,080
It's very hard
because there is a lot of security,

1291
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:57,360
there is a lot of risk
and everything involved.

1292
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:00,320
So it's a sensitive job.

1293
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:01,400
Okay.

1294
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:04,680
So we will just discuss the

1295
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:07,640
very simple concepts regarding networking.

1296
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:09,560
So let's say that

1297
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,960
this is a big network

1298
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:17,320
and we are dividing it into subnets.

1299
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:20,880
So this isolation,
our division going to be

1300
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:27,720
only logical, not physical meaning to say

1301
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:31,840
that this whole network,
let's see, has an IP address.

1302
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:32,840
Do you guys understand that?

1303
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:39,160
What do we mean by IP address?

1304
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:43,640
Okay, so let's say this is the IP address
of this particular network and

1305
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:44,840
let's say it has

1306
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:52,440
like 64 divisions available.

1307
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:56,400
It can be divided up to 64 solutions.

1308
02:04:57,040 --> 02:05:01,680
So we can name this one that it's 192.168.

1309
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,280
let's say 0.1.

1310
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:08,640
This is going to be one of the subnets.

1311
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:10,800
And the other one we can see that it's

1312
02:05:12,720 --> 02:05:14,480
dot two

1313
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:18,920
and then dot three, I can see

1314
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:28,000
and dot for

1315
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:31,680
now, after

1316
02:05:31,680 --> 02:05:38,440
creating the sum, that's
what I can do is I can connect my computer

1317
02:05:40,840 --> 02:05:43,760
to zero one

1318
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:49,440
and I can connect my second computer to

1319
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,560
zero two and I can connect

1320
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,480
my third computer to zero three
and the fourth one.

1321
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:59,240
So on.

1322
02:05:59,240 --> 02:06:01,800
So are these all computers

1323
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:10,200
connected to the same network?

1324
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:12,120
Yes, they are actually connected.

1325
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:17,160
The same network,
but different sub networks.

1326
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:17,960
Okay.

1327
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:22,440
And now let's talk about VPC.

1328
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:26,400
The whole concept of telling you
this was so that you are able to

1329
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:30,040
get the concept of ABC. Yes.

1330
02:06:30,440 --> 02:06:31,440
With Gates.

1331
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:33,080
I'm not talking about Gates right now.

1332
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:34,480
It's going to get complicated. Okay.

1333
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:36,560
I just want to make things simple.

1334
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:40,200
This is something that you should just
understand conceptually

1335
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:45,560
so we will not be winging very much
depth of.

1336
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:47,720
Okay, so A

1337
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:56,760
is cloud a network?

1338
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:58,680
Yes, Cloud is a network, right?

1339
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:02,920
A network
to which on which we can create our

1340
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:05,120
machines.

1341
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:05,840
Right

1342
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:12,240
now, whenever
someone wants to work on the cloud,

1343
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:16,800
can he just go ahead and simply start
working on

1344
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:21,400
or will he needs to create a network

1345
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,680
or use a created network by default?

1346
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:36,440
Already?

1347
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:38,080
Let me rephrase my question.

1348
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:41,960
When someone is going to work on the cloud
or let's say he's just say,

1349
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,160
let's say using his machine, he needs to

1350
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:48,840
either

1351
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,160
create a new network

1352
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:54,160
or use a default network.

1353
02:07:54,160 --> 02:07:56,440
He can do any of those things.

1354
02:07:56,440 --> 02:08:00,960
So the first thing first layer
are the first division of the cloud

1355
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:04,800
network is called VPC,

1356
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:07,480
which stands for virtual

1357
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:12,000
Private

1358
02:08:12,440 --> 02:08:17,760
Cloud.

1359
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,080
So what you are doing inside a big
E of this cloud,

1360
02:08:22,400 --> 02:08:26,640
you are creating your own specific.

1361
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:32,520
It's a smaller
division of virtual private cloud.

1362
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:35,600
So basically this is one of the divisions
of the network.

1363
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:38,880
So let's say the cloud is 0.0.0.

1364
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:42,800
This is the IP of the cloud, for example.

1365
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:46,080
Okay. And you can have like

1366
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,520
how many connections you guys can have.

1367
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:51,000
There's a formula
at least that I forgot it.

1368
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,120
Let's say you can have

1369
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,360
flash

1370
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:57,440
like this much connections.

1371
02:08:57,440 --> 02:09:01,560
So now what you are going to do,
you are going to create a VPC

1372
02:09:01,880 --> 02:09:03,600
which is going to assign you some

1373
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,400
private cloud in which you

1374
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:13,800
have 64 Alexa connections available.

1375
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:16,840
So this is the first step
of segmentation of cloud.

1376
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:20,160
So if I show you now
when you go to network

1377
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:23,360
what you did, you selected a default

1378
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:25,440
network.

1379
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:28,280
Ah, what you can do is create a new VPC.

1380
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:30,440
If you do not want to use the default one.

1381
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:37,800
Is that clear to all of you?

1382
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:40,120
So what's the BBC?

1383
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:55,320
If I asked you what is a BBC?

1384
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:56,720
It's a virtual private cloud.

1385
02:09:56,720 --> 02:09:59,040
And what's the what's the private cloud?

1386
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:09,600
It's the division off.

1387
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:13,320
What does the
how is the virtual private cloud form?

1388
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:15,920
What do we divide?

1389
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:21,000
Yes, it's the logically divided portion

1390
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,680
of the actual cloud network.

1391
02:10:25,680 --> 02:10:28,400
Okay. So

1392
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:32,840
I'm going to share some
theoretical stuff about it.

1393
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,240
So a VPC is a logically

1394
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:40,120
isolated portion
of, the cloud within a region.

1395
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:45,640
So basically a PC
can can be created inside a region.

1396
02:10:45,640 --> 02:10:46,960
You have to select the region.

1397
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:49,360
So let me select the region

1398
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:53,200
that we select our region,

1399
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:54,640
Yes, we did in the start.

1400
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:59,600
And then in that region we created
our virtual private cloud right.

1401
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:04,920
That says you can have multiple virtual
private clouds in a region,

1402
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:09,200
but each virtual private cloud
is in a single region.

1403
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:10,000
What does this mean?

1404
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,560
It means that

1405
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:15,080
in staying in Mumbai or Ohio,

1406
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:16,440
you can have multiple

1407
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:20,280
VPC is you can say that, okay,
I'm dividing this particular region

1408
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:25,200
into my own virtual private cloud,
like five virtual private stuff.

1409
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:29,840
But you're going to not have this
that you have a cloud, which is virtual

1410
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:35,760
private cloud, and it is like half in Ohio
and half in Mumbai or somewhere else.

1411
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:39,680
You cannot have this.

1412
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:42,960
Okay. So the next thing that we have is

1413
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:50,120
some network.

1414
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:53,840
What's the difference between the VPC
and we peer?

1415
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:58,960
Okay, so BPC is a virtual private cloud,

1416
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:03,240
whereas a VPN is what's a private network.

1417
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:09,640
The detail difference is that in a VPC,

1418
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:14,160
this is something which is going to be
always related to cloud.

1419
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:20,280
You cannot have a VPN
when you are working on like, sorry,

1420
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:24,000
you cannot have a VPC
if you are not working on a cloud.

1421
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:28,680
It's also like a network which is private,
but we call it

1422
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:32,000
private cloud because we can create
some networks in that.

1423
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:33,520
A lot of that.

1424
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:42,520
Does that make sense?

1425
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:45,960
Okay,
so now what we do after creating a VPC

1426
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:51,320
so VPC can login one region.

1427
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:53,800
This is what we we discussed about.

1428
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:57,880
So in this region,
what we are going to have is

1429
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:00,360
different data

1430
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:08,640
centers right?

1431
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:13,560
So let's say we created
this virtual private cloud and it has

1432
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:16,720
it is in a region

1433
02:13:19,680 --> 02:13:21,800
and this region has, let's say,

1434
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:26,760
one, two, three, four availability zones.

1435
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:27,880
Our data centers.

1436
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:33,960
So whenever I see availability zone,
it means the actual physical building

1437
02:13:34,160 --> 02:13:41,800
in which hardware is zero.

1438
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:42,040
Okay.

1439
02:13:42,040 --> 02:13:46,080
Now once you have created VPC, VPC,

1440
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:49,000
then we can create a subnet.

1441
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:54,720
And what is a subnet?

1442
02:13:54,720 --> 02:13:58,280
A subnet is so our come off subnet

1443
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:03,120
and it is the logical subdivision
of the network further.

1444
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:08,480
So let's say from this particular net
cloud IP address,

1445
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:13,400
we divided it into our own 192.168.0.0

1446
02:14:13,600 --> 02:14:16,840
and it's further division

1447
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:25,440
is going to be called subnet.

1448
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:30,360
So just for the sake of example,
for a crude example, I can see that

1449
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:32,880
all the IP address

1450
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:36,360
from 192.168.1.0

1451
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:40,360
slash 60 are going

1452
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:44,560
be in data center number one.

1453
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:47,360
All the addresses from

1454
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:57,720
1.30.200.1 are going to be into

1455
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:01,080
like this is I'm
just going giving you a cool example.

1456
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:03,960
Okay so these IP addresses can do all but

1457
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:07,320
just giving you an idea.

1458
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:17,480
And 192.168.9.0 slash

1459
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,520
16 are going to be here.

1460
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,880
Okay. So how do read an IP address.

1461
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:28,720
It means that 192.168.1.0 you can have

1462
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:33,360
from this range up to 16

1463
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:36,960
additional IP address in one data centers.

1464
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:42,240
This which means that the IP address
192.16.1.1

1465
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:48,280
is going to be here,
dot two is going to be here

1466
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:53,400
and DART three is also going to be here

1467
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:58,720
in the same network.

1468
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:02,240
So right now what we are doing,
we are just creating the network,

1469
02:16:02,240 --> 02:16:03,360
the subnets.

1470
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:06,720
So let's say
is the subnet that we created.

1471
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:09,600
Okay, let me now show you in the console.

1472
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:12,760
If we see that
we have the option of subnet

1473
02:16:12,760 --> 02:16:16,200
after the network
and this subnet says that

1474
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:19,520
either you can use a default

1475
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:22,800
one or a create on
or you can create a new subnet.

1476
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:28,800
So by they have created different subnets
and they have the code for them.

1477
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:34,440
For example 0101e
once you AC five the etc.

1478
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:39,920
and they have also mentioned
the availability zone

1479
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:43,080
in which those subnets are

1480
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:45,480
so many locations.

1481
02:16:45,480 --> 02:16:47,240
Do we see or hear

1482
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:51,440
one, two, three, four, five, six.

1483
02:16:51,440 --> 02:16:54,680
So it means that I have six
availability zones

1484
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
which I can select.

1485
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:01,880
So let's see,
I want to select this one default

1486
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,920
use East one E
So I just selected one of the center.

1487
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:08,560
So I'm actually saying that hey,

1488
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:12,440
in this virtual private cloud select,
let's see

1489
02:17:13,160 --> 02:17:20,400
this particular building,
let's say it's this

1490
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:23,720
which has an IP address

1491
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:26,960
ranging from this
to this is it where we want

1492
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:36,680
and the rest of you,

1493
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:42,800
what about you guys?

1494
02:17:42,800 --> 02:17:47,080
There's this thing
making a little bit sense to you

1495
02:17:47,080 --> 02:18:11,040
or are you guys lost with the networks?

1496
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:11,560
Okay.

1497
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:20,280
So Hasim is speaking for everyone, right?

1498
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:22,080
Christine Good.

1499
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:24,000
Katarina, Good tenant.

1500
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,840
And what about the rest?

1501
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:31,840
I remember, I think, Kasim,
you are the one right to.

1502
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:35,920
Whenever a hostage does not understand
anything, he sends out a doctor question.

1503
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:36,680
Question mark.

1504
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:41,640
Right.

1505
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:42,000
Yeah.

1506
02:18:42,360 --> 02:18:46,040
It took me, you know,
it took me some time to figure that out.

1507
02:18:46,080 --> 02:18:47,840
I was like, What's this question mark?

1508
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:52,640
But I figured it out.

1509
02:18:52,640 --> 02:18:55,720
Zamzam because she did,
cannot have any more smoking breaks.

1510
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:58,120
So I believe he is.

1511
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:02,760
He's sleeping.

1512
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:04,920
And Miriam okay, Miriam is here.

1513
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:07,600
So I believe Miriam is
done with her brain. I need

1514
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:14,680
it still cooking.

1515
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:18,360
But are you going to eat it like after?

1516
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:21,240
Okay. It's a start for you, right? So.

1517
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:24,920
Yeah. Okay, that's. That makes sense.

1518
02:19:24,920 --> 02:19:27,440
I thought it was

1519
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:28,960
okay.

1520
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:30,320
You pass off

1521
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:35,520
sugar gas

1522
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:41,240
to the sugar gas. Oh,

1523
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:44,600
well, stay.

1524
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:47,120
At least be safe

1525
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:54,560
kind of thing.

1526
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:59,040
Yeah, I can understand,
but I feel sleepy too, sometimes.

1527
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:05,600
And right now I do.

1528
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:08,040
Okay,
let me share something with you guys.

1529
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:12,320
I just detected this

1530
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:13,120
now. No, no, no, no.

1531
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:14,720
Don't. Don't go to sleep.

1532
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:17,240
Yeah, Just taking a brief

1533
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:20,000
chitchat break

1534
02:20:21,480 --> 02:20:25,600
the life syntax.

1535
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:29,040
Yeah, Especially one right?
Life. Life chat.

1536
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:31,440
This is life chat and share this.

1537
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:33,200
Oh, by the way, it's.

1538
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:34,800
You guys have been out of touch, right?

1539
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:49,200
Let me show you something.

1540
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:50,720
The After the rooster.

1541
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:53,600
By the way, I did not had the rooster. But

1542
02:20:57,320 --> 02:20:59,040
it was someone else.

1543
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:00,520
I got this

1544
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:05,160
and it was a baby just

1545
02:21:05,160 --> 02:21:10,520
I can fit him and yeah, that's
now I bought him.

1546
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:15,840
I brought him when he was like 25 days
and it's like now 1.5 months.

1547
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:16,520
Yeah.

1548
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:18,560
African raised pretty intelligent

1549
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:23,600
and, you know,
they have a vocabulary of 1000 words.

1550
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:30,840
He's a very fast learner, so yeah, I,

1551
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:35,960
I just don't have,

1552
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:42,920
have this now.

1553
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:45,800
You know, I keep him away from,

1554
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:49,000
from the classes.

1555
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:51,000
I don't want him to learn programing.

1556
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:56,320
I'll make him an artist.

1557
02:21:56,320 --> 02:22:03,680
Does it know how to good.

1558
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:04,760
Now I know he does it.

1559
02:22:04,760 --> 02:22:09,680
I'll not be making him look older like
the life is not good for coders.

1560
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:10,360
Right.

1561
02:22:10,560 --> 02:22:12,880
So I'll.

1562
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,760
I'll see what he wants to do.

1563
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:17,680
His name is Mr.

1564
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:20,680
Gray.

1565
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:22,680
Not yet. He is.

1566
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:24,880
He's quite young.

1567
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:32,480
You'll learn,
but he is just like 1.5 months.

1568
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:32,760
Right?

1569
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:48,040
So he doesn't start right now.

1570
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:51,000
I'll be not teaching him any other coding.

1571
02:22:52,400 --> 02:22:53,600
It's expensive.

1572
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:55,760
It's about getting converted to dollars.

1573
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:58,080
It's going to be

1574
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,120
not my master's.

1575
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:04,840
So that is.

1576
02:23:08,080 --> 02:23:08,840
Well,

1577
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:11,880
if people in our country
asked us to do these birds

1578
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:17,000
like they are like expensive birds, so
everyone is going to steal them right now.

1579
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:17,680
Yeah.

1580
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:22,400
Trust me, I cannot leave him in the open
because they are going to steal it.

1581
02:23:22,400 --> 02:23:24,800
Yeah, I just keep him inside.

1582
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:28,440
So it's like I e

1583
02:23:30,440 --> 02:23:38,160
$300. Hey,

1584
02:23:39,360 --> 02:23:43,200
I was looking for an owl,
but no, what's the average lifespan?

1585
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:52,360
The average lifespan is 65 years, yet

1586
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:56,280
they live up to 65 years
if they're kept in a good environment.

1587
02:23:56,480 --> 02:23:58,400
Now, trust me,

1588
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:01,280
I don't know where to get an owl trust.

1589
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:05,480
If you get any any place or you can buy
and I'll let me know

1590
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:09,400
if you can deliver it to me, I'll Be glad
I love owls,

1591
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:12,400
but unfortunately in our country
they are bad.

1592
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:14,040
They are not allowed to be sold.

1593
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:19,120
I think I so saw one in in a park. So.

1594
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:23,720
But they are hot too, you know, cats.

1595
02:24:23,720 --> 02:24:27,000
So I'm out of options.

1596
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:28,120
I just gave up on that.

1597
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:31,680
Please. Well, you can sell it.

1598
02:24:31,840 --> 02:24:41,200
Send one of their chicks to me right.

1599
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:48,120
Eagles are good to.

1600
02:24:48,120 --> 02:24:52,440
Like I said, next year, if you guys are
here, anyone of you, I'll show you my.

1601
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:54,360
My whole collection.

1602
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:55,760
I'm starting to collect

1603
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:59,320
many of the species,
but it will take you some time next year.

1604
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:04,640
I'm going to show you all the questions.

1605
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:05,720
Okay. So

1606
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:11,600
again, now I believe that we

1607
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:19,000
will be looking at on owls right?

1608
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:20,080
The white ones are good.

1609
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:21,400
These are pretty common, actually.

1610
02:25:21,400 --> 02:25:24,440
Yet these brown ones are pretty common
in our country.

1611
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:26,760
I see them

1612
02:25:27,080 --> 02:25:30,360
all like if they're 5 to 6 places,
I have actually seen them.

1613
02:25:30,680 --> 02:25:32,360
So the white ones are the rare ones.

1614
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:39,640
These brown ones are quite common,

1615
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:43,520
but obviously they are not sold
in the market because I don't know

1616
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:48,200
there is a myth or like it's true,
but people say that their blood is used in

1617
02:25:48,200 --> 02:25:49,720
black magic or something.

1618
02:25:49,720 --> 02:25:53,120
That's why it's like so bad to be sold

1619
02:25:53,320 --> 02:26:00,200
in the market.

1620
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:03,360
But obviously it can be met.

1621
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:05,760
I said that, but that's the concept here.

1622
02:26:07,640 --> 02:26:09,640
Okay, So let's get back to it.

1623
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:11,880
Yes, enough of the owls and stuff.

1624
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:15,640
Let's get back to our session
and let's try to end it in 30 minutes

1625
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:17,120
so that you guys can also have

1626
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:19,400
Ali off.

1627
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:20,040
Okay.

1628
02:26:20,840 --> 02:26:23,400
So talking about subnets,

1629
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:31,760
do you guys understand
the concept of subnets now?

1630
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:32,760
Okay, perfect.

1631
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:36,680
Now, when we selected a VPC and after that

1632
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:41,000
we selected a subnet,
Do you guys see this?

1633
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:41,960
What does it say?

1634
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:47,720
It says that this particular subnet
has 4091 IP address.

1635
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:51,040
What Does this mean

1636
02:26:57,440 --> 02:27:03,440
what does this mean?

1637
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:09,320
It means that you can have 4091 computers

1638
02:27:10,520 --> 02:27:13,680
in this particular building launched.

1639
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:22,520
At the same time,

1640
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:27,160
and their capacity is like that
that is another question.

1641
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:32,640
The only thing is that for 091 computers
can be lost, their capacity can be huge.

1642
02:27:33,480 --> 02:27:37,920
But if you want to launch
600 in this building,

1643
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:41,200
that will not be possible
because the network is not going to be

1644
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:42,840
there.

1645
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:46,600
Only 4091 options are there right?

1646
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:47,920
Okay. So now

1647
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:53,280
what we are going to do is

1648
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:56,080
I don't know about cryptos, so

1649
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:58,440
no idea.

1650
02:27:58,680 --> 02:28:01,800
After selecting the network
after the selection of subnet,

1651
02:28:02,120 --> 02:28:04,480
the next thing we are going to do is

1652
02:28:06,960 --> 02:28:08,840
click on Add storage.

1653
02:28:08,840 --> 02:28:13,320
Okay, Now it's asking us that, hey,
what kind of storage

1654
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:16,840
and what is the size of stories you want?

1655
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:23,840
So we can set the size a GB to 30 GB
so three tier customers can get up to 30.

1656
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:26,800
GB three.

1657
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:30,640
So I to be here

1658
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:33,800
log in type.

1659
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:34,960
Do you want SSD?

1660
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:37,920
GP two assisted GP three SSD.

1661
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:43,200
I want to magnetic
like whatever you want to.

1662
02:28:43,200 --> 02:28:46,560
Okay, let's do something Let's keep it
eight because I don't want to get charged

1663
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:49,360
if like the volume type is not correct.

1664
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:52,200
Yeah.

1665
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:56,160
You don't need to know about what
the GP told you between I want obviously

1666
02:28:56,160 --> 02:28:59,680
that is like
out of your scope of knowledge.

1667
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:03,320
Just select anyone.

1668
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:03,640
Okay.

1669
02:29:03,640 --> 02:29:09,200
So after that we are
going to click on next attack

1670
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:12,880
Configure security group.

1671
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:15,280
This is the step
five is something that will skip.

1672
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:16,080
Okay.

1673
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:20,760
This is something that we do not want to
discuss.

1674
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:22,960
Okay. Security group.

1675
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:26,240
Now we need to have a brief discussion
on security group

1676
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:30,240
and then after that we will be actually
launching this instance.

1677
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:30,960
Okay.

1678
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:34,080
Now let me show you to simulation

1679
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:38,320
that what actually is happening.

1680
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:42,040
So right now we are we
we are on our own computer, right?

1681
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:45,720
This is the computer that we have
that says

1682
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:55,480
someone working on the computer.

1683
02:29:55,480 --> 02:30:02,640
Okay, Now

1684
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:05,280
I have a W.

1685
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,600
S console

1686
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:09,120
opened up

1687
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:14,800
and using this

1688
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:19,840
I am making configurations
in aid of this cloud.

1689
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:25,200
So the first configuration that I made is
I selected A, B, C.

1690
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:25,920
Right

1691
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:29,800
after selecting
the VPC, I selected a subnet

1692
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:31,560
and after

1693
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:35,800
selecting the subnet
I said that, okay, now

1694
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:39,560
select the volume off the SSD

1695
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:42,880
and launch that particular instance.

1696
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:44,920
So what is actually happening?

1697
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:47,440
The scenes of VPC got created.

1698
02:30:47,720 --> 02:30:49,560
We use the default one, right?

1699
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:54,240
A subnet, we use the default
one selected actually a building somewhere

1700
02:30:55,440 --> 02:30:57,640
with that this particular subnet

1701
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:01,560
and how many computers were available
for 091.

1702
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:05,200
Right. 409.

1703
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:07,200
What computers were available to us

1704
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:13,800
now and say they were here
we are launching.

1705
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:17,600
How many instances did
we select while considering one,

1706
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:25,520
two, three?

1707
02:31:25,520 --> 02:31:28,720
What happened?

1708
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:29,640
Thank you.

1709
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,280
You guys just below,

1710
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:34,360
please have some conversations.

1711
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:38,040
Okay, We launch one instance, right?

1712
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:40,520
So this is imagine one computer.

1713
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:43,960
And this computer that we launched

1714
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:47,640
is going to be assigned

1715
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:49,840
an IP address. Right?

1716
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:55,080
You know that
all computers have IP address.

1717
02:31:55,080 --> 02:31:59,520
Now, this IP address is going to lie under
which particular

1718
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:00,840
network can you guys tell me

1719
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,480
under which network

1720
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:23,040
are which particular subnet?

1721
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:23,280
Okay.

1722
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:26,760
So this particular IP address,
which is going to be there,

1723
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:29,480
is going to be part of

1724
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:34,080
this particular range of subnet

1725
02:32:35,080 --> 02:32:39,840
because this is the subnet that is
assigned to this building right out?

1726
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:44,880
Of these 4091 subnets that are available,
it's going to be one of them.

1727
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:48,880
And this subnet is the part of

1728
02:32:48,880 --> 02:32:50,720
this particular network,

1729
02:32:50,720 --> 02:32:53,640
the cloud that be created.

1730
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:55,560
Okay, This is the only thing

1731
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:58,800
that is actually important
that you should understand that.

1732
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:03,000
Do we need to have a VPC, a subnet
and an IP?

1733
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,160
If you understand
this, you are good to go.

1734
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:18,040
Let me know
if any questions are over here.

1735
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:19,560
Who assigns the IP class?

1736
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:21,560
Either Class E, Class B okay.

1737
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:23,840
You want to say that which which

1738
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:25,560
do we want

1739
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:31,920
to assign?

1740
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:33,240
Do we do it?

1741
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:36,560
No, we just select the subnet and the IP

1742
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:39,920
is this IP assigned by default.

1743
02:33:41,560 --> 02:33:43,680
Okay guys, is the concept that

1744
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:49,040
why do we need an IP to all of you?

1745
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:53,000
Okay, so let's say the IP address
of this particular computer

1746
02:33:53,000 --> 02:34:00,960
is 192.168.10.9.1.

1747
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:04,520
Now it is the part of this
particular subnet.

1748
02:34:04,800 --> 02:34:05,160
Okay.

1749
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:09,800
Now let me tell you, why is it important
to have a VPC and a subnet?

1750
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:12,000
And this particular IP address?

1751
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,280
So let's see the IP addresses.

1752
02:34:14,280 --> 02:34:16,800
192.168.9.1.

1753
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:17,240
Okay.

1754
02:34:17,240 --> 02:34:19,680
We all agree upon this

1755
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:27,640
someone or let's say

1756
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:30,800
Katherina or Miriam, I asked you.

1757
02:34:30,800 --> 02:34:31,480
I said that.

1758
02:34:31,480 --> 02:34:32,640
Okay, you have this.

1759
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:36,160
192.168.9.1 IP address.

1760
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:39,040
Log into your aid of this machine for you.

1761
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:39,960
It's simple.

1762
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:43,560
Will simply enter the IP address
and some command and see access it.

1763
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:46,640
But how is network going to find it

1764
02:34:47,880 --> 02:34:49,800
out of millions?

1765
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:52,040
IP address?

1766
02:34:52,400 --> 02:34:54,760
How is it going to navigate to the right

1767
02:34:54,760 --> 02:34:59,720
IP address?

1768
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:03,360
It will take a lot of time
if it starts going to each and every one.

1769
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:03,960
Right?

1770
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:08,320
So first of all,
it will say, okay, this IP address

1771
02:35:10,120 --> 02:35:12,560
lies in which particular

1772
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,120
VPC is a part of which particular VPC

1773
02:35:17,160 --> 02:35:19,640
first is going to define the

1774
02:35:19,640 --> 02:35:20,760
virtual private cloud.

1775
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:23,840
It's going to say, okay,
this virtual private cloud, this

1776
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:27,600
IP address is a part
of this particular virtual private cloud.

1777
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,800
It's going to say, okay,
which region is that?

1778
02:35:29,800 --> 02:35:31,760
It's going to say it's
this particular region.

1779
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:32,760
Okay, good.

1780
02:35:32,760 --> 02:35:37,040
After going to the VPC, it's

1781
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:40,720
going to say, okay, now one, two, three,
four subnets are there.

1782
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:43,200
This IP address is a part of which subnet.

1783
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:46,560
It's going to say
it's a part of this particular subnet.

1784
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,600
Okay, good.

1785
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:50,960
Now it has detected the building
of the detection of region.

1786
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:54,120
It has detected the building
Now in that building.

1787
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:56,920
It's going to go to that exact computer,

1788
02:35:57,800 --> 02:36:03,120
very unique to perform some tasks.

1789
02:36:03,120 --> 02:36:09,560
Is it clear to all of you?

1790
02:36:09,560 --> 02:36:11,320
So that's how

1791
02:36:12,600 --> 02:36:14,520
the IP address and the network

1792
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:18,920
subdivision actually
you move through the network smoothly.

1793
02:36:18,920 --> 02:36:21,480
Else if there's no subdivisions like this,

1794
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:24,080
will have to like go to first

1795
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:29,880
East, go to all the IP address,
then go to Mumbai, go to all the IP

1796
02:36:29,880 --> 02:36:33,000
address, then go to somewhere else,
go to all the IP address.

1797
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:34,560
It's going to take a lot of time.

1798
02:36:34,560 --> 02:36:39,160
So Internet is fast,
you know, due to this logical

1799
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:42,880
division of networks.

1800
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:46,440
Okay, Now

1801
02:36:48,280 --> 02:36:52,800
security groups.

1802
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:53,080
Okay.

1803
02:36:53,080 --> 02:36:58,480
So we know that whenever
there is going to be a network

1804
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:02,880
involved, we are going to have
some security related issues.

1805
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:03,680
Right?

1806
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:07,440
We need to make our network secured.

1807
02:37:07,440 --> 02:37:10,320
If it's not secured,
then anyone can have access to it.

1808
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:13,320
Anyone can go into our network

1809
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:17,240
and, you know, hack our
computer and stuff like that,

1810
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:19,560
too. So

1811
02:37:19,560 --> 02:37:22,840
security groups are something
that we configured

1812
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:26,440
to make our computer secure

1813
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:29,800
so that only it is accessible by us.

1814
02:37:31,160 --> 02:37:33,760
What a security group,

1815
02:37:33,760 --> 02:37:36,760
how do they work

1816
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:38,040
and stuff like that?

1817
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:41,280
We will be discussing it in the next class
because I

1818
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:42,960
we are done with Teri, right, for this.

1819
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:45,320
That's enough of theoretical stuff.

1820
02:37:45,520 --> 02:37:47,680
I'll discuss it later.

1821
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:51,560
Let's go ahead
and practically launch the instance

1822
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:56,720
SO for now by default, let it be a switch.

1823
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,680
Let the protocol, the TCP,
let the port train.

1824
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:02,640
We try to let the source because

1825
02:38:02,640 --> 02:38:05,880
the IP address be desk
one and click on the View

1826
02:38:05,880 --> 02:38:09,840
and launch.

1827
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:14,680
And after that click on launch,
let me know

1828
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:18,480
when you have this flop up in front of you
so that I can tell you

1829
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:25,680
what to do.

1830
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:26,400
Okay, Now

1831
02:38:29,160 --> 02:38:32,320
you need to click on create a new key here

1832
02:38:33,320 --> 02:38:35,480
so that RC

1833
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:41,280
gave you a key player name,
let's say my key

1834
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:51,760
and download that keep peer.

1835
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:54,880
Okay, It is a download. It is. Shh.

1836
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:57,760
Shh, shh, shh, shh,

1837
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,640
shh, shh,

1838
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:10,960
shh. Because launch instance.

1839
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:13,680
No disturbing sound.

1840
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:14,840
It's.

1841
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:19,040
It's the sparrows outside, not he.

1842
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,600
He's sleeping.

1843
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:24,720
Shh, shh,

1844
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:29,040
shh, shh, shh.

1845
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:32,000
Okay, Once you click on launch instance,

1846
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:35,400
go to your

1847
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,080
easy to a again.

1848
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:43,040
So you just type in easy to
and click on Easy do.

1849
02:39:43,080 --> 02:39:47,400
It's going to take you on the console
and there you have

1850
02:39:47,400 --> 02:39:51,760
instance running one.

1851
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:52,000
Okay.

1852
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:56,200
So it means that one computer is running,
one instance is running.

1853
02:39:57,360 --> 02:39:59,480
He appears that he downloaded ah, one

1854
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:03,160
volumes is one

1855
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:06,560
you can name anyone, any name, name it.

1856
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:09,240
My key name if your key whatever you want.

1857
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:11,040
Okay So the instance is running.

1858
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:14,440
Let's click on that instance
and let's have a look at state.

1859
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:17,600
So running is the state, but right now

1860
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:22,280
it's status is still loading,
so it will take some time

1861
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:25,760
for that computer to set up lost.

1862
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:27,920
That was build that.

1863
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:31,040
And so all those so software's on it.

1864
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:34,120
It's going to take some time
like two, 3 minutes

1865
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:38,360
and then we will see that
how can we actually connect with that?

1866
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:39,840
Okay.

1867
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:43,600
At this point I want to mention something.

1868
02:40:44,240 --> 02:40:46,760
So this is the computer that we built up

1869
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:50,880
inside the cloud on an Amazon, okay?

1870
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:58,080
And we did that using eight of us console.

1871
02:40:58,080 --> 02:41:01,440
Okay. Now,

1872
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,240
this is a computer that we have

1873
02:41:03,240 --> 02:41:06,240
in our home right?

1874
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:09,200
And it is connected to

1875
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:14,000
the router

1876
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:18,000
and then the Internet.

1877
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:21,120
And again, this is connected to

1878
02:41:23,640 --> 02:41:24,720
the building

1879
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:28,680
where we have our resource, our instance,

1880
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:33,480
and that building is also connected
to our router gateways.

1881
02:41:34,360 --> 02:41:35,760
And then

1882
02:41:36,920 --> 02:41:41,240
to our computer.

1883
02:41:41,240 --> 02:41:46,640
And obviously
we know the IP address of our computer

1884
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:54,800
that we just created.

1885
02:41:54,800 --> 02:41:59,560
Now, if you want to have access or work
on this computer, there are multiple ways,

1886
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:03,560
number one is to use the console

1887
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:06,680
to have access of this particular computer

1888
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:11,160
for that
you do not need any additional software.

1889
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:13,560
You can do it directly to the console.

1890
02:42:13,560 --> 02:42:15,320
I'll show you how.

1891
02:42:16,200 --> 02:42:18,560
Our the other thing is that
if you do not want

1892
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:21,160
to use it of this console

1893
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:25,400
to work on a computer,
then you need to have a software

1894
02:42:25,400 --> 02:42:30,880
called Woody.

1895
02:42:30,880 --> 02:42:36,520
It's something like this.

1896
02:42:36,520 --> 02:42:37,960
You need to have this in here.

1897
02:42:37,960 --> 02:42:41,080
You give the IP address of the thing
that you want to connect.

1898
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:42,520
You select the protocol

1899
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:46,440
on which you want to connect,
and then you open up the connection

1900
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:49,840
and it actually connects you
to that particular computer.

1901
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:51,240
Okay.

1902
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:55,400
Is it you just

1903
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:07,800
And what about the rest?

1904
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:11,000
Okay, guys,
so what's the status of your instance?

1905
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:12,360
Is it

1906
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:13,920
a status?

1907
02:43:13,920 --> 02:43:20,160
Is the check that Jack Seth based
and it has launched?

1908
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:20,760
I'll be great.

1909
02:43:20,760 --> 02:43:23,880
Now let's click
on this particular instance

1910
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:27,200
and have a look

1911
02:43:27,200 --> 02:43:29,760
at the information that we have.

1912
02:43:31,400 --> 02:43:34,440
Okay.

1913
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:45,440
So what is this?

1914
02:43:45,440 --> 02:43:50,920
It is the IP address of the computer
that you just generate that you just me.

1915
02:43:51,480 --> 02:43:54,840
It's going to be different for,
all of you.

1916
02:43:56,440 --> 02:43:58,240
This is a private IP

1917
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:02,440
IP for the difference
between public and private address.

1918
02:44:02,480 --> 02:44:05,760
Can you guys tell me what's the difference

1919
02:44:12,760 --> 02:44:35,600
just Yeah, but what's the difference

1920
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:38,080
between the public one
and the private one?

1921
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:39,880
What's the

1922
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:43,200
actual difference?

1923
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:46,920
Okay, so this public one means

1924
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:52,440
that if you want to access this computer
through a network

1925
02:44:52,560 --> 02:44:57,840
that is outside that building,
for example, right now what we are

1926
02:44:57,840 --> 02:45:01,920
trying to do, you will have to connect
using this particular IP address.

1927
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:06,720
But if you are not using a network
that is outside the building

1928
02:45:06,720 --> 02:45:09,600
and you are connecting to this computer,
then you can use this

1929
02:45:09,720 --> 02:45:13,080
private IP address.

1930
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:17,520
Okay.

1931
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:26,240
And let's have some other details.

1932
02:45:26,240 --> 02:45:29,000
Well, if you do computers,

1933
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:33,000
Mohammed, if two computers in the data
center wants to communicate

1934
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:41,440
among each other, do they need a network?

1935
02:45:41,440 --> 02:45:45,960
I mean, do they need an outside network?

1936
02:45:45,960 --> 02:45:46,560
No. Right.

1937
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:51,000
So when they want to communicate,
they communicate

1938
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:56,040
using private IP addresses
so that the communication is fast.

1939
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:58,320
So that's the reason of having private IP.

1940
02:45:58,840 --> 02:46:02,880
IP addresses.

1941
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:03,640
Okay.

1942
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:06,680
Now, the important thing that we will be

1943
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:09,600
discussing over here is security.

1944
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:12,360
So right now.

1945
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:15,600
This says that

1946
02:46:16,880 --> 02:46:18,880
the IP address,

1947
02:46:18,880 --> 02:46:21,760
this public IP address that this computer

1948
02:46:21,760 --> 02:46:27,560
has can be accessed on port number 22

1949
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:32,240
using the protocol TCP IP from the source

1950
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:35,400
0.0.0./0.

1951
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:36,640
Okay.

1952
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:44,600
What does this mean?

1953
02:46:44,600 --> 02:46:56,440
Any ideas?

1954
02:46:56,440 --> 02:46:58,440
No. Source.

1955
02:46:58,680 --> 02:46:59,480
Let me repeat it.

1956
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:03,600
It says that this public IP address

1957
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:07,480
can be accessed on Port 22

1958
02:47:07,800 --> 02:47:11,440
using the protocol TCP IP from the source

1959
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:23,200
0.0.0.0000.

1960
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:28,280
What's that?

1961
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:28,920
Okay.

1962
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:32,160
Okay. Let me explain it to you guys.

1963
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:33,760
It means that

1964
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:38,160
if I want to access this computer,
I'll have to use the port 22.

1965
02:47:38,440 --> 02:47:40,200
What is that? I'll explain it.

1966
02:47:40,200 --> 02:47:43,920
I'll have to use the protocol,
TCP and source.

1967
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:44,760
This is important.

1968
02:47:44,760 --> 02:47:46,040
This source is right.

1969
02:47:46,040 --> 02:47:48,520
0.0.0. Right.

1970
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:52,560
This is an IP address, right?

1971
02:47:52,560 --> 02:47:56,400
Is this an IP address?

1972
02:47:56,400 --> 02:48:00,560
When the IP address over here is 0.0.0,

1973
02:48:00,600 --> 02:48:05,480
it means that any IP address is welcome.

1974
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:09,360
So it means that if you know
the IP address of my computer,

1975
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:11,240
you can have

1976
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:16,800
access to it.

1977
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:20,560
So the machine that I just created,
if you want to access it, you guys can

1978
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:26,760
just by knowing the name of this,

1979
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:30,800
just by knowing the IP address and
just by knowing the port and the portable.

1980
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:33,880
So, you know,
now if you want to connect BGP,

1981
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:38,240
the port of all train to the port
range and IP address is this one.

1982
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:43,400
If I want to make it secure,

1983
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:47,320
if I want to make it secure,
no, I have not made a secure yet.

1984
02:48:47,320 --> 02:48:50,920
I did it by choice
because right now what we set,

1985
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:54,240
we said that will be discussing
security groups in the next class.

1986
02:48:54,680 --> 02:48:59,040
If I want to make it secure,
I just and to my personal computer

1987
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:04,640
IP address in the source
and it's going to be then only access

1988
02:49:05,080 --> 02:49:08,360
from this specific IP address and none

1989
02:49:08,360 --> 02:49:11,720
else.

1990
02:49:11,720 --> 02:49:12,120
Okay.

1991
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:16,360
So anything else
that we want to have a look upon?

1992
02:49:16,680 --> 02:49:17,800
I don't think so.

1993
02:49:17,800 --> 02:49:20,000
Everything is fine.

1994
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:21,760
So We can monitor our

1995
02:49:25,760 --> 02:49:28,920
utilization of CPU and other

1996
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:32,760
operations of the computer

1997
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:36,960
to this logs, CPU
utilization status check field.

1998
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:40,920
If there is any network practice
that were password

1999
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:44,520
network, our network
and this reads described, etc.

2000
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:45,800
etc..

2001
02:49:45,800 --> 02:49:48,400
Now let's connect to the instance.

2002
02:49:48,920 --> 02:49:51,040
So I'll click on Connect

2003
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:54,480
and it takes me to this particular page.

2004
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:59,000
So all of you click on Connect,
you'll be on this particular piece.

2005
02:50:00,360 --> 02:50:03,560
And after that

2006
02:50:03,560 --> 02:50:05,720
I'll click on

2007
02:50:06,480 --> 02:50:07,520
Connect.

2008
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:10,440
I hope this one works because sometimes

2009
02:50:11,640 --> 02:50:14,640
it just is not in the mood of connection.

2010
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:15,840
So there we go.

2011
02:50:15,840 --> 02:50:20,040
We have successfully connected
to a computer

2012
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:24,880
that we created on this cloud
using US console.

2013
02:50:24,920 --> 02:50:32,440
We can also do it to our computer,
but I'll show you that in the next class.

2014
02:50:32,440 --> 02:50:32,560
Okay,

2015
02:50:33,720 --> 02:50:37,440
So when I issue user

2016
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:43,240
Yeah, this is amazing, right?

2017
02:50:43,240 --> 02:50:48,960
Easy to use.

2018
02:50:48,960 --> 02:50:54,240
Okay, Now this is the Linux machine.

2019
02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:56,600
This is a Linux machine.

2020
02:50:57,200 --> 02:51:00,720
So everything that you are going to be
working over here is going to be

2021
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:02,160
with the Linux command.

2022
02:51:02,160 --> 02:51:06,680
You cannot use Mac with
and Windows and stuff like that.

2023
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:09,560
So do you guys know about Linux,
Any commands?

2024
02:51:09,560 --> 02:51:13,080
Do you know if you want me to run

2025
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:20,240
now? There you go.

2026
02:51:20,240 --> 02:51:24,200
pWt is there a less let's do LS So
there is no direct.

2027
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:26,480
The system is actually empty right now.

2028
02:51:26,480 --> 02:51:29,640
Let's do CD tilde and let's do it again

2029
02:51:30,360 --> 02:51:33,080
against all.

2030
02:51:33,080 --> 02:51:35,960
If you do the I r let's say

2031
02:51:37,080 --> 02:51:39,240
batch level

2032
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:42,280
unless.

2033
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:44,640
Oh, there we go. We have batch 11.

2034
02:51:44,640 --> 02:51:45,960
So silly.

2035
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:48,320
Batch 11.

2036
02:51:48,320 --> 02:51:51,800
You know we can go and pwt.

2037
02:51:52,480 --> 02:51:53,320
So there you go

2038
02:51:54,320 --> 02:51:55,680
if you want to install some

2039
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:59,400
softwares on it because this particular
machine image that choose

2040
02:51:59,640 --> 02:52:04,560
I believe it does not have pre-installed
softwares, it's a black one.

2041
02:52:05,160 --> 02:52:09,320
So if you want to install some softwares
on Linux, it's

2042
02:52:09,320 --> 02:52:12,360
a completely very difficult process.

2043
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:15,440
So we will not be doing that
and most probably

2044
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:18,720
you guys will not be asked to do that
even on your jobs

2045
02:52:19,320 --> 02:52:23,120
either until you are,
you know, experienced.

2046
02:52:23,120 --> 02:52:24,440
You write down in your resume

2047
02:52:24,440 --> 02:52:26,880
that you have been working with Linux
because if you write that down,

2048
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:30,760
they are going to ask you
to work in the Linux because companies

2049
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:33,160
love people who do Linux.

2050
02:52:34,320 --> 02:52:37,240
So right now what we are going to do,
we are just

2051
02:52:37,240 --> 02:52:38,880
going to put it

2052
02:52:42,400 --> 02:52:43,520
on it logout

2053
02:52:46,720 --> 02:52:50,280
and click on your instance

2054
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:53,640
and click on it again.

2055
02:52:53,640 --> 02:52:58,960
And let's do one thing.

2056
02:52:58,960 --> 02:53:01,520
After reaching this point, just

2057
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:05,000
click on Terminate instance

2058
02:53:05,160 --> 02:53:08,520
that you do not have an extra
computer running on us.

2059
02:53:08,520 --> 02:53:09,240
Okay?

2060
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:19,280
So just terminate it.

2061
02:53:19,280 --> 02:53:21,720
What is Linux useful for?

2062
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:22,960
Well,

2063
02:53:23,400 --> 02:53:25,760
the purpose of using Linux.

2064
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:29,640
Okay, first I would go to your instance,
click on it,

2065
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:32,880
click on instance date and click

2066
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:36,360
on Terminate instance

2067
02:53:36,360 --> 02:53:47,320
and terminate.

2068
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:47,640
Okay.

2069
02:53:47,640 --> 02:53:53,280
So Linux versus Windows versus Mac was

2070
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:57,480
well, why is Linux distribution

2071
02:53:57,480 --> 02:53:59,920
mostly preferred?

2072
02:54:00,240 --> 02:54:03,360
Because when you have an application,

2073
02:54:03,360 --> 02:54:06,320
develop completely,

2074
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:09,480
you want that application
just to run, right?

2075
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:12,200
You do not want any
graphical user interface.

2076
02:54:12,480 --> 02:54:13,240
Why is that so?

2077
02:54:13,240 --> 02:54:16,640
Because if you have a user interface
that is going to consume

2078
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:21,600
RAM and that is
going to consume CPU, right?

2079
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:25,960
But when the application is ready,

2080
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,960
you do not need any
graphical user interface.

2081
02:54:28,960 --> 02:54:32,920
If you develop an application
and run it on Windows

2082
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:37,680
and deployed on the server,
you are paying for extra RAM

2083
02:54:38,120 --> 02:54:41,040
and extra CPU

2084
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:47,200
for the graphical user interface,
which you do not even need.

2085
02:54:47,600 --> 02:54:48,320
Right?

2086
02:54:49,440 --> 02:54:53,240
So your application
is going to require more.

2087
02:54:53,240 --> 02:54:59,160
And even apart from
that it's going to be a little bit slow.

2088
02:54:59,160 --> 02:55:02,800
Yeah, it's about the cost and the speed
also because Windows

2089
02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:06,120
is obviously going to be slow
because it has to always,

2090
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:10,160
even if it's not showing you
the graphical user interface,

2091
02:55:10,160 --> 02:55:14,160
still it has to
within its hardware display something.

2092
02:55:14,160 --> 02:55:17,080
It has the code running behind that,
that okay,

2093
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:20,160
draw this dialog walks
or whatever is going on.

2094
02:55:20,680 --> 02:55:26,080
So when you have an application
developed in Linux and you deploy it,

2095
02:55:26,920 --> 02:55:29,480
there is actually no
graphical user interface.

2096
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:31,320
It saves you a lot of resources.

2097
02:55:31,320 --> 02:55:35,280
It's actually fast
and is preferred animator.

2098
02:55:35,320 --> 02:55:39,920
So whenever you will be actually
working on server, you will see that

2099
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:45,440
all servers have Linux distribution
operating system.

2100
02:55:45,600 --> 02:55:46,720
I don't think that

2101
02:55:48,160 --> 02:55:50,640
people use Windows or Mac OS servers

2102
02:55:51,800 --> 02:55:54,240
and big interest directly.

2103
02:55:54,240 --> 02:55:58,120
So that's the reason.

2104
02:55:58,120 --> 02:55:58,680
Okay guys.

2105
02:55:58,680 --> 02:56:01,320
So I believe that

2106
02:56:03,440 --> 02:56:05,680
we are almost done with today's session.

2107
02:56:05,680 --> 02:56:07,120
And before we end,

2108
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:10,600
let's do something really cool
and then we'll end our today's session.

2109
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:15,880
So they they can't ease to just

2110
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:19,000
quickly, let's do it just quickly

2111
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:22,920
and then we'll end our session.

2112
02:56:22,920 --> 02:56:26,480
Since easy too.

2113
02:56:26,480 --> 02:56:31,600
I want to go to the consoles. No.

2114
02:56:32,520 --> 02:56:33,280
Okay,

2115
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:35,960
click on launch instance.

2116
02:56:35,960 --> 02:56:39,440
Let me know once you guys are here,
go to easy to click

2117
02:56:39,440 --> 02:56:44,400
a launch instance.

2118
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:47,960
Okay.

2119
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:51,320
Write down windows

2120
02:56:59,040 --> 02:57:04,240
done.

2121
02:57:04,240 --> 02:57:09,240
Click on Select.

2122
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:22,680
Select the feature to micro.

2123
02:57:22,680 --> 02:57:28,440
Let me know what's done because then
I will click on next configuration.

2124
02:57:28,440 --> 02:57:31,280
Okay, The next

2125
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:34,880
the default APC and subnet,

2126
02:57:35,880 --> 02:57:37,560
choose any one of the default

2127
02:57:37,560 --> 02:57:41,600
subnets that you want to.

2128
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:45,720
So only these two options
have to be selected by default.

2129
02:57:45,720 --> 02:57:52,760
And then click on Add Storage.

2130
02:57:52,760 --> 02:57:56,760
No changes to be made and add storage
and click on Add

2131
02:57:56,760 --> 02:58:00,800
Tags.

2132
02:58:00,800 --> 02:58:05,960
I would be to this point, okay,

2133
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:08,640
click on Configure Security group.

2134
02:58:09,240 --> 02:58:11,760
Leave it like this by default

2135
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:17,360
and click on review and launch.

2136
02:58:17,360 --> 02:58:20,600
And after that, then go on launch again.

2137
02:58:21,800 --> 02:58:22,560
Okay.

2138
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:27,600
Now in key you do this to let keep here

2139
02:58:28,440 --> 02:58:32,600
and my key RC and acknowledge this
that's it

2140
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:38,440
I good with this done

2141
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:42,280
perfect Now last instance

2142
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,640
let's go to our console again

2143
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:13,920
and see where the instance is launched.

2144
02:59:13,920 --> 02:59:14,240
Okay.

2145
02:59:14,240 --> 02:59:17,960
It's still loading letter load
and then we will connect to it.

2146
02:59:18,200 --> 02:59:18,720
Okay.

2147
02:59:18,760 --> 02:59:23,200
So I just wanted to mention that now
you guys are already out in the market

2148
02:59:23,200 --> 02:59:28,240
and you'll be having job interviews,

2149
02:59:28,240 --> 02:59:32,000
you will be going to assessment
tasks and stuff like that, right? So

2150
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:35,200
just whenever you get in an

2151
02:59:35,200 --> 02:59:38,400
assessment,
just make sure of one thing that

2152
02:59:39,640 --> 02:59:41,160
before

2153
02:59:41,440 --> 02:59:46,240
you actually attempt it, because I believe
that you always get some time, right?

2154
02:59:46,240 --> 02:59:49,400
You get like 2 to 3 days actually

2155
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:53,480
to perform that particular assignment.

2156
02:59:53,480 --> 02:59:56,560
So let's just say that you got two days

2157
02:59:56,560 --> 02:59:58,760
to have to perform that assignment.

2158
02:59:59,600 --> 03:00:03,240
And it's mentions
that it's regarding selenium.

2159
03:00:03,240 --> 03:00:06,600
Ah, it's regarding, let's see, Java,

2160
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:11,040
just open up your notes
and at least revise

2161
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:13,200
the basic stuff regarding that topic

2162
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:14,800
quickly.

2163
03:00:14,800 --> 03:00:17,800
Go through the basic stuff that you have

2164
03:00:18,960 --> 03:00:22,000
read regarding that topic so that

2165
03:00:22,440 --> 03:00:25,800
when you actually attempting
those assignments

2166
03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:29,760
you are able to do them

2167
03:00:29,920 --> 03:00:32,520
like give you 100% at least.

2168
03:00:32,520 --> 03:00:34,440
And whenever you

2169
03:00:34,760 --> 03:00:36,840
tag some someone like

2170
03:00:37,920 --> 03:00:40,200
anyone from us, like us or me,

2171
03:00:41,640 --> 03:00:44,240
just know one thing that we will be there
to help you out.

2172
03:00:44,240 --> 03:00:47,600
But we cannot make promises.

2173
03:00:47,600 --> 03:00:53,440
You got to be always available because
we also have regular classes going on.

2174
03:00:53,880 --> 03:00:56,600
So only if we are able to get up time

2175
03:00:57,360 --> 03:01:01,840
in that specific slot,
we will connect with you.

2176
03:01:01,840 --> 03:01:03,880
But again,

2177
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:06,640
that is not going to be

2178
03:01:06,640 --> 03:01:09,000
under person scenario.

2179
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:16,080
Okay.

2180
03:01:16,080 --> 03:01:23,520
Most of our yes, you mentioned
I think it's related to Java, right?

2181
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:28,080
So okay, so let's see if it's available

2182
03:01:28,080 --> 03:01:38,640
at any time.

2183
03:01:38,640 --> 03:01:40,120
Okay. And most of what can you do?

2184
03:01:40,120 --> 03:01:44,080
One thing I think
can you please share the recording

2185
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:47,680
with your all fellows

2186
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:50,640
of the interview that you had?

2187
03:01:50,640 --> 03:01:53,720
I think you guys can also go to that
recording and

2188
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:56,760
see the questions for yourself.

2189
03:01:56,760 --> 03:01:59,280
Maybe they'll help you
prepare a little bit.

2190
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,640
Okay, so just go through this recording

2191
03:02:03,720 --> 03:02:05,800
and see that what kind of questions

2192
03:02:05,800 --> 03:02:09,280
you may get prior to taking the answers.

2193
03:02:09,880 --> 03:02:11,520
Try to research on the answers.

2194
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:14,080
Okay, So

2195
03:02:15,920 --> 03:02:17,840
it will prepare you a little bit.

2196
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:20,520
But well, the assignment
that most of you actually got,

2197
03:02:20,520 --> 03:02:22,280
it was a little bit hard one.

2198
03:02:22,280 --> 03:02:26,520
So I'm hopeful that other people
will having

2199
03:02:27,600 --> 03:02:29,400
an easy assignment

2200
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:37,680
posting about the grade.

2201
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:39,920
I'll just let you go with it.

2202
03:02:39,920 --> 03:02:44,200
Okay. So

2203
03:02:45,360 --> 03:02:47,520
no, I don't have that list.

2204
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:49,200
Okay.

2205
03:02:49,200 --> 03:02:51,600
So No, no, I do not have it.

2206
03:02:52,480 --> 03:02:53,160
I'm sorry.

2207
03:02:53,160 --> 03:02:54,240
I do not have it.

2208
03:02:54,240 --> 03:02:57,360
Okay,
so I'll ask so that if you can do it.

2209
03:02:57,360 --> 03:02:59,400
Okay, Mustafa, I'll ask this.

2210
03:02:59,400 --> 03:03:00,760
I have the link.

2211
03:03:02,080 --> 03:03:04,000
Okay, So now let's quickly
connect to the windows.

2212
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:07,320
And after that we go over to Sydney
and wait for you.

2213
03:03:07,640 --> 03:03:11,520
Hassan So let's
click on this and then click on Connect

2214
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:17,160
and click

2215
03:03:17,160 --> 03:03:19,400
on our DP client.

2216
03:03:21,120 --> 03:03:23,440
So let me know, do

2217
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:28,400
you guys have this option available?

2218
03:03:28,400 --> 03:03:29,840
I declined, all of you.

2219
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:38,960
You have this.

2220
03:03:38,960 --> 03:03:43,280
Okay, download this remote desktop file.

2221
03:03:43,280 --> 03:03:45,240
It's going to download for everyone.

2222
03:03:45,240 --> 03:03:48,280
I believe.

2223
03:03:48,280 --> 03:03:54,360
Let me know what you have downloaded it.

2224
03:03:54,360 --> 03:03:57,360
Okay, so we click on Connect

2225
03:03:58,200 --> 03:04:01,440
and then RTP clients

2226
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:04,440
in order to connect

2227
03:04:04,440 --> 03:04:07,920
with a Windows system that we launched,

2228
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:12,480
the method is a little bit different
than the next one,

2229
03:04:13,960 --> 03:04:16,200
so it's opening it up, click on it.

2230
03:04:16,320 --> 03:04:19,840
The file that you download it,
it's going to open up something like this.

2231
03:04:19,840 --> 03:04:24,600
Click on Connect.

2232
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:27,880
So okay, till this point, are you guys

2233
03:04:27,880 --> 03:04:33,000
with me?

2234
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:41,320
Mac users, Are you able to do this?

2235
03:04:41,320 --> 03:04:41,880
Mac users?

2236
03:04:41,880 --> 03:04:45,360
Do you have the same option
when you click on this particular

2237
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:51,600
file, you need to click on
some already be decided if you want

2238
03:04:55,920 --> 03:04:56,480
this.

2239
03:04:58,160 --> 03:05:13,600
Okay.

2240
03:05:13,600 --> 03:05:16,800
I think for Mac users

2241
03:05:16,800 --> 03:05:19,000
to connect using RTP,

2242
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:22,000
let me just just give me a moment.

2243
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:23,960
It's to be similar

2244
03:05:23,960 --> 03:05:57,120
to this.

2245
03:05:57,120 --> 03:05:57,320
Okay.

2246
03:05:57,320 --> 03:06:00,680
So getting downloaded
Microsoft Remote desktop client from Mac

2247
03:06:00,680 --> 03:06:01,680
App Store. You

2248
03:06:06,080 --> 03:06:08,720
do you have Mac after

2249
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:11,520
this?

2250
03:06:12,560 --> 03:06:12,840
Yeah.

2251
03:06:12,840 --> 03:06:14,480
Just follow this name.

2252
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:16,840
Download this remote desktop plan.

2253
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:18,200
It will be there. Okay.

2254
03:06:18,200 --> 03:06:22,080
So for of you who have it,

2255
03:06:22,080 --> 03:06:25,120
the next step that you are going to do
is click on get password.

2256
03:06:25,240 --> 03:06:26,640
Okay? It's not available right now.

2257
03:06:26,640 --> 03:06:29,840
This will take 4 minutes,
but I believe it.

2258
03:06:30,040 --> 03:06:32,280
It will be available a few minutes.

2259
03:06:32,280 --> 03:06:34,800
So just go ahead and do this password.

2260
03:06:34,800 --> 03:06:35,960
Click on. Okay.

2261
03:06:35,960 --> 03:06:40,840
It's going to open up a windows
console in front of you

2262
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:45,360
and you'll see that even if you are on Mac
aren't Windows on Linux,

2263
03:06:45,360 --> 03:06:49,440
you will have a Windows system accessible
so you can have

2264
03:06:49,440 --> 03:06:53,680
it and Mac OS people who wants to work on
Windows

2265
03:06:53,680 --> 03:06:58,480
Go ahead, launch a Windows instant
and you can work.

2266
03:06:58,480 --> 03:07:01,640
Or what do I think for today's class

2267
03:07:01,800 --> 03:07:04,560
that's going to be it and the next topics

2268
03:07:05,080 --> 03:07:09,000
and some information will be covering that
in our next class on Saturday.

2269
03:07:09,480 --> 03:07:12,520
And I'm going to now and this session,

2270
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:16,280
the load that I'm going to
just give you a brief overview

2271
03:07:17,280 --> 03:07:18,960
for Haswell, if anyone

2272
03:07:18,960 --> 03:07:21,360
else wants to have it, regarding

2273
03:07:22,640 --> 03:07:25,120
the Selenium read and the rest of you,

2274
03:07:25,440 --> 03:07:28,680
best of luck for your coming endeavors.

2275
03:07:28,680 --> 03:07:30,600
I hope that you guys will be doing great.

2276
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:34,320
You guys are going to do the interviews,
you guys are going to get the jobs

2277
03:07:34,560 --> 03:07:36,480
as soon as possible.

2278
03:07:36,480 --> 03:07:40,720
My best wishes are without you.

2279
03:07:40,720 --> 03:07:41,200
Okay.

2280
03:07:42,600 --> 03:07:50,760
You're welcome.

2281
03:07:50,760 --> 03:07:53,720
Thank you. All. Okay.

2282
03:07:53,720 --> 03:08:03,160
So talking about selenium, great.

2283
03:08:03,160 --> 03:08:35,080
Let me quickly draw it for you.

2284
03:08:35,080 --> 03:08:35,880
Okay, handsome.

2285
03:08:35,880 --> 03:08:41,040
So I.

2286
03:08:41,760 --> 03:08:44,160
Well, Mohammad, I'll figure it out later.

2287
03:08:44,160 --> 03:08:46,800
Okay. Regarding Mac,
and I'll let you look up.

2288
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:48,960
I don't know about all at once.

2289
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:50,280
I don't remember.

2290
03:08:50,280 --> 03:08:52,600
So let's do it on our free time.

2291
03:08:53,200 --> 03:08:54,360
Okay, So selenium. Great.

2292
03:08:54,360 --> 03:08:57,960
I'm trying to be talking about this.

2293
03:08:57,960 --> 03:09:03,840
Selenium grid consists of two parts.

2294
03:09:03,840 --> 03:09:06,080
One is Selenium hub

2295
03:09:08,880 --> 03:09:16,200
and the other

2296
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:28,200
ones are nodes.

2297
03:09:28,200 --> 03:09:29,560
Okay, So

2298
03:09:30,960 --> 03:09:33,200
the actual problem is

2299
03:09:34,200 --> 03:09:36,160
on your computers.

2300
03:09:36,160 --> 03:09:42,520
It's quite difficult to establish hub
and nodes.

2301
03:09:42,520 --> 03:09:45,080
It's it's really difficult
to configure them

2302
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:47,640
to install them

2303
03:09:49,800 --> 03:09:50,640
because

2304
03:09:51,640 --> 03:09:53,400
they actually

2305
03:09:54,200 --> 03:09:57,240
make up separate kind of containers,

2306
03:09:57,240 --> 03:10:00,920
separate kind of resources is

2307
03:10:01,160 --> 03:10:04,200
because, you know, it is actually most

2308
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:08,080
popularly used for parallel testing,
right.

2309
03:10:08,440 --> 03:10:12,360
And cross browser testing.

2310
03:10:12,360 --> 03:10:15,920
So setting this up inside your computer,
it is

2311
03:10:16,160 --> 03:10:20,120
it can be done, but the contributions
are quite complicated for this purpose.

2312
03:10:20,120 --> 03:10:24,480
What usually do is that they either use
the cloud

2313
03:10:25,720 --> 03:10:30,600
are they use most of probably doctors,

2314
03:10:30,600 --> 03:10:34,200
they launch selenium grid in dockers
container.

2315
03:10:34,760 --> 03:10:37,320
What are Docker
containers will get to understand

2316
03:10:37,320 --> 03:10:40,440
and study
about them in the upcoming classes.

2317
03:10:40,440 --> 03:10:42,200
But for now, I'm just going to give you

2318
03:10:42,200 --> 03:10:44,480
the hint
of how silicon grade actually works.

2319
03:10:44,480 --> 03:10:46,840
But showing you

2320
03:10:48,080 --> 03:10:48,640
a practical

2321
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:51,200
example,
I think that would not be possible for me.

2322
03:10:52,080 --> 03:10:55,400
So what happens is that Selenium

2323
03:10:55,400 --> 03:10:58,640
hub is the place where you have

2324
03:10:58,640 --> 03:11:04,880
your script running,
your script is running here,

2325
03:11:05,640 --> 03:11:08,160
and these are the nodes where your

2326
03:11:09,440 --> 03:11:21,840
browsers are launched.

2327
03:11:21,840 --> 03:11:27,240
So let's say in this particular browser
you have in this particular node

2328
03:11:27,240 --> 03:11:30,960
you have Chrome browser launched

2329
03:11:32,160 --> 03:11:35,560
and in this one you choose

2330
03:11:35,560 --> 03:11:38,480
Firefox.

2331
03:11:38,480 --> 03:11:40,760
Then what is so going to do?

2332
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:44,640
It's going to execute the test cases

2333
03:11:49,000 --> 03:11:51,160
in parallel

2334
03:11:51,720 --> 03:11:56,560
in the Firefox and also in the Chrome.

2335
03:11:57,480 --> 03:12:00,000
And if you want to, let's see

2336
03:12:01,560 --> 03:12:05,480
parallel test
the same script, same application

2337
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:09,200
in more

2338
03:12:09,320 --> 03:12:12,400
browsers, you can set up more nodes.

2339
03:12:12,520 --> 03:12:15,800
Let's say you have a node
in which you have opera.

2340
03:12:15,800 --> 03:12:18,720
So the hub is going to

2341
03:12:20,200 --> 03:12:23,080
also run the script over here.

2342
03:12:23,920 --> 03:12:28,320
So basically that's how a selenium grid
actually works.

2343
03:12:28,400 --> 03:12:30,560
It's a very top layer view.

2344
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:33,680
I'm going to share some

2345
03:12:34,680 --> 03:12:35,320
links with.

2346
03:12:35,320 --> 03:12:36,840
You have a machine?

2347
03:12:36,840 --> 03:12:40,640
No, that's the whole point.

2348
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:41,640
It could be not.

2349
03:12:41,640 --> 03:12:44,640
Machine is going to be the same machine

2350
03:12:44,640 --> 03:12:48,000
as just one computer.

2351
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:50,240
And in that particular computer

2352
03:12:51,240 --> 03:12:56,000
there is segmentation,
which is not physical but logical.

2353
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:58,200
So it separates these machines.

2354
03:12:58,800 --> 03:13:02,000
It makes multiple virtual machines.

2355
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:04,800
You can see, okay,

2356
03:13:04,800 --> 03:13:06,160
but the camera's same.

2357
03:13:06,160 --> 03:13:11,560
But logically there are like multiple
machines on it and that's how it works.

2358
03:13:12,040 --> 03:13:14,920
So selenium great for that.

2359
03:13:14,920 --> 03:13:17,360
If you want to go to I'm going to

2360
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:22,720
give you guys this link

2361
03:13:22,720 --> 03:13:24,880
and you should

2362
03:13:26,240 --> 03:13:28,320
directly go down towards

2363
03:13:32,960 --> 03:13:34,080
the point

2364
03:13:34,080 --> 03:13:58,200
where, okay, I just want you see.

2365
03:13:58,880 --> 03:14:03,200
So we have a hub
and we have nodes, but right now

2366
03:14:04,320 --> 03:14:08,080
this particular link teaches you about

2367
03:14:09,640 --> 03:14:15,040
how to use selenium pop using dockers
because mostly in the industry,

2368
03:14:15,040 --> 03:14:19,320
selenium is used in combination
with Dockers as the configuration on

2369
03:14:20,520 --> 03:14:23,960
individual system is not easy to be done.

2370
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:30,240
So Dockers is used to do that allegedly
just go to it A read the code.

2371
03:14:30,240 --> 03:14:31,320
The code is simple.

2372
03:14:31,320 --> 03:14:33,520
It's not that difficult in fact.

2373
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:35,080
You know what?

2374
03:14:35,640 --> 03:14:37,920
When it comes to selenium, Gray is

2375
03:14:39,120 --> 03:14:41,760
once you have the grid set up,
the software

2376
03:14:42,400 --> 03:14:45,800
set up, that is, which is not when
using a doctor difficult part.

2377
03:14:45,800 --> 03:14:46,680
You have

2378
03:14:47,280 --> 03:14:49,360
dockers selling image

2379
03:14:50,640 --> 03:14:52,640
we discuss about images right

2380
03:14:52,640 --> 03:14:54,720
You know what's an image

2381
03:14:56,400 --> 03:14:57,960
so you have Docker

2382
03:14:57,960 --> 03:15:00,320
image for selenium grid available.

2383
03:15:01,120 --> 03:15:05,000
So what you can do,
you can install this Docker

2384
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:09,000
image on the system
and it will set up the grid for you

2385
03:15:09,000 --> 03:15:13,000
automatically
so that haseloff configuring the doctor

2386
03:15:13,280 --> 03:15:17,520
sitting in with yourself is bypassed
and you have the grid running.

2387
03:15:18,080 --> 03:15:19,520
Once the grid is running,

2388
03:15:20,560 --> 03:15:23,240
then your whole responsibility

2389
03:15:23,240 --> 03:15:26,200
is only going to be read
to write down selenium script.

2390
03:15:27,120 --> 03:15:30,480
It is going to be just the same way
you write down

2391
03:15:30,480 --> 03:15:33,840
normal scripts,
the normal setting scripts.

2392
03:15:33,840 --> 03:15:36,480
The only difference that is going to be
there is

2393
03:15:38,320 --> 03:15:41,120
it's in the code where you actually

2394
03:15:44,920 --> 03:15:51,240
set the drivers.

2395
03:15:51,240 --> 03:15:53,760
So let me show you the difference in code

2396
03:15:54,480 --> 03:15:57,760
that you guys can have an idea
and not be afraid by sending in.

2397
03:15:57,800 --> 03:15:58,240
Great.

2398
03:15:58,840 --> 03:16:05,320
Okay,

2399
03:16:05,320 --> 03:16:07,520
so this is just the running of

2400
03:16:08,960 --> 03:16:11,640
the this is a selenium image
that they have.

2401
03:16:11,640 --> 03:16:15,000
They installed the image now.

2402
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:17,520
The containers are up

2403
03:16:17,640 --> 03:16:22,160
and this is the code.

2404
03:16:22,160 --> 03:16:22,880
Okay.

2405
03:16:23,320 --> 03:16:26,160
So now what they are doing is

2406
03:16:26,160 --> 03:16:26,520
chrome.

2407
03:16:26,520 --> 03:16:31,240
Optionally it goes to new call options
driver, not set new remote web.

2408
03:16:31,240 --> 03:16:35,040
You mark all options
and in doing what you are

2409
03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:41,760
they have the local rules for for
for the address of the container

2410
03:16:41,760 --> 03:16:46,440
where the selenium hub
is okay and apart from that

2411
03:16:47,640 --> 03:16:48,960
everything else is going

2412
03:16:48,960 --> 03:16:52,760
to be the same regarding the test case.

2413
03:16:52,760 --> 03:16:56,880
So the only change is going to be
where you set the drivers.

2414
03:16:56,880 --> 03:17:00,360
Nothing else is different
when you are using selenium.

2415
03:17:00,360 --> 03:17:03,160
I hope that makes sense to all of you.

2416
03:17:04,120 --> 03:17:07,800
Okay, that's it.

2417
03:17:07,800 --> 03:17:11,440
So once you have the Dockers,
you have the selenium grid running

2418
03:17:11,440 --> 03:17:14,520
and then you just need
to make these changes

2419
03:17:14,560 --> 03:17:17,240
of how to set the driver in your

2420
03:17:19,080 --> 03:17:22,240
and your code for selenium strip
and the rest of the things,

2421
03:17:22,240 --> 03:17:27,880
they are just the same,
nothing else is there to be worried about.

2422
03:17:27,880 --> 03:17:28,520
Okay guys.

2423
03:17:28,520 --> 03:17:31,960
So that that is going
to conclude our session for today.

2424
03:17:31,960 --> 03:17:36,720
I'll see you guys on Saturday 1015.

2425
03:17:36,720 --> 03:17:39,720
Take care. And by the.
