1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,160
Fine guys.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,680
So we are in the class Board of debates.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,240
Right.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,720
So far in the remaining three classes,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,880
we have underscored all the basics of MBA.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,080
What are the operations
we have to perform and we can perform.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,840
What kind of exercises?

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,240
We need to perform those operations
via MBA?

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,680
What is public MBA?

10
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,560
What is private API?

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,360
What is biggest?

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,080
How we can understand
is a strategic protocol.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,840
What all under methods
we have in the protocol, correct?

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,760
What is payload?

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,040
How we train the body in the decent?

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,560
What are the other performance
rate your API accept

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,400
and then in the response what all are
the things we should look forward to?

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,520
What are the API is pretty good.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,480
We should go with how we didn't
generate the token.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,240
What is a stateless application?

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,040
What is stateful application?

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,120
All these things we have covered so far

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,080
in these topics, what we have covered
in the last three classes.

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,280
If you guys have any question,
please ask our

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,000
we are going to start this class today,
not only from the guest

26
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,720
but also from Awakening region

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,240
so that the banks which we are going
to cover in activities class right.

28
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,080
That you guys won't be any problem

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
to this.

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,120
That is getting my point

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,960
could be more explain fine
but you have to guess for me

32
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,600
if you had give it to me
in that I'll explain again

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,480
and prefer chocolate one

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,680
all rain.

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,880
So let me start from here.

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,080
This is what we have in class before.

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Will start with it again.

38
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,800
Then we guys cookies from third party.

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Yes. Excellent.

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,400
The moment I started the Class
Einstein mindset comes in the picture late

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,320
one cup unsalted butter low soften
one and a half cups,

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,920
sugar, two large eggs, two disciplined
vanilla, two and a half cup glory.

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,320
Amazing.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,400
There's some women cookies
and install it in our software, right?

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,160
So that we can capture all the data
and then use it for prediction algorithms

46
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
so that we can use them for advertisement.

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,320
Amazing.

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,200
Nice.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,760
Maybe you are the most strongest candidate
in this base

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,680
to become the next president of us, right?

51
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
See the mindset exactly like

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,480
Donald Trump.

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,520
Like is when things alone getting

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
fine.

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,520
All right.

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,800
Very valuable by them in the class.
Critical.

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,960
Also, Google nice

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
then it's

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,200
kind of

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,800
looks busy fine

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,400
but it is then is really

62
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,480
learning of the

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,880
nice loading

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,120
today we needed the most I know so loaded

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
Whenever I ask you to have my ready,

66
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,960
just come.

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,640
Uh, yeah.

68
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,680
I like your favorite ones.

69
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,160
No, I.

70
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,680
Katrina,
I was about to ask yourselves, but.

71
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,400
Right.

72
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,920
So your normal exception yet
also my favorite one.

73
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,120
I was about to ask you.

74
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,480
And suddenly your beard.

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,560
That's great.

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,840
I'm in a very good mood.

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,200
That's why I didn't is to load it.

78
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,720
Yes, ma'am. Yes, if I got a haircut.

79
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,640
Thank you.

80
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,720
Thank you, ma'am.

81
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,280
Exactly. Exactly.

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,040
Every single student in this class,

83
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,480
all these 92 members,
you all are my brothers and sisters.

84
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Don't worry again

85
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
by well, let's time

86
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,600
already.

87
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,160
So tell me, what was the first topic
we covered in ideas for this class?

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:49,440
What was that?

89
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,920
Nice.

90
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,520
Let's take to the Class
Tom Specular topic.

91
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,320
What was the first topic we covered

92
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,040
exactly

93
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,040
the process of authentication
and authorization.

94
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,360
This is something extremely important
that we need to understand, right?

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,360
So the first thing is, the first thing is

96
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,240
authentication and

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,720
one crazy

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,920
authorization point is
what is the meaning of authentication?

99
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,320
Or both are seen authentication
or authorization.

100
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,680
No order not seen. Right?

101
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,760
So what is the difference?
What is authorization?

102
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,560
Let's start with authentication first.

103
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,560
What is authentication?

104
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
Sticking it to verify?

105
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,040
Is your identity correct? Who you are

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,840
getting

107
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,760
it verifies

108
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,560
it really buys your identity
and who you are.

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,920
Are you a on the system?

110
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,360
And if your database returns
with the response that, yes, this

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,320
particular user is a part of our system,
then authorization comes into play

112
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,840
right after verifying your identity
authorization, we come straight.

113
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,960
So what is the meaning of authorization?

114
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,920
What exists?

115
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,240
You have correct.

116
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,320
What exists you have for the system.

117
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,400
So basically,
I told you yesterday four questions

118
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,160
you need to ask yourself
when it comes to authorization

119
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,200
and authentication,
what are those four questions?

120
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,080
The first question is who are you?

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,240
My I am. So help us.

122
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,080
Yes. Show your ID.

123
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,760
Correct.

124
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,800
I will allow you to access the system.

125
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,840
Yes. Are you allowed to access the system?

126
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,080
Find out the question.

127
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,040
Exactly.

128
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,480
And the fourth one is
what excuses you have.

129
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,360
So what exist You have.

130
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,200
So these are the four questions, right?

131
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,240
This is nothing but the crux of your
authentication and authorization process.

132
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,080
Right?

133
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,920
If you know these four questions,
it means you are covering your compute

134
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,640
authentication and authorization process

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,520
or experience

136
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,600
clear.

137
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,080
How is this clear?

138
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,600
Is this clear?

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,680
Perfect.

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,520
After that, what was the next topic?

141
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,880
We covered?

142
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,080
Token.

143
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:45,720
So guys, tell me when we deal with token,

144
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,960
whenever we are working with

145
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,640
work to work

146
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,440
with, is tech less an application?

147
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,560
Is Stateless Application

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,200
Stateless Application.

149
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,480
We need we need tokens, right?

150
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,800
We need tokens to work with stateless
application.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,120
We need token. Fine.

152
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,360
Now, when it comes to token,
how many types of token we know

153
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,040
three types of tokens we have, right?

154
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,800
Three times of what are these

155
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,680
three types of token

156
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,680
is the first is beta.

157
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,640
Correct.

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,840
But the second is make tokens

159
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,880
sixth position next is Mac

160
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,360
token and the third one is grants grams.

161
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,840
Right.

162
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,760
So the beta, the Mac and the drinks,

163
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,560
these are the three types of tokens
we generally deal with.

164
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Stateless application party.

165
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,560
Correct?

166
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,720
Correct. Fine.

167
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,360
Fine, fine.

168
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,720
Now, after this,
after this BNA Mac and Grams,

169
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,280
tell me which one we are going to use.

170
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,440
We are going to work with beta token.

171
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,160
We are going to work with beta, but

172
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,760
now tell me guys, how are we choosing
the tokens based on what?

173
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,920
Basically based on your application.

174
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,040
All right.

175
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,360
What is the structure
and the architecture of your application

176
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,280
and what kind of token
your application accepted?

177
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,800
So the majority of application,
except the beta token,

178
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,080
when it comes to API testing, remember,
if you're dealing with your UI part,

179
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,080
when you're working with web applications,
you will not be able to see any token

180
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,200
you're not be able to see anything,
any excuses, rate anything.

181
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,920
We only see all

182
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,840
these things when we work with API.

183
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,120
Getting my point will be

184
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,720
fine.

185
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,240
So in beta token, in better token, we have

186
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,520
we have how many books we have,

187
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,680
how many, but three parts separated
by, separated by full stop.

188
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,520
Right.

189
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,640
So we have three parts, right?

190
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,680
Three parts separated by dots.

191
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,280
What are these three parts

192
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,520
we have?

193
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,800
Then we have been Node

194
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,280
and then we have signature,

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,960
right?

196
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,800
We have three parts
per billion and signature file,

197
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,440
not aggregates in header
for the further in header.

198
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,200
We have two parts.

199
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,320
What are those two?

200
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,600
The first is the most is type of spoken

201
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,840
and then the second is

202
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:10,960
algorithm

203
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,760
is assigning algorithm rate, assigning

204
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,560
algorithm algorithm it is used.

205
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,400
So I think algorithm statement

206
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,800
right

207
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,320
now, after this, after this,
when we talk about header

208
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,920
to be happy load in our book,

209
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,320
So what is Node

210
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,720
rate?

211
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,920
We have several claims in it.

212
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,960
We have several claims in it. Right.

213
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,960
So what are these claims?

214
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,080
We have first issuer who is the issuer.

215
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,800
Correct.

216
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,280
The expiry date, 80 days expiry time.

217
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,640
Then we have subject,
then we have audience.

218
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,480
We have all this information.

219
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
Now, when we talk about signature,
what is signature

220
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,960
rate, we find that the message

221
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,160
which is actually conveying
has been conveyed correctly.

222
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,200
And it was not changed, right?

223
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,720
It was not changed.

224
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,840
So verify that the message

225
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,040
that the message

226
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,040
wasn't the change was wasn't the change.

227
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,120
While can be

228
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,120
right guys
now tell me when the when we talk

229
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,360
about the fourth thing header in this
we got one part type of token.

230
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,760
So what is that type of token
we are dealing with?

231
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,480
We are dealing with JWT, right?

232
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,880
JWT means JSON, RAM token

233
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,080
case.

234
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,480
Kazim I is this point in yesterday's
class as well

235
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,640
that we have
a very less amount of information here.

236
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,520
That's why I didn't put it in this blue
check art.

237
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,680
But yes, after that class
I will definitely put so to date

238
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,160
in this class I will definitely put
excellent and superb.

239
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,520
It looks delectable,

240
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,160
mouthwatering, delicious, amazing

241
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,000
place.

242
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,200
You need more synonyms a little bit

243
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
on rainy days.

244
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,960
So just some web tokens.

245
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,880
So far so good.

246
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,840
Everyone

247
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,720
screams

248
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
cool place.

249
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,600
Some one is so cool.

250
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,520
Amazing.

251
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,680
All right,
Best now after this. After this.

252
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,120
When we actually got the token,
when we did Hold on.

253
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,720
We are we were thinking all retirement
like continue, please continue this.

254
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,600
If anyone wants to join or not,

255
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,880
you guys can also go ahead.

256
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,320
So by the time I completed comes,
it would be great.

257
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
You finish everything.

258
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
I know, I know.

259
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,240
You know,
you guys are expecting a collision

260
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,280
from honey.

261
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,760
All right,
So after the JSON, the token rate

262
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,040
when we actually created the token
by creating the token,

263
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:02,560
first thing is we need credentials
which credential we use.

264
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,160
We use admin credentials.

265
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,000
Right now there is there is a logic behind
this, but what is that logic?

266
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,000
So Wednesday when we talk about
create operations, right,

267
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,040
to add something in the record
to better record in their database

268
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,600
to delete a record from their database
or to update or play with their data,

269
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,840
which is available in their database,
but even to retrieve some information

270
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,600
from their database. Right.

271
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,160
This all under the operations,
you can now do a normal use of.

272
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:31,920
Right?

273
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,720
You can not interrupt anything
with the data or interpret

274
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,720
the data related to any of
them. One, you can't do this

275
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,120
right?

276
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,200
Right. Okay.

277
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,280
Only only one user can do
all of these things to me.

278
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,080
And always remember
when you test your application,

279
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,240
majority of times, 90% of times
the very first test

280
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,880
you perform in this environment,
you use admin credentials.

281
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,640
It doesn't matter
whether you talk about your white part,

282
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,520
you talk about API bar
to talk about your database part, right?

283
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,800
Everywhere, everywhere.

284
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,880
You know, in my admin user, you verify
it, checks all the functionalities

285
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,800
and then for a specific type of scenario
after that,

286
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,520
you use a specific type of users.

287
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,280
Is it

288
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,960
is indicates to fine.

289
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,720
So that's why for generating
the JSON were broken here

290
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,800
in both
when we are using admin credentials.

291
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,520
Right
so now once we got the token once we got

292
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,040
is just a token, what is the next thing
we have done when we got the token then

293
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,520
after getting the token,

294
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,240
what is the next thing

295
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,600
first?

296
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,560
First, we are considering that
there is nothing in the database

297
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,920
available, so if I have nothing
in the database available first

298
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,640
I have to add some and that determines
that I need to get that value

299
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,080
and be able to change the value,
delete the value.

300
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,040
Whatever the operation I want to perform,
I can perform on that particular value,

301
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,160
which I'm going to do first
if I don't have anything and I'm trying

302
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,040
to access their data from their database,
it doesn't make any sense to me.

303
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,240
Right.

304
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,160
So should we close the backup before work?

305
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,320
Backup forward, create in order

306
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,680
should because to become.

307
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,200
I didn't know you don't need it.

308
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,520
You don't need to do that.

309
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,960
This is in your and your data right
You can do whatever you want to do

310
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,640
and they always give you, you know,

311
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,160
the distinct beach, the listing page,
basically requesting the data.

312
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,920
So then you should not claim
to be production here looking to load.

313
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,880
But we always see that is there is data,
everyone knows it right

314
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,760
And we perform our testing
using tested only

315
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,960
we never used really on testing.

316
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,920
Yes you can consider that there dumping.

317
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,800
You can consider that

318
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,000
fine.

319
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,760
So now now to create a user,
to create a user,

320
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,200
what is the next thing you have to do
based on to create a user to post?

321
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,960
We need to read Swiger document
to get all the instructions

322
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,960
and the information
from the particular document

323
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,520
that what all are
the things we need, right?

324
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,480
So to create a user,

325
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,480
be a user,

326
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,120
we need first thing what we need based.

327
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,240
You want to write, we need this other.

328
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,000
Then second thing we need to work

329
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,920
on that.

330
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,560
We need to create an employee
that would be more relevant

331
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,480
to create an employee

332
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,640
base.

333
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,880
You are right again thing we need is

334
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,960
able method

335
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,320
type of method.

336
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,280
Fine.

337
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,880
Then we need

338
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,640
to be load or body

339
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,800
onboarding.

340
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,840
Right?

341
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,640
Then we have to understand
what are the things we need

342
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,160
to boss in the body.

343
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,360
And after that
I have to provide headers, headers

344
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,640
not after header.

345
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,800
We need to provide authorization, right?

346
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,120
So there is a having pools in there.

347
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,240
We will use authorization and right.

348
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,920
And in authorization
we will provide the token

349
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,560
correct.

350
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,480
These are the things we need
to create one particular employee.

351
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,520
Understood.

352
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,760
And once, once we get once
we are generated,

353
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,400
the employee created the employee,
we get the spawn squad.

354
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,240
What is the response?

355
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,880
What we get after ending
a record in the database, we get to zero

356
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,400
one created

357
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,280
as gets to zero one

358
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:18,720
created event. It.

359
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,040
Now after getting this,
after creating the record, the next thing,

360
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:30,160
the next thing we will do is get an employ
get and I'm not saying I'm not saying

361
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,840
get all employee I say get and it means

362
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,040
just one employee getting.

363
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,480
So just one employee is the one which one.

364
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,320
The one
which we just added in the database.

365
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,400
Correct.

366
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,960
Microphone

367
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,560
and see what happened
to one of the initial

368
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,520
names.

369
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:06,120
And I already went to everyone.

370
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:18,720
Now Vendor All right.

371
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,600
I have started to
speak slowly. That's the way

372
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:34,920
right?

373
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,760
No, no, no issue that next. No issue.

374
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,480
It's totally fine because it shows
that you are actually listening.

375
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,080
For example, Stephen, by the way.

376
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,880
Thank you.

377
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,640
Fine.

378
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,240
Grace

379
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,480
was was further.

380
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,600
Exactly.

381
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,160
Exactly.

382
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,520
That is exactly.

383
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,840
No, sorry.

384
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,840
No room for sorry.

385
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,480
Late. Late, late. Exactly.

386
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,200
Only BS sake.

387
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,000
So when it when it comes to get

388
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,640
an employee rate, when it comes to get

389
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,600
an employee information, tell me guys,
what all are the things we need here.

390
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,720
What is the very first thing
we need to get an employee

391
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,760
base?

392
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,480
You are kind of this.

393
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,920
You are then

394
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,040
we need a type of method.

395
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,880
Type of method.

396
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,320
What is the type of method?

397
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,520
This is great method.

398
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Then we need it.

399
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,160
There is nobody, right?

400
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,520
We need parameters. Which better minutes.

401
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,040
Angelica.

402
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,760
Which parameter?

403
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,360
We need? No, no.

404
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,240
First remember, we need ready

405
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:12,600
parameter.

406
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,840
We need query barometer,
and then whatever the value

407
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,440
it is being defined, there,
the particular value we need.

408
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,240
So it is a great parameter.

409
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,520
We need correct.

410
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,000
I will tell you what is getting better,

411
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,040
which I don't,
but we will cover this in today's class.

412
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,720
But I hope you understood it
at this point.

413
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,320
Basically,
what type of method query parameter?

414
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:43,680
What is the next thing we need?

415
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,520
Yes, we can use header also,
but this is optional because here we are

416
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,080
not providing anybody.

417
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,160
So we can use header but not not many.

418
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,560
Demand query
could be anything developers put in there

419
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,200
that yes, in Equity
barometer did this query barometer.

420
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,280
But remember one thing I assure

421
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,640
that when we talk about
a specific identity to any user,

422
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,640
so the name could be multiple

423
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,880
date of birth could be seen.

424
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,600
First name, last name we didn't
name could be same job title,

425
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,440
position designation, nationality
could be same employ.

426
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,800
I could not be same.
It should be different.

427
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,840
It should be unique. All right.

428
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,760
So here when we are seeing that, okay,
I need information from the database

429
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,960
or database with ask, I have a lot of
information which one you need.

430
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,600
So I we did
this is the particular specific

431
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,960
identity of the information
I want to date, Right.

432
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,360
So that particular identity
we need to provide,

433
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,120
which is unique in the database,
what is that uniqueness.

434
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,440
The uniqueness is your employer ID,
which is unique to every single employee.

435
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,400
The moment you change
an employee, ideas of change getting.

436
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,640
So that's why we will need
another thing is here. Here

437
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,840
authorization token

438
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,440
we need authorization to continue correct.

439
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:18,840
Now tell me guys here, when we talk about
response, what is the response we get?

440
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,200
So whatever the query in.
So I got to be used.

441
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,640
Got it.

442
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,360
Know what swagger is are viable of API

443
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,520
blindly follow the document,
don't use know

444
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,360
follow the follow document whatever the
instructions you are getting from there,

445
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,200
just take those instructions, implement
it, you verify the design and then going

446
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,840
in. I'm finding validating the

447
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,040
and providing more
and more complete from the testing.

448
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,160
Say there use this don't
create requirement from your own

449
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,600
requirement from did something

450
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,160
to zero zero. Okay.

451
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,520
And this is the status code
API status code in response we get the

452
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,680
if we are getting this particular one,
we will understand it.

453
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,800
All right, fine.

454
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,480
It is working. Absolutely. Okay.

455
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:07,880
Got it.

456
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,440
Everyone, after this.

457
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,520
After this, we got one more thing.

458
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,880
Get all employee correct.

459
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,400
Get all employee.

460
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,920
This is also we did yesterday. Then we

461
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,640
would read it or not get all employee.

462
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,160
Right.

463
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,200
So again, again, we need
all of these things except just one thing.

464
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,560
What is that we don't need here?

465
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,160
Query better.

466
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,720
Why we don't need query better
and we don't because

467
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,520
we are going to target
the complete bunch of information.

468
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,720
I don't want any specific information.

469
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,400
I need all the information.

470
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,480
So when it comes to ask
for the complete information, we not

471
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,080
we are not going to provide
any query better.

472
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,600
Correct.

473
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,040
So here also in response, in response here

474
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,760
also we will get what

475
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,880
do the one zero

476
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,800
or just to scoop.

477
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:21,320
So now now if you look at this particular
part here,

478
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,080
if you look at this particular
part so far, what we did here

479
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,480
from the credit operations

480
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,240
we created, we retrieve this through

481
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,440
the not right

482
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:39,840
quanta.

483
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,600
Is this prudent or not?

484
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,800
So how many left

485
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
just to

486
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,560
complete this joint APAs or was

487
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,480
let's compare this to an eBay or

488
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,520
guess. Yes.

489
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,120
Today is the last glass
of your manual API.

490
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,920
From Tuesday
we will start your API automation.

491
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,080
Rest assured

492
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,960
how we should

493
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,960
to check the engine employs
to avoid the errors later on.

494
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,880
That is good.

495
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,760
I will tell you that API with Java
just gathering them.

496
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,800
You play with Java.

497
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,880
All right.

498
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,360
Very simple one.

499
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,680
Believe me. Yes.

500
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Correct. Correct.

501
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,000
Correct.

502
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,160
For the API classes,
but for automation. Right.

503
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,560
If we keep working on manual,
then definitely will not be complete

504
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,680
API classes.

505
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:56,640
But we can automate.

506
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,920
I am I not I think with correct based
with complete coverage

507
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,720
with full explanation, with exact
information, with proper satisfaction.

508
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,280
Understood.

509
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,600
So don't worry about reports.

510
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,360
I'm taking care and I will take care.

511
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,560
So now.

512
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Now the only one or the one operation

513
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,640
is left for gaining the employee status.

514
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,400
You'll see if I go
and if I open this particular part,

515
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,160
you see, get employed
and get all employee done

516
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,240
these to remove any good job title
and get employment status.

517
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,360
It is no one exception.

518
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,000
It is not one exception.

519
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,040
We have to use simple different end point.

520
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,160
That's it. Because this is a good one.

521
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,320
So let me copy the this you want.

522
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,800
I promise you

523
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,040
I go and I am going to add

524
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,000
new request.

525
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,080
Go get.

526
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:15,960
What is that?

527
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:21,480
You get employee status.

528
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,680
Fine. So

529
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,800
get employee status.

530
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,920
Let's take first
this one, then get employment

531
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,440
status.

532
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,520
Fine. If we change it to employ

533
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,200
maid, that's good employment status.

534
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,320
All right.

535
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,200
Next week we have to generate a new token.

536
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,160
Yes, I still am coming to that point.

537
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Do they already provide a token?

538
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,720
I didn't draw it to contract,
so I'm coming to that point.

539
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,760
No, no worries.

540
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,520
Nobody. Sebastian,
At least you are a week next.

541
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,600
A good part.

542
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,720
So tell me, guys who get the employment
status, What are the things I should do?

543
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,880
Anybody?

544
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,000
Students

545
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,600
Do we need any header which is mandatory

546
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,960
doing it Authorization.

547
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,080
But my token, which I created yesterday,
having the expiry time

548
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:34,360
for how many hours?

549
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
12 hours.

550
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,480
So it must be, it must be the new one
which I'm going to use

551
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,560
because this one is already expired.

552
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,800
So let me generate the new token.

553
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,400
See, I got new token.

554
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,880
This is the new token which I

555
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,640
generated correct,
The new token which I generated.

556
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:57,200
So let me copy this new token
and let me based this token here.

557
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,960
So what I will do straight from here

558
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,200
better be token.

559
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,520
And then here I object this token.

560
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,520
Fine.

561
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,080
Let me quickly
update this token everywhere

562
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,960
because my token gets expired
from all the request.

563
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,600
Right.

564
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,600
So just to avoid any conflict and we would

565
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,360
claim

566
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,880
so now, now you see now you see here

567
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,920
when I object to my token headers body,
all the things,

568
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,640
whatever the things I need to get
the information, everything I have

569
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,880
now tell me when I get the response,

570
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,280
what should I expect in the API or discord

571
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,440
in this case?

572
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,800
What should I.

573
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,400
I should accept 200. Okay, got it.

574
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,520
So let me send the request.

575
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,880
See all the employment status
you see here.

576
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,160
Independent contractor freelancing,
0 hours, contract, part time employee,

577
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,440
seasonal employee, summer time
employee, active employee contract.

578
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,640
Everything you see
here, read all the employment status.

579
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,800
We can see correct

580
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,680
you guys can use, see everyone

581
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,040
point.

582
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,720
Let me save all of this information post

583
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,360
here.

584
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Getting it is getting over somewhere.

585
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,160
Right right.

586
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,680
Fine days now now let's go a step back.

587
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,560
Alright, let's go a step ahead.

588
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,200
So what we have to do is after

589
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,160
create operation done
after create operation done

590
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,600
after retrieve operation done right, just
one more division operation is remaining.

591
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,920
What is that?

592
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,200
What is see case employment
status is done.

593
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,000
We are going to get only
the job data correct.

594
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,840
The job title is pending.

595
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,760
So let's complete this job and also first
and then we will proceed further.

596
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,960
So you see
there is no parameter required here also

597
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,760
right in the response code.

598
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,240
Also you see
there is nothing required, right?

599
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,840
We just need to select the type of method,
the end point and the base.

600
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,960
You want to do this all we need.

601
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,360
So now if I go in my postman,

602
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,440
I'm going to add a new request.

603
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,600
And the request name should be Get the Job

604
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,400
opens.

605
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:21,480
I'm going to provide it here.

606
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,760
This right

607
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,120
race token I can pick from here.

608
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,400
So this is my token.

609
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,480
But recently, recently
dendritic token I have

610
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,680
I have to select a beta token

611
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,200
and then I can simply update this locally,

612
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,480
replace anything else
I initiated to get information.

613
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,600
Anything internally can be

614
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,320
stressed.

615
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,720
No. Right.

616
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,680
So now forced to let me
save it and let me send this

617
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,280
in. You see we got a status quo 200.

618
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,160
Okay.

619
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,080
All this is the gate issue, right?

620
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,160
So in get request we are just retrieving
the information from their data.

621
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,400
That is correct.

622
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,920
When they're retrieving the information
from their database,

623
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,120
we don't make money
when they're not sending the body.

624
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,400
That's why
we are not providing any header.

625
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,160
Then the content type of my body
is applications slash

626
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,800
Jason
because we are not sending any content.

627
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,240
So when there is no content that is void,
it is optional if you want to,

628
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,920
but it's not going to affect anything
if we are not going.

629
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,120
But we can yet. That's what I'm saying.

630
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,200
If you put it, it's not going to affect
if you don't put a smart way.

631
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Okay.

632
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,120
Finding it

633
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,000
quite so far, so good guys.

634
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,400
See, Doctor. Doctor 57.

635
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,640
Dear 60 all Doctor.

636
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,680
Now I got you with Mr.

637
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,920
Drivers To date,

638
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:08,040
B is the master technician.

639
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,240
No need to hand without getting

640
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,240
ready to do a job.

641
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,200
Okay. Right.

642
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,160
Okay, guys.

643
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,920
So almost redundant. Get banner.

644
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,360
Let's go to that part operation
update one.

645
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,600
Which one?

646
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,440
We are going to proceed with the No.

647
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,640
Now we are going to make the third request
put in bench judging.

648
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,520
I'm going to that point now.

649
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,280
So now I'm going to work on two

650
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,240
update the update the information

651
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,560
of created employee, the employee
which is already created there.

652
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,600
I'm going to update the information
of the report.

653
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,200
Correct.

654
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,240
So now see who will tell me what
all of the information

655
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,440
I needed, what all the components
I need to make that request

656
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,200
for updating the
information of an employee

657
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,160
who will tell me this

658
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,360
swag, obviously.

659
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,480
Right. So let's open the swagger document.

660
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,000
This is the swagger one, right.

661
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,640
Can you see where the update
information available

662
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,680
when you see the update employee
information?

663
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,320
This book one right
this put one open this.

664
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,120
So now first first, let's take this base.

665
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,280
You are right from the first.

666
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,720
When it is based, you are

667
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,600
no, no.

668
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,520
Understand one the authorization token.

669
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,200
Obviously
we need authorization to continue

670
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,160
right now.

671
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Guys, understand one thing.

672
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,720
If I'm trying to update some information

673
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,520
in their database,
it means I'm exchanging something.

674
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,720
I'm just changing the information current.

675
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,880
There is some information already
available in the database.

676
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,960
Now what I am doing is basically I'm
just trying to update

677
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,640
particular information,
to update the information in the database.

678
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,320
I have to send something again.

679
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,560
If I go do anything, what would I say?

680
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,600
Getting
so I have to send some information to them

681
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,000
or not, Right?

682
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,160
It means when I see I have to send
some information to their database,

683
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,320
what does it mean?

684
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,720
It simply means I need to have body.

685
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,680
So what I need, I need payload or body.

686
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,640
Got it. Now, in this body, what we need

687
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,080
because regard or do

688
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,280
we tell you what all are
the things I need in this body?

689
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,560
I cannot decide on my own right.

690
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,440
It's my God who is going to decide this.

691
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,080
Okay.

692
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,400
Okay, fine.

693
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,720
After this, after this.

694
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,040
Since I am sending the body,
I'm sending the payload.

695
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,840
There is one more thing I need

696
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,960
that we need ahead of this time.

697
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,560
Right?

698
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,080
And then type of method.

699
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,920
We need type of method.

700
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:22,560
We need
these are the five things we need or not.

701
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,720
Now we will consider the response.

702
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,080
See what would be the response of there.

703
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,960
That is something we need to understand.

704
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,560
So here first let me go to Postman and

705
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,200
let me add parameters we need.

706
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,200
I'm coming to that point.

707
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,640
I'm coming to that point. So at request.

708
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,320
So here I am going to add double date

709
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,880
update employee details I need.

710
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,400
So that is the point that you

711
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,200
this is the point.

712
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,840
This is the point I have to get isn't and

713
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,840
right now, guys, what kind of request
I'm going to send from you?

714
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,560
What is the type of request

715
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,000
I'm going to use, what method

716
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm going to put my card right.

717
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,120
So put method.

718
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,760
I have made it available automatically.

719
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,720
I made it available now
here, after adding the put

720
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,840
method, the next thing is, see,

721
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,880
when I open this bar,

722
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,440
it says name in terms of barometer.

723
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,120
What we need, guys, is this barometer.

724
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,960
What is this body?

725
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,160
What we need

726
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,120
guys body.

727
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,680
So now the question I want to update one
particular employee information,

728
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,360
not all the employee's information,
because at one time

729
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,480
information
deleted one particular employee.

730
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,360
I will update only that information.

731
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,920
Right.

732
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,720
So if I'm going to ask
or need one information

733
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,560
on one employee, I need one specific data.

734
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,320
Right.

735
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,080
What do you observe
closely in the body itself?

736
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,680
Your swagger document says provide
employer.

737
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,800
Isn't it a unique identity

738
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:23,880
based?

739
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,680
Isn't it a unique identity? Right.

740
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,240
So here first let me put this bar.

741
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,000
Let me put this part
in my notes in the body.

742
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,520
So this is the body I need.

743
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,360
This is the body.

744
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,240
I need

745
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,960
in most cases.

746
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,480
Right?

747
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,360
So now you'll see here
I need body from this site.

748
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:45,840
Fine.

749
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,280
So let's copy
the body going to your most men

750
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,440
under body to select guidelines for body

751
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,920
control.

752
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,400
From here, Jason

753
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,920
is to be stood here.

754
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,200
So now, see, in this body
I have to send some data.

755
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,760
What should we do with the rest? Alliance.

756
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,120
For example, if you want to change
a status only your name is.

757
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,840
I'm coming.

758
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,520
I'm coming to that point.

759
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,600
I'm coming to get on board with it.

760
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,480
Now they see this is their data, right?

761
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,520
In order to update.

762
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,760
So first thing we do highlighted
particular information.

763
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,160
What I have to do first,
I have to provide my employer I.D., Right.

764
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,600
So let's see for creating an employee.

765
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,800
Let me create a fresh employee here.

766
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,840
See, this
is the new employee I got, right?

767
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,440
So let me just use this employee here.

768
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,200
Here.

769
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,680
This is the embroidery at work.

770
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,280
Now, let me change the first name.

771
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:58,480
Let me change
the first of this time, then this,

772
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,920
and then

773
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:04,720
right

774
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,360
in Katrina and again

775
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:20,000
in 57 point,
the middle name I'm going to blow.

776
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,840
It is it's

777
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,880
made in the last
no last name should be an X

778
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,680
and the middle name should always be.

779
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,240
This time I'm going to change.

780
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,240
Ten days earlier, B provided F
so now I'm going to provide M

781
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,920
Right. And the date of what?

782
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,160
Also I'm going to change to 2002

783
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,240
and nine date of

784
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,160
right to went and connect

785
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,520
employee status.

786
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,560
This time
we're going to change the employees

787
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,760
to dissuade
so we can change to anything, for example.

788
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,400
But let me change it to implement small E

789
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,480
fine and

790
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:11,080
then job it so this time job right
it should be cured.

791
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,680
Understood. Raised.

792
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:22,960
We changed every single thing, isn't it?

793
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,600
We changed every single thing here
in this part, in this part.

794
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Inequality.

795
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,560
Any question in this part of this.

796
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,160
So here,
if we live stream, it won't change

797
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,880
or it will change to spring
than what we have two months.

798
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,080
When you read Asia and the value
is nothing but the district can be changed

799
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,880
or need name or not state on
how does it what it will take to explain

800
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,480
how we can skip some information.

801
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,480
I'm working on one part
it is update the employer ID details.

802
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,720
I'm not working on this part which says
update partial employee details.

803
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,840
I'm telling you to hold your horses
for some time

804
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,280
so that I can explain one point and
then I will switch on to another point.

805
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:17,040
So by the time you have to hold
your horses, get in my points two days

806
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:28,760
late,

807
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,080
then it's

808
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,160
fine after the class.

809
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,000
Then this week send me the invoice that,
Hey, you hired me from last two months.

810
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,360
You didn't pay with a single penny.
And there you go.

811
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,240
This is my invoice.

812
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,720
So we are fine.

813
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,400
So now, see, guys, there are two ways

814
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,440
to update the information in the database
for the employee.

815
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,000
Do this post.

816
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,120
You change every single thing,

817
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,120
make sense.

818
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,680
There's one user that is correct.

819
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,920
You have to be a department
that takes one so that.

820
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,080
All right.

821
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,720
So now, now, here either you change
the complete information of the employee

822
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,120
or you change financial information
of the employee to this.

823
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,880
So first one, first one,
we are going to check right in this.

824
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,960
We are going to change
the complete information.

825
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,400
We're not going to change only partial.

826
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,560
The first one is complete information.

827
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,320
So when you have to change complete

828
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,720
information, you have be used automatic.

829
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,240
Which party of details goes to

830
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,720
To change the complete information,
you have to use the method.

831
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,760
Right? So now,

832
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,840
now I'm going to work with put method post

833
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,840
standard request.

834
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,680
Oops.

835
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,720
We did a token

836
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:12,200
nothing.

837
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,120
Let me take the token here.

838
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:19,080
Let me put it here
and then take me put the header also.

839
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,280
So here that is what is

840
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,640
and that is what I'm going to place.

841
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,040
Dummy value applications.

842
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,120
Let's just

843
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,880
write country name this time if I send

844
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,200
you'll see here I got request

845
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,680
called employee record of due date.

846
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,760
Now see now see everything is changed.

847
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,440
Can you see Bina and Miss
Alex knew that Employee gender Male

848
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,920
employee job title
Q were employee's quarters employee

849
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,960
everything is working or not
and you'll see here

850
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,840
the messages employee record updated.

851
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:17,960
Is this correct or not?

852
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,160
Dates I'm going to change the complete

853
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,280
information, not just one part
of the information, right?

854
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,760
The complete information. I'm changing.

855
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,400
That's why I'm using record.

856
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,960
That's why I'm using record,

857
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,320
right?

858
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,120
So for any question in this,
everyone, anyone,

859
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,400
Marina, I always see you just one answer

860
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,960
from your side that gives business
why you never ask question.

861
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,640
Speak them.

862
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,440
Ask if you have

863
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,720
you updated
is almost created a new employee right?

864
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,680
You know that what happened right?

865
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,960
When you work in one company
and you suddenly left the job after

866
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,240
three months they assign your employment
employer to someone else, right?

867
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,680
They do it. Why? How they do it.

868
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,080
They change all the information.

869
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,320
Simple,
but they keep the same employee, right?

870
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,840
So they're told
they can delete the data from there

871
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:30,240
and they can update the same data
in that particular piece.

872
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:30,880
Right?

873
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,800
Because when you work
with the organization, I was

874
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,720
I think I should show you the embroidery
in the embroidery, you got to pass.

875
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,680
Remember, I showed everyone the two parts
and the employer in the back.

876
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,000
One is the white card, right?

877
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,320
That is the Xs one.

878
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,760
I see this, right. So

879
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,680
so there there in that particular one,
this employee.

880
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,200
Right.

881
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,880
The white one, the back one.

882
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,720
Do you have a lot of a lot of money?

883
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,760
I think maybe like going to pay
$30 or $2 can generate that one because

884
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,000
because the Xs one, having the magnet
inside it does get it inside this right.

885
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,800
So they can't generate for every single
embroider new one if they already had rate

886
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,280
is available, they provide this
to another one assigned to another one.

887
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,760
If the employee is normal with
the organization, it happens like this.

888
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,360
Okay.

889
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,880
It's not like you're working

890
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,880
with ABC organization today
and you left the job after five years.

891
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,320
When you're going to join again,
the same organization.

892
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,200
It's not like your idea will be same
employee, what you used to use earlier.

893
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:53,880
It will be changed right?

894
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,360
Categories

895
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,880
of employee is right.

896
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,760
So now, now, remember I told you

897
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,800
first to create the employee,

898
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,360
get the corrected details,

899
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,520
then update the employee
and get the updated employee

900
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,600
does remember the chart
which I showed you yesterday.

901
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,040
Okay.

902
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,440
So now now here.

903
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,600
Right type of matter header
the responsible upgrade the information.

904
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,080
Right.

905
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,960
So now if you see the response we got here

906
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,400
is is

907
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,880
is guys 200, why is this so

908
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,240
why is this so we sent a body right?

909
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,920
We sent a body.

910
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,440
So it means we were sending
we were sending somebody.

911
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,760
But still we are getting to 00201 that

912
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,520
not a newly created.

913
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,040
We are just doing some changes
in the existing record

914
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,080
train 201 is for creation rate.

915
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,480
Yes 201 is for creation 201 created

916
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,520
Creating something.

917
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,960
You're not creating something, right?

918
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,080
You're just doing some changes
in the existing record.

919
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,040
So there's services.

920
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,240
Okay, whatever you need to explain.

921
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,760
So we're giving you 200.

922
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,960
If you are going to add a new record
in the database,

923
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,240
then only it becomes 201,
ending a new record in the database

924
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:33,640
industry.

925
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,560
This part strings

926
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,840
nice.

927
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,800
Now here, I'm going to get this employee

928
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,280
and I will go in, get one employee part.

929
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,720
Right.

930
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,360
I will update this employee 80 here to get
the exact data and send this request.

931
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,240
Now, here you see, I got this data.

932
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:07,120
The can you see the updated

933
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,520
is it possible to create new employee
with book

934
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,320
with book you cannot create a new employee

935
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,320
because the employee
you already provided it.

936
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:16,920
Right.

937
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,520
So in this employee and if you see sort of

938
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,560
right
if you provide the same employee here.

939
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,520
Right.

940
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,800
Whatever the data
you are going to provide,

941
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:33,720
it will get updated against this
employee 80.

942
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,280
Right.

943
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,400
And when we talk about create
a new employee's implements

944
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,400
creating the new employee.

945
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,120
So you see here
the embroidery is generating.

946
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:47,480
No, the simple message you're seeing
is employee record updated.

947
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,440
It's nursing employee created.

948
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,920
So you guys, when you create employer,
you get this message employee created

949
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,520
and you get always this employee,
the newly created employee 80

950
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,720
But here when you're trying
to update the information it says employee

951
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:08,840
record updated and there is no employee
and it is providing in your body

952
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,880
correct.

953
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,600
So put information. Correct.

954
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:20,040
After updating the information,
we retrieved the updated information

955
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,960
from the database
that is also working perfectly fine. Are

956
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,960
guys there that is also working for you?

957
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,400
So far so good days.

958
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,440
So far, so good.

959
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,320
Now let's proceed for the let's
go a step right now.

960
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,160
Your best question so far.

961
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,600
What if I want to update some information?

962
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,200
I would want to update some information.

963
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,360
It means sorry.

964
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,640
Can you get can you go over again?

965
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,440
You just look to the idea
intended on the get an employee cutting.

966
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
So what I did Sebastian here

967
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,320
I got this employee from here right?

968
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,320
I put this employee in this part here.

969
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,280
Right.

970
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,760
So then then I can check
because this request

971
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,840
is available to check this specific user
in the database.

972
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,360
Right.

973
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,680
So I'm taking the data
which I updated against one

974
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,640
particular user with the same data
I'm able to get from here or not.

975
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,480
So That's why I have updated this employee
and I checked

976
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,280
and it is giving me the updated data
which I just updated.

977
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,240
It means my API is working fine

978
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,640
and that's good.

979
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,320
So now no, for me not working.

980
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,840
And then he replaced check.

981
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:49,520
Why is this is not working?

982
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,880
What is the issue?

983
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,120
What is the issue that you're getting any

984
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,240
any. I'm waiting.

985
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,160
What what is that issue you have?

986
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:32,600
Can you please tell guys

987
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,760
maybe you need to check this
this you are right.

988
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,480
You are trying to get it in
create employee, not one employee.

989
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,440
Please check your base you want
it is a problem.

990
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,840
You are trying to get the end point
of having create employee

991
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,560
you should provide is employee aid
and this value

992
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,320
of the employee only engaged one employee
not declared employee.

993
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,480
Otherwise you didn't ask you to provide
put or post right.

994
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,400
So please take care of the base.
You are right. That is correct.

995
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,960
All right.

996
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,800
You're targeting you're targeting
the wrong one.

997
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,920
Is trying to correct it
and then it will definitely work fine.

998
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,480
So update employee reduced job titles,

999
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,800
employment status, get all employee
get one employee,

1000
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,240
create an employee,
generate the token, create a mini user.

1001
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,000
These are the aggregate list
we are done with.

1002
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,960
So far.

1003
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,280
Now, the ninth one we are going to work
with is badge on.

1004
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:56,080
When I say badge, call simply means
I'm going to update financial information.

1005
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm not complete information. Right.

1006
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:06,360
So here, if we tried to update, we update

1007
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,680
information, information of an employee.

1008
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:13,760
Right.

1009
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,640
So now again, again,
I would need a couple of things.

1010
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,120
Right.

1011
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,200
What are those things?

1012
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,960
Let's check from this document.

1013
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,120
So now see, when I click here,

1014
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,640
it says update employee details.

1015
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,200
This endpoint will update
portion Employee needed.

1016
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,440
Please enter required requirement

1017
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,200
automate people instances
to update in employee information.

1018
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,840
For example, when you see
what you're seeing in the note,

1019
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,000
please enter employee I.D.

1020
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,200
as it is compulsory
to identify the employee.

1021
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:51,040
It is but obvious that if I'm going
to update even a partial information,

1022
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,960
I need to specify against
which particular user.

1023
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,320
I'm going to update this information.

1024
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,040
It doesn't matter whether I'm going

1025
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,920
to update complete information
or I'm going to update your information.

1026
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:03,880
Right.

1027
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,720
Whether it is complete one
or whether it's a partial one.

1028
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,280
I have to specify a particular identity
in the database

1029
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,160
against this particular user.

1030
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:15,200
I'm going to update this information.

1031
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:15,720
Right.

1032
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,080
So it is saying please enter employee ID

1033
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,360
as it is compulsory to identify employee.

1034
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,880
Please provide all instances when new

1035
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,040
or only desired instances to update.

1036
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,240
What does it mean
if you want to update some values,

1037
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,880
so provide only those values,
not the complete values.

1038
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,680
Then please remove the rest of
the instances that should not be updated.

1039
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,880
If you don't want to update
all the other one.

1040
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,560
For example, you want to just update
the post in the middle name the last name

1041
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,760
a list of the things you don't want to do.

1042
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,160
So just remove them.

1043
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,200
Keep this three along with the employee
I.D., which is compulsory.

1044
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,840
To specify the employee,
please remove come off the last instance.

1045
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,360
It means I will continue that work.

1046
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,960
Okay, so now this is the body part.

1047
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,440
We got current cutting.

1048
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,120
So first first I would go in my notes
and I will write here

1049
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,040
the very first thing
I would need is basically

1050
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,720
now you see

1051
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,280
now you'll see here
the type of method I'm going to use is

1052
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,400
nice.

1053
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,640
What is the type of method
we are going to use now?

1054
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,920
So we are going to use Edge method, right?

1055
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,880
We are going to use batch method.

1056
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,840
Fine.

1057
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:41,440
So now in batch method,
do I need body or not? Yes.

1058
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,560
So we need to be what we call it.

1059
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,280
Body. What is the body?

1060
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,280
This is the one point.

1061
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,880
This is the body and after body.

1062
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,600
Do I need header or not?

1063
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,920
So you'll see

1064
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,680
it says applications.

1065
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:02,000
Let's do some country I need great.

1066
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,720
Then.

1067
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,680
Then I need authorization token
also this one not

1068
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,800
addition token.

1069
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,160
I was going

1070
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,000
So now you see this.

1071
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,600
You are right
from where we can get the base you are

1072
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,120
first

1073
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,480
select here

1074
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,520
and then put it here

1075
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,880
after this.

1076
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,560
After this.

1077
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,080
Simply connected with the end point.

1078
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,200
So this is the

1079
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,760
this is the end point.

1080
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,240
Then EIGRP of method is batch payload

1081
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,560
or body is this header
we will update token we already have.

1082
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:44,840
Right.

1083
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,760
So now now let's make this request first.

1084
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,120
Let's make this request first.

1085
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,680
I am going to update some information.

1086
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,000
Right.

1087
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,560
I'm going to update some information here.

1088
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,480
See what are those information?

1089
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,800
I'm going to update.

1090
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,000
So first, I would need the employee I.D..

1091
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,400
So what is the employee?

1092
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,560
This is the employee.

1093
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,600
I'm going to provide this employee I.D.

1094
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:17,280
because I want to change their data
against this particular employee. 80.

1095
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:17,880
Right.

1096
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,760
So let's change only first name

1097
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,880
with element, last name,
address, remove every single thing.

1098
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,720
Every single thing.

1099
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,120
Now, now, guys, tell me.

1100
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,720
I'm saying
there is an additive in this body.

1101
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,320
What is that?

1102
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:37,480
And is.

1103
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,720
Yes, yes. Correct.

1104
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,600
In the last
we should not have any cover trade

1105
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,840
in the end,
we should not have Common Core.

1106
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,440
What is basically in between all values.

1107
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,640
Right. Not in the last.

1108
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,240
So I'm not going to provide any comma
in the last.

1109
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:54,840
Right.

1110
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,040
So now let's update the force, guys.

1111
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,800
Give me one. Very beautiful.

1112
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:02,160
The example.

1113
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,360
You know, you told me

1114
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,000
Ora and now school

1115
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,200
did fine or a good book.

1116
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,840
What is the last name?

1117
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,840
It's not should be okay,

1118
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,080
great.

1119
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,840
Milan. Fine.

1120
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,880
Then you got to spot.

1121
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,800
By the way, Katrina,

1122
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,840
you don't do words,
but for whom to do names?

1123
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:34,840
Whose names

1124
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,560
right?

1125
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,720
And what is a best word in the bylaws?

1126
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,720
And amazing

1127
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,360
Alexis's middle
name should be low for you.

1128
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,440
Let's keep it lol.

1129
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:52,520
All right, fine guys.

1130
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:56,160
No point
the employer is basically the one.

1131
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:00,040
I'm specifying
that against this particular user I'm

1132
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,920
going to update the details now
because I'm going to update

1133
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,920
the body should information
I would need first to name.

1134
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,080
I would need last name,
I need middle name only.

1135
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,120
These three things
I'm going to update in the body.

1136
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,760
So now you see my request is completed.

1137
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,560
My request is completed.

1138
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:22,120
Now I am going to update this information
here.

1139
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,040
So the next request I'm going to make is

1140
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,040
update

1141
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,960
update

1142
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,880
option is

1143
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,320
made update audition information.

1144
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,120
So now first let's select the method.

1145
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,200
What is the method?

1146
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,520
Nice edge. Let me select fetch.

1147
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:55,400
Second thing I need is

1148
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,360
base.

1149
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,320
You are

1150
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,280
this is the base you are

1151
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,760
then 30 authorization.

1152
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:20,160
So let me take this token from here.

1153
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:20,720
Fine.

1154
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,400
Now I would need this.

1155
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,360
What is the rendering new?

1156
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,000
Let's

1157
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,240
application slash

1158
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,160
Jason trade application slash Jason.

1159
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,280
Now I would need body Right.

1160
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,720
So I will click here I would go and

1161
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,800
and here I will write

1162
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,040
this particular body
which is already here with me

1163
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:52,560
so far.

1164
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,400
So we're just

1165
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,480
and Katrina's is the rule which rule

1166
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,840
the raw looking for

1167
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,680
everything completed or is there anything

1168
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:16,840
which is still pending right.

1169
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,560
That's totally fine, but it's my mistake.

1170
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:22,000
Actually, I'm missing just fine.

1171
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:26,240
So now let me save it and let me sending

1172
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,440
it says Employee record updated
successfully.

1173
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,480
Employee record updated successfully.

1174
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,520
Right.

1175
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:40,680
So now you'll see one more thing here.

1176
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,200
Did you object? It has been in there.

1177
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,600
What is this?

1178
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,520
Come on,

1179
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,160
dude, you objected this bend and lol

1180
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,480
and were only middle name got updated

1181
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,680
only middle name got updated.

1182
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,920
But remember one thing to observe in
in the response.

1183
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,720
You got those little one this time.

1184
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,640
Not true. There was little.

1185
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,200
That is the main difference.

1186
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,960
And we interview question
What is that difference?

1187
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,600
Input and badge.

1188
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:19,480
So our difference is first you update
complete information, you have complete

1189
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:24,520
information input, but you update
partial information in batch.

1190
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,400
However,

1191
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,520
when you update complete information
input,

1192
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,120
you'll get to double zero status code.

1193
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:36,880
And when you update modified information
by a batch, you'll get to zero one.

1194
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,640
Understood.

1195
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,080
And that's true.

1196
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,560
And this is the bug in the API.

1197
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,920
You see, you give the name as you give
the name is good

1198
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,640
you got then you get Malama

1199
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,720
right as a last name you got
when you provided with the allowance.

1200
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,760
It gets updated only and will correct

1201
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,840
adding.

1202
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,400
Can you see you guys? It's a bug.

1203
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,720
Yes, it's a bug. Correct.

1204
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,960
Job title.

1205
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,920
Oh has emerging droid.

1206
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,120
Don't worry,

1207
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,280
I didn't blow it.

1208
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:21,240
This is not my.

1209
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,240
Let me just change it right away.

1210
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:35,160
Let me just change it
right away from here.

1211
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,520
Now see middle name
got updated to my little friend.

1212
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,600
Can you see

1213
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,160
it's still my little friend.

1214
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,560
I don't know how this API is working.

1215
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,760
Why even? I don't know.

1216
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,320
It looks like

1217
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,840
this is a bug in the API.

1218
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,440
If this happened, it disappears.
Not working. Yes.

1219
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,880
You get updates what we wanted to show you
right then.

1220
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,560
If you're getting this
Facebook are responses in API.

1221
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,880
The key
people keep updating the same input.

1222
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,800
Oh. Might be the reason it is a bug.

1223
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,680
So let's.

1224
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,120
Let's do it. Let's do it.

1225
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:17,360
Let me create one employee.

1226
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,920
Don't create any other one.

1227
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,160
Don't. Don't do anyone.

1228
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,240
Okay, I'm going to create one employee.

1229
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:23,880
Please don't do this

1230
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:28,800
I'm going to

1231
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,160
get this data
and I'm going to update this information.

1232
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:37,760
It's now

1233
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,880
see, it says employee
record of record successfully.

1234
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,520
But here
the data I'm passing is not showing here.

1235
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,600
This is something else.

1236
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,600
Can you see

1237
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:51,160
can you see this case

1238
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,360
right now?

1239
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,640
Employee record of digit successfully?

1240
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,000
Yes. Correct.

1241
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,400
Correct. Correct. Fine.

1242
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,920
So now now we got

1243
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:05,840
we got this complete details
of all the employees.

1244
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,520
If you see right, complete
due dates of all the employees

1245
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,120
and how we are playing with the data.
Right.

1246
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,720
Whether it is a post operation. Right.

1247
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,680
Whether it is a post operation within
it is a gate operation,

1248
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,280
it is a boot operation.
It is a batch operation.

1249
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,360
So for so far, we did
what is the fifth thing.

1250
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,720
We are going to make no case.

1251
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,160
The fifth thing
which we are going to make is

1252
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,440
yes, yes.

1253
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,920
Correct. To delete the employee.

1254
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:40,520
Now the only operation pending
is to delete the employee.

1255
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,200
So now let's see again.

1256
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,720
Again, I have one point through
which I can get all the information,

1257
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:52,080
but is that slider document right?

1258
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,800
So now and should we check again
with great method?

1259
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,000
Yeah, sure. Why not? We can.

1260
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,840
We can if we take this,
if we go to get one

1261
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,080
employee, let me update this employer.

1262
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,720
Let me send it
and I'm getting this data now.

1263
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:13,080
Can you see 26110?

1264
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,600
Yes. Currently

1265
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,840
we aim you as team and you see the Alexi.

1266
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,000
We must all Yes

1267
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,960
best practice we should for

1268
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,720
final.

1269
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,640
Yeah no copy Exactly

1270
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:49,320
fine based

1271
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:54,160
So now the next thing is
we are going to delete the employee.

1272
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:58,480
Now see, we're about to complete the
operation of the can you see?

1273
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,320
Then you must be thinking is still
we are done.

1274
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,920
We just within a half hour. Right.

1275
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,400
What we will do for the next 3 hours.

1276
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,080
I have a solution for the course.

1277
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,640
We're going to.

1278
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:15,240
No, no, I have a solution for that.

1279
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,040
I don't want

1280
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,600
no practice. The

1281
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:24,840
project, no plan, no project.

1282
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,160
Still, we have just done
with the basic operations of Baby, an

1283
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:37,680
advanced operation is still pending.

1284
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,880
Hazim, please check that your browser
to said what I could not understand.

1285
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:42,400
Check.

1286
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,760
That is an error with your base.

1287
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,360
You are right.

1288
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:50,600
That is an error with your base
you are a base check.

1289
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,440
So now we're picking up over my

1290
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,720
earlier look.

1291
01:13:58,720 --> 01:13:59,680
Correct.

1292
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,240
Even I don't know how this is working now.

1293
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,200
See, forget one employee.

1294
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:10,120
They will get the details of this specific
employee from their database

1295
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,920
or to delete one specific detail
from their database.

1296
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,880
What operation looks similar on

1297
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:17,880
similar approach?

1298
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,480
I'm not getting the detail
of one particular identity

1299
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:39,560
or deleting that, but

1300
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,080
I really don't understand
what has been written.

1301
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,960
But the picture is

1302
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,840
superb.

1303
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,600
Vladimir Putin faked a basement

1304
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:17,040
slide in the sticks.

1305
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:25,040
What we have been repeating again
and again that we had a bug in the AP.

1306
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,160
This is what I'm saying.

1307
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,440
We have a bug in the API, right?

1308
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:33,040
So if you come across
this type of behavior in the application,

1309
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:38,920
you should report it to the developer.

1310
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,920
No, that's fine. Alex Then explain.

1311
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,120
You're fortunate enough
that he's allowing you to speak to the

1312
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:51,240
So enjoy, or at least you can speak

1313
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:55,280
a lot of things, right?

1314
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,080
They didn't speak from last many

1315
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,160
again, authentication

1316
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,440
authorization, BNA token probate,
which is valid only for 2 seconds.

1317
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,800
They fine.

1318
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,800
So now now this document says
this document says very good document.

1319
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,080
Right.

1320
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,440
What it says we have to delete employee.

1321
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,600
So to delete to to delete the employee
what all our information we need.

1322
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,480
You see,
it looks exactly like a gate one employee.

1323
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,560
Did you need one specific identity

1324
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,760
that is unique to the database
you're going to delete in their database?

1325
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:43,200
What is that unique data?

1326
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,520
Obviously

1327
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,600
in 4 minutes.

1328
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,280
Then it's in 4 minutes.

1329
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,120
Maybe in five, 5 minutes.

1330
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,840
Maybe in 10 minutes. I don't know.

1331
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,160
But they will definitely.

1332
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:57,680
Having a breakdown.

1333
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,800
So now, now

1334
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,520
I am going to
I am going to add a new request here.

1335
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,640
And that request is

1336
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:18,080
delete, delete employee.

1337
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,480
So now, guys, see,
first I have to select which part

1338
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:23,680
here.

1339
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,320
First, let's make it first.

1340
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,040
We need a base unit
that is basic after base.

1341
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,840
You are right type of method.

1342
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,800
So what is the type of method we need?

1343
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,280
A type of maintenance. Delete

1344
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:36,680
after this.

1345
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,040
After this.

1346
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,720
Do we need body place?

1347
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,240
No, we don't need body.

1348
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,520
We need query.

1349
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,080
We need better.

1350
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:47,760
Right.

1351
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,840
We need qualified and we didn't hear.

1352
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,440
Then what else?

1353
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,400
If you are passing query parameter,
do we need any headers

1354
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:58,000
guys?

1355
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Do we need any headers?

1356
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,720
You know this is optional break
so that is optional.

1357
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:12,160
Unit authorization goes.

1358
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:13,320
We need authorization.

1359
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,120
Okay.

1360
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,400
So these all are the information, right?

1361
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,640
I need to delete the employee
from the database.

1362
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:20,960
Fine.

1363
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,960
Let's get this data from here

1364
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,640
next. This data from here.

1365
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,400
So first

1366
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,040
this part

1367
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,120
and then

1368
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,280
select the end point.

1369
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,800
So this is the end point

1370
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,400
and then query barometer.

1371
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,280
So what is the query?

1372
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,880
But I would have
I need to see it says employee, right?

1373
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,480
So I would rate employee

1374
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,040
and then we will see the response
what is the response code

1375
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,640
I will get from here?

1376
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,600
What is the response code
I will get from here?

1377
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,880
Okay, fine.

1378
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,160
So let's make this particular request
in an Austrian.

1379
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:18,720
So now I'm going to create a delete one.

1380
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,680
And here this is you.

1381
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,760
Based on this.

1382
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,320
This. You want it contained service.

1383
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,200
You wanted it
plus a location, plus a blank.

1384
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,200
On this three, it can be four.

1385
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,640
Then we don't need header,
but we need authorization.

1386
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:40,320
And the one which we need is be added to
can it be added?

1387
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,680
So find a school here
and let this added to control

1388
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:48,760
here and it's to file

1389
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,360
now. We need to order this.

1390
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:55,200
We need query better and we do
so the query parameter

1391
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,240
is already available here.

1392
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,040
See This is not waiting better,

1393
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:04,000
so just copy this way better barometer
and then the value.

1394
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,640
So I am taking the same employee 80
which I had.

1395
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,880
Right? The same employee.

1396
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,880
I will use this employee

1397
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,040
file,

1398
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,240
I will use this employee ID here.

1399
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,720
Anything else?

1400
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,360
Guys, I need to

1401
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,600
know what?

1402
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:38,800
Are we ready to send the request for this?

1403
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,120
What?

1404
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,600
We must see.

1405
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:46,680
Yes, I will show you.

1406
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,800
Employee does not exist
or you provided invalid employee entity.

1407
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:57,720
Amazing.

1408
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,880
Now you see guys what is happening?

1409
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:04,520
It says employee does not exist
or you have provided invalid employee It

1410
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:05,880
exists.

1411
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,880
404 No, no, no.

1412
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,880
I am. I have only deleted.

1413
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:15,200
Now you see here is
status is for zero for not phone

1414
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,440
right.

1415
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,520
The status is for zero four not one.

1416
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:24,960
Why is this? Yes.

1417
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,520
Pending is at all correct.

1418
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,240
Many good spending is wrong.

1419
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:31,200
I know.

1420
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,120
So now.

1421
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:37,240
Now this is status for zero four
not found a means no data found

1422
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,280
no delegates who have gone
has gone through that part.

1423
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,480
Who has gone through that part?

1424
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,200
No. I see no nothing.
No. What was deleted?

1425
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,880
I am only I have only deleted
API status code read for zero four

1426
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
when we get for zero four -200.

1427
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,040
Okay.

1428
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:00,160
I have 400 404 now we'll get rid.

1429
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:34,760
Let me do it for you once again.

1430
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:40,480
Now see now see guys
it says employee employee deleted.

1431
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,920
Now you see.

1432
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,080
Right. Employee deleted.

1433
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,760
Can everyone see guys

1434
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:53,520
can everyone sees it says employability.

1435
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,080
Your request method must be deleted.

1436
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,080
Uh, this is part of normal.

1437
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:58,280
What?

1438
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,080
Can you please change your request
method from get to delete

1439
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:03,640
you didn't provide
to get delete method right?

1440
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,440
And then you're already selected.
Get bored.

1441
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,040
That's why it was not working.

1442
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,080
So now you'll see guys here.

1443
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,080
Now here. You see what we are doing.

1444
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:17,040
We have provided this particular data
to delete the employee.

1445
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,920
Right?
So deleting the information is fine.

1446
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,800
Now it says is data scored 200.

1447
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,880
It means the data you want it to delete.

1448
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,440
You have already deleted this data.

1449
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,480
So what the spirit does this.

1450
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,120
Okay, 200 requests is successful.

1451
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,840
Now if you want to check here this time,
if you want to check,

1452
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:41,640
what would you gain?

1453
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:45,240
Employee does not exist
or you have provided

1454
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,480
invalid employee eight

1455
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:01,360
Not sending anybody.

1456
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,240
Alex Alexi why do not read Because

1457
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:07,720
want to weaken restore
but not with the API.

1458
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,360
We're not with the API.
There is no method for that.

1459
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,760
So remember Alexi here.

1460
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,760
Please don't employ 80.

1461
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:19,240
Been.

1462
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,400
We are doing

1463
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,000
your service.

1464
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,880
Please provide employee
then provide employee here

1465
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:29,920
or delete.

1466
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,000
We need parameters
authorization in header.

1467
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,800
No Alex there's four times
they for delete.

1468
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,920
We need parameter query parameters
an authorization

1469
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:41,000
not data.

1470
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,720
It wasn't for zero 44.

1471
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,880
Now it is 404.

1472
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,840
This is for get remember
this is for get bad request.

1473
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:51,920
It means your system
not able to find anything.

1474
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,600
Right. So this is the expected one.

1475
01:24:54,600 --> 01:25:00,360
This is the expected one.

1476
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,000
Right. So different messages
we are getting.

1477
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,600
I know because again,
this is a glitch in the API.

1478
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,600
This API is a lot of glitches.

1479
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,840
We have to understand
despite the bad request,

1480
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,440
because the once
you delete everything from the database,

1481
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:19,080
will your database
be able to find the data? No.

1482
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,280
When it is not going to find a reader,
it will that you request rate

1483
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,040
because you are trying to send something
which is not available.

1484
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,680
If somebody must send something
which is available.

1485
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:31,800
For example, I created new employee.

1486
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,440
This new employee I

1487
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:38,000
created
and this time going to send this to.

1488
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,600
So now this is the correct request

1489
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,880
at the moment I provided
this is the correct receipt.

1490
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,200
It is returning minor target cutting

1491
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,080
connect again, it didn't need to do here.

1492
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,280
Can you see this?

1493
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:56,000
Everyone?

1494
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:56,640
Right.

1495
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:00,480
So now now here to delete the employee.

1496
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:01,600
You get this message.

1497
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,200
Employee delete it right.

1498
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,040
Sorry. One more point.

1499
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,240
So we get 200 or it's delete.

1500
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,840
Not what did not exist.

1501
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,520
It does not exist.

1502
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,400
That's
why I sent Alexa to read the eBay code.

1503
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,040
I give you the site. Right?

1504
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,520
If you know what is the meaning of 400.

1505
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,120
Right. It will understand it for so.

1506
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:26,520
Now see is what happened
when you send to delete request.

1507
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:27,840
Right?

1508
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:33,080
You deleted the data
or deleted data from database.

1509
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:34,600
Right.

1510
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:39,400
When you delete gender data from database
dataset returns or get 200. Why?

1511
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,080
Because the operation
you wanted to perform the operation

1512
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,120
you wanted to perform,
you completed with the operation.

1513
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,280
Right.

1514
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,560
Those one does
find can start break monument.

1515
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,720
Just wait for 3 minutes and then you have

1516
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,600
just 3 minutes.

1517
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,800
So now VRC deleted data from the database.

1518
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,480
You want it to be deleted frame deleted.

1519
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:06,120
Next point
200 is okay for that rate for them now.

1520
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:09,680
Now after these, you're
trying to search the information.

1521
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,640
Why aren't getting it employed now?

1522
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:14,720
Something
which is already deleted from the database

1523
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,000
is no more part of your database

1524
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,040
and you are trying to search
on that parameter which is not available.

1525
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:27,040
The database you will get work
you will get for 040 bad request. Why?

1526
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,880
Because there is nothing available
in the database for that.

1527
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,520
But getting my point

1528
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,480
getting them one way so posted
deleted this by you got 200.

1529
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,880
Now you're trying to access
the information where I get it right.

1530
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,120
It is not work
because it is checking something

1531
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:45,440
which is not already available
in the database.

1532
01:27:45,440 --> 01:28:00,600
So what is this clear to everyone?

1533
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,080
Guys,

1534
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,480
when we talk about current

1535
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:09,360
operations, that's why I stopped.

1536
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:13,240
You know, we'll see
when we talk about current operations

1537
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:16,240
we created or not

1538
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,920
crib the information or not

1539
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:28,120
we updated the information or not

1540
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,000
and we deleted the information or not.

1541
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,040
We are done with all four types
of explanation.

1542
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:35,960
Correct.

1543
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:41,760
Operation is done.

1544
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,560
Yes, exactly.

1545
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,200
Exactly.

1546
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:49,400
Then at that point of time, you have to
check everything on completion.

1547
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,720
So better to digitally.

1548
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:53,560
Right.

1549
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:57,400
So now now the basic is done right.

1550
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,360
The basic operation is done

1551
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,760
in this raid,

1552
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:06,000
in this next three and a half hours.

1553
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,080
Right. In this next 3 hours, I believe

1554
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:12,640
I will take you to the most interesting

1555
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:16,160
part of the story.

1556
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:19,560
This coming 3 hours
will be the really exciting journey.

1557
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,240
Right?

1558
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,800
So let's take a break now after break.

1559
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:27,760
Once you come back,
everything would be interesting, right?

1560
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:31,240
So that would be very easy things
and interesting things we are going to do.

1561
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:37,880
So after the break,
we do all of the stuff.

1562
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,960
What is this?

1563
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,200
What is glasses are for three.

1564
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:57,760
How many people do you have right now?

1565
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,800
Fine.

1566
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:05,680
So now, now, here

1567
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,760
we have covered all the operations

1568
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,840
after discrete operations. Right.

1569
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:13,960
Let me tell you something.

1570
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,200
What else you can do here? The best thing

1571
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,800
when we talk about the postman

1572
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:25,760
and we talk about postman here, two things
you can do.

1573
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,600
First,

1574
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,760
when it comes to verification, part

1575
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,280
verification

1576
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:38,200
and validation, part,

1577
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:41,280
we should not rely only on the status code

1578
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:46,360
red guys.

1579
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,600
You guys getting my point?

1580
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,240
We should not rely only on the status quo
because we have seen

1581
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,240
if there's a glitch in the API,
then we get this code correct.

1582
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:59,360
But there is always a problem
with the response guidance rate

1583
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,600
in the body of the response.

1584
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,680
We always see some of the problems.

1585
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,920
Correct? So

1586
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:07,480
even though the

1587
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:11,560
message seems to be a status quo,
but still the details

1588
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:14,440
which we are getting in
the body is having some problem

1589
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:25,040
right? Yes.

1590
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,440
So now the first thing I should show you
in the postman.

1591
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:33,480
See, whenever we make any any request
and we get the response rate,

1592
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,920
we get any request
and we get the response here.

1593
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,400
What we have to do is

1594
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,360
the very first thing.

1595
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:49,680
Can you see this console part?

1596
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:54,440
You guys in the bottom left, bottom

1597
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:56,880
right,

1598
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:02,520
click on this console.

1599
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:03,920
Now just see this response.

1600
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,200
Get one employee 26112. The latest one.

1601
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:09,000
We need 26112.

1602
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,120
Can you see

1603
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,200
all the responses are available here
if you see all the responses are available

1604
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:14,400
here.

1605
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,760
Eight Whatever the request we have created
so far, all the request you see

1606
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:22,160
now, Hazim, this is the console.

1607
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,760
The console

1608
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:29,200
just click on the console
and you'll see all of your request that.

1609
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,120
Even with so far

1610
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:36,440
lazy, are you able to see this part

1611
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,480
now? Now click on any of this.

1612
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:44,280
For example, the latest one, right?

1613
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,080
Ballistics one.

1614
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:51,560
What we did,
we get the details of the employee.

1615
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,320
Now when you open this,
this is the response rate.

1616
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,680
This is the response.

1617
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:00,200
So it says request
to headers was contained.

1618
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:03,280
We provided application JSON
authorization.

1619
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,440
We provided builder token user agent.

1620
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,920
Is this but Austrian?

1621
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,520
We are postman, right exempt
everything was to token trade

1622
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,480
and then see the response headers.

1623
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,480
These are the items
I'm talking about in the response.

1624
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,960
See in the response

1625
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,840
you see these headers we have
in the response been headers, right.

1626
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,360
All these been headers. Great.

1627
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:33,200
What we have and the response
you're going to console and here you see

1628
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,280
these are those response headers mundane
for date of February.

1629
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,400
Right. This is their time

1630
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:43,680
server is Apache Xe powered right.

1631
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,480
Every single thing is invocation is store
no must rehabilitate fragment

1632
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:55,520
things are available you can
you see this again you see this okay

1633
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,120
and then the response
party is available this

1634
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,400
the response board is available
this you see.

1635
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:04,520
And so

1636
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:07,200
the employee explains

1637
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,360
that Then we then every single thing guys

1638
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:13,200
see today's date, Sunday, 28th of January.

1639
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:15,480
This is the time for the postman server.

1640
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:24,240
Wait, so

1641
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:28,520
now what you can do is instead of
just following,

1642
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:33,200
relying on the status, good,
you can go here in the response body.

1643
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:33,720
Right?

1644
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:34,600
And from there

1645
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,680
you can verify some of the feeds
or the privacy of bonds and everything.

1646
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,280
Right.

1647
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:44,360
Or if you want to see whether it is generating the employee or not, you can verify

1648
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,200
if you want to see.

1649
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:49,320
This is not closely my past bit
that I'm getting this post remote.

1650
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:53,720
Not you can verify
it means would be value.

1651
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:58,160
You can verify in this particular part
how they will discuss.

1652
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,240
But this is also the operation
of verification validation.

1653
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:08,680
We can perform in Postman the second thing

1654
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:16,920
you click on your Postman collection

1655
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:19,280
to click on the collection of this

1656
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:25,800
is everyone can

1657
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:31,400
click on collection.

1658
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:39,280
Now what do you have
in this collection, guys?

1659
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,360
What do you have in the collection?

1660
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,200
Tell me

1661
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:51,840
everything.

1662
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,240
Read all the request
you have in the collection.

1663
01:35:54,240 --> 01:35:54,960
Right?

1664
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:00,680
So now Postman says
if you want to run your entire collection

1665
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,200
in a single shot there also you can

1666
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:07,400
you don't want
you don't need to run one at one time.

1667
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,560
Another request
and then another request and a no,

1668
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,400
go ahead,
create collection and collection.

1669
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,440
It will work again.

1670
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:18,360
Similarly to your best to suit.

1671
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:22,520
So if you want to execute your suit,
remember in terms of this disorder,

1672
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,920
you have all the test cases. You
just run your test.

1673
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,480
So it works for all the test gives. This.

1674
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,920
If we talk about training class,
we provide bags like vision and smoke.

1675
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,840
So whatever other does
this belong to that particular bank?

1676
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,480
It executes all of them.

1677
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:38,800
Similarly, here, this collection sees

1678
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:43,000
if you want to run,
you can run this complete collection.

1679
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,800
Can you see these are an option here
or from this three

1680
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:50,480
Also click here
and you see that I'm collection

1681
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,520
and collection, right?

1682
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,360
So now see what happens.

1683
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:58,040
Click run collection.

1684
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,360
It says

1685
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,880
it will run, create

1686
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:06,200
a user generated token and then create
employee gained one employee

1687
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:11,040
get all employers, get employment status,
get job photos of digit employee returns,

1688
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,880
updated partial employment admission
and building them

1689
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,400
right next. Can you see this?

1690
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,360
Everyone

1691
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,040
now here exists aberrations.

1692
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,600
What does it mean
when I say iterations speaks

1693
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,520
limitations?

1694
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:40,080
Basically how many times
you want to run your collection?

1695
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,840
Five times. 18 times, right?

1696
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,080
Multiple times.

1697
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,920
So right now keep it to one only. Right.

1698
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:48,600
We will run it one time.

1699
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,640
It says delay in the time.

1700
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:54,400
It means after every iteration
how much delay you need.

1701
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:57,360
I don't want any delay because I'm
going to execute just one thing.

1702
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,200
If you are passing the data
from any of the refinery,

1703
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:05,680
passing the data
from any other freight, no.

1704
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,880
So there is no data.

1705
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:11,280
If you want to see of responses,
click on this checkbox.

1706
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:13,760
Right. Keep variable values.

1707
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,280
We don't have any variable
as of now when collection

1708
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,360
without using a stored cookies
or save cookies after collection.

1709
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:25,280
Run again cookies coming to picture
You want to save your cookies

1710
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:26,640
after collection run.

1711
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,280
Let's save disabled
because my data is not good science.

1712
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,240
That is no formula of making,
especially on relaunching because.

1713
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:33,840
Right.

1714
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:37,680
So definitely
I should not be bothered about this part.

1715
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:50,640
Let's run collection.

1716
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:51,440
Can you guys see

1717
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:56,080
it says this request does not exist.

1718
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:00,920
This requester does not have any
does this request does not exist.

1719
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:04,560
This request does not exist
for all the request.

1720
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,760
It is saying the same thing.

1721
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:08,040
Can you see

1722
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,360
based.

1723
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:12,960
So what?

1724
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:13,720
What is this?

1725
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,400
This what this test is all about?

1726
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,280
See if I had an event on it from here.

1727
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:20,880
Right.

1728
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,520
See if,
I run it from here. Let's see this one.

1729
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,600
If I had an individually, it is running

1730
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,240
fine. See?

1731
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,040
Let we cleared one template

1732
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,320
from here that would create new employee.

1733
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,880
This is the employee record

1734
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,560
working for fine.

1735
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:44,280
Correct.

1736
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,160
But the same thing if I'm going to run

1737
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,800
my collection part

1738
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,760
from this particular part

1739
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:56,480
the collection, it's not going to run

1740
01:39:59,120 --> 01:40:00,840
if I'm trying to run,

1741
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,320
see if this does not have any test.

1742
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:05,320
What is this

1743
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:07,920
test they will discuss on this test.

1744
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:09,960
All right.

1745
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,280
So far, individual requests are done,

1746
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:17,960
but there are no test
which we are executing.

1747
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:20,400
There are no test which we are executing.

1748
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:23,160
Right.
So now we have to focus on this part.

1749
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:26,160
So good things, good things first,

1750
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:28,760
we will not allow

1751
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,320
our to create best

1752
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,560
and use it in the postman plane

1753
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:58,320
requester.

1754
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,200
You are to lose impedance that provide you
what simple

1755
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,480
now? No, before this.

1756
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,120
Before this.

1757
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:19,200
Let me just explain
you Let me just explain one thing here.

1758
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,040
What is this

1759
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:31,920
query benefit?

1760
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,960
Anyone knows what is query, but it would

1761
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,760
instead of going to get request

1762
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:54,120
and check first,
this is all about get request only rate.

1763
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:56,160
Otherwise every single one I'm

1764
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:58,280
every single one.

1765
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:00,680
Right. I'm getting
see this is the response in green.

1766
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:05,120
So that means it is working.

1767
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:08,760
Mainly the parameter required
to run the query subtest,

1768
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:12,960
take care of the slider, document
what it says you have to follow.

1769
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,840
Exactly the request
which is available there.

1770
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:16,400
Right.

1771
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,440
If you don't follow this, am

1772
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:31,920
great.

1773
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,120
So now

1774
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:36,480
the first one.

1775
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,880
No, no, no, nothing, nothing.

1776
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,280
It's a simple.

1777
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,440
We are also using the same thing, right?

1778
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,600
You can your message right
Someone just post your message

1779
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:51,680
in this index of is available
she was available then will help you make.

1780
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,960
I know there is a small query to business.

1781
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,920
The mistake you are doing is put in there.

1782
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,920
If we look, it's not a big deal.

1783
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,720
So now here is query better.

1784
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,760
And we told you something.
We need to focus.

1785
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,480
And there is another of bad
and we done when we talk about is

1786
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:08,880
thought better

1787
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,040
what is the second one.

1788
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,080
The second one is both better and better.

1789
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:15,120
The first one is query better.

1790
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:17,640
Now understand the difference
in between these two

1791
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:19,320
query better.

1792
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,480
We want better parameter. What is this?

1793
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:25,440
See, when I open this,

1794
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:29,520
you see the parameters are coming
after the question mark

1795
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:30,920
and you see

1796
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,520
everyone see the parameters

1797
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,080
which are coming after the question mark.

1798
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:42,440
So when they're coming after the question
mark,

1799
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:45,480
it is come, it comes with the key and

1800
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:47,280
well knew what

1801
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,360
query parameter comes
with key and value board.

1802
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:57,720
So wherever you find G, whenever you find
a value after the question mark in your,

1803
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:01,520
you are will record this type of parameter

1804
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:06,240
as query barometer.

1805
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,080
We call this type of parameters
as query parameter.

1806
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:15,840
Then after the question mark
you'll get D and value mode, right?

1807
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,240
So once you're done with your base,
you are a right after today you provide

1808
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:25,560
or it provides basically question mark in
whatever the value is coming.

1809
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:28,840
After the question
mark, it says query better. We

1810
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:31,840
did not separate stuff,

1811
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,680
but basically
it is defining the whole path, right?

1812
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,080
The segregation is before that.

1813
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:40,000
This is the part of the question mark.

1814
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,200
This is the parameter when combined both
it makes a single list.

1815
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:46,440
Is this clear?

1816
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:54,520
This part is what is clearly parameter.

1817
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:55,320
Right?

1818
01:44:56,440 --> 01:44:58,080
So now another one

1819
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:03,640
let me show you.

1820
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:05,080
I open Amazon.

1821
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:06,480
Can you see this Amazon?

1822
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:07,560
I opened

1823
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:15,320
I click on for two years now

1824
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:19,520
now here you see when I click on foot

1825
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,360
we're after Amazon dot in slash Q

1826
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:28,920
slash came in you see

1827
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:32,040
it didn't start with question mark

1828
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,080
directly forced slash came

1829
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,160
right or

1830
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:41,560
let me give you one best example for
that I'm writing here

1831
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:42,880
let's see

1832
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:55,920
so now if you see images right

1833
01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:00,000
if I click on the images option,
I click here.

1834
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,720
I select this image.

1835
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:04,440
Now you see here, right, It says Google

1836
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:07,280
dot com slash search

1837
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:10,720
and you see slash search, Right.

1838
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,280
So the moment you keep for further,
you keep adding one thing

1839
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,720
to think three things, right?

1840
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:19,880
It will keep adding one more slash
with your request keep adding

1841
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:24,600
one more slash with you request this one
find this one will add the request.

1842
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,280
So whatever the parameters
you are asking with the slash,

1843
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:33,400
recall them fourth parameter
because in part parameters

1844
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:38,280
we don't have to provide any question
mark, any key or any value.

1845
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:44,040
You simply define the bond in back,
but just creates the things it provides.

1846
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:47,840
You ready the complete
but it see the complete month, right?

1847
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,840
For example let's get prime

1848
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:51,760
so you'll see

1849
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:56,320
landscape was using photography fine
So now when you open this photography

1850
01:46:56,720 --> 01:47:01,560
right in the images or in the all right
you are seeing this particular one

1851
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:03,600
will all

1852
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,440
dot com in Google dot
com you perform some search in search

1853
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,600
you performed
what landscape the source is this range.

1854
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:16,200
So then after question mark
right after the question mark you see box

1855
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:20,560
barometer comes query
barometer comes in opposite single slash.

1856
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,680
What comes there gives the mark parameter.

1857
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:27,080
So in Google under search,
you made this operation correct.

1858
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:31,520
This is when this is the sort of
search is better and better.

1859
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,720
Google right.

1860
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:36,800
So under Google in search,
you perform this operation.

1861
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,840
So Google dot
com was the initial thing we provided.

1862
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,560
And then when we provide the

1863
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:45,920
search option, the board gets added
automatically by slash.

1864
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:49,480
So whenever whenever something comes up

1865
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:52,800
with Slash, whenever
something comes up with Slash,

1866
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,800
this is part parameter
that adds to the path.

1867
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,920
And whenever some comes with question
mark,

1868
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:01,920
we call it as query barometer in the month

1869
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:09,480
for example, Google dot com

1870
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,760
slash search

1871
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,080
slash log in something like this.

1872
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:17,320
This is your bot barometer, right?

1873
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:21,480
But if it is coming with Mark,
employee I.D.

1874
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,920
is equal to 1 to 3.

1875
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,880
Then again when it was performed
by using something like this.

1876
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:29,840
Right.

1877
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,960
Because they come after the question mark
they are your query better.

1878
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:34,520
There

1879
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:38,480
is this clear difference
and we've been very open and.

1880
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:55,520
We did a lot better.

1881
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,800
There is this clear.

1882
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:02,040
Now let's let's try to do this.

1883
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:04,200
Let's try to do this.

1884
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,240
I'm going here and I'm writing here.

1885
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:08,360
See HDB

1886
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,440
equivalent of a slash

1887
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:16,880
H&M sending index data.

1888
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:19,000
NEG same things.

1889
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,240
Thanks dot net.

1890
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:24,560
And here I'm going to provide

1891
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:27,320
some index API slash

1892
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:31,880
slash, API slash.

1893
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:33,760
I want to provide it all

1894
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:38,600
in all,

1895
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:41,280
get all employees right,

1896
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:46,080
get all employees door HP

1897
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:47,960
slash.

1898
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:51,720
I'm saying cloud

1899
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:56,160
cloud consultant.

1900
01:49:56,160 --> 01:50:02,160
Now see what I'm doing in this particular
set of I'm going into the EPA location

1901
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:06,480
and then all the employees that I see get
all employees, BHP,

1902
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:09,920
I'm providing cloud consulting slash rate.

1903
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:12,720
Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.
I'm not going to search anything.

1904
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:14,080
I'm just showing you right now.

1905
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:19,240
Okay, so here, this would be
your little white cloud consultant,

1906
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,240
Rain. Cloud consultant.

1907
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,760
So now here
you see this cloud concerted part.

1908
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:28,440
So this is basically the main you are

1909
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:31,160
after this slash.

1910
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:33,480
It is extending the path of the API.

1911
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,480
Then one more part of the API location,

1912
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:40,320
then one more part of the end point here.

1913
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,280
Also, if you want to specify
the information or rate

1914
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:47,280
among all the employees
I need only cloud consent, then fine.

1915
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:50,280
So now this part returns

1916
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:53,280
all the cloud consultants is our database.

1917
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,240
This part returns
all the Cloud consulting.

1918
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:57,160
Correct

1919
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:03,160
is if we provide only this part.

1920
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:06,640
In this part,
tell me what represents the highlighted

1921
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,400
one will return What

1922
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:16,080
all the employees right.

1923
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:19,440
So now after this, after the slash.

1924
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:22,240
If I provide cloud consulting, then what?

1925
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:28,440
It will return.

1926
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:30,800
It will return only
cloud consultants, right?

1927
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:35,760
Whatever the cloud consultants
we will be having in our database,

1928
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:39,640
this will return all the cloud consultants
after

1929
01:51:39,640 --> 01:51:43,240
Cloud consulting
if I want a particular one.

1930
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:46,800
So four are good thing
one particular thing.

1931
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:49,520
I need to go with query management

1932
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:52,680
after this.

1933
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:56,520
If I want to specify
one particular piece of information

1934
01:51:56,520 --> 01:52:00,240
from the bunch of information
I have to rely on query with.

1935
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:03,400
If I want to define the complete font

1936
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:06,960
so that I can access all the information
available on that.

1937
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,120
But I have to rely on but better.

1938
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:10,840
So now

1939
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:14,480
here, here, if I want to provide indexing,
hey, I'm seeing

1940
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,920
in all the cloud consultants.

1941
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,480
In all the cloud consultants,
give me the one

1942
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:26,720
whose page is due zero eight, for example.

1943
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:30,000
20 and I'm seeing the gender

1944
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,040
of the particular person is

1945
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:34,960
these women.

1946
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:38,120
So now see, I'm
just defining this part, right?

1947
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:40,520
This is my this is my world based,

1948
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:45,960
my query barometer,
and this one is my body

1949
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:55,200
barometer so that I'm getting equity
barometer, correct.

1950
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:58,480
Is this correct case?

1951
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:02,520
Any question in this part
query buried with any question

1952
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:05,320
so far, strings

1953
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:19,320
all clear?

1954
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:20,760
Yes, Correct.

1955
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,920
Now, you can verify the same thing here.

1956
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:27,960
Also see in this part
your address of the server,

1957
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:32,720
then your API location after Slash,
then slash gate

1958
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:36,080
one, employ it because these are
your parameters coming in the fund.

1959
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:37,440
So these are automatically

1960
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:41,680
these are correct

1961
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,400
that exists

1962
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:54,640
after a cloud consultant can do it
one more time.

1963
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:55,320
Yes, ma'am.

1964
01:53:55,320 --> 01:54:00,680
So for example, if you see in the cloud
consultants, you are trying to target

1965
01:54:00,680 --> 01:54:04,120
a complete bunch of information
by a month barometer.

1966
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:07,240
But now in an old consultant,
let's say you have

1967
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:09,520
then students, 13 employees,

1968
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,440
then cloud consultant, you have
you want to get just one

1969
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:17,560
cloud contracting, which one
you need to provide the specific identity.

1970
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,720
You have to build that.

1971
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:22,840
Okay, I need the cloud consultant
who is having the edge going the engine,

1972
01:54:22,840 --> 01:54:28,520
but always having the priority 1 to 3
and having the value for five six.

1973
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:32,560
If you provide this type of information
we call this equity parameter

1974
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,240
squared again at any point of the month.

1975
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:37,280
No, I don't know.

1976
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:41,880
Remember, this query can be
inside the part where you are.

1977
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,560
You are having the data.

1978
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:47,200
For example,
if I provide this 2820 during remit here

1979
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:51,840
press index API, will it work?

1980
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:52,720
Will it work?

1981
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,440
I don't know.

1982
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:56,680
No, it will not work.

1983
01:54:57,720 --> 01:54:58,280
Why? It will

1984
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:02,200
not work
because it's a simple like in the water.

1985
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:06,120
We have all the clouds
and you are trying to find on your bank

1986
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:08,040
and not find that. Why?

1987
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:10,320
Because they are already available
in deep water.

1988
01:55:10,840 --> 01:55:13,560
You have to open the wardrobe,
then only search for it

1989
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:22,080
if you are starting somewhere else
you're not quite on right.

1990
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,720
But it

1991
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:25,760
fine.

1992
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,840
I hope the example was relevant.

1993
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:30,520
I just thought of that examples
I giving you.

1994
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,600
You find

1995
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:39,240
the problem.

1996
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:44,560
So please explain and point the time
you read this point to touch point first.

1997
01:55:44,560 --> 01:56:00,480
And with this.

1998
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,960
All right then and then we will.

1999
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:08,560
Which one is end point.

2000
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,800
Which one is editable Indian

2001
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,480
this practice and applying

2002
01:56:15,480 --> 01:56:19,840
the method read the last part of the
you want it and what is the point of the

2003
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,480
then when you read it in The Postman

2004
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:31,800
Postman is here.

2005
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:53,520
Mm. Surveyor is touch point.

2006
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:59,800
I'm expecting answer you.

2007
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:02,800
Can you just explain it and we will warn

2008
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:03,480
Simon.

2009
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:05,640
First I need to ask

2010
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:09,000
first I need to ask why I need to ask
because this is something irrelevant

2011
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:09,800
to the topic.

2012
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:12,800
And if I spend my time on something
which is irrelevant supposedly

2013
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:15,480
to ask where
he got the information from straight.

2014
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,920
So this is my duty. Let me do my work.

2015
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:20,080
It is extremely important for me then.

2016
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:20,800
Me, sir.

2017
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,200
Yeah, exactly.

2018
01:57:22,200 --> 01:57:23,000
That's what I'm saying.

2019
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,320
So you should tell your people

2020
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,080
by themselves.

2021
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:33,120
We are not wasting their time
yet Ahead of their time.

2022
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:33,840
Right.

2023
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:37,760
The bind which I'm occupying
and I'm taking, I'm trying to cover more

2024
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:39,240
and more topics for you, Right?

2025
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:41,480
So please don't tell me that
you're wasting time here.

2026
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,440
If you think so.

2027
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,360
If you think so, that we are wasting time.

2028
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,440
Is let me so I can go in fast.

2029
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:54,800
I can explain the things bust
this do let me know.

2030
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:54,920
That's

2031
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:57,800
fine, guys.

2032
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:02,560
So now, now, so far,
how many of you guys think

2033
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:18,280
that you're
wasting their time in the class? Now?

2034
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:29,800
You find Fine.

2035
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,400
So now, now you'll see here.

2036
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,640
You see this particular point, right?

2037
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:39,720
When we talk about sending the collection,
it is asking for the best

2038
01:58:40,760 --> 01:58:47,720
rate.

2039
01:58:47,720 --> 01:58:50,200
So that's what I wanted to ask him. Right.

2040
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:53,840
So that even I can give you
this is this touch point.

2041
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:57,000
I never thought anyone

2042
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,320
no one got this question
in the interviews.

2043
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:01,440
This was completely in the living thing.

2044
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:03,120
So I just wanted to ask him.

2045
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:05,400
I can make his concepts clear.

2046
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:10,000
I was just trying to help him
so that next time, if he did something

2047
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,040
like this right, then definitely
you should know all the things, right?

2048
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:16,640
So that is the way to clear someone's
doubt.

2049
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:21,680
That's what I am trying to do.

2050
01:59:21,680 --> 01:59:25,840
Fine, Because if he doesn't have
a complete information and if I did know

2051
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:30,440
if I all he has to do somebody me
and he does someone, indeed

2052
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:31,800
he will identify that.

2053
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:38,160
Okay, this is totally irrelevant
to their topic, right?

2054
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,640
So please don't get it.

2055
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:40,160
Don't take it.

2056
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:45,280
Otherwise I'm just trying to help
this people because they do some 50%, 25%.

2057
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:48,200
They need them need point in
and the applicants are genuine.

2058
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:49,680
But it's our duty.

2059
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:52,800
It's my duty to explain them
what is relevant, what is the relevant.

2060
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:57,720
So first there's get them some work,
let them complete some work,

2061
01:59:58,120 --> 02:00:01,520
have some identity on their own,
and then maybe I'll explain.

2062
02:00:03,120 --> 02:00:03,920
Fine, guys.

2063
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:06,960
So now, now, so far we did this.

2064
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:10,080
We tried to run the collection,
but they didn't ask for one thing.

2065
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,080
What is that thing?

2066
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:13,320
It asked for best.

2067
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,680
So what is this best?

2068
02:00:15,680 --> 02:00:18,320
We need to understand this, right?
We need to understand.

2069
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,880
What is this test?

2070
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:21,360
What does this all about?

2071
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:24,120
So first first let me tell you this

2072
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:31,560
here approach

2073
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:35,880
for if we are testing

2074
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:43,000
ten, the first thing when we talk
about approach for the API testing,

2075
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:46,400
what kind of testing we're
performing in API

2076
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:00,160
are amrut functional testing.

2077
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,440
What is functional testing days.

2078
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,080
Tell me, Simon, what is functional testing

2079
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,360
UI testing is functional one

2080
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:24,240
this is non UI testing, right?

2081
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:27,080
API is non UI.

2082
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:30,400
There's been so we perform
integration testing.

2083
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:31,120
You need a

2084
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,480
rate rise.

2085
02:01:41,480 --> 02:01:43,200
This is integration distinct.

2086
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:45,640
Now can somebody tell me
what is integration does do

2087
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,480
in somebody.

2088
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:57,160
Yeah. Silva Yeah I.

2089
02:01:57,160 --> 02:02:00,000
Mean I don't
I would share this not with everyone

2090
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:03,400
The rate

2091
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,880
we have one piece of application

2092
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:09,760
we are trying to add
another piece of application.

2093
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:14,160
So when we are trying to add another piece
of application writing,

2094
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:18,160
merging this two portions
in one application we have to test.

2095
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:21,320
But if my existing

2096
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:24,960
as well as the new, what parts are working
or not in the application.

2097
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:25,520
Right.

2098
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:27,640
So when we integrate those two things

2099
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:31,880
and then we try to test this part,
we call it integration.

2100
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:41,560
This right,
we call it integration testing.

2101
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:46,680
So now, now here,
let me write first one user story, right?

2102
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:50,360
What kind of user story
you generally get in the API testing?

2103
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,600
See, first

2104
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:56,160
you have to create an employ, right?

2105
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:00,000
And then get the created employee.

2106
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:02,360
This should be.

2107
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:05,480
But don't we also check the function
of the application here?

2108
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:08,440
So when we talk about functions,
what does it mean?

2109
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:16,440
Input and output?

2110
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:18,680
We are verifying the connection links.

2111
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:21,160
We are verifying the API status.

2112
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:22,320
Good, right?

2113
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:26,640
So we are taking the connection that has
been established in between that thing.

2114
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:27,000
Right?

2115
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,280
And the server is working absolutely fine.

2116
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:34,680
All right. So create updated index.

2117
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:38,400
What I am saying,
the primary point is your API status.

2118
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,560
Could you perform this API instead?

2119
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:50,720
This could be testing anyone.

2120
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:54,560
No, you don't break,
you don't in there did indeed

2121
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:57,720
that was you perform this to 00201404.

2122
02:03:57,720 --> 02:03:59,440
This is what you build in the database

2123
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:08,240
guys.

2124
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:12,760
Yeah, that is based on me.

2125
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:14,480
Do you checked?

2126
02:04:14,760 --> 02:04:16,720
Yes. Got it. Got it.

2127
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:19,760
So there is a difference in between
distinct

2128
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:23,280
API, distinct database, distinct

2129
02:04:23,600 --> 02:04:27,600
in the first form of testing
when you have to deal with the UI

2130
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:33,920
by the website, you always make sure that
okay, if you're entering the user name

2131
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:37,920
right, this being username is updating
can be user name.

2132
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:42,240
So function be is linked with the look

2133
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:44,880
and feel the great part, great

2134
02:04:46,120 --> 02:04:48,120
right with the great button.

2135
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:52,480
But here here in API
testing we're taking the integration

2136
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:55,040
that the data keeps adding
into the application.

2137
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:58,720
The link has been established,
the connection has been updated

2138
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:02,240
and now when we are sending
some information, then we are creating

2139
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:06,480
some information
not with the UI part but with the API.

2140
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,840
But that is non-US by right?

2141
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:12,320
So from here
I'm able to get the successful messages.

2142
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:16,720
What does this success with messages
these are your DBA is status called

2143
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,120
right

2144
02:05:28,760 --> 02:05:29,880
getting my phone case.

2145
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:32,240
So there is a difference in database.

2146
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:36,080
You never test API part in API
you never guessed

2147
02:05:36,080 --> 02:05:39,160
you born in UI, you never tasted Facebook.

2148
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:43,440
If if we were performing the same approach

2149
02:05:43,440 --> 02:05:46,000
in all that region,
why do we need to distribute relevance?

2150
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:47,640
Makes sense.

2151
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:50,160
Things make sense.

2152
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,560
Then why do we need to test entry levels?

2153
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,720
I have seen integration testings,
implements.

2154
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:58,200
See, let me give you
a very simple example.

2155
02:05:58,200 --> 02:05:59,880
You have a login page.

2156
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:02,160
You already have a log
in pending a replication,

2157
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,840
you are testing
your login functionalities working.

2158
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:08,880
Find your positives
about your negative scenario Blank log.

2159
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,800
Everything is working fine. Now.

2160
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:13,600
The model your developers have ended here

2161
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:16,200
in module or in employment.

2162
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:17,160
Right?

2163
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:20,200
So now your application head as do module.

2164
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:23,840
So post is module module
and the second one is an employee module.

2165
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:26,720
And here you had just one module
that was a log in modern.

2166
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,920
So now after adding this
an employee module in the application

2167
02:06:32,200 --> 02:06:36,840
you have to perform testing to make sure
there turnaround in module as well.

2168
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:38,360
Is your employee.

2169
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:42,720
Both modules are working absolutely fine.

2170
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:42,960
Mark.

2171
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:48,240
This is what we call integration testing

2172
02:06:48,240 --> 02:07:00,600
on industrial.

2173
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:04,640
Now after this what we have
you have to verify there

2174
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:11,360
we created employee, correct?

2175
02:07:12,280 --> 02:07:12,960
Correct.

2176
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:18,800
So now here, verify
the created employee is part

2177
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,840
or all existing employee

2178
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:25,080
Now is you guys existing employee, right.

2179
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:28,440
It means that your data should be
generated

2180
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:31,040
in this specific location in database.

2181
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:35,200
It should be like your generating the user
and it is generating and will work

2182
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:37,400
normal user. This should not right.

2183
02:07:37,800 --> 02:07:43,080
It should get updated and created
and added in the right place in database.

2184
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:45,640
Alright. Alright.

2185
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:49,520
And that update the employee after this.

2186
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:54,720
We need to and again
we have to get the updated details

2187
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:58,800
of the employee,
updated details of the employee.

2188
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:02,800
This is the user story we generally take
for the complete scenario

2189
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:06,240
and then we will simply

2190
02:08:06,240 --> 02:08:09,360
return or share the partially.

2191
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:11,680
We will update the employee.

2192
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:15,360
After partially updating the employee,
we will simply verify

2193
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:19,320
right, verify what all are

2194
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:23,040
the things we have modified that generated

2195
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,560
verify that job data,

2196
02:08:25,640 --> 02:08:27,880
fight the instances. Right?

2197
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:31,120
Any instance we can verify the instances,
any other thing.

2198
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:33,480
So this must be my users. Me.

2199
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:37,200
So now you see I'm will be everywhere
this verify

2200
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:40,160
that if I have been five points
give you see

2201
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:41,640
if I have any point.

2202
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:43,120
Can you see this

2203
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:49,800
without performing test in the postman?

2204
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:53,360
We cannot verify
or we needed any permission.

2205
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:58,480
Everyone agrees with the point.

2206
02:08:58,480 --> 02:08:59,880
Everyone agrees with this point.

2207
02:08:59,880 --> 02:09:01,920
I'm not fine

2208
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:06,120
now let me check your knowledge between

2209
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:08,960
then me here.

2210
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:12,400
When it comes to test
a particular piece of application,

2211
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:17,240
when it comes to test a particular piece
of application witnessed in how amendments

2212
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:28,400
Windows ten Division one linked windows
didn't

2213
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:32,760
you in one linked with the student staging
and when we pre-production

2214
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:36,680
and when we test in certain mind
with this Dingwall environment,

2215
02:09:36,680 --> 02:09:38,760
we saw it in production environment,
right?

2216
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:42,240
Depending on your company,
the structure you can decide

2217
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:49,040
whatever the environments
you have correct or not.

2218
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:52,560
Correct or not either dam or QB or

2219
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:56,840
staging or pre-production or cert
or on or production.

2220
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:59,640
These all are the environments, right?

2221
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:02,880
These are the environment
generally organizations here,

2222
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:06,840
depending on your company,
depending on your client,

2223
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:09,760
depending on your architecture architect.

2224
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:10,680
Right.

2225
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:16,560
They can decide how many environments
they want to have.

2226
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:27,320
Sandbox Is this the environment?

2227
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:27,800
What is this?

2228
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:29,160
They one sandbox?

2229
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:31,320
I've never heard
about this type of environment.

2230
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:34,680
Anybody? Not anybody.

2231
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:35,040
Nobody.

2232
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:37,480
Anybody is not in the article that

2233
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:40,560
sandbox, not metaverse.

2234
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,440
Maybe
they gave the name to their environments

2235
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:48,720
metaverse or something like this
playground to create something like this.

2236
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:51,240
They provide these are the normal ones.

2237
02:10:51,240 --> 02:10:55,840
What exactly do environment for developers
do you in mind linked or do is

2238
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,240
is standing environment
very different stages

2239
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:02,440
pre-production environment
exactly that the public of your production

2240
02:11:02,440 --> 02:11:06,520
environment on which we perform immediate
testing right before the deployment

2241
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:09,360
certification environment is what note

2242
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:13,160
this performance testing
something like this quality environment

2243
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:16,960
is what also need you in quality
if we need to.

2244
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:21,800
Good when we say But like I said, we don't
need all this environment at one time.

2245
02:11:22,080 --> 02:11:26,360
We can have two, three or four in one,
which makes two weeks, not one.

2246
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:27,240
And the studio.

2247
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:32,960
Now if you want to give the name of your
environment to live ours, you can do that

2248
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:35,360
if you want to give

2249
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:39,200
playground developers, you can do that
and call it playground like this.

2250
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:42,360
So you can have millions of names
on the environment tree.

2251
02:11:42,600 --> 02:11:44,960
These are the genetic one, common ones
which I give you

2252
02:11:46,800 --> 02:12:00,720
So far, so good.

2253
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:05,400
You made the same leg stage.

2254
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:10,480
Q Well, you mean not understanding
design, user experience testing

2255
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:14,920
you will be is not in the staging you
it is not in staging.

2256
02:12:14,920 --> 02:12:17,800
If there is no pre-production,
then it is spreading.

2257
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:20,440
Otherwise it will always in production
you would

2258
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:24,600
find point.

2259
02:12:24,600 --> 02:12:28,800
So now,
now just look at this point right now.

2260
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:34,680
Just come on.

2261
02:12:34,680 --> 02:12:44,040
How long?

2262
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:46,600
Just look at this point here.

2263
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:49,160
He had built this point, isn't it?

2264
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:50,960
This environment

2265
02:12:51,160 --> 02:12:52,000
case.

2266
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:54,280
This is environment of not

2267
02:12:55,360 --> 02:13:05,960
any more.

2268
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:08,280
Okay, see this point?

2269
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:11,280
This point is same here.

2270
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:14,280
Also here, also

2271
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:17,680
here also zeros everywhere.

2272
02:13:17,720 --> 02:13:21,960
The environment is same great
deal slash API or similar

2273
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:23,280
not between

2274
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:27,520
seen what

2275
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:33,400
if you consider this is a Q in
when this is a Q and when you have written

2276
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:39,160
100 request,
how many requests you able to do?

2277
02:13:39,160 --> 02:13:43,680
100 request in only 100 request
you updated?

2278
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:48,200
This part isn't in mind
whether you want this is a minority order.

2279
02:13:48,200 --> 02:13:50,920
You updated this part everywhere. Correct.

2280
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:55,440
Now let's say you have to test this theme.

2281
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,560
You are in the same API.

2282
02:13:57,560 --> 02:14:01,440
Is this same APIs you need to test
in development environment.

2283
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:08,800
What what do you do?

2284
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:09,920
What would you do?

2285
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:15,600
Will you write another hundred
API request?

2286
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:17,320
Will you write 300 more days?

2287
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:20,880
Once again, query parameters once again,
everything 100 times.

2288
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:23,960
No, you simply select

Can you see

2333
02:16:49,880 --> 02:16:51,840
base. Can you see this

2334
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:53,880

02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,680
This is the initial value.

2348
02:17:33,680 --> 02:17:40,640

2352
02:17:46,720 --> 02:17:48,360
So when you provide initial value.

2353
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:52,280
Finally, that is also

2354
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:55,480

2355
02:17:55,560 --> 02:18:00,360
It should be defined before you find

02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:27,640
Can everyone see this value?

2363
02:18:27,640 --> 02:18:31,440
You can add multiple environments, guys
you can add.

2364
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:37,680
Then you will test environment.

2365
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:40,080
So here can you see here?

2366
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:43,200
Can you see you just changed his name to

2367
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,280
or let me write like this

2368
02:18:46,280 --> 02:18:49,520
Q a q e environment.

2369
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:52,440
I just changed it now.

2370
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:57,120
When I changed it,
you see it June Me So this time, this time

2371
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:00,720
you see I'm getting this queue environment
and in this do it.

2372
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:01,320
And when we,

2373
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:05,960
when I'm selecting by default
am getting this curious you are it or not.

2374
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:06,840
Did you see

2375
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:11,400

2376
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:13,000
or so now

2377
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:16,000
now everyone see this Q eight environment.

2378
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:18,720
This new environment is having

2379
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:21,160
this do it based.

2380

anybody want to see this part.

2382
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:42,120
So now what we will do first
we will update this value.

2383
02:19:42,800 --> 02:19:46,960
We will update this value here
in all the request.

2384
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:50,080
So now we don't need this part.

2385
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:55,320
What we need, we need the environment
which will save the date

2386
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:56,640
which we set there.

2387
02:19:56,640 --> 02:20:00,680
So what is the environment
related Environment,

2388
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:07,080
This one we're getting, you see the
you mouse over now what you have to do

2389
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:12,240
double Kali braces value, double click

02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:17,360
Right and keep this end point it is
so now you see this is the battery

2391
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:21,880
reprised one
and the moment you provide this Q a q A

2392
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:25,440
you are in when you like defining
a static variable here, right?

2393
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:27,360
So now see this curious.

2394
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:30,040
You are the moment
you go to our operation here

2395
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:34,320
it says this is the initial value,
this is the current value.

2396
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:38,440
Is this the correct one?

2397
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:40,080
Is this correct or not based on

2398
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:46,280
first first, let's check first.

2399
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:48,280
Let's check whether it is working or not.

2400
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:51,160
Let me say it

Email address.
You have already registered point.

2403
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:58,320
We can create any other user.

2404
02:20:58,320 --> 02:20:59,840
Let me go here.

2405
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:02,200
Let me provide to now see

2406
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:05,320
you'll see working fine.

2407
02:21:05,320 --> 02:21:07,480
201 created

2408
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:10,080
201 created it meets my

2409
02:21:10,080 --> 02:21:13,080
this particular variable is working
absolutely

2410
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:15,280
fine or not nice

2411
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:29,240
now now let's update this particular part.

2412
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:33,760
This particular part
in all the request First, did

2413
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:36,840
this particular part
in all the request saving

2414
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:41,600
use this one here also

2415
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:48,040
here on

2416
02:22:27,360 --> 02:22:29,240
we updated this information

2417
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:33,760
everywhere you see.

2418
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:36,840
Where did you copy
what the shortcut to call it.

2419
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:37,200
I will.

2420
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,520
I will can you should unwind. Yes.

2421
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:40,640
Now school.

2422
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:43,120
Where were you when we creating this park?

2423
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:45,880
There you go. This is like you a base.

2424
02:22:45,880 --> 02:22:48,840
You are a reader.
This environment variable

2425
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:50,960
rate.

2426
02:22:51,160 --> 02:22:53,640
What a shortcut to call it.

2427
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:54,960
Goodness, We are not.

2428
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:57,840
We state halfway done right.

2429
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:00,320
Half of the base is still pending
now as well.

2430
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:04,880
Can you see from we got this you would
miss you are in and we provide you

2431
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:08,800
so to pass the parameter
make sure this building is correct.

2432
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:09,320
Right.

2433
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:12,840
You can also payment with the after
double curly braces

2434
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:25,920
when you type it gives you this addition.

2435
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:28,920
So because in the value
also you provided is double quotes.

2436
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:32,480
Can you see here I didn't provide
double places like you are.

2437
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:35,400
Providing the welcome references

2438
02:23:35,440 --> 02:23:36,440
in the variable.

2439
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:38,880
Don't provide to welcome this Alex.

2440
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:49,320
Otherwise it will not work.

2441
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:50,080
Fine.

2442
02:23:50,440 --> 02:23:52,280
So now, now, now.

2443
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:55,520
See, just to check anything.

2444
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:58,280
Anything. Just check from see

2445
02:23:59,320 --> 02:24:00,680
working fine.

2446
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:03,440
Great big this one also it

2447
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:06,080
this one also batch.

2448
02:24:06,760 --> 02:24:10,080
This is also fine
because see why it's not giving?

2449
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:12,440
Because we already deleted this employee

2450
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:14,280
object.

2451
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:16,320
Partial employee returns in the body.

2452
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:19,200
These important things don't do right.

2453
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:23,760
We have the next one is six.

2454
02:24:23,760 --> 02:24:24,440
One, two, six.

2455
02:24:24,440 --> 02:24:35,880
So let's take this post yet.

2456
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:37,040
There you go.

2457
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:39,600
See the object successfully.

2458
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:40,280
Correct.

2459
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:46,080
But now

2460
02:24:54,440 --> 02:25:00,400
the correct.

2461
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:01,120
Fine.

2462
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:04,560
Now let's go a step further.

2463
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:06,840
Now let's go a step further.

2464
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:09,120
Now you see, you'll see here

2465
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:13,280
one more thing I have one more thing
I have, which is common.

2466
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:15,480
The value is not changing. What is that?

2467
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:18,520
I should not call this update.

2468
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:20,840
Partial employs didn't BHP

2469
02:25:22,600 --> 02:25:26,400
update embroidered? BHP

2470
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:28,920
delete employee dot BHP?

2471
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:30,760
I don't want to boss like this.

2472
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:33,120
I should not. But actually why?

2473
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:38,480
Because if the model I'm 1000 delete
what is right

2474
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:42,440
delete EPAs I'm requesting
I'm making 1000 delete request.

2475
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:46,640
If someone changed the end point,
then what would happen?

2476
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:50,680
I have to change it 1000 places right?

2477
02:25:50,680 --> 02:25:53,880
So I should not be in a position of there
if tomorrow

2478
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:57,800
someone didn't just make you
what you want it right now in terms of

2479
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:01,320
and when I'm very much sorted,
I have to change this.

2480
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:02,840
You are elected one, please.

2481
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:06,880
And from there the key which I'm
passing in April that exist, it will work

2482
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:08,400
fine, Right?

2483
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:14,040
So I'm going to save my when it comes
to provide the values of the environment.

2484
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:15,360
So bom

2485
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:18,840
bom comes from

2486
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:22,560
one what he has imposed with

2487
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:25,640
speed object model design,
but is a framework great.

2488
02:26:25,640 --> 02:26:27,960
It's like in particular,
unless it is a particular design.

2489
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,880
But is that one simplistically
for encapsulation?

2490
02:26:30,880 --> 02:26:33,600
Then you created these
and you keep your data see?

2491
02:26:33,920 --> 02:26:36,240
Right. So no one can change it. Fine.

2492
02:26:36,720 --> 02:26:40,360
Similarly,
when we talk about these endpoints,

2493
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:44,280
when we talk about this particular points,
what we have to do in this

2494
02:26:44,280 --> 02:26:47,120
case, click on this icon again.

2495
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:51,800
And this time they're not going to deal
with all of this in one means

2496
02:26:52,400 --> 02:26:56,040
like this time we have to deal with

2497
02:26:56,320 --> 02:26:59,920
global variables.

2498
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:01,880
We have to deal with global variables.

2499
02:27:01,880 --> 02:27:06,040
So my all the endpoints,
my all the other stuff

2500
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:10,000
comes under the category of global.

2501
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:10,560
And this

2502
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:16,440
industrial disk.

2503
02:27:16,440 --> 02:27:20,760
So now, now see how we can add
the global variables here.

2504
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:24,840
So first for us to click on this
great icon everyone can see

2505
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,560
at next,

2506
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:31,880
click on the American,

2507
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:33,920
see here.

2508
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:38,840
I have to provide this part,
create user, create user.

2509
02:27:38,840 --> 02:27:41,640
So from there, I got this

2510
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:43,400
guys.

2511
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:45,640
This is the create user rate.

2512
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:49,120
So let me right here.

2513
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:50,240
Can you repeat, please?

2514
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:58,320
Sure.

2515
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:03,120
You click on this egg,
can you see someone?

2516
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,960
Yeah. Don't worry.

2517
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:06,640
What you have what you don't have.

2518
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:08,960
It will sort it out. Don't worry.

2519
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:14,520
First click on egg, Leak on egg
and then here for straight.

2520
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:18,520
The variable name is Create user.

2521
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:20,640
Create user.

2522
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:23,400
And then I see an export button

2523
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:26,120
is that able to export it
and we import the whole event.

2524
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:30,120
First, don't look for the shortcut,
at least for a time.

2525
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:32,000
We do what I'm doing.

2526
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:36,120
Okay, so take this first do from the

2527
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:40,440
egg, this first menu from here
create user.

2528
02:28:40,440 --> 02:28:42,440
It is for admin one.

2529
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:46,440
Create user is for admin,
one create employs for the normal one

2530
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:49,800
and then provide this and you

2531
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:52,200
provide this value selected here.

2532
02:28:52,440 --> 02:28:53,240
Okay.

2533
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:56,400
Selected to enforce the

2534
02:28:56,680 --> 02:28:59,240
guys I provided variable name.

2535
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:02,320
I provided value and the current commit

2536
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:04,680
you clear

2537
02:29:05,560 --> 02:29:06,800
one endpoint any point

2538
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:10,040
and I selected the checkbox.

2539
02:29:10,240 --> 02:29:11,800
Is this clear?

2540
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:16,120
Yes. If yours is empty there,
why am I everything from scratch?

2541
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:27,480
Not then.

2542
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:29,600
The second is in writing. Generate token.

2543
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:34,800
So now go here, take the second endpoint.

2544
02:29:34,800 --> 02:29:39,640
Generate token.

2545
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:41,680
Take this one

2546
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,400
pasted print select

2547
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:49,160
select generate token

2548
02:29:51,200 --> 02:29:51,840
player.

2549
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:52,760
Everyone

2550
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:56,880
there is to end points we have ended.

2551
02:29:56,880 --> 02:30:01,280
Can we do same with body elects we make

2552
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:04,200
the meeting

2553
02:30:04,200 --> 02:30:08,040
we are going see we are still halfway
down.

2554
02:30:08,040 --> 02:30:13,040
We are going Yeah, we can do everything
with anything on this planet.

2555
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:16,400
We just have to have some patience.

2556
02:30:16,400 --> 02:30:18,800
So. So we'll go this

2557
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:22,560
is everyone doing this with me

2558
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:29,520
based? Yes.

2559
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:32,200
Okay.

2560
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:34,400
Now the next thing is.

2561
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:37,520
The next thing is we have to write,

2562
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:39,360
we have to break,

2563
02:30:40,040 --> 02:30:46,520
create, employ, create employee.

2564
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:49,080
Do we leave their name default?

2565
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:52,800
You should leave their name
default, create employee.

2566
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:57,920
So here, come and take this create
employee part, this part

2567
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:00,240
create employee.

2568
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:03,080
And then update this particular behavior

2569
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:04,200
created

2570
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:09,960
right

2571
02:31:11,440 --> 02:31:13,880
after this. For

2572
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:15,120
date one employee.

2573
02:31:15,120 --> 02:31:17,200
So just type it again.

2574
02:31:17,200 --> 02:31:20,400
One employee go here

2575
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:24,120
take this particular part of

2576
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,680
one employee

2577
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:34,560
and then based this value here,

2578
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:37,280
select the checkbox.

2579
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:41,880
So paused whether it is create admin,
but it is to name it create user.

2580
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:44,760
Yes. Correct.

2581
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:45,520
Correct.

2582
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:49,800
If you want you can give
this name is create entering user.

2583
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:53,000
That is also it's a you know,
is it more simple?

2584
02:31:53,320 --> 02:31:55,400
No, it's fine create a user.

2585
02:31:55,400 --> 02:31:57,120
Is this okay now

2586
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:04,040
if you a man would be use clipboard.

2587
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:04,560
Yeah.

2588
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:08,440
Here also I can use clipboard
but right now because of I have to give,

2589
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:11,640
you know, really low level information
everything will spread index

2590
02:32:11,640 --> 02:32:13,640
by typing this.

2591
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:14,960
Otherwise

2592
02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:18,120
otherwise,

2593
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:20,760
you know, I can also take this data
from here in this state.

2594
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:23,200
So to help everyone, I'm doing this.

2595
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:28,240
Did all employees
go take this particular data

2596
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:31,000
to get all the employees

2597
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:33,520
and I'm going to put it here.

2598
02:32:33,520 --> 02:32:35,040
Did all employees

2599
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:47,880
fine and get employee status right.

2600
02:32:48,240 --> 02:32:51,560
So here you see did
all employees employee status?

2601
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:53,160
I think this one.

2602
02:32:53,480 --> 02:32:57,120
So Dick
the get employee status from the one

2603
02:32:58,400 --> 02:33:01,800
and I'm going to put it here

2604
02:33:02,680 --> 02:33:05,240
then update employee information raised.

2605
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:07,920
I'm going to be a big employee.

2606
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:12,560
There is update employee is which one.

2607
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:13,280

Jimmy says it works.

2628
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:33,840
He looks in a different mood today.

2629
02:34:33,840 --> 02:35:17,120
That happens,

2630
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:27,920

02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:37,000
I'm just giving time for everyone. Right?

2634
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:38,440
So it would be

2635
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:42,360
all right.

2636
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:45,800
So I'm giving time so

2638
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:02,640
that great.

2639
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:05,760
So now, now at this point of time,

2640
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:10,120
we have added all the global behemoths
right?

2641
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:15,320
Replace all the global Beliebers
now just to save them first.

2642
02:36:15,480 --> 02:36:18,320
So click on this save option.

2643
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:20,400
Click on this option post Fixing

2644
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,560
saved everyone.

2645
02:36:25,640 --> 02:36:28,640
Now, when you click on this icon,
this time

2646
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:32,560
it will give you all these people
see all the global variables

2647
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:34,680
and you can you see

2648
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:39,600
these global variables
are having all the endpoints.

2649
02:36:40,720 --> 02:36:42,960
All the endpoints, right?

2650
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:46,320
And here you are
having this particular environment.

2651
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:49,400
If you want to add multiple environments,
you can add

2652
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:52,560
multiple environments, no issue and go

2653
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:53,280
right?

2654
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:56,000
No, no, that's their split.

2655
02:36:56,040 --> 02:36:57,840
I'll come to that point.

2656
02:36:57,840 --> 02:36:59,520
I'm going to explain all.

2657
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:02,520
Is it 100 days?

2658
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:03,600
So far, so good.

2659
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:09,200
Everyone.

2660
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:09,800
Great.

2661
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:11,240
Great.

2662
02:37:11,240 --> 02:37:12,640
Let's take a break, guys.

2663
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:14,040
Let's take a break for 10 minutes.

2664
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:17,040
Maybe. And I'm

2665
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:20,360
are our joint account

2666
02:37:20,600 --> 02:37:22,800
things that maybe you could only hear

2667
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:28,640
what is going on in the world.

2668
02:37:28,640 --> 02:37:31,840
All right.

2669
02:37:31,840 --> 02:37:35,000
So so far, so far what we did here see

2670
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:39,360
in this base, you are right.

2671
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:40,200
Right.

2672
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:44,640
We provided our environment
like this slash, whatever the is

2673
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:48,600
we have, we provided like this.

2674
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:50,120
This is exactly what we did, guys.

2675
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:53,040
Correct?

2676
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:53,800
Correct.

2677
02:37:54,120 --> 02:37:58,440
So now now what we did,
this particular part

2678
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:04,240
also we provided in global variables,
including slash, including slash.

2679
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:08,440
You'll see here if I go in my post
and if I click here

2680
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,560
this value in blue slash also

2681
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:14,640
and you see

2682
02:38:15,440 --> 02:38:17,520
these values include slash answer.

2683
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:20,520
So Dennis, coming back to your point

2684
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:24,880
right, you were writing this part
with Slash in between guys.

2685
02:38:24,880 --> 02:38:28,840
Then we knew we needed to slash
and when we

2686
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:32,160
we don't need, we don't need.

2687
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:35,640
So now what we will to simply see this

2688
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:38,640
and then this is the variable.

2689
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:40,920
Whatever the variable
we are passing the end point.

2690
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:42,360
That's it.

2691
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:45,720
So now, now update this particular part.

2692
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:47,040
You're not opposed to it.

2693
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:49,200
How first

2694
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:52,400
big this value for created

2695
02:38:52,400 --> 02:38:58,880
a mini user.

2696
02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:04,240
Create a main user, go here
and instead of writing this particular

2697
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:12,760
mark, create

2698
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:15,840
a mini user.

2699
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:17,880
Find create admin user

2700
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:25,720
mind worked without any input, yet

2701
02:39:25,880 --> 02:39:28,320
it wins because see this is just a
you are a great.

2702
02:39:28,320 --> 02:39:32,720
So when you provide this video when it
considers everything without double.

2703
02:39:32,720 --> 02:39:32,880
Yeah.

2704
02:39:32,880 --> 02:39:36,200
But it should provide because this is
the variable that we need to provide.

2705
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:37,160
Fine.

2706
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:40,680
Now what is the shortcut for curly braces?

2707
02:39:41,760 --> 02:39:42,720
Shortcut.

2708
02:39:42,720 --> 02:39:44,200
Curly braces.

2709
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:47,360
Then you

2710
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:04,600
now see

2711
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:09,120
it is giving redirect token rate
so I can call the generate token.

2712
02:40:09,440 --> 02:40:12,200
And here also it gives me

2713
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:14,920
you would miss
you are it so this you are a value

2714
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:17,560
Let me take you want correct

2715
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:23,240
shortcut for card levers is a shortcut
I don't get

2716
02:40:23,240 --> 02:40:26,160
I didn't get the question on
would it simply shifted

2717
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,480
Take that and

2718
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:33,800
shift and break it that's
that's the way to create the levers.

2719
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:38,240
I mean shortcut for you just based it on

2720
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:45,000
I pasted the value not the Charybdis.

2721
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,640
Yeah I didn't.

2722
02:40:46,640 --> 02:40:48,920
I didn't. That's what I'm saying.

2723
02:40:48,920 --> 02:40:51,240
So force to save it

2724
02:40:51,360 --> 02:40:53,800
then save this part.

2725
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:58,200
And now here, here
after creating the employee

2726
02:40:58,240 --> 02:41:02,640
right here also first provide this

2727
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:06,280
sees create employee.

2728
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:08,560
Take this data and save it

2729
02:41:09,840 --> 02:41:11,680
create employee

2730
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:14,600
now similar similarly here

2731
02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:17,880
get one employee part so go here

2732
02:41:17,880 --> 02:41:20,040
and then ready to get

2733
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:22,080
good employee.

2734
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:24,120
Get one employee.

2735
02:41:24,680 --> 02:41:26,880
See? Thanks.

2736
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:29,320
I think you're trying

2737
02:41:30,360 --> 02:41:33,240
and after this going to get all employees.

2738
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:35,280
So just update this thing, guys.

2739
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:40,680
See how I'm operating the perimeter,
get all just type what you're looking for

2740
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:43,480
and it will give you
if your values are correct,

2741
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:46,280
if your values are going to.

2742
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:46,920
Right.

2743
02:41:47,360 --> 02:41:51,200
So here again, get employee status.

2744
02:41:52,400 --> 02:41:54,000
Then here

2745
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:58,120
I'm going to get the job status

2746
02:41:59,160 --> 02:42:01,320
after job status

2747
02:42:01,320 --> 02:42:04,640
here, I'm going to provide
for update employee, right.

2748
02:42:04,640 --> 02:42:09,720
So be right here.

2749
02:42:09,720 --> 02:42:11,800
Update employee

2750
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:14,520
This one is for see

2751
02:42:18,520 --> 02:42:19,480
partially updated.

2752
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:20,760
Employee

2753
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:23,400
This one is for

2754
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:32,920
delete or

2755
02:42:51,200 --> 02:42:54,400
now let's try to run this.

2756
02:42:54,400 --> 02:42:56,880
Please provide Employee 80

2757
02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:59,960
So since I have provided this data,
tell me guys why

2758
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:03,280
it is not working.

2759
02:43:03,280 --> 02:43:08,280
Why it is not working
is because because when I predicted

2760
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:13,080
this barred their data here
their data from here is gone.

2761
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:13,560
Right?

2762
02:43:13,560 --> 02:43:17,600
That is no query barometer which I am
passing from my global variable.

2763
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:22,640
So to parse the query parameter here,
I have to write what I have to radiate

2764
02:43:24,760 --> 02:43:25,640
underscore.

2765
02:43:25,640 --> 02:43:28,440
I think this is the value correct.

2766
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:31,320
And here I can provide
the value of a created employee.

2767
02:43:31,840 --> 02:43:34,400
So let's take this value

2768
02:43:34,400 --> 02:43:38,040
and we will provide it here.

2769
02:43:38,040 --> 02:43:38,680
Fine.

2770
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:41,760
See? Now, see

2771
02:43:44,320 --> 02:44:00,240
what happened?

2772
02:44:00,240 --> 02:44:01,760
I deleted that employee.

2773
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:03,000
I didn't need

2774
02:44:04,840 --> 02:44:05,280
working.

2775
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:05,880
Fine.

2776
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:11,800
It means my you ordered in my one
employee quotes that I'm working fine on.

2777
02:44:11,800 --> 02:44:13,240
Okay. See

2778
02:44:15,960 --> 02:44:17,160
guys, are they working

2779
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:24,800
fine or not?

2780
02:44:24,800 --> 02:44:28,560
Everything looks good.

2781
02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:31,800
We get all employees
you can even cross-check while

2782
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:34,800
sending the request to see working fine.

2783
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:37,600
Did job creators update the employee

2784
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:40,680
so for that
you have to update this employee.

2785
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:43,320
We just update the employee from here on

2786
02:44:56,280 --> 02:44:59,520
point saving

2787
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:01,760
this belongs so see

2788
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:05,040
now guys is

2789
02:45:05,040 --> 02:45:08,160
still one thing is pending what is that

2790
02:45:12,160 --> 02:45:13,560
there is one thing is pending

2791
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:21,480
what is there any barometers?

2792
02:45:22,080 --> 02:45:24,320
I don't think so. Parameters
that we need to see.

2793
02:45:24,360 --> 02:45:26,400
We already provided the parameters of this
to you.

2794
02:45:27,360 --> 02:45:28,360
Token.

2795
02:45:28,680 --> 02:45:29,920
Token we have generated.

2796
02:45:29,920 --> 02:45:31,800
It is valid for 12 hours. Right.

2797
02:45:31,800 --> 02:45:35,800
So we don't need to generate the token
delete employee parametres.

2798
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:39,320
Well we delete employee

2799
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:41,720
barometer is something

2800
02:45:42,360 --> 02:45:45,200
less how to give or

2801
02:45:45,360 --> 02:45:47,280
delete employee parameter query better.

2802
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:48,000
We have these.

2803
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,880
These are the things we can sort it out
at any point of time.

2804
02:45:50,880 --> 02:45:52,880
So this is not a big deal.

2805
02:45:53,440 --> 02:45:55,560
One thing to remember,

2806
02:45:55,800 --> 02:45:59,080
we wrote one user story

2807
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:03,040
we wrote, but you have

2808
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:05,640
you will need to update 1000
tokens, right?

2809
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:07,400
We don't

2810
02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:09,760
believe me.

2811
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:12,000
We don't need any help.

2812
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:19,000
We So now, now,

2813
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:24,480
now the next thing, what we have to do
is the next thing, what we have do is here

2814
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:29,240
we will simply verify
and validate the feeds.

2815
02:46:30,240 --> 02:46:31,800
Whatever the response we are

2816
02:46:31,800 --> 02:46:35,720
getting, we have to verify and validated
and how we can do it.

2817
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:40,560
So if you see if you see here,
there is an option GOI test

2818
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:46,800
available, can you see the best option
available here?

2819
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:51,840
Everyone.

2820
02:46:51,840 --> 02:46:55,640
So here
Faustman says if you want to write test

2821
02:46:55,840 --> 02:46:58,960
for verification and validation,
write your test.

2822
02:46:58,960 --> 02:47:01,960
Even in manual testing also.

2823
02:47:01,960 --> 02:47:04,880
So the way we write code
in automation is doing

2824
02:47:05,080 --> 02:47:08,040
Postman allows us to write code.

2825
02:47:08,040 --> 02:47:10,080
Anyone in manual, as Gwen

2826
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:15,120
understood this,

2827
02:47:15,120 --> 02:47:18,760
understood this, remember,

2828
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:20,920
remember

2829
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:25,080
when we talk about test in Postman

2830
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:31,080
So here, here in this post,
when we have to write a script in,

2831
02:47:31,240 --> 02:47:34,240
we have to write a script
in JavaScript language

2832
02:47:36,360 --> 02:47:38,800
now which programing language
we are going to use based

2833
02:47:43,560 --> 02:47:46,400
JavaScript.

2834
02:47:46,400 --> 02:47:58,280
How many of you
guys know how to read the JavaScript code?

2835
02:47:58,280 --> 02:48:00,960
No idea. None. Not me, not me.

2836
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:05,360
Regularly, no issues,
although I know it is called

2837
02:48:06,600 --> 02:48:11,280
Google Need and copy paste.

2838
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:14,880
I know when I am, but systems don't

2839
02:48:16,120 --> 02:48:18,600
google mumble. Right?

2840
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:20,600
And unless someone

2841
02:48:20,760 --> 02:48:21,480
fluent.

2842
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:23,040
So now.

2843
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:26,280
Now here in JavaScript,

2844
02:48:26,280 --> 02:48:29,520
let me tell you what your postman

2845
02:48:30,720 --> 02:48:32,040
postman says.

2846
02:48:32,040 --> 02:48:35,520
You have to write your
the script in JavaScript language,

2847
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:37,840
but even if you don't know

2848
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:41,360
JavaScript, don't ready
just to let me know what you need.

2849
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:44,920
I'll give you I'll give you a reading

2850
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:46,200
the code

2851
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:51,160
Faustman says I will give you an email.

2852
02:48:51,200 --> 02:48:51,840
Good.

2853
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:57,320
So just know that it are one
no going to give that name right?

2854
02:48:57,320 --> 02:49:00,840
So now here in this post,
the best quote is

2855
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:03,640
you just you should know what you want.

2856
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:06,040
Postman gives you everything

2857
02:49:07,160 --> 02:49:09,200
you can verify, validate your fields.

2858
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:10,960
You can be the status school.

2859
02:49:10,960 --> 02:49:14,120
You can write your district
even for writing the test.

2860
02:49:14,120 --> 02:49:16,440
You don't need to write the programing
languages script.

2861
02:49:16,440 --> 02:49:19,520
Just call
and it will give you already prepared food

2862
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:22,920
for the school district.

2863
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:23,720
Everyone.

2864
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:26,240
This part JavaScript, the language

2865
02:49:26,360 --> 02:49:29,160
which we use to write the test script

2866
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:32,480
in order to it is JavaScript.

2867
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:34,920
42nd thing

2868
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:38,280
what ever whatever we do, whatever we do,

2869
02:49:38,440 --> 02:49:42,600
they will use an object called e m

2870
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:47,080
What is the name of the object

2871
02:49:52,480 --> 02:49:54,480
been in the screens for

2872
02:50:00,520 --> 02:50:03,520
almost 20?

2873
02:50:03,520 --> 02:50:04,840
Horstman

2874
02:50:05,560 --> 02:50:09,240
Lane Horstman Can you see

2875
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:13,680
So now,

2876
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:17,240
now here let me show you one thing, right?

2877
02:50:17,560 --> 02:50:19,440
Let me show you one thing.

2878
02:50:19,440 --> 02:50:23,040
Go here and I am going to write

2879
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:34,920
one thing here.

2880
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:35,920
Try library,

2881
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:42,160
try library and you see.

2882
02:50:42,160 --> 02:50:47,480
Nicole Long Right, So you'll see here
this is the part.

2883
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:53,640
Try library, try a solution library,
main post main use,

2884
02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:56,520
Try a solution labeled form

2885
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:58,920
verification and validation points

2886
02:51:00,120 --> 02:51:03,000
right the way we use unit assertions.

2887
02:51:04,080 --> 02:51:06,160
We use test in assertions.

2888
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:09,160
Similarly, here
we will use GI as solution.

2889
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:12,280
Now ask me what is the meaning of chain?

2890
02:51:12,280 --> 02:51:14,360
Everyone knows it right?

2891
02:51:14,360 --> 02:51:15,840
This is GI

2892
02:51:21,240 --> 02:51:23,400
E Exactly.

2893
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:27,080
This is the assertion based

2894
02:51:30,720 --> 02:51:31,520
community,

2895
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:34,040
not this chain celebrity.

2896
02:51:34,040 --> 02:51:35,400
This check

2897
02:51:36,320 --> 02:51:39,560
object.

2898
02:51:39,560 --> 02:51:43,560
But so this GI library GI,
a such a library

2899
02:51:43,640 --> 02:51:45,960
was to be used in this book

2900
02:51:47,440 --> 02:51:49,880
and called it everyone

2901
02:51:54,520 --> 02:51:55,200
writing.

2902
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:58,560
Whenever you get time,
you see all these things,

2903
02:51:59,160 --> 02:52:03,520
you will find everything
in this library partly by default.

2904
02:52:03,520 --> 02:52:05,680
It is available in post.

2905
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:08,520
We now what this library does.

2906
02:52:09,160 --> 02:52:13,920
So we will use this beam object
to perform all the assertions.

2907
02:52:14,280 --> 02:52:15,520
What kind of assertions?

2908
02:52:16,800 --> 02:52:17,520
Whether my

2909
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:20,640
status code is what I'm expecting or not

2910
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:24,080
is correct or not.

2911
02:52:24,360 --> 02:52:26,520
Whether my state, a school
district or not,

2912
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:30,040
even if my status code is correct

2913
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:33,680
in my body, I'm getting a bright idea.

2914
02:52:33,720 --> 02:52:38,160
Mark Let's say employee
what I am getting first name or not,

2915
02:52:38,680 --> 02:52:40,760
but I'm getting middle or not

2916
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:44,160
or I am getting last name or not.

2917
02:52:44,160 --> 02:52:45,240
Okay, fine.

2918
02:52:45,240 --> 02:52:46,520
I'm getting middle name now.

2919
02:52:46,520 --> 02:52:48,200
Stimulating. Funny.

2920
02:52:48,200 --> 02:52:49,560
Is it like plugging it?

2921
02:52:49,560 --> 02:52:52,400
It is like plug in,
but it is already everybody close to me.

2922
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:53,320
Fine.

2923
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:55,480
I'm getting employed
if we need a false name.

2924
02:52:55,480 --> 02:52:59,720
William Last name is mine
for we go to this particular.

2925
02:52:59,720 --> 02:53:03,000
Value or not,
we will limit once to this value or not.

2926
02:53:03,360 --> 02:53:06,240
Last name is equal to this bendy one,

2927
02:53:06,240 --> 02:53:08,480
isn't it a video demonstration?

2928
02:53:08,760 --> 02:53:13,080
If we are performing Now tell me guys,
this is what we do or not any

2929
02:53:16,040 --> 02:53:16,320
guys.

2930
02:53:16,320 --> 02:53:19,800
This is what we call assertions
verification and validation check points.

2931
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:30,640
The same thing with performing Selenium,
also known.

2932
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:32,120
I hope everyone is getting my point.

2933
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:34,440
What I'm trying to explain here

2934
02:53:43,560 --> 02:53:45,960
and excluding the industry, fine.

2935
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:50,880
Let me explain it again.

2936
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:52,640
Let me explain it again.

2937
02:53:52,640 --> 02:53:55,680
Using this child duty child child library.

2938
02:53:55,680 --> 02:54:00,720
I'm seeing this is my state school,
but I'm not verifying that.

2939
02:54:00,720 --> 02:54:01,600
I know

2940
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:04,400
right now I'm not.

2941
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:07,760
So using that child name, I will verify

2942
02:54:07,960 --> 02:54:10,680
that this is the school is 200 or not.

2943
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:14,760
Also, we can verify in the body

2944
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:17,080
we are getting employed or not.

2945
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:19,080
We are getting employed.

2946
02:54:19,080 --> 02:54:21,760
Middle name or not,
we are getting employed.

2947
02:54:21,760 --> 02:54:25,920
Last name or not, we are getting employed
but simply a solution.

2948
02:54:25,920 --> 02:54:29,040
Alex How we do a solution assert,

2949
02:54:29,320 --> 02:54:32,400
assert equals assert
or assert to like this.

2950
02:54:33,160 --> 02:54:35,800
Okay,
this is simply assertions. We are done

2951
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:39,280
right.

2952
02:54:39,440 --> 02:54:43,200
So now this is
the first layer of assertion that we get

2953
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:44,240
a status code is correct.

2954
02:54:44,240 --> 02:54:49,760
On the second layer of assertion,
I expect in these keys in the body

2955
02:54:50,120 --> 02:54:52,960
hardly or position, I'm expecting

2956
02:54:53,080 --> 02:54:56,280
the values of these keys in the body.

2957
02:54:56,640 --> 02:55:00,360
So for example, last name is visible sign,
last name is visible

2958
02:55:00,720 --> 02:55:04,320
are the last name
value is the last name value and done?

2959
02:55:04,640 --> 02:55:06,120
Yes. The meter then correct.

2960
02:55:06,120 --> 02:55:08,880
Otherwise not correct. No. Understood.

2961
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:10,040
What I'm see

2962
02:55:21,600 --> 02:55:23,040
silver now understood

2963
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:32,240
what I'm trying to explain.

2964
02:55:32,240 --> 02:55:34,720
Now see now We'll see how easy it is.

2965
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:38,520
First date one employee.

2966
02:55:39,080 --> 02:55:41,840
I have made this request.

2967
02:55:41,840 --> 02:55:43,960
I want to write a test.

2968
02:55:43,960 --> 02:55:46,040
So first I have to write that.

2969
02:55:46,040 --> 02:55:49,520
Okay, I will verify
my status code is 200 or more.

2970
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:50,640
Right?

2971
02:55:50,640 --> 02:55:54,600
So tell me for getting one employee
what is the successful API status code?

2972
02:55:55,680 --> 02:55:56,560
When I consider

2973
02:55:56,560 --> 02:55:59,720
data API, explain what it is,
what should be the status?

2974
02:55:59,720 --> 02:56:02,160
Good. It is 200. Correct.

2975
02:56:02,280 --> 02:56:03,680
It should be 200.

2976
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:05,040
So no, no.

2977
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:06,880
Let's write

2978
02:56:07,360 --> 02:56:11,160
and let's write our first test
for this particular part

2979
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:14,560
our first test for this particular part.

2980
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,880
So like I said,
we will use JavaScript language

2981
02:56:17,880 --> 02:56:21,360
using beam object using beam object.

2982
02:56:21,360 --> 02:56:25,760
So how I can write can you see
what is snippet option available here?

2983
02:56:26,320 --> 02:56:31,760
This one is snippet
option available in this case.

2984
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:35,640
Go in this snippet
option and select from here.

2985
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:40,040
Select is status code is 200.

2986
02:56:40,080 --> 02:56:40,800
Can you.

2987
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:43,120
It says a status code code is 200

2988
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:45,360
and you see it

2989
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:48,000
click on this.

2990
02:56:48,360 --> 02:56:50,520
Simply click on this.

2991
02:56:50,520 --> 02:56:54,800
And the moment you click on it to see it
gives you already written test

2992
02:56:56,040 --> 02:56:56,280
in. You

2993
02:56:56,280 --> 02:57:07,400
see here, simply click on it

2994
02:57:07,400 --> 02:57:11,880
and it gives you this particular
status code automations available.

2995
02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:15,360
You read this is the test is script,
this is the test

2996
02:57:15,400 --> 02:57:18,200
descriptive
only everything was So is it like this

2997
02:57:18,680 --> 02:57:22,760
now see, now see,
I told you this beam is the object.

2998
02:57:23,640 --> 02:57:25,560
This the test.

2999
02:57:25,560 --> 02:57:27,240
So this is destiny.

3000
02:57:27,240 --> 02:57:30,120
You can change this name
according to your case.

3001
02:57:30,120 --> 02:57:30,800
For example.

3002
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:34,360
Point and see really fine.

3003
02:57:34,360 --> 02:57:37,080
When you find that the

3004
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:41,880
is data scored,
it is similar to your scenario name.

3005
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:45,360
You're providing the names of verify

3006
02:57:45,360 --> 02:57:48,360
this data score is so it says beam

3007
02:57:48,360 --> 02:57:51,480
door responds dot to have a status 200

3008
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:53,880
is this written in JavaScript?

3009
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:58,080
Yes this is JavaScript language
so function simply means method.

3010
02:57:58,640 --> 02:58:02,120
This is the name of your method
and this is the code

3011
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:06,720
which will find your history
discord, whether it is broken or not.

3012
02:58:07,800 --> 02:58:13,440
And that's good.

3013
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:14,720
Is this underscore to be one?

3014
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:15,080
Whatever.

3015
02:58:15,080 --> 02:58:23,680
See, let's let's run this time.

3016
02:58:24,520 --> 02:58:27,680
Let's run this time for specific

3017
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:30,120
and then then send

3018
02:58:36,200 --> 02:58:37,080
right

3019
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:42,280
in does not exist.

3020
02:58:42,280 --> 02:58:46,000
Who deleted this employee?

3021
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:51,680
Come on.

3022
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:53,280
Wait, wait.

3023
02:58:53,280 --> 02:58:55,440
I believe that you would

3024
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:05,640
no see guys here.

3025
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:06,760
No. See,

3026
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:09,440
someone is always messing with 80.

3027
02:59:09,440 --> 02:59:11,080
You work on connect.

3028
02:59:11,080 --> 02:59:13,320
So now you see Lubo.

3029
02:59:14,200 --> 02:59:17,880
Sorry no one see this are going to it's

3030
02:59:18,640 --> 02:59:22,560
going to snippet and there is an option
called a status code.

3031
02:59:22,840 --> 02:59:25,160
Colon code is 200 and you see

3032
02:59:26,440 --> 02:59:28,040
colon code is 200.

3033
02:59:28,040 --> 02:59:30,720
So just select this one, click
on this particular one

3034
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:33,920
and then you get this data in this part,

3035
02:59:34,080 --> 02:59:36,240
you can change the name of the method.

3036
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:39,680
This is the name of the function
you can change, right?

3037
02:59:39,960 --> 02:59:43,560
And once you change
the name of the function, this is the code

3038
02:59:43,560 --> 02:59:48,120
that will identify and verify
that this data is doing this.

3039
02:59:48,480 --> 02:59:52,400
And then see,
we don't forget to see after received.

3040
02:59:52,600 --> 02:59:55,240
When you click send,
you will get this resolved.

3041
02:59:55,480 --> 02:59:57,080
So now here you see when the

3042
02:59:58,120 --> 02:59:59,560
multi cookies

3043
02:59:59,560 --> 03:00:03,760
headers and Easter results
and you see dates distributions give

3044
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:06,000
everyone.

3045
03:00:07,240 --> 03:00:09,320
Now click on this just results

3046
03:00:10,440 --> 03:00:12,440
click on this distributions.

3047
03:00:12,440 --> 03:00:17,760
What is this it says verifying
that their status code is you'll see

3048
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:22,200
code is you write 200
and then simply send it again.

3049
03:00:22,800 --> 03:00:25,640
Now states is verifying
that the status code is 200.

3050
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:30,240
So now you are providing verification
validation check points.

3051
03:00:30,240 --> 03:00:32,960
Let's see, I'm going to change it
intentionally.

3052
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:35,240
I'm going to make it feed.

3053
03:00:35,240 --> 03:00:38,400
I'm writing here to zero one

3054
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:40,160
Sigma is what I'm doing.

3055
03:00:40,160 --> 03:00:43,560
I'm going to make it feel
I'm writing to zero one here.

3056
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:48,040
Can you see every 1 to 0
one simply sending

3057
03:00:50,200 --> 03:00:53,680
those is verifying that the status code
is 200.

3058
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:59,160
Assertion
and expected response is 201. 200

3059
03:01:00,520 --> 03:01:00,960
is empty.

3060
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:04,120
Today's the same kind of assertion
we provide expected

3061
03:01:04,120 --> 03:01:08,080
an actual value right?

3062
03:01:08,080 --> 03:01:08,440
Right.

3063
03:01:08,440 --> 03:01:12,360
So now when you provide
this is the correct 100

3064
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:16,920
and then when you run
it will radically verify

3065
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:19,320
that the strictest code is 200.

3066
03:01:20,160 --> 03:01:24,120
Correct?

3067
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:32,760
Correct. Wow.

3068
03:01:32,760 --> 03:01:35,800
No. Now, see now see here.

3069
03:01:36,600 --> 03:01:42,160
If I want to verify something, something
here, what I have to do, zero one.

3070
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:45,040
So fine. Let's go into that test.

3071
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:48,000
It's going to test and select here.

3072
03:01:48,160 --> 03:01:50,320
Select.
The first thing it is is data scored.

3073
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:53,320
It is two. So is this correct?

3074
03:01:53,400 --> 03:01:58,760
Then I'm going to check 200,
but I have to change.

3075
03:01:58,760 --> 03:02:00,240
This should be

3076
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:04,680
this should be 201201.

3077
03:02:05,120 --> 03:02:09,920
And then
and then simply simply let me change

3078
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:13,320
this particular part in the body
when I'm going to change it.

3079
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:14,400
Good. Three, one, two, three,

3080
03:02:15,480 --> 03:02:16,720
seven.

3081
03:02:16,720 --> 03:02:18,120
Send it.

3082
03:02:18,920 --> 03:02:21,280
So now you'll see this

3083
03:02:21,280 --> 03:02:25,200
resources is strictness
code is 201 and the statuses

3084
03:02:25,200 --> 03:02:28,120
boss can you see

3085
03:02:29,400 --> 03:02:31,080
and you see this guys

3086
03:02:35,760 --> 03:02:37,160
I hope everyone is understanding

3087
03:02:37,160 --> 03:02:39,480
what I'm trying to do here

3088
03:02:41,640 --> 03:02:44,840
now now let's go up

3089
03:02:44,840 --> 03:02:50,000
state made here to school
and step four to the mix.

3090
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,920
The next thing which we are going to do,

3091
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:55,920
what is that thing that see,

3092
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:59,200
when I'm using this particular part
to generate the

3093
03:03:00,240 --> 03:03:02,800
I'm getting 200 fine.

3094
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:06,560
I'm getting this 200 totally fine.

3095
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:07,200
Perfect.

3096
03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:13,080
But I can't rely on the state discord.

3097
03:03:13,080 --> 03:03:16,080
Remember?

3098
03:03:16,080 --> 03:03:17,400
Remember this case?

3099
03:03:17,400 --> 03:03:21,040
I can't rely only on status code
because sometimes

3100
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:24,720
we have seen in the API
that even if my status code is

3101
03:03:24,960 --> 03:03:32,040
if that is a problem with the body,
there is a problem with the body.

3102
03:03:32,280 --> 03:03:34,720
Right? So here we have trust issues.

3103
03:03:34,880 --> 03:03:37,760
So what we are going to verify I'm seeing

3104
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:40,880
fine fine, let me write test.

3105
03:03:41,320 --> 03:03:45,160
So in their test first I'm grading here
and okay,

3106
03:03:45,480 --> 03:03:48,920
you are returning my 200 point
return with 200.

3107
03:03:48,920 --> 03:03:54,960
I don't have any issue, but
but here I want that in my response.

3108
03:03:54,960 --> 03:03:58,040
Body 200 is the first condition.

3109
03:03:58,040 --> 03:04:00,920
Second condition in my response body.

3110
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:01,800
I need to

3111
03:04:04,400 --> 03:04:04,960
I have to

3112
03:04:04,960 --> 03:04:07,480
check whether you are generating the token
or not.

3113
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:09,120
Right.

3114
03:04:09,360 --> 03:04:12,720
So here
there is another method in this nipple.

3115
03:04:12,720 --> 03:04:18,080
It's called response
Body response Body can banes stream.

3116
03:04:18,080 --> 03:04:24,000
Can you see the is
this part contains a string, click on it.

3117
03:04:25,960 --> 03:04:26,840
Click on it. Right.

3118
03:04:26,840 --> 03:04:30,960
And he and it says is trying you want to
search so what I want to search

3119
03:04:33,160 --> 03:04:36,840
by is what I want to search.

3120
03:04:36,840 --> 03:04:39,160
I want to search token simple

3121
03:04:40,560 --> 03:04:43,560
I want to search token prime see would

3122
03:04:44,640 --> 03:04:46,920
now see posted check is there

3123
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:50,040
discord is 200 is there discord is 214.

3124
03:04:50,280 --> 03:04:54,600
Second, it will check after
getting that body in the response body

3125
03:04:54,760 --> 03:04:57,640
whether this particular value token
is available

3126
03:04:57,640 --> 03:05:01,240
or not sent.

3127
03:05:01,240 --> 03:05:06,640
Now see it says body matches is
green is status code is daunting.

3128
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:10,240
Let me intentionally change it.

3129
03:05:10,240 --> 03:05:14,880
I'm token one now see running

3130
03:05:15,360 --> 03:05:17,800
it says is there discord is 214

3131
03:05:18,040 --> 03:05:23,880
but Baltimore just expected
is this one but you got token one trade so

3132
03:05:23,880 --> 03:05:30,760
see it is working absolutely fine
cutting, cutting, sending it will jump.

3133
03:05:30,760 --> 03:05:33,400
And then you see what is the most

3134
03:05:43,160 --> 03:05:46,920
you guys getting my point.

3135
03:05:46,920 --> 03:05:51,520
You obviously this is just inserting
because here this token comes May

3136
03:05:51,520 --> 03:05:54,640
this is the value, the same value
we have to pass here.

3137
03:05:54,640 --> 03:05:55,680
This is the key.

3138
03:05:55,680 --> 03:05:58,120
So guys should always be the stream.

3139
03:05:58,560 --> 03:06:02,560
All right, guys.

3140
03:06:02,560 --> 03:06:07,560
All right.

3141
03:06:07,560 --> 03:06:10,920
So now here in the node, I have to write

3142
03:06:13,280 --> 03:06:16,120
in those daemon

3143
03:06:16,120 --> 03:06:19,000
the use

3144
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,440
be object.

3145
03:06:21,560 --> 03:06:22,600
Write

3146
03:06:23,320 --> 03:06:26,120
this in

3147
03:06:26,120 --> 03:06:30,120
the JavaScript language here

3148
03:06:31,960 --> 03:06:34,120
cause when you

3149
03:06:35,240 --> 03:06:39,360
try library for assertions.

3150
03:06:39,840 --> 03:06:40,720
Right.

3151
03:06:40,720 --> 03:06:46,080
So remember always goes to mine
comes with comes with

3152
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:49,600
the in java script. They'd be

3153
03:06:51,120 --> 03:06:51,800
great guys

3154
03:06:51,800 --> 03:06:54,600
we all can
see it comes with built in JavaScript TBA

3155
03:06:55,200 --> 03:06:58,160
and after this here beam is the object

3156
03:06:59,840 --> 03:07:01,160
what is happening

3157
03:07:03,320 --> 03:07:05,960
Beam is the object.

3158
03:07:05,960 --> 03:07:06,760
Of course.

3159
03:07:06,760 --> 03:07:13,360
Postman Beam is the object of postman
that allows us, that allows to use,

3160
03:07:13,360 --> 03:07:16,680
that allows us to use different methods,

3161
03:07:17,080 --> 03:07:19,080
different methods available

3162
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:23,560
available in API.

3163
03:07:23,560 --> 03:07:24,720
Right guys.

3164
03:07:25,040 --> 03:07:27,240
So now what are these different methods?

3165
03:07:27,680 --> 03:07:30,600
Beam dart, extreme

3166
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:33,120
beam dart Global.

3167
03:07:33,120 --> 03:07:36,640
You see here, if I go in my postman
and you see this 2 p.m.

3168
03:07:36,640 --> 03:07:38,400
not expect

3169
03:07:39,200 --> 03:07:41,800
anything like this beam not response

3170
03:07:43,480 --> 03:07:45,840
rate right,

3171
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:49,680
but expect beam not response

3172
03:07:50,040 --> 03:07:52,840
beam not to have beam or best

3173
03:07:53,200 --> 03:07:56,680
all of those things beam notice
this one Also

3174
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:02,120
these methods is a part of industry
in big JavaScript API.

3175
03:08:03,280 --> 03:08:04,000
Right?

3176
03:08:04,040 --> 03:08:06,760
So here beam dart est

3177
03:08:06,760 --> 03:08:09,720
is the next one and then beam dart

3178
03:08:10,440 --> 03:08:15,120
request is next one.

3179
03:08:15,120 --> 03:08:18,200
Not like this, but I think what you

3180
03:08:24,320 --> 03:08:27,400
write based beam dart expect beam global

3181
03:08:27,640 --> 03:08:31,360
beamed or test beam dart request rate.

3182
03:08:31,680 --> 03:08:33,640
These all are the methods.

3183
03:08:33,640 --> 03:08:36,880
They are some more which we use every now
and then bombard send

3184
03:08:36,880 --> 03:08:40,040
request rate and that is beam

3185
03:08:41,440 --> 03:08:45,520
I believe is that at the vibration data,

3186
03:08:45,560 --> 03:08:48,640
something like that beam directly.

3187
03:08:48,640 --> 03:08:51,280
So these these are the methods we have

3188
03:08:51,280 --> 03:08:54,520
in beam beams supports all these methods.

3189
03:08:54,960 --> 03:08:55,920
All right.

3190
03:08:56,320 --> 03:09:00,880
All right, guys.

3191
03:09:00,880 --> 03:09:03,960
Now here, when we talk about

3192
03:09:03,960 --> 03:09:06,480
when we talk about try a solution library.

3193
03:09:06,480 --> 03:09:11,320
So we need to understand
what is this chai?

3194
03:09:11,320 --> 03:09:13,440
What is this chai Association library?

3195
03:09:13,720 --> 03:09:15,520
This is something we need to understand.

3196
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:17,840
Okay,

3197
03:09:18,160 --> 03:09:22,560
so now when we talk about chai, a solution
library basically will be right next

3198
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:26,240
to provide verification
and validations in the post.

3199
03:09:26,480 --> 03:09:29,360
We have to use chai a solution.

3200
03:09:29,360 --> 03:09:32,360
So by default you can read the same thing

3201
03:09:32,360 --> 03:09:35,520
in the website
also since we are in the class.

3202
03:09:35,680 --> 03:09:38,760
So this is my responsibility
to tell you all of these things.

3203
03:09:38,960 --> 03:09:41,960
So remember, remember

3204
03:09:41,960 --> 03:09:44,560
Chai at a social library, right?

3205
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:46,760
A social library

3206
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:48,680
supports

3207
03:09:49,800 --> 03:09:51,640
it. It is a text.

3208
03:09:51,640 --> 03:09:54,720
The way it has been implemented,
it supports

3209
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:58,200
reducing text only.

3210
03:09:58,200 --> 03:09:58,560
Right?

3211
03:09:58,560 --> 03:10:03,320
So now why we use Brigid's in this case,
the what is the main reason behind

3212
03:10:03,760 --> 03:10:05,160
it is index

3213
03:10:09,800 --> 03:10:11,520
going again

3214
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:20,960
by you

3215
03:10:24,600 --> 03:10:26,200
to reach out is data.

3216
03:10:26,200 --> 03:10:31,640
It is that enable it is easily readable,
easily understandable.

3217
03:10:31,880 --> 03:10:35,560
So your child library read
even though you're not getting this

3218
03:10:35,560 --> 03:10:39,400
as a as the in one word you see.

3219
03:10:39,400 --> 03:10:41,880
It's very simple response to have status.

3220
03:10:41,880 --> 03:10:47,760
So in response we want to have the status
that is 200 we are expecting

3221
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:50,840
in the response of text that it should

3222
03:10:50,840 --> 03:10:53,560
include token, it should include token.

3223
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:55,320
This is what we are doing or not.

3224
03:10:55,320 --> 03:10:55,480
Great.

3225
03:10:55,480 --> 03:11:01,560
Still. Yes.

3226
03:11:01,560 --> 03:11:03,720
Correct. Behavior driven development

3227
03:11:04,920 --> 03:11:06,080
becomes more than known.

3228
03:11:06,080 --> 03:11:09,360
I people can understand right now

3229
03:11:09,560 --> 03:11:12,400
let's add at least one best in every one.

3230
03:11:12,680 --> 03:11:16,440
So if we are creating the employee grade,
what is the status quo?

3231
03:11:16,440 --> 03:11:21,600
Should I click?

3232
03:11:21,600 --> 03:11:22,520
What is the status quo?

3233
03:11:22,520 --> 03:11:30,200
And I should expect to create the employee
201201 or get one employee.

3234
03:11:30,200 --> 03:11:32,800
We have test four create employee.

3235
03:11:32,800 --> 03:11:34,320
We have test

3236
03:11:34,640 --> 03:11:39,440
for getting all the employees
go here and anyone from here.

3237
03:11:39,440 --> 03:11:40,080
Right?

3238
03:11:40,320 --> 03:11:44,520
So let me take the same one for two zero
working fine.

3239
03:11:45,320 --> 03:11:46,760
See would

3240
03:11:47,280 --> 03:11:50,120
get employee status again
going to their test,

3241
03:11:50,840 --> 03:11:54,120
use the same one, see

3242
03:11:54,120 --> 03:11:56,640
all the great methods
having to double zero.

3243
03:11:56,640 --> 03:11:57,560
All right.

3244
03:11:57,560 --> 03:12:00,880
If you want to send any verify
any particular field

3245
03:12:01,200 --> 03:12:04,040
that also you can write,
it is completely your base

3246
03:12:04,520 --> 03:12:06,960
input input also raised

3247
03:12:07,720 --> 03:12:11,280
guys golden badge so wonder 201

3248
03:12:14,760 --> 03:12:17,040
Updating the complete information

3249
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:22,560
of the employee needs.

3250
03:12:22,560 --> 03:12:23,800
Come on guys.

3251
03:12:23,800 --> 03:12:26,680
Updating the complete information.

3252
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:27,000
Right.

3253
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:31,600
So after completing the updating the
complete information, the status is 200.

3254
03:12:31,600 --> 03:12:33,960
Right? So I'm going to see over 200.

3255
03:12:34,400 --> 03:12:36,440
And when we talk about badge, then

3256
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:43,040
for banks, this should be 201.

3257
03:12:43,560 --> 03:12:45,200
Here you can change the values.

3258
03:12:45,200 --> 03:12:48,240
For example, you're updating the position
information, right?

3259
03:12:48,680 --> 03:12:52,000
So when you're updating
the partial information, right.

3260
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:53,240
Do you have to do

3261
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:57,560
but I'm reading the partial information
if I know what is Dick anything.

3262
03:12:57,720 --> 03:12:59,080
Right. Big anything.

3263
03:12:59,080 --> 03:13:00,520
And then according to the things

3264
03:13:00,520 --> 03:13:03,520
which you are taking,
you have to change your expectation

3265
03:13:03,520 --> 03:13:06,480
and you have to change your expectation
values.

3266
03:13:06,640 --> 03:13:11,320
Correct?

3267
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:13,240
Update Partial employee information.

3268
03:13:13,240 --> 03:13:15,360
So this should be your

3269
03:13:15,360 --> 03:13:18,120
it should be Roy underscore it

3270
03:13:19,600 --> 03:13:20,640
saved

3271
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:26,240
doing this for

3272
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:28,600
this information.

3273
03:13:28,600 --> 03:13:30,840
So you're also providing this

3274
03:13:32,520 --> 03:13:34,760
on your question

3275
03:13:34,800 --> 03:13:37,560
what kinds of saved

3276
03:13:40,080 --> 03:13:41,640
job title

3277
03:13:41,640 --> 03:13:44,680
employer status Get one employee Fine.

3278
03:13:45,280 --> 03:13:48,600
So now every single thing is fine, right?

3279
03:13:48,640 --> 03:13:50,240
I'm also

3280
03:13:50,760 --> 03:13:51,080
right.

3281
03:13:51,080 --> 03:13:52,720
I'm also

3282
03:13:54,120 --> 03:13:56,640
delete employee
intentionally updating the token.

3283
03:13:56,640 --> 03:13:58,880
Yes. Yes, we are doing great.
We are doing that.

3284
03:13:59,240 --> 03:14:01,560
So this is the token. We got the new one.

3285
03:14:02,040 --> 03:14:03,040
So let's make it done.

3286
03:14:03,040 --> 03:14:04,280
This token.

3287
03:14:04,280 --> 03:14:05,880
Every everywhere

3288
03:14:39,040 --> 03:14:39,440
names.

3289
03:14:39,440 --> 03:14:42,400
Please don't use my email. Okay.

3290
03:14:42,400 --> 03:14:44,520
My employee

3291
03:14:44,520 --> 03:14:58,960
is don't use this.

3292
03:14:58,960 --> 03:15:01,560
So now,
now everything is completed, right?

3293
03:15:02,200 --> 03:15:04,320
Everything is completed. I have here.

3294
03:15:04,720 --> 03:15:06,920
You see all the test I can see

3295
03:15:07,400 --> 03:15:10,440
based on their test
I can see here and always tell me

3296
03:15:12,320 --> 03:15:14,080
this test symbol is green.

3297
03:15:14,080 --> 03:15:19,800
Every right.

3298
03:15:19,800 --> 03:15:23,360
So now, now tell me, are we in a position

3299
03:15:23,480 --> 03:15:27,680
are be in a position
to run our collection, not

3300
03:15:46,040 --> 03:15:48,360
just first?

3301
03:15:48,360 --> 03:15:49,920
Tell me one thing.

3302
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:56,400
How many times
we are generating the token,

3303
03:15:56,400 --> 03:16:15,360
how many times
you are generating the token?

3304
03:16:15,360 --> 03:16:17,560
Multiple times.

3305
03:16:17,840 --> 03:16:18,720
Multiple times.

3306
03:16:18,720 --> 03:16:20,720
I mean,
every time we are generating it, right?

3307
03:16:21,480 --> 03:16:24,000
So now let's see what we can do

3308
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:27,480
going to these headers

3309
03:16:27,600 --> 03:16:28,800
right this time.

3310
03:16:28,800 --> 03:16:32,600
This time, instead of going from here,
going to the headers

3311
03:16:33,320 --> 03:16:36,840
and here in the header right.

3312
03:16:37,360 --> 03:16:40,200
Authorization rate.

3313
03:16:40,200 --> 03:16:41,160
Authorization What?

3314
03:16:41,160 --> 03:16:41,840
We should wait here.

3315
03:16:41,840 --> 03:16:44,880
This is can

3316
03:16:44,880 --> 03:16:48,720
you see what I'm reading?

3317
03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:51,440
Authorization. Okay.

3318
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:54,200
Now in authorization,
what I am going to do see,

3319
03:16:55,240 --> 03:16:58,560
this is the value of my token.

3320
03:16:58,560 --> 03:17:02,560
And what kind of token is this?

3321
03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:06,600
What kind of token is this?

3322
03:17:06,600 --> 03:17:08,160
Reader Token. Right.

3323
03:17:08,160 --> 03:17:12,600
So can't we pass this bearer
token as my global variable

3324
03:17:16,200 --> 03:17:17,760
days so that

3325
03:17:17,760 --> 03:17:20,680
next time I don't need to change
values everywhere.

3326
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,080
Okay, Just one place. Change it.

3327
03:17:23,080 --> 03:17:24,720
So go here

3328
03:17:25,160 --> 03:17:27,000
click on this icon,

3329
03:17:27,000 --> 03:17:29,880
click on edit option here.

3330
03:17:30,240 --> 03:17:32,880
Simply write JWT

3331
03:17:33,360 --> 03:17:37,560
and then here
when it comes to go away the value.

3332
03:17:37,800 --> 03:17:40,200
So how we provided the value first

3333
03:17:42,040 --> 03:17:44,480
first here we have good right

3334
03:17:44,480 --> 03:17:48,600
virus space, the value

3335
03:17:49,880 --> 03:17:52,560
beta space value

3336
03:17:53,760 --> 03:17:54,280
player.

3337
03:17:54,280 --> 03:17:55,840
We want them to

3338
03:18:00,880 --> 03:18:02,600
base clear

3339
03:18:02,600 --> 03:18:04,800
go into global variables

3340
03:18:04,800 --> 03:18:09,680
via clicking on icon,
Click on Edit in global variables

3341
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:14,080
Under global variables,
add one more variable JWT.

3342
03:18:14,280 --> 03:18:17,840
Provide this value as beer space.

3343
03:18:18,040 --> 03:18:19,640
Beer is based.

3344
03:18:19,640 --> 03:18:23,200
You can see it gets updated.

3345
03:18:23,720 --> 03:18:25,920
So simply saving

3346
03:18:26,640 --> 03:18:29,440
simply saved after saving it.

3347
03:18:29,440 --> 03:18:32,280
What you have to do is see here go.

3348
03:18:33,440 --> 03:18:36,840
You don't need to select
anything from here right.

3349
03:18:36,840 --> 03:18:40,320
Going to the body,
going to the header and here write

3350
03:18:41,600 --> 03:18:43,440
authorization

3351
03:18:43,800 --> 03:18:44,840
authorization.

3352
03:18:44,840 --> 03:18:45,840
This part.

3353
03:18:45,840 --> 03:18:49,040
And here Google

3354
03:18:49,200 --> 03:18:51,680
simply provide JWT in

3355
03:18:51,680 --> 03:18:56,400
you case here provide JWT JSON token.

3356
03:18:56,400 --> 03:19:00,480
So this value will be phased
from their part from that bar

3357
03:19:00,800 --> 03:19:03,240
next time you have to update their token.

3358
03:19:03,480 --> 03:19:08,280
Just updated it one place and it will get
updated everywhere automatically.

3359
03:19:08,920 --> 03:19:10,080
Save it

3360
03:19:10,720 --> 03:19:13,080
now. Please send

3361
03:19:13,800 --> 03:19:16,200
working fine days are still

3362
03:19:16,200 --> 03:19:18,120
employed, created

3363
03:19:18,520 --> 03:19:20,280
is still working fine.

3364
03:19:20,280 --> 03:19:23,120
So now let me quickly update

3365
03:19:23,360 --> 03:19:28,360
let me quickly update this bar everywhere
going to headers,

3366
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:32,400
click here on authorization part
and then simply

3367
03:19:33,600 --> 03:19:37,120
a W to see

3368
03:19:39,120 --> 03:19:40,680
go here,

3369
03:19:41,080 --> 03:19:44,680
select from here, not go into headers,

3370
03:19:45,440 --> 03:19:47,840
link here and write for authorization

3371
03:19:48,440 --> 03:19:53,160
and then simply g w e. See,

3372
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:57,960
this is one time

3373
03:19:57,960 --> 03:20:01,240
activity that we have to do,
but for next time

3374
03:20:01,840 --> 03:20:05,040
for it will be able to handle that thing.

3375
03:20:05,040 --> 03:20:08,120
So next time,
if we are going to change to token,

3376
03:20:08,400 --> 03:21:12,080
we have to update it
just one place and it will work. See,

3377
03:21:13,800 --> 03:21:14,720
now you see

3378
03:21:14,720 --> 03:21:18,320
every single kind of constant
sort of get across this.

3379
03:21:18,600 --> 03:21:23,200
Yes. Connect kind of parameters
that we are passing from one place.

3380
03:21:23,200 --> 03:21:26,400
So next time we don't have to change it
1000 places.

3381
03:21:26,840 --> 03:21:28,560
We just change it one place.

3382
03:21:28,560 --> 03:21:32,080
And these things will get updated
everywhere, correct?

3383
03:21:32,080 --> 03:21:34,560
Everyone.

3384
03:21:34,560 --> 03:21:36,800
And as everyone goes

3385
03:21:37,440 --> 03:21:39,480
now, now this time,

3386
03:21:39,480 --> 03:21:43,960
this time, what I am going to do
is I'm going to run the connection

3387
03:21:44,880 --> 03:21:47,000
because we are done
with every single thing.

3388
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:48,960
So I'm going to run the collection,

3389
03:21:48,960 --> 03:21:52,680
but I don't want to delete the employee
so I can exclude this part.

3390
03:21:53,400 --> 03:21:55,200
I don't want to generate a new token.

3391
03:21:55,200 --> 03:21:59,240
I just generated a digital token
so I will exclude this smart

3392
03:21:59,760 --> 03:22:02,120
admin user, exclude this part also.

3393
03:22:02,400 --> 03:22:04,760
So let's run this particular version.

3394
03:22:04,760 --> 03:22:05,400
Understood.

3395
03:22:07,280 --> 03:22:10,120
And this could implement what I'm doing

3396
03:22:10,840 --> 03:22:12,520
there is I excluded

3397
03:22:12,520 --> 03:22:16,400
admin user because I don't want to create
again, I don't want to create

3398
03:22:16,400 --> 03:22:20,280
token again, I don't want to delete
my employee as of now.

3399
03:22:20,280 --> 03:22:22,000
So I'm excluding them.

3400
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:25,200
The remaining big ones
will be the part of my collection.

3401
03:22:25,800 --> 03:22:27,960
Now let's run

3402
03:22:35,760 --> 03:22:37,880
now you guys see

3403
03:22:37,960 --> 03:22:47,720
guys see here.

3404
03:22:47,720 --> 03:22:48,560
Nice.

3405
03:22:48,600 --> 03:22:51,200
It says create employee boss status.

3406
03:22:51,200 --> 03:22:53,480
Go to get one employee.

3407
03:22:53,480 --> 03:22:56,200
Really find their The status code is 200.

3408
03:22:56,200 --> 03:23:02,000
Get all employees 200 here
it says a status got 200 but in assertions

3409
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:05,280
it got 404 not found right

3410
03:23:05,800 --> 03:23:10,400
and in badge in page
it says expected response to have a status

3411
03:23:10,400 --> 03:23:15,560
could do zero one
but got 200 but got 200 right

3412
03:23:15,960 --> 03:23:18,720
so now now let's fix this error

3413
03:23:19,360 --> 03:23:22,200
first come here try to run this

3414
03:23:24,120 --> 03:23:26,520
See it says employee not found.

3415
03:23:26,520 --> 03:23:28,040
Employee not found.

3416
03:23:28,040 --> 03:23:30,280
That's why Let me in.

3417
03:23:30,280 --> 03:23:31,480
I need to it.

3418
03:23:32,520 --> 03:23:33,600
It's working fine.

3419
03:23:33,600 --> 03:23:35,760
This is the employee can

3420
03:23:37,280 --> 03:23:38,520
go here

3421
03:23:39,000 --> 03:23:40,000
and update this.

3422
03:23:40,000 --> 03:23:43,080
He is a made this data employee, not 406.

3423
03:23:43,920 --> 03:23:46,680
Now let's try run this code

3424
03:23:46,680 --> 03:23:47,120
again.

3425
03:23:47,120 --> 03:23:50,560
It says employee not found against
but the employee 80.

3426
03:23:51,560 --> 03:23:53,280
What is the reason

3427
03:24:31,080 --> 03:24:33,440
now this should work

3428
03:24:34,200 --> 03:24:36,840
now this should work. See,

3429
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:40,120
I go and I click on line collection.

3430
03:24:41,160 --> 03:24:43,320
I don't want this. I don't want this.

3431
03:24:43,480 --> 03:24:51,120
I want this run.

3432
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:53,040
Now see, all this is working fine.

3433
03:24:53,040 --> 03:24:54,320
Just one is failing.

3434
03:24:54,320 --> 03:24:57,760
So let me update this one.

3435
03:24:57,760 --> 03:25:00,040
Let me take this part from here.

3436
03:25:01,520 --> 03:25:03,120
This part and put it in the body.

3437
03:25:03,120 --> 03:25:05,800
Because in my body I'm not changing it.

3438
03:25:05,800 --> 03:25:08,040
There's the issue
I have to change in my body.

3439
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:10,400
Also, employee saving.

3440
03:25:11,400 --> 03:25:13,440
Now, this time, if I had

3441
03:25:13,440 --> 03:25:20,080
run this particular connection,
I don't want the user generated there

3442
03:25:20,080 --> 03:25:23,520
to delete the employee simply right

3443
03:25:31,920 --> 03:25:34,960
now. See that it's all pass

3444
03:25:35,280 --> 03:25:37,360
guys all boss

3445
03:25:43,360 --> 03:25:44,520
right there.

3446
03:25:44,520 --> 03:25:47,320
So when you create your entire distinct
right

3447
03:25:48,400 --> 03:25:51,920
when you create your own API goals,
the best thing is

3448
03:25:51,920 --> 03:25:56,000
the next time you come to the office,
you just open your boards to me.

3449
03:25:56,440 --> 03:25:59,840
Click on one command,
it will run all your API is

3450
03:25:59,880 --> 03:26:02,600
check all the responses for you,
all the users.

3451
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:05,840
It is just a click of it. Now

3452
03:26:05,840 --> 03:26:07,720
everything is ready.

3453
03:26:07,720 --> 03:26:11,120
You said to create a new token
find generated and put together.

3454
03:26:11,160 --> 03:26:13,800
One is simple

3455
03:26:13,800 --> 03:26:16,960
admin user one name activity.

3456
03:26:16,960 --> 03:26:18,560
Isn't it? Very simple.

3457
03:26:18,560 --> 03:26:28,360
Tell me now.

3458
03:26:28,720 --> 03:26:32,640
See one more thing
I would like to show you in this post.

3459
03:26:32,920 --> 03:26:35,360
I don't want to see only the status quo.

3460
03:26:35,360 --> 03:26:39,120
201 Instead I want to see.

3461
03:26:39,120 --> 03:26:42,640
Okay, I'm getting this message
employee created

3462
03:26:42,640 --> 03:26:45,880
or what if I'm getting employee created?

3463
03:26:45,880 --> 03:26:48,960
Message
then only I will check and I will see.

3464
03:26:48,960 --> 03:26:51,920
Already
everything is working absolutely fine.

3465
03:26:52,200 --> 03:26:54,880
So how we can check it? Go here.

3466
03:26:54,880 --> 03:26:55,440
Go here.

3467
03:26:55,440 --> 03:26:56,600
Right.

3468
03:26:56,600 --> 03:26:59,280
Copy this particular part from here.

3469
03:26:59,280 --> 03:27:03,280
Or you can call it directly from there
also and basically iterate.

3470
03:27:03,640 --> 03:27:04,760
So I'm going to write here

3471
03:27:07,560 --> 03:27:09,600
really fine

3472
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:12,120
that the message is, is

3473
03:27:13,920 --> 03:27:15,840
message is visible. Right?

3474
03:27:15,840 --> 03:27:18,200
So what is the message in terms of text?

3475
03:27:18,600 --> 03:27:21,600
I need to employ

3476
03:27:22,920 --> 03:27:25,400
employ, create,

3477
03:27:25,720 --> 03:27:28,920
read, employ, created saving.

3478
03:27:30,400 --> 03:27:32,560
This time run this simple one query

3479
03:27:34,200 --> 03:27:35,520
going to this resource.

3480
03:27:35,520 --> 03:27:38,480
It says verifying that
the message is visible so it is passed.

3481
03:27:38,720 --> 03:27:43,080
Can you see this one is passed is status
code is 200.

3482
03:27:43,080 --> 03:27:45,720
So this one is also must

3483
03:27:50,600 --> 03:27:50,880
guys.

3484
03:27:50,880 --> 03:27:52,320
So voiceover

3485
03:28:02,880 --> 03:28:04,240
What is the bricks be used for?

3486
03:28:04,240 --> 03:28:08,080
Verify response body contains a string.

3487
03:28:08,320 --> 03:28:17,280
This one responds body contains string.

3488
03:28:17,280 --> 03:28:19,280
Real welcome.

3489
03:28:20,240 --> 03:28:22,960
So guys, everyone completed what.

3490
03:28:22,960 --> 03:28:23,680
We did.

3491
03:28:24,360 --> 03:28:30,800
Everyone understood what we did.

3492
03:28:30,800 --> 03:28:33,600
Let's do another collection
one last time is are still

3493
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:37,560
the collection is limited to time
because we're talking in this.

3494
03:28:37,560 --> 03:28:39,360
It will last for time.

3495
03:28:39,360 --> 03:28:41,520
Let me add one more point here. First,

3496
03:28:42,960 --> 03:28:45,200
let me open generic to complete it.

3497
03:28:46,040 --> 03:28:51,000
For example,
what example I'm seeing right cannot see.

3498
03:28:51,480 --> 03:28:53,640
For example, I'm seeing, hey,

3499
03:28:55,080 --> 03:28:59,000
I know you're generating that you're
creating the employee in the database.

3500
03:28:59,400 --> 03:29:01,440
Okay, Absolutely fine.

3501
03:29:02,880 --> 03:29:07,920
But but you are taking a lot of time.

3502
03:29:07,920 --> 03:29:10,640
You are taking a lot of time.
I don't want this much time.

3503
03:29:10,640 --> 03:29:14,760
I want you to create my employee
in 500 milliseconds.

3504
03:29:15,480 --> 03:29:18,760
It means employing 5 seconds
if you are not able to create

3505
03:29:18,760 --> 03:29:21,520
or even just one second,
1000 milliseconds,

3506
03:29:22,360 --> 03:29:25,680
if you're not able to generate
my employer, create my human brain,

3507
03:29:25,880 --> 03:29:29,440
what If I'm signature in one second,
I will not consider you

3508
03:29:29,680 --> 03:29:32,480
that your application response
time is good

3509
03:29:36,880 --> 03:29:38,400
if you put the token in headers.

3510
03:29:38,400 --> 03:29:39,200
Do we also?

3511
03:29:39,200 --> 03:29:42,160
No, no,
we removed it from the authorization.

3512
03:29:42,160 --> 03:29:44,920
That's why we put it in others.

3513
03:29:44,920 --> 03:29:49,320
So for that you'll see
it says the response time is less than 200

3514
03:29:49,320 --> 03:29:50,760
milliseconds and you see

3515
03:29:52,240 --> 03:29:55,320
response time is less than 200
milliseconds.

3516
03:29:55,320 --> 03:30:00,320
Can you see guys, another snippet here?

3517
03:30:00,320 --> 03:30:02,440
Guys, can you see another stupid snippet?

3518
03:30:02,440 --> 03:30:05,680
You click on this, click on this.

3519
03:30:06,160 --> 03:30:09,240
And here you are taking that
okay response time.

3520
03:30:09,240 --> 03:30:10,440
I should see it.

3521
03:30:10,440 --> 03:30:12,920
This should be less than 800 milliseconds.

3522
03:30:13,200 --> 03:30:15,880
So just change them and you do it fine.

3523
03:30:15,880 --> 03:30:18,000
You change them a little, do

3524
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:20,800
this time when you think

3525
03:30:20,960 --> 03:30:24,560
it says response time is less than 800
because the total time

3526
03:30:24,560 --> 03:30:28,080
was 551 milliseconds and you see

3527
03:30:29,440 --> 03:30:31,240
deadline 5 to 7.

3528
03:30:31,240 --> 03:30:31,800
I see.

3529
03:30:31,800 --> 03:30:34,080
We have taken this line from here.

3530
03:30:34,920 --> 03:30:37,160
Jason, I'm sorry, contains the string.

3531
03:30:37,160 --> 03:30:40,600
The response body contains string snippets

3532
03:30:41,640 --> 03:30:42,960
in snippets.

3533
03:30:42,960 --> 03:30:44,520
Can you please check

3534
03:30:55,680 --> 03:30:59,080
rate and this the nine line number 1911

3535
03:30:59,080 --> 03:31:03,200
we got from your response
time is less than 200 milliseconds.

3536
03:31:03,600 --> 03:31:05,560
This is the name of the function.

3537
03:31:05,560 --> 03:31:07,240
You can find it here

3538
03:31:07,240 --> 03:31:11,440
and you can change simply the value
here, the value which is going verify.

3539
03:31:13,000 --> 03:31:13,440
Another

3540
03:31:13,440 --> 03:31:16,520
thing you can verify what is the header
we are passing?

3541
03:31:16,520 --> 03:31:19,920
Let's see, I'm passing the header
which is containing.

3542
03:31:20,320 --> 03:31:23,240
I am seeing
I am sending contain ap delete.

3543
03:31:23,880 --> 03:31:27,720
So please check in my header
content type is available or not.

3544
03:31:28,200 --> 03:31:31,160
So see, I am seeing content present.

3545
03:31:31,480 --> 03:31:35,600
So in the response also told me
that I'm getting content type or not.

3546
03:31:35,800 --> 03:31:37,280
I can take.

3547
03:31:37,280 --> 03:31:39,360
Let me run it again.

3548
03:31:39,720 --> 03:31:42,400
How many test for this can you see now?

3549
03:31:42,720 --> 03:31:46,640
So in headers
if I go I see content date available.

3550
03:31:46,960 --> 03:31:50,040
So this content night
in the response of the body,

3551
03:31:50,040 --> 03:31:53,280
my paste is verifying content type.

3552
03:31:53,520 --> 03:31:57,440
It is verifying it is on state,
it is verifying message is visible.

3553
03:31:57,600 --> 03:31:59,680
It is very
plain is to underscore this stored

3554
03:32:01,080 --> 03:32:05,120
content.

3555
03:32:05,120 --> 03:32:06,920
I recognize

3556
03:32:09,280 --> 03:32:10,360
students

3557
03:32:15,840 --> 03:32:18,080
any questions or

3558
03:32:26,280 --> 03:32:28,600
this is I am creating it in way

3559
03:32:28,840 --> 03:32:34,200
I'm not working with any 80
this is the create employ.

3560
03:32:34,200 --> 03:32:36,040
How did you add the second one?

3561
03:32:36,040 --> 03:32:37,680
When did the messages as well?

3562
03:32:37,680 --> 03:32:39,680
This one Well, what

3563
03:32:44,760 --> 03:32:46,360
one with this one

3564
03:32:53,360 --> 03:32:54,840
Herman you find.

3565
03:32:54,840 --> 03:33:00,120
So here you see it says response
body contains a stream

3566
03:33:00,600 --> 03:33:04,320
the scene when you dig
and you just renamed the method name.

3567
03:33:04,440 --> 03:33:05,480
That's it.

3568
03:33:05,480 --> 03:33:08,440
You can give any name,
whatever the name you want to give.

3569
03:33:08,440 --> 03:33:13,560
I give that name and I provide
the message, which I want to verify simply

3570
03:33:27,520 --> 03:33:30,560
this one in header we are seeing there.

3571
03:33:30,600 --> 03:33:34,560
The content type of my body is just right.

3572
03:33:35,280 --> 03:33:41,760
Similarly, I didn't get that,
but how did you run all your methods?

3573
03:33:41,760 --> 03:33:43,080
The same thing, man.

3574
03:33:43,080 --> 03:33:44,880
This is what we called winning collection.

3575
03:33:44,880 --> 03:33:46,760
Simply going to collection.

3576
03:33:46,760 --> 03:33:50,040
Click on this three dots,
Click on collection.

3577
03:33:50,440 --> 03:33:53,840
Select
what all are the methods you want to run.

3578
03:33:53,840 --> 03:33:56,480
So for example,
I want to run this six seven methods.

3579
03:33:56,480 --> 03:34:00,080
When you do the one you want to include,
click on them.

3580
03:34:00,160 --> 03:34:01,800
The one you want to exclude.

3581
03:34:01,800 --> 03:34:04,960
Just don't pick them and simply run it.

3582
03:34:05,560 --> 03:34:07,920
See, it is working for all this

3583
03:34:08,880 --> 03:34:09,600
for everything.

3584
03:34:09,600 --> 03:34:11,520
It is working fine.

3585
03:34:11,560 --> 03:34:14,600
So here
when we are taking this content type,

3586
03:34:14,640 --> 03:34:18,040
it simply means the body
which I'm sending is having decent

3587
03:34:18,800 --> 03:34:21,800
of export and import rate.

3588
03:34:21,800 --> 03:34:28,560
So one will work on the business.

3589
03:34:28,560 --> 03:34:32,000
Wizards simply say work at eight.

3590
03:34:32,760 --> 03:34:36,120
It started with the
can you show the test for create employed.

3591
03:34:36,880 --> 03:34:39,280
Why not so that you

3592
03:34:41,800 --> 03:34:45,200
so now we
we divide this content in headers

3593
03:34:45,200 --> 03:34:48,600
because the response
we are getting in this body

3594
03:34:48,800 --> 03:34:52,520
the response we should
is also having this content type.

3595
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:55,480
But there is just an example I gave you.

3596
03:34:55,680 --> 03:34:57,520
If you want to verify something else.

3597
03:34:57,520 --> 03:35:00,920
For example, in the response body,
you want to have poisoning

3598
03:35:01,600 --> 03:35:05,560
type closed to create content,
a duplicate header.

3599
03:35:05,800 --> 03:35:09,840
Just read response, not text to include
so in the response it is.

3600
03:35:09,840 --> 03:35:12,840
How did you save on dry?
You should not be.

3601
03:35:13,360 --> 03:35:16,600
You should see we don't drive in your post
when you already

3602
03:35:16,600 --> 03:35:20,440
created a workspace inside your workspace
you have this collection.

3603
03:35:20,680 --> 03:35:23,600
We can simply export this collection
anywhere.

3604
03:35:23,600 --> 03:35:24,440
Right?

3605
03:35:24,720 --> 03:35:28,080
So this is going to click moment.

3606
03:35:28,320 --> 03:35:28,880
So you better.

3607
03:35:28,880 --> 03:35:32,760
Basically it is collecting to
it is connected to the Postman Cloud.

3608
03:35:32,960 --> 03:35:35,320
Right? And there your workspace is mixing

3609
03:35:36,440 --> 03:35:37,240
and if you are

3610
03:35:37,240 --> 03:35:40,360
exporting to some place
simply provide that you are

3611
03:35:40,800 --> 03:35:45,320
right
in that you are ready to provide anywhere.

3612
03:35:45,320 --> 03:35:45,560
Right.

3613
03:35:45,560 --> 03:35:47,880
For example, here's
the share collection rate

3614
03:35:51,600 --> 03:35:55,920
because this is not the city,
this is not the status quo.

3615
03:35:55,920 --> 03:35:58,200
This is the name of your function.

3616
03:35:58,200 --> 03:35:59,640
Just change in lane number.

3617
03:35:59,640 --> 03:36:02,200
The status code is 222 to 0 one.

3618
03:36:02,440 --> 03:36:03,840
So it will give you a square disco.

3619
03:36:03,840 --> 03:36:05,840
This 201 is checking

3620
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:16,440
in. You see that city?

3621
03:36:16,440 --> 03:36:17,560
No issues

3622
03:36:28,800 --> 03:36:29,520
could not save

3623
03:36:29,520 --> 03:36:35,200
your request.

3624
03:36:35,200 --> 03:36:37,960
Invalid character
inhaler content authorization

3625
03:36:40,600 --> 03:36:43,120
JWT. Please check the value

3626
03:36:43,120 --> 03:36:45,600
is take the value there for saving

3627
03:36:46,640 --> 03:36:49,480
the correct sequence
of creating new collection.

3628
03:36:49,480 --> 03:36:53,640
Find in this find Definitely
So to create a collection

3629
03:36:53,640 --> 03:36:57,440
here, let me write.

3630
03:36:57,440 --> 03:37:01,360
Create a collection

3631
03:37:01,360 --> 03:37:02,720
was to take on

3632
03:37:05,360 --> 03:37:07,680
an icon

3633
03:37:08,200 --> 03:37:10,880
and name the collection

3634
03:37:14,200 --> 03:37:19,440
in the list you need.

3635
03:37:19,440 --> 03:37:22,560
All the necessity

3636
03:37:22,960 --> 03:37:25,120
is in

3637
03:37:25,120 --> 03:37:26,800
that request

3638
03:37:28,240 --> 03:37:33,720
and the collection.

3639
03:37:33,720 --> 03:37:35,400
Click on

3640
03:37:36,200 --> 03:37:38,000
three dots

3641
03:37:38,760 --> 03:37:41,440
and select

3642
03:37:41,440 --> 03:37:48,720
the here

3643
03:37:50,200 --> 03:37:53,320
Next number of

3644
03:37:54,320 --> 03:37:56,400
vibrations

3645
03:37:57,240 --> 03:38:02,960
Delayed Dying here

3646
03:38:04,120 --> 03:38:06,160
exclude

3647
03:38:06,240 --> 03:38:08,040
include

3648
03:38:09,920 --> 03:38:10,680
list.

3649
03:38:11,840 --> 03:38:14,000
This is

3650
03:38:16,040 --> 03:38:19,680
and also

3651
03:38:28,200 --> 03:38:30,800
then in spite

3652
03:38:58,440 --> 03:39:01,680
I'm going to pause to create. No,

3653
03:39:01,680 --> 03:39:05,640
now you have every single thing
available here.

3654
03:39:05,640 --> 03:39:06,600
All right, guys.

3655
03:39:06,600 --> 03:39:10,400
So far any question
I think we are done with the postman.

3656
03:39:11,280 --> 03:39:14,000
The manual testing of API
we are done with.

3657
03:39:14,000 --> 03:39:18,720
Is there any question
If you have, please ask.
