1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,680
And hopefully
things will start to make sense.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,040
Hi, Miriam.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,280
All right, guys.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,520
So up till now.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,160
So can you guys tell me how how do we
solve real problems using using programing

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
so you guys are half and down
so you know, the half of the concepts.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,560
Now, the second part of

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,760
this Java series

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,560
will be to solve

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,720
the real life problems,
but in a better way.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,000
So the basics, they will be same.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,160
We will be using the same things,
but now we will learn some techniques

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,840
that will help you write better code

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,240
because that is understandable to others.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,720
Because that is easy to manage. Easy.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,040
But by manage.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,160
By manage I mean easy to change.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,440
If new requirements come in, comes in,

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
you can easily incorporate
those new changes.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,480
This part of Java series.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,840
It will help you better model

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,440
real life problems inside your computers.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,640
So take a problem from real life.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,240
Define the rules, and then those rules
they will keep on executing automatically.

25
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,360
We need a little help with to the arrays.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,200
I do not worry.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,480
I will be going to the to the editor.

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,280
But let me tell you this.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,520
We really need to the arrays.

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,160
They are not used in the real life

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,800
as much. So

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,840
after these oops concepts,
I will be teaching you

33
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,920
at least five classes on collections
framework.

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,560
So those collection framework you guys
will be learning new data structures.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,640
So the in real life you guys will be using
those data structures instead of the.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,560
So at this point,
if you guys have understood the concept

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,560
concept that high level,
if you guys can access the element of a 2D

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,080
area and can store an element in the area,
that's enough.

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,240
I mean, we are trained to using the loops

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,440
or something like that.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,440
So when I will be teaching,
I will be telling you how

42
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,560
much, how,

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,800
how useful
those concepts will be in your realize

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,400
how important they are

45
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,480
with respect to your interviews
and on your job.

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,720
And then you guys,

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,960
you guys can pay attention or can study
those concepts accordingly.

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,920
You can spend your time accordingly.

49
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,000
You really also tell me of laudatory.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,240
So can you guys tell
me what do you guys think?

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,960
What does this programing do?

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,720
How how do we solve

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,800
that real life problem?

54
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,040
Using using programing.

55
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,360
No brain left to think,
but just just the just

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,560
the start of the class.

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,600
At least keep a little bit brain
for for my class but hard

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,440
by putting logical on the issues

59
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,120
for building the models

60
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,760
for transactions

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,440
so imagine imagine

62
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,600
how have you guys played the video games

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,520
Big B should provide for 3D games, right?

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,040
So in a game

65
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,000
you see almost everything from real life

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,800
is being billed

67
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,640
virtually inside your computer,
right? Yes.

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,720
Call of Duty, my favorite.

69
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,240
So using programing idea you
you must be very old format.

70
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,920
I played by

71
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,720
the using programing what we do

72
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,800
we build a virtual world

73
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,160
inside the computers.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,480
Then we define the rules

75
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,040
that how that word will work. Right?

76
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,160
So you can fly cars, you can jump from one
building to the other building, right?

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,680
And then the rules,
they are defined like this.

78
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,680
So you build a word
using these programs inside your computer.

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,320
I like a blind person here.

80
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
It's fine.

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,040
It's fun.

82
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,200
So you guys must have at least played
some kind of games.

83
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,440
Not it's not super
3D or something like that.

84
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,560
So we build

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,440
a virtual world inside the computer.

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Then we define the rules,

87
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,280
how that world will work right?

88
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,560
How many fires you you fired at
some person and then person will be dead.

89
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,040
How the rules of the physics will work

90
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,200
and then you let that word run, right?

91
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,720
So this is the case for games.

92
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,920
What you can do,
you can define those rules for anything.

93
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,040
Like, for example,
think of the banking applications. So

94
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,600
in big game in banking
application will define

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,200
that there will be a person,

96
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
he will be having a bank account,

97
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,720
he can put some funds in the bank account,
He can withdraw the funds, right?

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,160
He can transfer fast.

99
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,320
So all of these rules
we define using programing, right?

100
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,000
And then we put that those rules
inside the computer and that application,

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,120
it keeps on running,
entertaining thousands of customers.

102
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,480
So we will be doing this in

103
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,760
this part of the of the Java series.

104
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,760
It will be focusing on how to mimic

105
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,680
the real life things inside the computers.

106
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,360
Okay.

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,360
So you guys can think of yourself as

108
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,720
as the creator of those objects
on those things inside the computers.

109
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,160
So now you guys have to think if you guys

110
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,800
who are the creators of this word,
how, how, how would you have defined

111
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,280
all those things
that exist in the real life?

112
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,800
Are all those things

113
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,720
How did they work and interact and
how they look like and things like that?

114
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Okay, do that.

115
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,200
I know or you.

116
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,520
So in real life guys, tell me, how can I.

117
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,720
So how can I, I define something?

118
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,000
How can I define something like, say,
for example, if I have to tell someone

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,360
that what is a human,
how how can I tell this this information?

120
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,400
How how can I convey this information
if I have to tell

121
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,240
someone how the cards look like,
Well, what is a bike?

122
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,120
What is a cat? What is a dog?
What do we what do we convey?

123
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,640
What is the piece of information
that we tell the other person?

124
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,640
If we have to define that things

125
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,880
to explain
the qualities, the perfect properties?

126
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,480
Yes, I show perfect answer step by step.

127
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,040
Explain.

128
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,160
Yes. So we can explain how that thing
might work in real life.

129
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,600
Right?

130
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,720
So previously, step by step
explaining how they're think.

131
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,160
So we define
by describing by their actions

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,240
how those things look like, right
by description, by their shapes.

133
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,640
So we will be doing exactly the same

134
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,480
using these glasses and objects.

135
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,760
And if I ask you guys

136
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,600
in real life,
if I have to build something,

137
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,960
what will be my first step?

138
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,760
You have to build a car

139
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,240
or a bike or an airplane.

140
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,400
So I will first

141
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,640
I will be having that blueprint right

142
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,440
that to die, that concept inside my mind.

143
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,800
I will I will think about all those rules

144
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,360
and how did that thing will look like, how
that thing will function and everything.

145
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,520
Right.

146
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,120
So the first step is,
is that blueprint, right, that planning,

147
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:54,480
that idea.

148
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,280
So that idea, that blueprint

149
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,600
that could die

150
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,000
on that plan is called a class.

151
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,440
So you guys have been creating
a glass, right?

152
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,360
But up till now
you guys have been creating a

153
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,840
simple class in which you guys are having
all your main method, right?

154
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,240
You, you didn't define
any of the properties or how that class

155
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,040
would look like or what is the idea behind
you creating that class?

156
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,440
Why you are creating that class? Right?

157
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,200
I grew up my dad making blueprints
manually.

158
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,720
I said we will be doing the same idea.

159
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,040
So this class in Java is the concept

160
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,240
that we will use to define line,

161
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,080
how it will look like

162
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,160
and how that thing will.

163
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,960
What are the behaviors of that team?

164
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,120
What does that thing do
inside the computer?

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,080
Okay,
so defining how that thing looks like

166
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,840
and defining how that thing works

167
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,320
for these
two things, we will be using a class.

168
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
This is a class in in
Java programing that we use, okay?

169
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,320
We use a class to define how something
will work, how something will look like.

170
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,480
So by definition,
the class is a user defined.

171
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,760
And one more thing is

172
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,880
I will be

173
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,280
reading all the slides,

174
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,360
I will be explaining all the sentences,
all the

175
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,440
definitions and everything
that is written inside this slide.

176
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,160
Because after you guys are done
learning Java,

177
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,400
you guys will be coming back to the slides
to refresh your knowledge.

178
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,400
And I want you to have clarity
on everything that is written

179
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,600
inside these slides.

180
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
So if something is not clear inside
this file,

181
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,880
stop me and I will explain that thing
with different examples.

182
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,560
Okay.

183
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,280
And I want you
to do one more thing because

184
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,480
this is what
I have observed from previous batches.

185
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,560
So you guys will be for the next
three weeks, it will be all your Java

186
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,640
and after three weeks
you guys will be learning selenium.

187
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,760
And as you move away from Java and start

188
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
learning other things,
you guys will start to forget things.

189
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,760
So I want you to follow this routine
that at least

190
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,160
you guys are reading
at least 2 to 3 slides each day.

191
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,480
So you guys are halfway down.

192
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,560
So I want you to go and start
from this slide number one,

193
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,680
and I want you to keep on reading
one or two slides per day.

194
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,240
Or maybe if you have time,
you guys can go back and check your repos

195
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,040
and you can maybe start or write
at least a few lines of code each day.

196
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,600
So it will be very beneficial for you.

197
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,800
Otherwise what happens is that you
guys will be sitting in the interviews,

198
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,120
you guys will be following
the coding tests,

199
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,520
but you guys will not even remember
how to declare an edit.

200
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,680
You guys will forget the syntax
of how good it be at edit.

201
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,640
This has been this and this has happened
and I don't want you to do the same.

202
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,000
So okay, so a class

203
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,000
is a user defined

204
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,080
blueprint

205
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,200
from which object are created, right?

206
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,040
So let's say, for example, if I have to
be, if I have to create a get,

207
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
is this required any specific program
or we can use the clips.

208
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,920
So now is it right now

209
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,200
we will be using Eclipse,
but I guess from next week

210
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,280
we will be switching to a different idea
that is called in telling you.

211
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,560
So right now
in the industry, around 50 to 60%.

212
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,600
People use intelligent and 40%

213
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,400
of the time
they use Eclipse or another ID.

214
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,600
So we don't know.

215
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Depending upon your company,

216
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,480
you guys might be using Eclipse
or might be using intelligence.

217
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,640
We we want to teach you both.

218
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,520
So that's like
half of the Java will be part in Eclipse

219
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,120
and the remaining half
will be taught in an intelligent

220
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,080
and you guys will like it.

221
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,960
You guys will like it.

222
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,160
It's like using

223
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,800
this, like using Windows XP and Windows 11

224
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,680
or an iPhone
or maybe some third party giant

225
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,040
mobile phone.

226
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
So a class is a user defined so

227
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,880
the users define it.

228
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,720
Okay.

229
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,360
And it contains the blueprint, right?

230
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,960
The idea the sketch is the design

231
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,800
from which
we will be creating the objects.

232
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,480
Okay.

233
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,160
So let's say, for example, are we going
to be learning Python as well?

234
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,840
Northwestern

235
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,480
There are more than 10,000
programing languages

236
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,280
and we will not be learning
all those programing languages.

237
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,160
The basics, they are same

238
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,360
if you guys learn the rules

239
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,360
in one programing language,
here's the syntax that changes.

240
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,960
So if you have understood the concepts
in Python, you also have variables.

241
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,200
In Python, you also have loops in Python,
you have for loop, you have y

242
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
loop, you have little white loop

243
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,120
you have at is
you have everything that you have in Java.

244
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,800
Okay?

245
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
If the only the syntax

246
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,360
and some programing languages,
they are optimized for certain things.

247
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,720
For example, if you have to do some
machine learning task,

248
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,040
Python has a lot of libraries,

249
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,600
a lot of code that is already written
to solve those problem.

250
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,600
So it depends
what kind of problem you are solving.

251
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,200
For us, Java is good.

252
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,280
Yes, the student.

253
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,320
So class is a template

254
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,600
for creating different objects.

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,520
We which defines its features

256
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,240
are the properties and the behavior.

257
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,120
So how how certain

258
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,280
how a thing will look like features

259
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,240
and how that thing behaves in a real life.

260
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,600
Right?

261
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,640
What are the tasks
that that thing can perform?

262
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,000
We will be defining these proteins
in a class.

263
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,840
In order to create an object,
you need a class.

264
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,400
Okay, So first we have this idea and

265
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,000
we put all the rules,

266
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,680
like how things
how that thing will look like

267
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,720
and how that thing will behave

268
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,520
right then from those ideas,

269
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,720
those rules, that blueprint,
that design will create the actual thing.

270
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,320
Okay,
So we will follow this approach, right?

271
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,080
So in in a car factory,
if you have to build a car,

272
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,600
you you kind of build
that template, right?

273
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,000
And then you can build thousands of cars
out of that same template, right?

274
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,080
So you have

275
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,520
a little

276
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,000
you got
you can also have a little word variations

277
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,160
in different actual cars
that you produce from the same design.

278
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,160
Right.

279
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,120
So we can use that design to build

280
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,360
many real life

281
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,960
actual objects and we can have

282
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,960
a little bit different
different properties for those objects.

283
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,720
Okay.

284
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,920
So glass
is something that contain contains

285
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,720
rules or design or a blueprint.

286
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,720
And using those rules,

287
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,040
we create the actual objects.

288
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,320
So you guys already know
about the variables.

289
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,600
So a class can have variables

290
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,560
like the variables
that you guys are defining, like things,

291
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,280
integers, booleans, all those variables
that you guys have been using.

292
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,400
You can have those variables
in a class, this method.

293
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,800
So you guys right now, you guys only know
all about the mean method, right?

294
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,280
But we

295
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,720
can have many different main methods
and it will become super clear the moment

296
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,880
I gave you the first example, it will
super clear What are those matters?

297
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,280
What are those properties?

298
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,080
So don't worry right

299
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,120
now, this constructor thing
you guys don't need to worry about.

300
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,400
There is a complete class
on this constructor,

301
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,320
right?

302
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,160
So for now you guys can think of this
constructor is something that help you

303
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,000
construct the actual objects
from those classes.

304
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Okay.

305
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,360
And the last bind, you can have
multiple objects for the same class.

306
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,680
Now, before we move forward, this is

307
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,880
these are the main concepts
of object oriented programing.

308
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,320
So you guys are learning.

309
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,040
You guys have you
guys will now be learning.

310
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,080
The object oriented programing and

311
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,560
object
oriented programing is built on these

312
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,520
5 to 6 concepts.

313
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,120
Okay?

314
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,040
You have the concept of object and class

315
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,400
that you guys will learn in today's class.

316
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,360
Then you will be learning
about inheritance.

317
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,480
I think it's pretty much same
as the inheritance in our real life.

318
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,320
Then we have polymorphism,

319
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,240
if the easiest topic
being object oriented programing.

320
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,880
So I said this is where you guys
have to hold down your peers

321
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,720
and then we have abstraction
and encapsulation.

322
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,160
So we will be starting
from class and objects. Look

323
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,960
and Java is an object oriented programing.

324
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,160
It's not 100% object oriented programing,
and it will be clear

325
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,560
at the end of this course.

326
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,920
But we are other object
oriented programing languages

327
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,360
like Seashore, Python, C++.

328
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,600
So object oriented is nothing,

329
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,320
but it's a set of rules.

330
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,960
It's a way of solving

331
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,880
a real life program, a real life problem,
using any programing language.

332
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,080
So it's a set of techniques
and like object

333
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,320
oriented, we have functional programing.

334
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,680
There's another set of rules
that help us solve certain

335
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,160
real life problems in a better way,
not where you guys will not be trying.

336
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
I will make sure that you guys don't try

337
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,880
so object oriented.

338
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,960
It is nothing,

339
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,520
but it's a methodology, okay?

340
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,080
It's a way of solving

341
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,400
error, a real life problem,
a set of rules, the set of guidelines

342
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,920
that programmers
have developed over the years.

343
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,920
So today we are starting with the object
oriented programing.

344
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,200
And object oriented programing is nothing,
but it's a methodology

345
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,400
code paradigm to design a program
using classes and objects.

346
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,840
It simplifies the software development
and a maintenance problem.

347
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,280
Remember guys

348
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,240
to solve real problems.

349
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,440
You guys will be writing thousands

350
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,520
and thousands of lines of code right?

351
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,200
And by now you must have noticed
that if you write the program,

352
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,200
you're going to visit that program
for two weeks.

353
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,920
And after two weeks,
if you see that program,

354
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,120
half of the logic that you have written
inside that program, you don't remember

355
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,440
why you wrote that logic, right?

356
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,440
The does this happens to you guys?

357
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,240
Or maybe after 5 minutes, Spike,
you write something and after five meters

358
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,640
you don't know why you wrote a bad thing.

359
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,480
So this object or in programing
will help us solve that problem as though

360
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,680
we need to worry about.

361
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,080
Lemma Did he make a bad comment about man?

362
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,560
Don't

363
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
fried

364
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,360
Canada, don't worry about Zima.

365
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,080
I don't remember. Next. Next.

366
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,600
There is a lot

367
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,640
the object oriented programing

368
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,960
will also help you in
in these kind of scenarios.

369
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,760
And the second hardest part is that

370
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,440
you guys must have noticed
you use your mobile phones,

371
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,080
you use different websites
each day or each week.

372
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,360
There are new features
in those mobile phones or the apps

373
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,080
that you use on mobile phones,
all of the websites and everything, right?

374
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,120
So this software
development is not a one time activity.

375
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,200
So it's not like that.

376
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,640
You have written a program
and then that program

377
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,080
will continue to work
fine if I am not talking about Microsoft.

378
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,480
So this rule applies other than Microsoft.

379
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:36,120
So you guys will be adding
a lot of features day by day.

380
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,560
Okay. So

381
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,000
now now to

382
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,240
add those features,
you guys will be writing NewCo, Plus

383
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,320
you guys will be modifying
the existing code.

384
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,560
Yeah.

385
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,960
So that modification of the existing code
requires you to understand

386
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,480
what is already written.

387
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,000
Then modify those things

388
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,680
and then

389
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,480
build those new features.

390
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,800
I am lost, Cosima.

391
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,240
I am also lost.

392
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,440
So this is what we luckily will be doing.

393
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,640
So today we are starting the object
oriented programing

394
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,160
and to learn about the object
oriented programing,

395
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,640
we need to understand

396
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,280
the class and the objects.

397
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,760
Okay.

398
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,040
The backpacks make much error.

399
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,440
Students they they.

400
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,120
When I used to teach them,
they used to send me off.

401
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,000
There
we are about to jump from the window. So.

402
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,800
Zimmer Don't worry.

403
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,120
Those those things,
they will not apply on base.

404
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:44,960
I know

405
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,920
polymorphism.

406
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Wait for me. Yes.

407
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,720
All right.

408
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,240
So up now it's around

409
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,720
27 minutes and be honest, is this hard?

410
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,480
Does it require too much brain?

411
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,960
So, Emily, you guys will

412
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,040
I will ask you this question
after this class and you guys will tell

413
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,800
me, you guys, I want to hear from you
if it is hard or not.

414
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,600
We are just sleeping about you, okay?

415
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,160
Just give me like 30 to 40 minutes and
then all of your dogs, they will be here.

416
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,600
So I belong.

417
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,480
Do you guys understand?

418
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,880
Now what is object oriented programing?

419
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,560
I was going great, losing weight,

420
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,000
and I started this class
that you are gaining the weight now.

421
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,920
I think you should

422
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,960
lose more weight.

423
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,960
I was crying
because I don't want to lose my job.

424
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,600
Speaking about our exam.

425
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,240
When we see example, I hope we can.

426
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,760
Yes, you guys will be able to.

427
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,960
So guys.
But what is object oriented programing

428
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,720
is something specific to Java or whatever.

429
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,160
What is it?

430
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,240
Can you guys tell me?

431
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,440
Can you guys define it?

432
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,840
Oh, yes.

433
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,040
By the way, I forgot to tell you
that this part is easier than those nested

434
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:22,080
loops, Those body arrays
and stuff like that.

435
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,240
No, it's not just for Java methodology.

436
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm losing weird.

437
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,120
I'm just thinking about course,
the whole time, not even hungry anymore.

438
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,200
So I was then I was learning programing.

439
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,000
I used to think about the programs
when I was in bathrooms.

440
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,480
I was eating or sleeping.

441
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,360
So give me don't worry,
it's the same for all

442
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,920
go to here.

443
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,280
I was happy with the nested loops.

444
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,960
Does this part include coding?

445
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,720
Definitely.

446
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:01,600
Nikolai A lot of coding. It's

447
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
a program

448
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,520
works easier only for you as the

449
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,440
instance with finger.

450
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:21,840
Yes, a lot of coding.

451
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,520
The nice

452
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,280
object oriented programing

453
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,440
is just a way to solve real life problems

454
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,280
using any programing language,
a set of rules, a set of guidelines

455
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,760
that help us write it,
and that then that help us

456
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:50,160
solve
the real life problems in an easier way.

457
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,520
And can you guys
tell me about the class one?

458
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
What is the class

459
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,640
what what were you thinking about
in the bathroom?

460
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,800
So, Farhad, when you will be struck
on a problem for us

461
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,920
then and that

462
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,960
that problem, it will, it will haunt you.

463
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,680
So you will be thinking
about those problems in the bathroom.

464
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,480
So it was not just me who was losing Their

465
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,480
idea of an object

466
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,880
type of low class may contain objects

467
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,680
or word, a blueprint
from which we can create an object.

468
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,640
Perfect answer.

469
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,160
Who know class will define
features and behavior. Yes,

470
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,480
I. I was dreaming about my class.

471
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,080
Describe the contents of
so how a certain thing will look like

472
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,840
This is what a class will be defining.

473
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,280
And can you guys tell me about the object?

474
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,800
Well, what are objects in our real life

475
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,320
template for creating projects?

476
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:03,760
Not projects, but objects.

477
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,400
Physical items like the mouse,
the computer, the laptop,

478
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,640
the chair, the room, everything around you
that you guys can see and touch.

479
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,480
That that physical thing
is an object, right?

480
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,560
We will be creating those things
inside programs,

481
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:32,840
inside computers.

482
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,320
So here is an example.

483
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,920
It is an example
so we can have an animal class.

484
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,680
Okay.

485
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,240
For for now you guys can think of animal

486
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,160
as some kind of idea inside your mind.

487
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,080
So then I ask you to tell me
about how animals look like.

488
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,560
How do they behave?

489
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,600
You guys can tell me
some certain things about animals, right?

490
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,560
It's all inside your mind.

491
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,080
It's a logical thing.

492
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,640
It's a logical deviation, right?

493
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,600
It's an idea.

494
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,280
If something that is inside
only inside of mind.

495
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,360
If I ask you, can you show me an animal
you guys can.

496
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:12,960
You can.

497
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,080
Can show me a
lot of different things. Like

498
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,880
lions, like cats and dogs.

499
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,720
Right.

500
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,120
But if I ask you about a specific actual

501
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:33,040
physical object,

502
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,160
you cannot tell about a specific,
specific physical object.

503
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,880
If I ask you to define that thing
using animal.

504
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,320
Right.

505
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,240
But are these objects,
are they inside our minds?

506
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,720
We can have a physical

507
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,280
a sorry, we can have a kind of definition

508
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,280
about all of these things inside

509
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,800
this animal class, Right.

510
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,960
So if I ask you that,

511
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,000
what is the difference
between animals and cars?

512
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,400
You guys can define it, right?

513
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,680
If I ask you the difference between

514
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,800
animals and humans, you guys,
you guys can tell, right?

515
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,280
All those attributes

516
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,760
how humans look like and how animals
look like all those behaviors

517
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,720
that humans do and that those animals do.

518
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,840
Right. You you kind help.

519
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,960
You kind of
have that picture in your mind,

520
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,760
like snake is a tail,
which quickly creeps around.

521
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,520
Yes, that's that's perfectly right.

522
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,240
So what we will do

523
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,240
inside

524
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,600
inside computers,
we will be defining these classes

525
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,080
first, like,
for example, the animal class.

526
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,520
And once we have defined the animal class
inside the animal class, we will define

527
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,840
how how the animals look like,
how they behave.

528
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,360
And once we have defined those rules,

529
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,080
then we will be able to create different,
different animals using those rules.

530
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,280
Okay, so getting the furniture class

531
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,800
and here are all the objects
that are under this furniture.

532
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,840
So let me first show you an example.

533
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,240
Today's class number 11 right? Yes.

534
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,080
When we create a scanner,
we are creating an object.

535
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:53,480
So let me create a class.

536
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,120
So now I want you to follow me
and I want you to stop me.

537
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,120
If you guys are unable to follow me
and I am going fast.

538
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,720
So. Com or syntax.

539
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,880
No class, no.

540
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,960
And this time does not create
that mean method.

541
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,960
Okay.

542
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:29,800
This time don't attack me method.

543
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,400
The name must not be

544
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,800
identified

545
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,360
in class

546
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,840
and so

547
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:15,480
let me create the package first.

548
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,840
Last 11.

549
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,560
Is this class 11?

550
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:47,480
Yes, this is class 11.

551
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:56,760
So let's create a doll between ten and 12.

552
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:06,680
Let's try to create a doll.

553
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,320
Okay.

554
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,040
Let me know what you guys see.

555
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,640
This this class in here.

556
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,160
Without that, to

557
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,040
go inside a class,
What do we define, guys?

558
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,680
What define two things.

559
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:37,360
What are those two things
that we define inside the class?

560
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,760
No, main class.

561
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,760
The method behavior

562
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,280
and the features are the properties.

563
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,560
So we will be going step by step.

564
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,200
Right now, we will only be focusing
on features, on properties,

565
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,480
and later on
we will be defining the behaviors as well.

566
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,040
Inside that class.

567
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,280
So tell me about the dolls guys.

568
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,680
What are they
some what are some properties?

569
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,640
What are some features that dogs dogs have

570
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,600
four legs barking.

571
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,000
They'll one they'll size

572
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,800
breed.

573
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,600
So let's start from something very simple
although

574
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,360
it's a little let's say

575
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
let's start from the name right.

576
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,840
So dogs they can have a name

577
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,560
physical then humans

578
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,920
against

579
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,840
dogs they can have a breed, right.

580
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,320
So string and breed

581
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:12,800
dogs, they can have color.

582
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,320
Okay.

583
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,840
They have some trade in humanity to

584
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,080
gain.

585
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,600
Well, what are the other things, guys,
that dogs have

586
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,760
a name breed color type.

587
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,240
So Alexa, Alexa, we will be specifying
the type and the size or the age.

588
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,600
So instead of size, let's have

589
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,000
height.

590
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,200
So for height, what should I do, guys?

591
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,120
Should I declare an integer variable
or a double variable?

592
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,640
Then how do we end points?

593
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,120
And so we should be using a double, not a

594
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,440
major.

595
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:14,080
What about the age?

596
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,240
So age is usually defined in figures,
so increase

597
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,040
the age

598
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,600
right?

599
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,360
Then we can have

600
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,960
the gender as estimate right.

601
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,840
So this is how

602
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,760
old I am.

603
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,840
33.5 years old.

604
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,040
So we will consider you 33 years old.

605
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,120
So this is how guys using these

606
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,880
simple variables
that you guys have learned.

607
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,000
We define the features

608
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,040
or the properties for certain objects.

609
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,680
Okay.

610
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,080
So we have defined inside this class

611
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:00,240
that the object
that we will be creating from this class,

612
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,840
it will be
it can have a name, it can have a breed.

613
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,600
It will be having some color, right?

614
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,960
It will be having some height, age
and integer.

615
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,320
Right now, if you look at the real life

616
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,800
dogs,
there can be thousands of features right

617
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,400
there
and there can be thousands of features.

618
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,600
But to explain the concept,
we will only be

619
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,800
considering 5
to 10 features of each object right?

620
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,480
So don't don't worry
about those number of LEDs,

621
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,760
those those things
and all those other attributes there

622
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,360
that you guys have specified
in this channel

623
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,640
in here in the chat.

624
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,040
Yes, there are all features,

625
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,680
but we will be keeping the example simple
and there can be other features

626
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,360
that we are
not maybe considering right now. So

627
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,520
all those things,
they are classified and procedures, right?

628
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,360
So we defined a class.

629
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Okay, We have given the class
a name, it's our dog.

630
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,120
And then using variables, we have

631
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,440
some properties
or attributes of dogs, right

632
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,600
now we can have much more complex

633
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,720
structures to define the actual physical

634
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,920
appearance of a dog.

635
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,560
We can we can define to how how those legs
and those neck and body

636
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,480
and all that stuff, how they're acting
looks like in real life objects.

637
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,240
But we will be keeping things very,
very simple.

638
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,720
Okay.

639
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,160
So we will only be
considering these features.

640
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,280
So when we have now defined

641
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,800
the dog like service dog,
which is need for 2508

642
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,120
could be the

643
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,560
to test each class

644
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,840
or to clear the objects out of a class.

645
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,280
We will be following this

646
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,520
in this

647
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,480
approach

648
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,720
that for each class
we will be creating a test for class.

649
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,000
So we will create a dog

650
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,480
stuff in here.

651
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,120
And inside of this test,
our classes in here

652
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,480
we will be having the main methods.

653
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,320
So let me open these classes

654
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:46,800
side by side.

655
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,920
Can you repeat please?

656
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,320
Can we define behavior for features?

657
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,000
No, just give me 15 to 20 minutes.

658
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,720
I will tell you how to define behaviors.

659
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,040
So right now
I have defined some properties of a dog.

660
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,160
Okay. How a dog

661
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,040
looks like in real life.

662
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,040
For that I have created a class

663
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,400
and I have used some variables and

664
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,720
deficit. Okay.

665
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,080
And you created another class
like normal? Yes.

666
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,520
This is second class.

667
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,040
This dog best, the class in here.

668
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,320
We will create actual objects
out of these classes.

669
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,600
We can do.

670
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,960
We can create the objects
inside this class.

671
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,440
But this is how it is done in real life.

672
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,360
So I will try to follow the same rules

673
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,120
that you guys will be using in your
in your real life order, in your

674
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,160
on your jobs, in real life.

675
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:55,080
So are you guys done writing
most of these classes?

676
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,400
Okay, now to create

677
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,080
an object out of a class,
this is the syntax that we use.

678
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,240
So we write name of the class.

679
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,080
Okay, dog.

680
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,360
Then the object name.

681
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,320
Okay, It can be in there. Say

682
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
it can be

683
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
a Zima or not.

684
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,120
Okay.

685
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,600
And then we use that equal cosine.

686
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,440
Then we write new keyword

687
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,080
and then again that dog.

688
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,840
And of parentheses.

689
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,480
And this time we call it

690
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,360
the same as you guys have been doing
for this kind of class.

691
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,600
The name of the class,

692
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,680
then name of the variable.

693
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,160
So the name of the class,

694
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,520
name of the variable

695
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,680
and equal cosine neo keyword.

696
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,920
And then again the name of the class.

697
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,520
And the benefit is the dog is an Adi

698
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,800
likes camel and it likes Natty.

699
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,200
So that area is also class.

700
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,920
The class name is Guess Sensitive.

701
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:24,600
Yes, the class name is a sensitive.

702
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:31,200
Okay, so this is how we create
an object in here.

703
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,960
This is the object. Okay?

704
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,320
This is what we call an object.

705
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,680
This is the class.

706
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,800
This is what we call an object.

707
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,800
This is just an assignment.

708
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,840
This new keyword.

709
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,480
You guys will always be
using a new keyword when you will be

710
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,080
creating objects of classes.

711
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,520
And then again, name of the class.

712
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,400
And by the way, this
this is what we call the constructor.

713
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,800
So basically we are saying, Hey, Java

714
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,040
effort of the model to our class
and to use features from there. Yes.

715
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:07,600
So this is what happens, guys,

716
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,040
when you write the name of the class

717
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,840
and you don't write any import statement,
You remember this

718
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,360
for the scanner to work,
you guys used to write that import

719
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,800
statement, write that import statement.

720
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,880
It actually tells you
where that a scanner class is

721
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,000
inside
the packages that Java guys have built

722
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,720
when you guys are developing something.

723
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,360
And if that thing exists
in the same package,

724
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,320
you guys don't need that import statement.

725
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,240
I missed it.

726
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,680
Did you explain why the dog class
does not have a main method?

727
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,000
Can it ever have main method?

728
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,040
Yes, it can have the main method as well.

729
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,960
It's just an optional thing. So.

730
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,520
So when you write the name of the class
lines, this is important.

731
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,440
I want you to focus when you write
the name of the class what Java will do.

732
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,520
Java will go in here and Java will check

733
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,360
if there are any import statements

734
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,320
for that class.

735
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,040
If there are no import statements in here,

736
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,360
then Java will double check this package.

737
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,240
Okay, Java will take this package.

738
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,640
So Java will say okay,

739
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,880
I am so this this dog best

740
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,600
our class is inside
this class 11 package here

741
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,880
and I don't have any import statements
that Java will do.

742
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,840
Java will go inside this package

743
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,920
and Java will search

744
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,280
for the four classes that have this dog

745
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,320
as the name.

746
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,360
Once Java has found this dog,
not Java, then Java.

747
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,280
Go inside this class in here,

748
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,400
okay?

749
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:13,040
And now Java knows
what are the properties of this class,

750
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,680
What are the methods
and how to use that class.

751
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,840
Okay,
if we have an import statement of that

752
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,440
import statement,
it tells you where to find that class.

753
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,600
If we don't have import statement,
the first priority

754
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,600
in Java looks inside this package

755
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,160
in which the class exists

756
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,080
in which you are
trying to create the object.

757
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,600
Okay. So far dog class

758
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,520
because there are no import statements,

759
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,840
Java will go inside this

760
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,800
class level and package the same package

761
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,400
in which this class exists

762
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,520
and it will try to search

763
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,640
the dog class is

764
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,000
the class was to be on same package.

765
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,920
No, it can be in a different package,

766
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,160
but if it is in a different package

767
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,760
then you have to write
that import statement.

768
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,040
Then it would be in a folder.
Not you meet.

769
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,120
You should be inside the package

770
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,720
import card or turtle

771
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,440
and dog would not need to import Asia.

772
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,600
What is the syntax import valid or tuple?

773
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,960
And so we don't need that import
statement.

774
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,800
We don't need any syntax.

775
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,000
Oh, then it is outside of the package.

776
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,480
I will.

777
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,560
I will teach you well what happens
when it is outside of that package.

778
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,560
No, don't worry about that right now.

779
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,360
What about if
there is nothing in the package,

780
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,160
then you will be getting an error.

781
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,560
Now you will be getting an

782
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,360
Dimas dog.

783
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,360
It's a variable.

784
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,640
And so it could be anything.

785
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,920
Yes, it can be anything.

786
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,840
It can be anything

787
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,480
you want.

788
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,680
You can say

789
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,720
the mark

790
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:20,520
looks are dog.

791
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,160
Yes, this is the object.

792
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,000
Okay.

793
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,840
Okay.

794
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,080
So let me put a comment for you

795
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,160
when here we are creating

796
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,280
an object of

797
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,120
dog class. Okay.

798
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:50,040
So when we write this line, we say
we are creating an object of that class.

799
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,200
No, you have a dog, Rima.

800
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,800
Okay, Rima, tell me.

801
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,040
Tell us

802
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:00,560
more.

803
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,880
Tell us.

804
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,280
So I am writing this variable name.

805
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,120
That means.

806
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,360
But who has that dog in this class

807
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,600
alone now?

808
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,040
Okay, we will create the object
for all of your dogs.

809
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:27,240
So let's start from.

810
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,520
All right,
So tell us about the about the name

811
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,640
of your dog.

812
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,120
I have a bird.

813
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,320
Me or bin.

814
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,360
I need to.

815
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,800
Two birds. Lexi.

816
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,440
So the name of the dog

817
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,240
is mixed.

818
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,920
Okay, so now we are.

819
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,160
I have all got.

820
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,600
Maybe you can try to create objects
out of your your kids.

821
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,840
So in here, guys.

822
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:11,080
So in here we are now actually specifying

823
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,920
how a certain thing looks like, right?

824
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,720
If you see this dog, all the dogs,

825
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,920
they have some kind of names,
they have breed and they have colors.

826
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,320
They have height, age, gender. Right.

827
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:33,040
But when we create an object
out of a class,

828
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,440
we tell the actual physical objects

829
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:52,160
how that thing looks like in real life.

830
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,800
All right, So let's define it
and define more attributes.

831
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,480
So now we are assigning actual

832
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,480
attributes to

833
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,960
the object that we have created
from that class.

834
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:10,840
Okay.

835
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,960
So tell us about the breed of your dog

836
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:20,920
mixed

837
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,960
in the standard American.

838
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:38,160
Okay.

839
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,320
And then, oops,

840
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,680
I should say last dogs dog.

841
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,960
Okay,
so now we have defined the breed as well.

842
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:54,240
Okay.

843
00:51:54,240 --> 00:52:00,120
And then let's define the color,

844
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,520
because there is the owner is female.

845
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,880
There have been color.

846
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,920
Well, what is the color?

847
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,520
I don't know.

848
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:18,560
Black.

849
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,200
Okay.

850
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,880
And then maybe define

851
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,920
the height

852
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,880
to be 2.5 or something.

853
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,640
I need another number.

854
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,920
And does it need to be in order? No.

855
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,920
The manner it does not need to be non

856
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,200
not. It may be ten years.

857
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,920
Okay.

858
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,600
So gender is equal to

859
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,040
and okay.

860
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,480
So have you guys defined all of your dogs
how your dogs look like?

861
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,320
What are their names,
What are their colors?

862
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:16,960
Height and everything.

863
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,240
I know it's my dog

864
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,920
these days you buy in is the thing here.

865
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,040
We went to position number seven,
right with this number

866
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,160
seven or six, I guess in the last week.

867
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,440
I am following along
as I don't have a dog.

868
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,080
It's fine.

869
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,920
It's impolite.

870
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,320
You are also an interpreter.

871
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,320
If we need one for our class,

872
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,840
I can buy two.

873
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:58,440
It did go up 4.5.

874
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:09,120
It even appeared with this.

875
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:14,280
We actually do buy a top.

876
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,160
Oh my God.

877
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,640
How many years you are into crypto

878
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,160
thinking of crypto?

879
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,880
24, seven, five months.

880
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:33,840
And that's why you did this.

881
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,520
I am like a stranger today.

882
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,120
I said we are talking talking
about cryptocurrency again.

883
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,440
That cryptocurrency is built
using programing

884
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,960
where you buy a few by Coinbase not allow.

885
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,240
I know nothing

886
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,600
of the everyday

887
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,040
for those who are new or those who are

888
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,320
in the crypto for one year.

889
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,840
I will suggest to you
to only start with $100

890
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,040
and after one year don't price.

891
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,480
Nothing is going anywhere after one year.

892
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,360
Once you have learned

893
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,080
all of that, do

894
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:23,720
this.

895
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,040
It happens.

896
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,320
All right, guys.

897
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,440
So now we have assigned bad reviews

898
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,560
now where you can get the values
of those attributes.

899
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,960
Why at a public class

900
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:49,920
model,

901
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,560
when you are defining
a class inside a class.

902
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,480
So when you define a class, inside
a class, yes, it is allowed,

903
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,840
but you cannot have two public classes
in a single file.

904
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,080
That's why you are getting an error.

905
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,800
So only one class, only one public class,

906
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,760
but qualified.

907
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,800
So now you have assigned the attributes.

908
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:22,040
You can also print these out.

909
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,000
So let's say I can say

910
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,800
why? What am I

911
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,880
doing wrong?

912
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:14,680
So Maria

913
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,600
and here
make sure that the spellings are correct.

914
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,200
Make sure you don't have color inside
your class.

915
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,560
You have colors variable. So

916
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,000
and both these type of issues
in this portion of

917
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:35,280
the classes there, he will help you out

918
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:36,360
there.

919
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:46,520
Show me my name,
your show me your dog class.

920
00:57:46,520 --> 00:58:18,040
Okay, then let me go to this board

921
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,760
and see

922
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,720
what quickly
you guys can use the other active.

923
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:34,640
We are accessible.

924
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,320
Do you guys see the artwork?

925
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,440
Like I see.

926
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,040
So what we are doing

927
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,760
first we created a class,

928
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,840
then we created an object from that class

929
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,960
we assigned values to the properties

930
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:59,760
and now we are simply accessing
those properties.

931
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,520
Okay, so let's create one more object

932
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,320
out of this same exact dog class.

933
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,880
Okay,
So I will again say the name of the class

934
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,960
and this time
who else Will said that they have a dog

935
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,360
are Well,

936
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:31,480
okay, let's create a

937
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,480
give me you are the next

938
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,720
question.

939
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,960
You are next.

940
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,560
Next. Go with that. Yes.

941
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:47,120
We will create the cat as a next to

942
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,600
give me this dog this time.

943
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,680
Okay so and equal to sign

944
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,760
new favor.

945
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,000
And then again

946
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,200
the name of the class, the parentheses.

947
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:10,760
And in here.

948
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,440
So give me more.

949
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,040
What is the name of your dog?

950
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,960
So give me this dog, not name

951
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,320
I want to get Who can help me do

952
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,840
and then we can see him is

953
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,440
not read

954
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,120
is equal to

955
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,480
or this degree to give me

956
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,400
my dogs

957
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,480
Labrador

958
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,520
and then

959
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,640
I'll okay,

960
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,200
actually let me look you guys

961
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:15,440
the older I am then this should be color
inside instead of colors.

962
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,760
This should be colors. So

963
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,480
I will be so if I

964
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,320
can this color in here,
you guys will notice

965
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,080
that I will get an ETA

966
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:32,480
on line 23 and on line 11.

967
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:32,960
Right.

968
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,240
Because I have changed the name

969
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,040
in in the class
from which I am creating the objects.

970
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,600
Okay.

971
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:44,160
So if you guys don't
want to get these errors,

972
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,680
okay, you can right

973
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:56,800
click on it.

974
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,680
And then there should be an option.

975
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,000
Read that and then rename.

976
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,160
Okay.

977
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,840
And now

978
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,080
I don't know

979
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,880
why that option is not working,
but it will.

980
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,040
It should change

981
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,760
the names

982
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,600
in here automatically

983
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,040
when you change the variable name in here.

984
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,240
Okay, so color is golden,

985
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:38,160
so let me do it manually.

986
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,640
I have 2 seconds of same

987
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,320
clips like me.

988
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,960
No, the XP. I Can

989
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:50,160
you do it again?

990
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:50,440
Okay.

991
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,720
So I have changed because I miss
I misspelled

992
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,040
the color two colors,
so I have changed it back to color.

993
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:03,960
So I change it in here
and then I change it in here and in here.

994
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,400
So every year we are.

995
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,760
I'm using this property in my code.

996
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,600
I have to change that name

997
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:18,400
on all those places.

998
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,840
Should we change it as well? Yes,
you guys should change that.

999
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,600
It will be better.

1000
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:38,680
So instead of colors,
make you guys everywhere, you have.

1001
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,840
Oh yes.

1002
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:43,200
I shouldn't change it in here.

1003
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,600
Okay, now

1004
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:52,880
it's just a just a change of variable.

1005
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,160
Nothing special.

1006
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:10,640
If you guys want,
you can keep it as colors.

1007
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,040
All right, So let me assign more values

1008
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,400
to the attributes. So.

1009
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,520
All right, give me
what is what is the height of your dog

1010
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,480
standing up?

1011
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,520
Yes, you can tell us.

1012
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,400
Standing of height

1013
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:56,960
five feet the last five.

1014
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,840
And then you can have

1015
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,920
it, what,

1016
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,520
five feet

1017
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,000
standing on two legs. I

1018
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,200
so and then gender five years old.

1019
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,360
Okay, so

1020
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,080
is not it if you guys are creating a class

1021
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,280
that grouping of objects of that class

1022
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,760
and assigning the values

1023
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,280
can we combine
object and class in one file?

1024
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,520
Yes, we can do that as well.

1025
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,000
I would show you that at the

1026
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,000
idea.

1027
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,120
Guys done writing the score,
Is it a dog or the

1028
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:15,720
other?

1029
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,600
Let let's try to access these properties
as well.

1030
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,120
Okay.

1031
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,160
Let's start with this property.

1032
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:27,360
Actually, let me let me copy this called

1033
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,360
and instead of alone as dog,

1034
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,640
what I will do, I will replace this object

1035
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:38,840
feature

1036
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,280
mentioned in the class,
but we need to specify all of them.

1037
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,560
No, we don't.

1038
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:46,560
So let's say, for example,
we can and we can only at this age

1039
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,760
we can just age.

1040
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,600
So I am replacing

1041
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,000
the object in here. Okay.

1042
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,960
So once I replace this object,
now I will see all the values

1043
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,760
that are assigned

1044
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,080
using this object.

1045
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:22,960
So if I a security score, So let me know

1046
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,280
if you guys see a different output
or if you don't see the output

1047
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,640
that you have assigned in here
ordered a change.

1048
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,680
So I copied this call from here

1049
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:51,200
and then I change the object in here.

1050
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,440
So this is a class we had.

1051
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,280
We define the properties.

1052
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,560
This is where
and this is how we create an object

1053
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:07,600
and this is how we assign the values
to the

1054
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,560
to those properties.

1055
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,960
Previously we were calling variable.

1056
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,280
Now we call object.

1057
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,160
So you get that

1058
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:23,520
if yes, we we use

1059
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,400
this terminology interchangeably, but

1060
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:32,760
when the data type is a primitive,

1061
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,840
we call it a variable.

1062
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:40,080
When the data type is a class

1063
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,880
we create, we call it

1064
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,960
an object.

1065
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,920
Okay, if you want to be more specific,
but you can use it interchangeably,

1066
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,760
your also fine.

1067
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,720
It did not print the I and T

1068
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,600
because I removed that
I didn't assign the value.

1069
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,600
And if you guys tried to print
the value of edge,

1070
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,880
you will be getting the default value.

1071
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,560
So what is the default
value of an integer variable?

1072
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,160
Right.

1073
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,920
If I don't assign a value to the integer
if there's zero,

1074
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:23,360
so do you guys will be getting a zero.

1075
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,640
Okay, let's last it

1076
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,400
this last dogfighter

1077
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:33,960
out of a negotiation.

1078
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:38,840
So again,
name of the class that I still forget.

1079
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,920
We have to create a separate class. Okay.

1080
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,680
Although a lot of the features
they are similar in cats and dogs.

1081
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,440
Okay.

1082
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:52,640
But logically
we should be creating a different forget.

1083
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,960
Okay. Yes.

1084
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,120
There are a lot of features
which are common in cats and dogs,

1085
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,640
but there are differences as that.

1086
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:07,080
Okay, me?

1087
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:12,720
Yes, and all combined.

1088
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:14,920
So again, how do I create an object?

1089
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,720
I write the name of the class, right?

1090
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,680
And you name

1091
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,960
for that class.

1092
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,880
Okay.

1093
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,680
And then equal cosine, then new keyword

1094
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,480
and then

1095
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,880
these parenthesis and

1096
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,880
moreover,
what is the name of their dog books?

1097
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,960
Not Name

1098
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,360
Melanie for gender.

1099
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,800
You missing

1100
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,440
in any of the classes?

1101
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:04,440
They had an escort and a post posting.

1102
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,040
This person

1103
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,640
or mandrill,

1104
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,000
If I am pronouncing it right,

1105
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,000
it and let's say

1106
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,480
we are now we want to define

1107
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,080
only only this name property.

1108
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,360
Okay, so we got we can also do this.

1109
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,560
Define one property.

1110
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,400
All of the property is

1111
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,160
50% of the properties.

1112
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,240
So it's all possible. Okay.

1113
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,600
And now we can print this out,

1114
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,680
not spell

1115
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:55,880
our first name, and

1116
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:14,800
we'll get

1117
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,480
you have to use this name as

1118
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,520
like this.

1119
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,000
Okay.

1120
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,040
No duplicates here, guys.

1121
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,040
Only love.

1122
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:49,160
Well, all.

1123
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:49,480
All right,

1124
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:54,320
So now let's try to

1125
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,640
let's try to create a class for cars,
okay?

1126
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,160
Because dogs and cats,
they are very similar.

1127
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,400
So I want to give you a different example.

1128
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,840
So this time next year,
let's try to create a car class.

1129
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,360
Okay.

1130
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,040
So are you guys done writing this code?

1131
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,200
Can you print all of them?

1132
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,800
Yes, we can print all of them.

1133
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,320
If you want.

1134
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,840
You can just print out statements

1135
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,360
just adding plus

1136
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,800
then we debug the dog.

1137
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:44,760
Yes, we can debug the dog.

1138
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,080
Okay, so let me get

1139
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,480
a class

1140
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,000
and let's call it a car.

1141
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:13,840
Okay.

1142
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,840
Everything works.

1143
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,600
That's great.

1144
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,080
All our guys tell me about

1145
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,240
some properties of cars,

1146
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,360
some features of car cars

1147
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:30,080
make model right so we can have the make

1148
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,880
or we can have an auto

1149
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,160
part again.

1150
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,680
Woops.

1151
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:46,720
Or you can have a color.

1152
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:51,160
We can have an easier right and easier

1153
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,040
for fast and furious

1154
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:09,520
country mileage.

1155
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:09,960
Yeah.

1156
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,160
So So these are some of the properties

1157
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,200
so sorry for the.

1158
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:18,920
All right

1159
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:23,320
so these are some of the properties
that that cars cars have.

1160
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,160
Yes. In our real life cars,
they have a lot of properties,

1161
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:30,000
but we will not be going
through all of those properties.

1162
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,560
Okay.

1163
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:36,720
We are
we are keeping these examples very simple.

1164
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,560
So this time let's create

1165
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,120
the main method
and the object inside the same class.

1166
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:46,400
Okay.

1167
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,720
So if you want to do that,
you have to define the mean method.

1168
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,720
Okay, so you write main,

1169
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:56,080
then you hit control and space,

1170
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,400
and then you should write the main
method for you.

1171
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,600
Are you guys able to write the main
method using the shortcut

1172
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,200
and just write mean any and mean

1173
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,360
and then hit control plus space

1174
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,040
or typing manually.

1175
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,160
If it is not working for you, write
it manually

1176
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,120
formatted command

1177
01:16:45,120 --> 01:17:01,120
plus space.

1178
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,960
All right.

1179
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:08,040
So now you guys will tell me how can I
create the object from this car class?

1180
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,720
So the main method now stays there
or could go up?

1181
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,800
Yes, you guys can use that.

1182
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,080
You can write this
main method in here as well if you like.

1183
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:17,880
Okay.

1184
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,640
But it is a common practice to foster

1185
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,480
define the attributes
and then by the matters.

1186
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,200
Okay.

1187
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:41,760
So we will be following that convention.

1188
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:42,680
All right.

1189
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,520
So you said common plus space

1190
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,680
command plus space,

1191
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:54,600
but the attribute should not be inside
the method.

1192
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,040
Yes. The attributes should
not be inside the method

1193
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,720
bar not make.

1194
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,760
So no, it's not correct.

1195
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:11,520
I am asking you,
how can create object of this class.

1196
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,480
So for the hard you are close

1197
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:20,000
but not correct here with Aleksey.

1198
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
So God I shall ask God

1199
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,680
then equal to sign nil keyword.

1200
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,200
And then again name of the class
but with parentheses.

1201
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:36,000
Right.

1202
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,720
Okay.

1203
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:39,960
Please explain.

1204
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,640
What does main method is in this content?

1205
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,760
Nabeel This main method is in

1206
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,280
behavior in this class.

1207
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:58,360
Okay, so this is how we define behavior.

1208
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,120
The next after the break
I will teach you how to write a behavior

1209
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,880
in a class as

1210
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,040
All right,

1211
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,080
So I write the name of the class.

1212
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,800
All right?

1213
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,720
And then

1214
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,120
I just start

1215
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,080
is equal to nil.

1216
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,440
And are we doing two in one file?

1217
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,720
Yes, All one.
This is what you were asking of you.

1218
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,040
How to define

1219
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,040
a class and how to clear the objects
inside the same class.

1220
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:41,520
Okay.

1221
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,560
So you guys can create objects
inside the same class

1222
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:48,040
by having the main method
in the same class.

1223
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,040
Or you can create a new class
and then you can define the attributes,

1224
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,240
You can define the objects.

1225
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,800
But remember that this
this approach is better approach.

1226
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,120
This is how you will be doing it
in real life

1227
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:01,920
work.

1228
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:07,320
This is also possible.

1229
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,720
We just combined two classes.

1230
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,320
No, we didn't combine two classes and

1231
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,720
we are creating the objects of a class

1232
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:22,360
inside this same class.

1233
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,680
It looks like just a scanner.

1234
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:27,680
It's not like a scanner.

1235
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,560
A running scanner is a separate class.

1236
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:34,200
So this example looks like
a scan of the dogs.

1237
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:34,720
Example

1238
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,440
Odd dream

1239
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:43,000
God, new pod.

1240
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,840
Here we have the main
method at the bottom of our class.

1241
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,080
Yes, it's a good practice
to have the main method at the bottom,

1242
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:51,160
but you guys can have many method at.

1243
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,800
The top as the

1244
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,360
our shots are

1245
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:06,360
not made.

1246
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,120
Is that slow, let's say.

1247
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:11,880
Okay.

1248
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:19,640
And the model is

1249
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:30,000
more or less.

1250
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,920
Can I borrow your.

1251
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,880
You guys now know how to create
jobs, airplanes, anything.

1252
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,120
You guys can create anything.

1253
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,520
Not using programing

1254
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,320
color

1255
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,440
is the same

1256
01:21:49,800 --> 01:22:04,840
as say

1257
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,960
I am only defining these properties
in here

1258
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:12,720
on the edge.

1259
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:18,720
Are we for girls?

1260
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:22,520
And then I can
I can define and print out is value.

1261
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:37,960
Okay. And

1262
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,400
and we can have

1263
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,920
any Tesla fighting dog what if.

1264
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,400
Well I don't do nothing
getting a job inside Tesla

1265
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:55,320
and then buying a Tesla. The

1266
01:22:55,680 --> 01:23:01,200
some of the students from previous batches
they got their jobs in Amazon Tesla

1267
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,480
and ended up

1268
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,200
disqualified
from the final interview in Microsoft

1269
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,960
and some of them
they are supplied in Apple and everywhere.

1270
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,960
So if you guys are working hard,

1271
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,680
you guys can go
for many of these companies.

1272
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,920
Oh, by the way, I forgot

1273
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,320
to invite the student from

1274
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,720
from previous badges

1275
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:31,080
so that they can share their experience

1276
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,680
about making this bootcamp and

1277
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:40,040
getting a job
and how they are doing in on their job.

1278
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:44,560
So this Saturday I will
I will to invest in my total

1279
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,360
three students from the previous batch.

1280
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:56,880
My cousin is working for Amazon,
excavated, so this is what they tell me.

1281
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:59,760
So they tell me that

1282
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,640
when I used to tell them
the previous restaurants

1283
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:07,440
that I used to tell them that you guys
will be getting jobs in big companies

1284
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,920
and all that they did.

1285
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,360
They did. They didn't used to believe me.

1286
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:17,200
So I hope that most of you
are from referrals, right?

1287
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:22,120
So you already know someone who took
this bootcamp and who is who has a job.

1288
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:26,880
Now, why didn't I?

1289
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,960
So, Emily, you are not from a referral

1290
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,200
like this.

1291
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:35,720
I am not from that. So.

1292
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,400
So not very.

1293
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,800
I will invite a lot of students
from previous batch.

1294
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,400
One batch is not very

1295
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:48,960
many people were writing a lot of people
or not very.

1296
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,360
I will invite

1297
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,920
ex coworker and it's all being made.

1298
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:59,080
All right. So

1299
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:08,480
I only

1300
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,480
Sebastian is multitalented, but

1301
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,760
so now let's try to execute

1302
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,120
this new software and you guys
should get something like this.

1303
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,800
You guys get this output this

1304
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,600
going to.

1305
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:04,800
Yeah.

1306
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,280
So this is how we the
the objects inside this

1307
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,480
same class.

1308
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:17,680
Is it hard disk,
Is it hard to create a class

1309
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,360
and then object?

1310
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,040
There is no sound coding.

1311
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:27,120
Please turn off.

1312
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:27,600
Okay.

1313
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,800
We will be going on a break Aisha.

1314
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:35,480
And after the break we will define

1315
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,360
how defined the

1316
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,640
behaviors as then

1317
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,880
we when

1318
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:52,160
someone is singing.

1319
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,640
Actually, he is not singing.

1320
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,440
There is a mosque.

1321
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:59,760
Yes. Next to my room.

1322
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,880
Yes. That's
why you guys hear these sounds.

1323
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:04,520
All right, guys.

1324
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,720
So let's have a break

1325
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,840
of 15 meters.

1326
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,520
And after the break,
we will learn how to define data

1327
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:24,240
on behaviors in a class as that.

1328
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,960
And remind me about it.

1329
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,200
You guys hear about why games

1330
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,960
and doping bump from 0.0 to 2.8

1331
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:41,680
and then was named as them. All

1332
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:48,760
our guys remind me about the recording.

1333
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:52,200
Last batch is invited for morning session.

1334
01:27:52,200 --> 01:28:05,080
I will invite them on Saturday or Sunday's
class.

1335
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:05,600
Okay.

1336
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:12,240
All right.

1337
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:17,360
Let me start the game.

1338
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:17,800
Okay.

1339
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:23,920
I have talked to four student
from batch nine and two of them, they

1340
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:26,080
have responded.

1341
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:37,960
They will be joining us on Saturday.

1342
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,840
So seriously.

1343
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,120
Question
If we have object in in the same class,

1344
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:54,320
can we call that class
outside the package?

1345
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,680
If you mean by calling the class
outside of the package,

1346
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:01,680
if you mean creating the objects, yes,
we can do that.

1347
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:08,160
But there is no thing
as calling a class outside the package.

1348
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:12,840
So we create objects of the from the class
and then

1349
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,120
we assign the properties

1350
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:19,800
and we call matters on, on, on an object.

1351
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:30,320
So let me know if this is what you meant.

1352
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,880
So, for example, if your question is

1353
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,160
maybe, let's say in class four,

1354
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:42,200
can I create the object of this car

1355
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:46,760
inside this package
four or package three or this class?

1356
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:47,600
So yes, we can.

1357
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,640
How about the attributes?

1358
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:55,800
Yes, we can do any everything that we are
doing in here, in any of the packages,

1359
01:29:56,160 --> 01:30:03,040
no issues,
getting an object of accessing the fields.

1360
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,120
There are rules.

1361
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,600
Yeah. That we will learn later.

1362
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,040
There are things that

1363
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,120
differ from one package
to another, package

1364
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,440
that we will learn later. But yes, we can.

1365
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:21,120
We can clear the objects
and we can call the methods and properties

1366
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:27,080
for now.

1367
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,520
Sound LLC.

1368
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,120
You don't hear me

1369
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:39,800
already, guys.

1370
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:45,720
So let's try to define some behaviors.

1371
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:51,400
Or what are the things that the cops do.

1372
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:57,320
Then you add like this.

1373
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:04,720
Yes, we can add like this.

1374
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,560
Okay.

1375
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,480
Cars, they can move forward.

1376
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,240
Right?

1377
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,400
So to define guys,

1378
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,640
this is how we define and define behavior.

1379
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,760
So before defining any behavior,

1380
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:20,880
we would write this keyword wide.

1381
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,240
Okay, We define this keyword wide.

1382
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:39,720
Then the name of the behavior,
then parentheses.

1383
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,160
Okay.

1384
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:45,360
And basically, okay,
this is how we define a behavior

1385
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:57,240
and we can clean out for now,
to keep things simple,

1386
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:10,920
I am simply printing out line.

1387
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,840
Wait, what did I miss?

1388
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,080
Can you please repeat that?

1389
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:19,960
Okay, so now we are learning

1390
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,000
how to define

1391
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,200
behaviors as well inside a class.

1392
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,600
Okay, so previously
we learned how to define properties

1393
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:36,840
like attributes, how to define some,
how something looks like.

1394
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:42,200
Now we are defining how that thing
behaves in our real life.

1395
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:47,520
Okay, What what are the things that this
this class can do?

1396
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:52,520
Okay, so to define a behavior or what
that class can do,

1397
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,840
we write this void keyword.

1398
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,400
Okay, then name of the behavior.

1399
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,640
So parents is

1400
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:08,200
opening a bracket, closing bracket,
and then we can write any logic in here.

1401
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:12,240
We can write loops or we can declare at
is pretty much everything

1402
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:15,160
that you guys have learned
you can do inside a method,

1403
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,480
but to keep things simple,
I am simply printing out

1404
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:23,360
a line in here.

1405
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:31,320
Is it clear me now?

1406
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,800
So now we are defining the behavior so

1407
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,960
how we use void Move forward in

1408
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,480
logic. In our logic.

1409
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:49,400
Okay.

1410
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:53,040
What is to defining the behavior
of the class?

1411
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:57,640
Yes, there are two types of behaviors.

1412
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,800
One one.

1413
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,880
One of them
they once they are done behaving,

1414
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,480
they give us the response back.

1415
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,720
Okay?

1416
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:11,280
And the other behaviors,
they don't give us the response back.

1417
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:15,120
So those who don't give us the response
back,

1418
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,960
we use this wall keyword.

1419
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:19,920
The other ones we will learn later.

1420
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,680
Okay, For now,
just focus on how to define it.

1421
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:27,280
Behavior, this word keyword,
what it does, where you should use it.

1422
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:31,560
I will teach you all about that.

1423
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:36,200
Move forward is not a keyword.

1424
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,560
What do you mean by a keyword?

1425
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,200
It is just a name you can give.

1426
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:45,640
You can give this behavior any name. And

1427
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:47,960
have you guys define

1428
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:53,600
just behavior.

1429
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,240
Okay.

1430
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:58,560
So this is how we call this behavior.

1431
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,880
So we write the name of the object.

1432
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,440
So I just off dog.

1433
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,680
No it.

1434
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:10,800
Okay, so dog
and then name and then parentheses.

1435
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:20,880
And now if I execute this code. Yes.

1436
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,240
So I can see God can move forward in here.

1437
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,840
Or maybe can see,

1438
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,160
maybe you can see

1439
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:34,360
moving forward.

1440
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,520
Okay. So God is now moving forward.

1441
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,600
So if I execute it again.

1442
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,200
Okay. Moving forward.

1443
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:45,840
So when when you call this behavior,
so this is what

1444
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,880
we call as calling the methods or,
calling the behavior.

1445
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:53,800
So we write the name of the object, a dog

1446
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:56,720
sign, then name of the behavior.

1447
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:57,520
Okay.

1448
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:01,640
We say that we are calling the move

1449
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:05,040
forward behavior on line 24.

1450
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:07,920
Okay. On the I God object.

1451
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,200
These
these are just some of the terminology.

1452
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:13,840
So I am calling move forward the behavior

1453
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,920
on I shall God object.

1454
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:20,120
But yes, it's monthly monthly.

1455
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:25,440
Write these lines
whatever logic we do so in Java executes

1456
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,960
Java executes from top to bottom, right.

1457
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:35,480
So it will declare this,
it will declare this, this, this.

1458
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:37,120
Then it will print out this.

1459
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:42,080
And once we call the method
Java goes inside this method,

1460
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:47,560
whatever we have written in here, Java
first executes that and then it goes.

1461
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,640
It comes back in here
and then keep on executing whatever

1462
01:36:50,640 --> 01:37:03,000
quotable you have to do.

1463
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:14,360
Do you guys see this output?

1464
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,880
So why is line pull not printed

1465
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,920
non line printed?

1466
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:23,160
You know, this is line ten

1467
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:26,560
moving forward
and I see this line moving forward.

1468
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,440
What do we mean by behavior?

1469
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:36,440
So by behavior mean
what are the things that an object can do.

1470
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,080
Okay so what are

1471
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:44,640
what are the physical actions
that that class, that object can do?

1472
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:49,480
We always
have to call the behavior at the end.

1473
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:52,280
No, you can call the behavior
at the start.

1474
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,720
Like you can call the behavior

1475
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,680
right after declaring the object.

1476
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,120
You can call the behavior multiple times

1477
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:04,200
because we meant was,
is it an action? Yes.

1478
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:06,840
These are actions actually, that all that

1479
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,920
that those objects can perform.

1480
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,240
How many behaviors?

1481
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:14,280
We can write as many as we want.

1482
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,160
And there is a limit of around

1483
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:24,000
65,000 or something like that
for 32 bit systems,

1484
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:28,640
and it's double for 64 bit systems.

1485
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:32,160
So you guys can have thousands
of behaviors, no issues

1486
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:38,680
with that.

1487
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:44,080
Let's ask as many questions as you have.

1488
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:47,920
Is calling a method is like calling
for a subroutine. Yes.

1489
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,240
Maybe in some programing languages,
we call it a subroutine

1490
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,440
in assembly languages

1491
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:57,480
under the
what if I want to add another B of it?

1492
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,880
Yes, you can add another behavior.

1493
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:03,360
So let's say, for example,
I can have a behavior

1494
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,640
apply breaks

1495
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:27,240
if so, we can start it God again.

1496
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,320
We can stop it.

1497
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,800
God, we can move it or God forward.

1498
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,360
We can move where we are backward.

1499
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:37,160
We can apply the brakes,
all of the actions that a car

1500
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:41,480
can do, we can define those behaviors.

1501
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:45,160
Do we have to use the word
for every behavior?

1502
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:49,000
No, we don't have to use word
for every behavior.

1503
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,480
You guys will learn different types
of behavior

1504
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:53,400
later on.

1505
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,120
I ask a question like that.

1506
01:39:56,160 --> 01:40:00,040
You and the behavior
cannot be in many matter.

1507
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:01,880
Yes, it cannot be in main method.

1508
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:06,520
No, We have to be separated like that.

1509
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:06,880
Maryland.

1510
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,920
What do you mean by separated like that?

1511
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,840
You mean these these matters?

1512
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:15,400
They are outside of other methods.

1513
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,760
Can we combine two or more in one?

1514
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:22,960
Yes, we can combine two or more in one.

1515
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:27,360
So for example,
you can call this move forward.

1516
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,720
I don't want to go into these details now

1517
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:34,560
and then can you part of this question
for our two classes.

1518
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,080
But yes, we can do that.

1519
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:40,760
We can combine,
but I don't want to confuse confusion.

1520
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:49,440
That's why let's not go into there.

1521
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:56,320
Any other questions, guys?

1522
01:40:56,320 --> 01:41:17,240
So now I can
I can call the other behavior.

1523
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:17,480
Okay.

1524
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:21,040
We can move it forward, backward.

1525
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:21,920
We can apply it.

1526
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,800
Every method has is on curly
brackets. Yes.

1527
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,960
Every method has its own curly brackets

1528
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,960
and y to know

1529
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:41,400
some other methods,
they will be having something different.

1530
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:44,000
So you're going to see this
man also has this word.

1531
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,240
Okay.

1532
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,840
But there there are other types of methods

1533
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,600
who will be having something different
than the word

1534
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,840
23 and 30 is same

1535
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:59,920
going to be and 30 same.

1536
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,720
Aleksey, can you elaborate a little bit?

1537
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:07,800
What do you mean by same?

1538
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,880
Oh, you mean
I am calling the same behavior again?

1539
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,720
Yes, we can do that.

1540
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:13,640
Yes, we can do that.

1541
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:18,080
I can call in method
109,000 and all restrictions on that.

1542
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:21,360
I can call a method inside the loop

1543
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,960
current one time.

1544
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,760
Oh no, it is not printing one time.

1545
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:33,240
Actually, I have not expanded this output.

1546
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:37,400
So you see moving forward in here
and moving forward again in here,

1547
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:43,440
I want to see the two behavior of syntax
to behavior.

1548
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,640
Syntax

1549
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,280
I What do we mean by two behavior?

1550
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,680
It will not print again and again.

1551
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:51,600
No, it will print again and again

1552
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,160
for you.

1553
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:54,360
You mean this?

1554
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:58,000
You can you can call this behavior

1555
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,040
inside another behavior.

1556
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,520
This is what I meant.

1557
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,760
So you guys can also do this.

1558
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:05,600
So can you guys.

1559
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,880
Now tell me if I execute this move forward
behavior?

1560
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,920
Well, what are what I will see.

1561
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:14,720
So let me command this out.

1562
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:18,400
Let me go mark this out.

1563
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:22,000
So I will see moving forward

1564
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,840
and then I will see apply breaks.

1565
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:30,000
Okay.

1566
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,400
So moving forward and then apply brakes

1567
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,480
if I call this move forward method once.

1568
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:40,920
Okay, So I can change these matters
one method inside another method

1569
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:43,440
and then start another method

1570
01:43:50,320 --> 01:44:05,280
again.

1571
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:05,680
All right.

1572
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:06,440
That's not less.

1573
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:07,600
I don't understand.

1574
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,160
So I like the

1575
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,880
inside this move forward.

1576
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,440
The method we are calling

1577
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:18,840
this apply breaks method.

1578
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:19,560
Okay,

1579
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,800
so the behavior cannot be inside
the main cannot be inside of this method.

1580
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:31,520
So now we are getting the output
moving forward and applying brakes

1581
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:37,000
when we call this move forward method
and index what we are discussing in here.

1582
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,800
So we are calling only mode forward,

1583
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,560
but we are getting both the outputs.

1584
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,240
Okay.

1585
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:49,280
Next, what happens if we call
a method inside and it doesn't matter?

1586
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,920
Yes, we will be doing
many different examples.

1587
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,000
Don't worry about it. Back

1588
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:58,200
then you make separate class for behavior.

1589
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:09,840
Yes, we can make a separate class
or behavior.

1590
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,120
Behavior has its own W brackets.

1591
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:15,560
Can we put the two behavior in one note?

1592
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,480
We cannot go back

1593
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,560
defining method inside
another method is not allowed.

1594
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:24,960
What do we can call a method inside
another method?

1595
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,440
So for example, if I if I copy

1596
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,840
and if I paste it in here,
I will get an error.

1597
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,200
So this is what we call
defining a method inside another method.

1598
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:40,680
This is not allowed, but

1599
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:43,080
we can call a method inside.

1600
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,760
Another method
we cannot define, but we can call.

1601
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,760
And you guys now know what happens
then We call it method inside.

1602
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:56,680
Another method, all those lines of code
that are written inside this apply text.

1603
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:00,320
They will be executed
when you will be calling to move forward.

1604
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,560
So let's do another example

1605
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:07,440
and you guys can keep on
asking the questions if you have any.

1606
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:11,160
So let's

1607
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,080
how did you play?

1608
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:16,000
Did you place apply brakes

1609
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,120
inside the first ward?

1610
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,280
So I just write, I just wrote

1611
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,800
apply Brakes Fantasy and Semicolons.

1612
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,600
Can we create behaviors in one line?

1613
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:33,600
Yes. Or one is possible
using functional programing.

1614
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:37,160
I will show you a little bit
about the functional programing as well.

1615
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:42,080
If we are left with something,
mine is read I up.

1616
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:49,520
Can you share the screenshot?

1617
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,760
But let's create a class.

1618
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:59,000
Okay.

1619
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:08,160
Or let's create a human class.

1620
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,440
Let's stick to the class.

1621
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:14,000
Otherwise we will be confused.

1622
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:14,600
No, don't worry.

1623
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:17,680
Shit, I will not be from now on.

1624
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:23,200
I will not be showing the things
that are not supposed

1625
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:27,240
to be taught in this class
and are planned for the next classes.

1626
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:30,920
What is the difference
in line 13 and 18? Then

1627
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:35,200
we go to line 13

1628
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,440
and line 18.

1629
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:45,440
So Nyah, in here we are defining a method.

1630
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:47,160
Okay.

1631
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:50,280
And in here we are calling it method.

1632
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,880
When we define a method,
we evaluate a piece of logic

1633
01:47:55,640 --> 01:48:00,360
and when call a method
that logic is executed.

1634
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:05,640
So if you only define a method, nothing,
you will see nothing on your consort.

1635
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:09,320
You will only see
the code is only executed

1636
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:13,880
when you call a method
and to call a method inside a class.

1637
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:19,480
We write the name of the method and
these bénin pieces and these semicolon.

1638
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,040
So we don't need to call after main class

1639
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:26,080
or in main class.

1640
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,280
Yes, we can call in the methods
that were nice if this is

1641
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,720
what is confusing you.

1642
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:34,160
So that's why I was not showing you this.

1643
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:35,640
That's why.

1644
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,960
I don't want to show you this.

1645
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:51,120
So let's forget about that.

1646
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:55,440
Why is it printing two times?

1647
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:59,840
Because you you are you are calling
a method inside another method.

1648
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:00,720
Okay.

1649
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:03,440
And then remove that call from here

1650
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:10,920
and you will not see two outputs.

1651
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:14,800
But then there are a remote
that call on line 13.

1652
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:17,640
We move applying braids
and you will not see it again.

1653
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,960
Please explain line 11 and 15

1654
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:27,960
if you can line 11 this one in line
15, this one.

1655
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:30,520
So in here it is.

1656
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:33,840
In here we are defining the behaviors

1657
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:38,240
to define a behavior
we write this word keyword,

1658
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:44,520
name of the behavior, parentheses,
and then curly brackets.

1659
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,400
And inside.

1660
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:50,320
And here we can write
any piece of code, any logic, any loops.

1661
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:55,480
Add is variables, print after anything
that you like to put in here.

1662
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,720
And once you call this behavior,
all that code

1663
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:02,000
will be executed.

1664
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,320
And this is how we call it behavior.

1665
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,520
Is it clear Now, guys,

1666
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:09,960
if you

1667
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:12,520
guys still have questions, please ask.

1668
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:13,760
Don't worry.

1669
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,320
There are no dumb questions.

1670
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:21,720
If things don't make sense at one splice
twice, it's also perfectly fine.

1671
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:26,840
You can ask me to repeat them again.

1672
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:27,840
So this is what happens.

1673
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,200
Guys and

1674
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,120
humans,

1675
01:50:32,240 --> 01:50:34,440
they can not focus

1676
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:37,800
more than 45 minutes.

1677
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:41,400
Okay, So even if you try your best
after four or 5 minutes,

1678
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,960
you will not be able to focus.

1679
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:46,120
So you will be missing
a lot of information.

1680
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:49,120
So you guys can ask me again
if you have missed

1681
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,280
some information,
maybe a part comes in your mind,

1682
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:57,760
maybe something disrupts you,
but make sure that you stop me right here.

1683
01:50:58,160 --> 01:50:58,920
Don't do this.

1684
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:04,200
Let's say, for example, I am explaining
something for the last 15 minutes,

1685
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:10,040
and after 15 minutes you ask me to repeat
whatever I have been doing in 15 minutes.

1686
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:12,360
If something is not clear,
stop me right there.

1687
01:51:12,840 --> 01:51:13,440
Okay?

1688
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:15,480
Or Tell me the line
number which is not behave

1689
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:17,240
that way.

1690
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:20,880
We will not be wasting the times of others
who are paying attention.

1691
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:23,600
I think

1692
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:27,520
word can be if as if

1693
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:34,080
no ward can cannot be effective.

1694
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:40,680
But inside, while
we can have intelligence, no questions.

1695
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:44,280
Now I will have million questions
when I try to do it myself.

1696
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:47,160
So I know you are not following me.

1697
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:58,600
Well, you are only watching, watching me.

1698
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,280
All right. That's good. Yes.

1699
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:03,880
You guys can ask me questions later

1700
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:04,400
on today.

1701
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:07,000
So let's do one more example next.

1702
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,160
So I have created this human class.

1703
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:13,080
Okay?

1704
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:15,920
Now you guys will help me define the

1705
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,640
attributes of humans
and the behaviors of humans.

1706
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:25,200
What is the difference
between method and behavior?

1707
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:29,880
In some places you are method
and in some places be they are same.

1708
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:33,840
Obviously are same.

1709
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,920
Let's make the perfect man then.

1710
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:37,120
That's not possible.

1711
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:41,400
Okay,
let's let's start from simple things.

1712
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:44,040
Like humans, they have names

1713
01:52:53,040 --> 01:53:01,520
and then we can have age.

1714
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,080
We can have

1715
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:10,800
I can wear

1716
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:22,680
you can have all gender.

1717
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:25,280
We can have race and color.

1718
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:28,440
Let's let's not go into these things.

1719
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:34,200
Blood type. Yes.

1720
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:41,160
The type is also an attribute. So

1721
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,720
but like

1722
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,040
many other attributes of humans

1723
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:04,200
LLC, for example,
tell me about the behavior of guys.

1724
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:10,000
What do what do humans do?

1725
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,440
The simplest behaviors, simple behaviors

1726
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:15,320
I thing is coming to my mind,
but I would not bet

1727
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,760
so humans they

1728
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:23,200
they eat right

1729
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:36,680
fight war, cry, study, blah blah, blah.

1730
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:39,560
Okay, so one more thing, guys.

1731
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,640
So this is something that is new.

1732
01:54:41,640 --> 01:54:44,760
Okay, So I again, I can use

1733
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:50,720
an attribute inside
in methods so I can say name

1734
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:00,040
use a lot of

1735
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:04,440
and then I can have

1736
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,320
my sleep

1737
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:19,960
investing wrong

1738
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:27,720
is the name

1739
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:38,520
is me being

1740
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:42,480
we don't need after a while. Yes.

1741
01:55:42,920 --> 01:55:45,960
So this is semicolon Emily.

1742
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:48,920
We near the semicolon

1743
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:51,120
once we end a statement

1744
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,520
and by end a statement, I mean something

1745
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:57,680
that can produce

1746
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,040
an output.

1747
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:01,160
Something that can that

1748
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:05,160
in which we assign something

1749
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:07,600
like, for example,
this assignment operator.

1750
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:09,240
So in here,

1751
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:14,160
when we would define a matter,
we would not need to send out semicolons.

1752
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:17,240
Like, for example,
we don't need to semicolon in here, okay?

1753
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:26,120
Because it's not a statement.

1754
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:27,280
All right, guys.

1755
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:31,600
So then we can have a or

1756
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:42,080
space before needs, right? Yes.

1757
01:56:42,280 --> 01:57:21,880
We are talking in number.

1758
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:22,360
Okay.

1759
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:28,680
So we can use all of the attributes
from our class inside the behavior.

1760
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:33,120
So like I am using name
and here using blood type in here.

1761
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:41,480
Yes. Now let's create

1762
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,960
the human.

1763
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:52,240
Okay.

1764
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:55,720
And in here we will be creating the main
method so I can be gone.

1765
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:59,240
I will take this checkmark

1766
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:17,720
and we open side by side.

1767
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:20,440
So you can you please?

1768
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:21,480
Yes, sure.

1769
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,000
How many of you will be done
with your projects by tomorrow?

1770
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:29,280
Because I am planning
to show you this solution in models

1771
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:36,800
class.

1772
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:39,480
Not here the first part yet.

1773
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,400
We also deadline is 6 p.m.

1774
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:45,240
doing all

1775
01:58:47,200 --> 01:58:48,360
so make sure guys

1776
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:52,360
you complete the project by 6 p.m.

1777
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:58,680
tomorrow because I will be showing
the distribution in the next class.

1778
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:02,520
Some work done, almost done will be done.

1779
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:03,320
All right.

1780
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:20,920
That's great.

1781
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:23,680
We had we had a do
you guys can push it to the gate hub.

1782
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:27,960
Daniel, please go back for a second.

1783
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:31,840
Now, do you want me to go back to the

1784
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:34,800
car class or the class

1785
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:37,800
Human class?

1786
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:40,320
I have opened both of them side by side.

1787
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:54,440
It is the human class.

1788
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:56,000
The last line

1789
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:01,600
is it readable, default?

1790
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,440
Is it readable? Guys

1791
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,960
illustrative of the industry?

1792
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:28,760
It really was intending
to send X student Yes.

1793
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:29,160
Or one.

1794
02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:31,560
You guys have to send the links
in the same text

1795
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,640
that we don't guys want.

1796
02:00:58,640 --> 02:01:00,840
You have this for

1797
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:03,920
since we shared

1798
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:08,040
weird software
field, one member posted it all in one.

1799
02:01:08,280 --> 02:01:10,160
No, everyone should push it.

1800
02:01:10,160 --> 02:01:12,480
I want you to have practice.

1801
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,960
All of you.

1802
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:19,080
I want you guys to have practice
pushing people

1803
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:23,160
to the gear tab.

1804
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:23,880
All right, guys.

1805
02:01:23,880 --> 02:01:28,200
So tell me,
how can I clear the object of human?

1806
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:30,480
Let's say I want to build them on

1807
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:34,080
into using Java.

1808
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,360
I was. I need help pushing.

1809
02:01:36,680 --> 02:01:39,840
If you guys need any help,
you guys can posting this for General

1810
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:47,040
and I was I was wasn't

1811
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:53,160
human
so I will be writing the name of the class

1812
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:57,240
right then the name of the object

1813
02:01:57,240 --> 02:02:01,160
I cannot name anything

1814
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:04,360
than equal to sign then new.

1815
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,200
Right?

1816
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:08,160
And then

1817
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:10,280
again name of the class

1818
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:14,360
and that entity right

1819
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:16,800
then using the object.

1820
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,880
This, this, this.

1821
02:02:18,880 --> 02:02:21,120
Then he throws

1822
02:02:21,120 --> 02:02:22,880
someone, send YouTube videos on.

1823
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:34,920
So don't send a lot about.

1824
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:35,640
All right, guys.

1825
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:39,920
So I will say
I use the name of the object.

1826
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:43,560
Then I can access the property

1827
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:48,960
by writing dog.

1828
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:49,560
Okay?

1829
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,000
And then I can see

1830
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:57,960
someone under

1831
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:01,200
age 16.

1832
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,600
All right.

1833
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:06,880
Good battles about always 16 and

1834
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:15,040
one on the right.

1835
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:17,400
Right is five four,

1836
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:21,480
I guess I it

1837
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:26,640
okay.

1838
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:26,960
Okay.

1839
02:03:28,120 --> 02:03:30,160
So we are building building Miss Universe

1840
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:33,600
in here, right?

1841
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:36,840
And ideal. Ideal

1842
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:39,880
rate for girls.

1843
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:42,520
If 30 if I am not wrong

1844
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,800
and then

1845
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:53,160
I can say it online or

1846
02:03:54,320 --> 02:04:00,440
then the 3030

1847
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:07,200
and then

1848
02:04:07,600 --> 02:04:10,560
I'm on one dog

1849
02:04:11,480 --> 02:04:12,520
blood type

1850
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:18,240
principle to a positive.

1851
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:21,440
So this is how we access the properties

1852
02:04:23,080 --> 02:04:27,840
and if we want to call the behaviors,

1853
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:32,200
then we will save it and got it.

1854
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:35,560
Okay, We can see

1855
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:42,280
when to sleep

1856
02:04:42,720 --> 02:04:46,040
and then, yeah, can you guys now,

1857
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,920
are you guys able to relate this
how we are building

1858
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:54,240
things that exist in real life

1859
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:57,520
using inside our computers?

1860
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:07,160
Can you guys relate these
to things that they make sense?

1861
02:05:07,160 --> 02:05:18,080
And I am about to disappear.

1862
02:05:18,080 --> 02:05:22,040
So other than the appearance,
so we are not touching the appearance

1863
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:25,840
here, other than appearance,
the attributes, the properties,

1864
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:29,640
the behaviors,
we are defining all those things in here,

1865
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:34,280
the appearance is done
with the help of graphic designers,

1866
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:37,800
so they build a character
like, for example, in games,

1867
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,480
they build a character,
then they combine this logic

1868
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:45,640
with that character,
and that's how you see those characters

1869
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:49,680
moving
and behaving and all of those in games

1870
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:52,280
that.

1871
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:55,040
So we will be writing logic
most of the time.

1872
02:05:56,160 --> 02:05:59,240
Can we use loop to connect to all void?

1873
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,240
You mean
can we use a loop to call all the methods

1874
02:06:05,560 --> 02:06:13,040
among?

1875
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:15,720
Yes, we can use a loop, but still

1876
02:06:16,040 --> 02:06:19,320
we have to type the names of the methods.

1877
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:20,000
Okay.

1878
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,880
So the
there is no point of using a loop. Yes.

1879
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:25,920
If you want to call these methods
multiple times,

1880
02:06:26,360 --> 02:06:30,240
then you should use the loop.

1881
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,000
But there isn't.

1882
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,600
There is no mechanism that

1883
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:39,120
you can call all the methods from a class.

1884
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:39,840
Okay.

1885
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:44,960
There is something called as a reflection,

1886
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:48,560
but that is something that we are lost
and we will not be going

1887
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:56,800
to that we will not be learning that.

1888
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:59,520
All right. So do you guys see this output,
Dom or not?

1889
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:04,440
It's a lot of nice sleeping in the blood
type is walking.

1890
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:10,080
So this name that we have used
inside these behaviors.

1891
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:13,520
So this is what is happening.

1892
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:16,440
So we create an object in here.

1893
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:19,080
We assign a name.

1894
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:24,240
So once we assign a name,
this name is actually assigned

1895
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:27,360
to this variable.

1896
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:28,080
Okay?

1897
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:32,280
And wherever
now you will be using this variable.

1898
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:34,640
So let's say, for example,
I use this variable in here.

1899
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:37,920
You will see this name in here.
That's why.

1900
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:41,640
That's why you see this this name

1901
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:43,680
with this output.

1902
02:07:43,680 --> 02:07:45,560
Okay? And it depends on the object.

1903
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:51,400
If you create a different object,
then a separate copy of this class

1904
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:57,360
will be created out of that object and
separate values will be assigned to that.

1905
02:07:57,560 --> 02:08:02,280
Okay, So let's say, for example, if we

1906
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:11,240
if we give ear loops, we do.

1907
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:12,440
Sebastian

1908
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:23,960
So if we create a Sebastian, we use new

1909
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:25,960
and then

1910
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:35,960
Sebastian you also want to be 16 years old

1911
02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:40,760
saying

1912
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:46,200
it's out is always in class.

1913
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:51,720
Are you can put your guitar, you can put
anything to keep things simple.

1914
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:53,920
I am using, I'm using printouts.

1915
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:59,400
You guys can write any logic in here.

1916
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:02,560
I can make word in class pasta.

1917
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:03,840
Yes, you can.

1918
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:06,560
You can make methods in here as well.

1919
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:10,320
This is also class.

1920
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,840
Now we have to create some new means.

1921
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:15,440
Yes. Let's create a standard in here.

1922
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:18,840
Okay.

1923
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:25,000
So. Or

1924
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:28,320
that means

1925
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:31,560
okay.

1926
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:35,720
And in here now we you need

1927
02:09:35,760 --> 02:09:40,400
because Dom or not or the other person,
they may not send any names.

1928
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:40,760
Right.

1929
02:09:40,760 --> 02:09:44,200
So now we can use
and if condition in here we can say if

1930
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:49,320
name la equals

1931
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:57,360
Sebastian,

1932
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:59,760
then only we send

1933
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:14,120
like this.

1934
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:18,520
So this is how you guys can put more
and more logic in here

1935
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:22,760
to define certain specific
behavior for, certain objects.

1936
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:25,440
Okay, so name

1937
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:32,680
and sure,

1938
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:45,200
we like this, right?

1939
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:49,160
It should be a

1940
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:55,680
all looks good now

1941
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:02,600
so human not name.

1942
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:09,560
If it is a question.

1943
02:11:09,560 --> 02:11:10,240
Right. Why? Why?

1944
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:11,880
I'm getting an error

1945
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:27,000
spelling.

1946
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:27,320
Right.

1947
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:31,680
So a lot of you are making spelling
mistakes in the sports channel.

1948
02:11:32,040 --> 02:11:35,280
So this is the reason that you guys
are getting those issues.

1949
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:39,000
And then I can see

1950
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:42,880
in or image

1951
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:47,680
Sebastian 16 years or 1818

1952
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:52,560
like million time

1953
02:11:52,560 --> 02:12:00,280
in my last error.

1954
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:08,600
What about the height?

1955
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:12,600
So sometimes I simply say

1956
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:20,120
extra

1957
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,400
and got

1958
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:28,600
weird.

1959
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,160
Okay, let me guess.

1960
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:33,960
We're wrong from the picture that you have

1961
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:37,320
on your profile.

1962
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:41,040
So it's in kids

1963
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:45,280
eight is more than 80,

1964
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:48,000
maybe around 400.

1965
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,080
It is

1966
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,080
for 25

1967
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:57,760
and then

1968
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:00,000
not allowed to drink

1969
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:16,400
alcohol.

1970
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,920
Why 100? Could not be.

1971
02:13:18,920 --> 02:13:22,200
You guys can use Elvis as well,

1972
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:24,200
because I am an engineer

1973
02:13:24,200 --> 02:13:27,680
and engineers, they use different systems.

1974
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:33,520
So that's why my my units, they
they will be different always.

1975
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:35,680
I will be using kilometers far distance.

1976
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:40,440
And then kids are weird normal systems.

1977
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:41,680
You mean

1978
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:47,640
there was this joke
that it'll take 40 years

1979
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:51,880
for the person to be an engineer,
and once he's an engineer, he can.

1980
02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:55,200
He can never be a person again, human

1981
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:58,440
again, not age.

1982
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:00,040
It should be

1983
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,200
like I

1984
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:11,720
mean, and guys, if I.

1985
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:14,400
If I call this send means on someone. Now

1986
02:14:15,800 --> 02:14:18,040
what will happen,
What are what I will get days

1987
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:23,160
then work it to LP.

1988
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:25,440
Yes you guys can define different
different things.

1989
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:28,920
You can have another property
in which you will be defining the

1990
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:31,200
and the eunuchs.

1991
02:14:31,200 --> 02:14:33,080
Okay. Nothing.

1992
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:41,520
And what if I call this
method on Sebastian object?

1993
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:47,120
So if I execute this, it will say

1994
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:50,720
sending me.

1995
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:53,640
So let me let me looking

1996
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,360
out these methods with

1997
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:17,640
so we see on the left

1998
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:31,360
me putting out some training so
that you can really differentiate in here.

1999
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:35,680
Okay so all the outputs for Sebastian,
all the outputs.

2000
02:15:35,680 --> 02:15:36,320
Okay.

2001
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:41,600
So this is how you define real life kings
in computers using programing.

2002
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:43,320
Can you roll it down?

2003
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:47,480
I want take notes, please. In.

2004
02:15:47,680 --> 02:15:49,440
You mean this class cities?

2005
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:55,080
This one.

2006
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:57,080
Is it better now

2007
02:16:02,280 --> 02:16:02,840
let me know

2008
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:06,560
if you guys have any questions
or something.

2009
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:09,200
Is not working out getting any errors.

2010
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:13,800
So whatever is before
the sunbeams gets into

2011
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:17,280
whatever is did before? No, no, no.

2012
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,400
Because We are calling these matters.

2013
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:22,280
That's why it is being printed.

2014
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:27,640
Sebastian is sleeping years a lot older
because we have all these methods.

2015
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:30,120
That's why we see them.

2016
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:34,640
I'll put into fast system dart out
How fast?

2017
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:37,200
What do you mean?

2018
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:41,200
You to print at the speed of 247 means

2019
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:43,000
flock.

2020
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,360
Now can you elaborate a little bit?

2021
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:48,360
What what do you want to ask about
send means

2022
02:16:54,600 --> 02:16:58,480
six out control plus space or

2023
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:02,120
so Alexi You mean how to type it fast

2024
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:05,640
and really.

2025
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:06,320
Oh yeah.

2026
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:11,680
So you can type S out
and then you can use control plus space.

2027
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:18,000
I may ask how do you use send means?

2028
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,440
I am calling this
to send me in here partner

2029
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:24,200
on the Sebastian object and on this

2030
02:17:24,600 --> 02:17:28,320
and inside this send means I written some

2031
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:30,920
extra logic.

2032
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:38,040
That logic is checking
if the name of the object is Sebastian.

2033
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:40,600
Then only print out sending means

2034
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,520
why If does not play into Sebastian

2035
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:52,360
is because of the.

2036
02:17:52,360 --> 02:17:55,840
Let me check if you have used the

2037
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:58,520
it is printing.

2038
02:17:58,520 --> 02:18:00,120
Sending means

2039
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:04,400
it is printing to sending means

2040
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:06,160
on on on the console.

2041
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:08,680
The last line is saying sending means

2042
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:11,760
that he

2043
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:16,200
means

2044
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:18,520
Elena.

2045
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:20,640
But what I you always get at is

2046
02:18:22,680 --> 02:18:26,120
com load plus 11 human log log

2047
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:32,840
not to any the complete error.

2048
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:37,680
I don't know it's one it's fine
you will get used to it

2049
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:40,720
Lloyd

2050
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:45,880
all because you are missing

2051
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:51,080
that closing bracket
Melanie online 20 after the semicolon

2052
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:55,920
you see in here after this log
I have this closing calibrator.

2053
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:58,360
Then I am typing the next method.

2054
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:04,400
Okay, then that's why you are getting that
that why the name it didn't print

2055
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:08,480
or the name it

2056
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:14,600
must have our because we are not
using them in any print out statements.

2057
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:18,280
We are not using them in any method that
that's why they are not being printed.

2058
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:22,000
If you want to print you can,
you can write this out and then can look

2059
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:26,880
at those attributes in there
and then they will be printed out

2060
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:29,880
maybe in another package.

2061
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:32,160
Yes, we will do that.

2062
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:34,280
Other permitting look, not now.

2063
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:38,840
Why sending names printed 11

2064
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:42,440
Sending this printed first.

2065
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:45,120
It is not printed first Silva.

2066
02:19:45,720 --> 02:19:48,840
It is printed at the last same sequence

2067
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:57,280
as I am
keeping as I am calling these methods.

2068
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:00,920
Oh, because you are calling it first,
you see online,

2069
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:05,280
it's line 30, I guess you are calling this
and the means first.

2070
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:09,600
Next slide is being printed net
plus if you call this at the last

2071
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:13,640
like me after these three calls,
then you will be seeing cannot last.

2072
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:16,200
My Sebastian,

2073
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:24,080
don't print.

2074
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:26,320
Oh because you are not calling the methods

2075
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:30,840
and see you are not calling the meters
silver.

2076
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:33,800
Is it clear like Z and silver?

2077
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:35,920
Is it clear now

2078
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:44,840
that if there are other questions,

2079
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:57,240
please ask.

2080
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:58,560
These are

2081
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,960
some things
that you guys will be using a lot.

2082
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:05,960
So I want
I want every one of you to be super clear

2083
02:21:05,960 --> 02:21:09,600
on these things. Why,

2084
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:13,160
yes, that's a

2085
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:14,560
good idea.

2086
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:18,960
To recap
why it is not printing age weird and high.

2087
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:22,920
So Farhad, it's not printing it
and high again, all that

2088
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:28,920
because neither we have use this age
or height or anything inside this method,

2089
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:33,680
nor we are using any printouts in the
in the main method.

2090
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,400
That's why I would not see them.

2091
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:43,680
So let's say if you want to printout the
it right, So either you have to

2092
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:46,920
write a printout in here,

2093
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:49,760
then you have to write Sebastian

2094
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:53,520
not age,

2095
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:58,880
then you will see it,
then you will see it.

2096
02:21:59,440 --> 02:22:05,480
Or you have to put this image in here
inside some of these methods.

2097
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:07,480
Then it be printed out.

2098
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,080
Why? It's like, and I need them

2099
02:22:11,080 --> 02:22:14,560
in this plan, but hard, silly

2100
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:17,040
standing means is not printing

2101
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:28,440
in my console.

2102
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:32,760
If name is

2103
02:22:36,200 --> 02:22:38,280
equals Sebastian.

2104
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:44,480
So your s he not your s is capital

2105
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:48,920
on line 21 inside the main method,
but the s

2106
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:52,880
inside of your method online 25 is a law s

2107
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:57,040
so the Java is case sensitive.

2108
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:59,520
Make sure you guys are using

2109
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:03,680
same cases in your methods

2110
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,400
and in your
when you are defining something

2111
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:11,000
and when you are assigning something,
let me know if it.

2112
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,640
Let's make sure that

2113
02:23:13,960 --> 02:23:18,000
the s in here and the s in here.

2114
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:19,640
They are same

2115
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:24,560
same here, same here.

2116
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:25,920
So I love you guys.

2117
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:29,400
Please make sure that the spellings
and then the syllabus change.

2118
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:33,080
They have same
and let me know if it's if it is also

2119
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:36,280
the issue.

2120
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:39,000
Yes, we can print

2121
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,440
it out in separate system of all together.

2122
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:46,240
Yes, we can print it out
and all together on different

2123
02:23:46,840 --> 02:23:49,320
I am confused output on

2124
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:54,360
console is printing to the object tab
or class tab so you'll get to the output

2125
02:23:54,520 --> 02:23:58,360
being printed from this main method.

2126
02:23:58,480 --> 02:23:59,040
Okay. We are.

2127
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:04,160
We are calling these matters,
but how that output will look like

2128
02:24:04,600 --> 02:24:07,240
it is defined inside this class.

2129
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:12,840
Okay.

2130
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:16,520
You can start typing
the name press control space

2131
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:21,920
and it looks all clear to create a class
and then all that property will be here.

2132
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:25,640
We are just wondering
how will we use these in our programs?

2133
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:27,640
So, Ammad,

2134
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:33,000
you guys will be combining all the logics,
using these classes.

2135
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,400
So you remember back to scanner class

2136
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:39,120
that scanner class has specific
behaviors, right?

2137
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:41,760
And you use that scanner class
for taking pictures

2138
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:44,200
of the input booleans as the input.

2139
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:48,000
Other things you write the matters.

2140
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:53,520
So you develop these to these small units
in the form of letters.

2141
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:56,160
You write logic in pieces.

2142
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:59,160
You combine those pieces

2143
02:24:59,160 --> 02:25:02,600
in a logical entity
that is called a class.

2144
02:25:03,480 --> 02:25:05,520
You declare some variables

2145
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:08,840
called as properties, hold

2146
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:11,280
some values inside the class.

2147
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:15,600
Then you build this a unit of class,
you build

2148
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,160
objects out of that class
and you use in your code.

2149
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:26,520
I guess it's a way of grouping
those smaller pieces first,

2150
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:31,680
dividing the task into smaller pieces,
writing the code for smaller pieces,

2151
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:36,040
then logically combining them
so that you guys can remember

2152
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:39,440
easily can organize your code easily

2153
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:42,720
inside big classes and use that.

2154
02:25:42,920 --> 02:25:46,760
And those logics,
those features, properties and matters

2155
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:51,480
by creating the objects and then calling
those methods of properties.

2156
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:57,840
So if you guys,
if you guys want to see a real life

2157
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:02,160
example of how you can use these classes.

2158
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:06,480
So I will suggest you to look at that
standard class

2159
02:26:06,480 --> 02:26:09,240
because you guys are already familiar
with the scanner class.

2160
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:15,040
So if you, if

2161
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:20,360
you type this.

2162
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:30,120
Yeah.

2163
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:31,440
Okay. So

2164
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:33,760
it's systematic.

2165
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:37,560
Okay, registration purposes,

2166
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:42,920
if we have upper or lower class,
is it going to give an error?

2167
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:44,160
Yes, it will.

2168
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:46,920
It not it will not give you an error,
but it will not work.

2169
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:51,680
So we write on main method
and we print on class, right?

2170
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:56,840
We call inside the method
and we define inside the class.

2171
02:26:57,240 --> 02:26:59,840
These are the proper terminologies.

2172
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:02,800
I think we will understand
when we need to use that logic.

2173
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:05,080
You guys will understand
next 3 to 4 classes.

2174
02:27:05,080 --> 02:27:06,200
Don't worry about that.

2175
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:09,120
Is it possible to create class inside
another class?

2176
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:10,880
Yes, So we can do that.

2177
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:14,000
But I will not be showing you that
right now.

2178
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,520
So, guys, this scanner is also a class.

2179
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:22,360
So what you guys have been doing,
you guys have been creating the objects

2180
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:26,160
of, this kind of class and then calling

2181
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:29,480
different behaviors on this kind of class.

2182
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:34,160
So if you want to check
how those behaviors are defined,

2183
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:37,080
you can hold down your control button

2184
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:41,600
on your keyboard
and you can click on this class.

2185
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:44,720
If You do. So

2186
02:27:45,560 --> 02:27:47,760
Eclipse will Eclipse will take you

2187
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:51,360
inside this scanner class.

2188
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:53,600
Okay, we are that class is defined.

2189
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:58,880
So hold it on your control
and then click on scanner

2190
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:01,720
the name of the class

2191
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:03,760
and me know if you guys

2192
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:06,600
see this class or not.

2193
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:09,080
Now I am showing you
the real life examples

2194
02:28:11,800 --> 02:28:12,480
ordered down

2195
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:16,400
your hold on your control
or command button.

2196
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:20,040
If you are on the Mac and click on
with your mouse

2197
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:23,920
right on it. No.

2198
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:28,680
Amid these classes they are written
by Java guys and they are read only.

2199
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:36,960
You cannot change them.

2200
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:55,200
Let me know once you guys see this class.

2201
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:58,800
So yes.

2202
02:28:58,840 --> 02:29:01,080
So you guys will see a lot of errors.

2203
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:05,360
You guys will learn
almost about all of these killers.

2204
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:08,640
Okay, So don't worry about them.

2205
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:12,040
So just focus on
this name of the class, okay?

2206
02:29:12,640 --> 02:29:16,360
And then you guys will see
we are declaring many,

2207
02:29:16,360 --> 02:29:19,000
many variables in here match

2208
02:29:19,440 --> 02:29:22,720
integers, backgrounds, settings.

2209
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:25,480
All of these are properties. Okay?

2210
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:29,360
All of these are properties right
click and choose work.

2211
02:29:30,040 --> 02:29:32,240
Just just clicked in displayed on it.

2212
02:29:32,360 --> 02:29:33,080
Just click on it.

2213
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:36,320
Hold on your control and just click on it.

2214
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:46,640
Next. Yes.

2215
02:29:47,480 --> 02:29:49,800
So it is the left control plus left with.

2216
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:52,800
It's not for looking for any

2217
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:55,200
go back and do from previous.

2218
02:29:55,920 --> 02:30:00,280
Yes so So Eve, let me close this class.

2219
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:03,800
If I hold down my control, see it changes

2220
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:06,000
to this hand kind of icon.

2221
02:30:07,080 --> 02:30:07,280
Okay.

2222
02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:10,640
If I if I take my miles,
if I take my pointer

2223
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:13,440
to the name of the class, it it to this

2224
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:17,680
blue color
and it changes it to this hand like icon.

2225
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:19,800
Once you see this.

2226
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:21,160
Yes. Left click on it.

2227
02:30:21,160 --> 02:30:23,760
That's it.

2228
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:27,960
Control Netflix.

2229
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:36,000
Does it work now? Yes.

2230
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,080
You can do the same with human class.

2231
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:40,440
Any other class.

2232
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:42,600
But they know it's still not working.

2233
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:45,040
So if it is still not working,

2234
02:30:46,440 --> 02:30:49,080
I want you
to right click on your name of the class.

2235
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:50,840
Looks like those

2236
02:30:51,240 --> 02:30:54,680
If it is still not working
right, click on the name of your class

2237
02:30:55,960 --> 02:31:01,240
and then click on this open declaration.

2238
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:04,760
Okay, Right click on the name

2239
02:31:04,760 --> 02:31:07,800
of your class
and click on Open Declaration.

2240
02:31:07,800 --> 02:31:10,320
And you guys also see
the shortcut to S3 for me.

2241
02:31:11,160 --> 02:31:21,560
So you can click on
you can click F3 as the.

2242
02:31:21,560 --> 02:31:22,080
All right.

2243
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:24,800
I hope everyone, everyone now see

2244
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:27,840
saw not not found.

2245
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:30,760
I said please post in this portion of what

2246
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:38,280
will help you out.

2247
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:40,120
Same here.

2248
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:41,000
It's fine. Okay.

2249
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:46,000
You guys just that's just like,
okay, you guys can visit it later.

2250
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:57,800
Yeah.

2251
02:31:57,800 --> 02:32:00,400
So you're going to have to attach
the sources.

2252
02:32:00,760 --> 02:32:04,280
You can click on attach sauces
and then you have the, the diary,

2253
02:32:04,280 --> 02:32:06,360
and then you guys will be able to see it.

2254
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:08,840
Okay. Georgiadis, this should be attached.

2255
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,360
You can post in the sport journal,

2256
02:32:10,360 --> 02:32:13,640
the class will show you
how to address that but did find nice.

2257
02:32:13,640 --> 02:32:16,080
Just just watch or just walk in here.
Okay.

2258
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:19,600
So this is this of class.

2259
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:23,320
Okay. And in here these are

2260
02:32:24,280 --> 02:32:27,640
the properties, all the properties
you guys see

2261
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:31,200
all the properties
are defined in here by Javabayes.

2262
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:36,560
But this is how when you guys
will be solving a real life problem,

2263
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,320
you will be logically first

2264
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:44,440
dividing that problem
into different parts.

2265
02:32:45,160 --> 02:32:47,520
Each block will be a class.

2266
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:50,000
Inside of that class,
You guys will further

2267
02:32:50,120 --> 02:32:53,200
divide
that problem into different behaviors.

2268
02:32:54,360 --> 02:32:57,480
These properties,
they will hold values for you.

2269
02:32:57,480 --> 02:33:02,400
So for example, you see in
we are holding Ben closed is fas

2270
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:06,560
blah blah blah null.

2271
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:08,560
So don't click anything.

2272
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:11,040
Marla Just, just, just follow me.

2273
02:33:11,560 --> 02:33:13,080
Just walk in here.

2274
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:17,480
So that's how you will be defining
different properties.

2275
02:33:17,880 --> 02:33:22,000
Then you guys will be defining
the behavior.

2276
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:26,480
Okay, So still properties, properties,
so many properties.

2277
02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:29,360
Okay, Now don't be scared.

2278
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:32,680
You guys will understand all of this.

2279
02:33:32,680 --> 02:33:36,840
So you see, this is how you guys are able

2280
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:39,480
to be to be input

2281
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:43,960
from your keyboard
by just writing the two lines of code.

2282
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:49,800
Someone Else has written
thousands of lines and very complex

2283
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:52,800
logics to make it happen.

2284
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:53,520
Okay.

2285
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:59,640
To be able to get the input
from the keyword and all that logic.

2286
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:04,440
All that code is first group
in the form of a class.

2287
02:34:04,440 --> 02:34:06,880
They have given a name scanner
to that class.

2288
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:10,000
Then they grouped all those logics

2289
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:14,880
inside different methods,
betters, behavior, like for example,

2290
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:19,680
if you have to take an integer output
an integer input from the keyword, right?

2291
02:34:19,880 --> 02:34:23,000
So you guys will find you see

2292
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:26,280
all of this logic, all of this logic.

2293
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:28,800
And inside

2294
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:30,960
a class, inside this class there are

2295
02:34:32,240 --> 02:34:35,520
2000 hundred and 18 lines of code.

2296
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:36,160
Okay?

2297
02:34:37,120 --> 02:34:41,280
And you guys can see
you can take next decimal in here

2298
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:44,280
and let me find out

2299
02:34:44,280 --> 02:35:01,560
the next integer for you.

2300
02:35:01,560 --> 02:35:04,320
So here is your method.

2301
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:07,000
So you get this next input.

2302
02:35:07,080 --> 02:35:09,720
You have only 138
lines of code first, then

2303
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:12,480
let's make sure

2304
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:15,880
you are inside the scanner class

2305
02:35:15,880 --> 02:35:18,360
that is defined inside the JDK.

2306
02:35:18,920 --> 02:35:22,920
Please do not scare us.

2307
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:27,000
Who asked this question that that's
how we will be building the classes.

2308
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:29,640
You guys please blame that That student.

2309
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:30,120
Okay.

2310
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:34,240
Don't blame me.

2311
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:38,520
So this is the logic

2312
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:42,720
to take
the integer inputs from the keyboard.

2313
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:43,320
Okay.

2314
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:46,280
And you call this method next integer.

2315
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:51,480
You create the scanner object,
you call this scanner dot next and.

2316
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:55,680
And that's
how with the help of this logic,

2317
02:35:55,680 --> 02:35:58,680
you guys are able to take the input
from the keyboard.

2318
02:35:58,680 --> 02:36:03,200
Now, all of the logic has been inside
this next integer method.

2319
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:08,160
If you have to take a boolean, you have a
you have a separate method.

2320
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:14,040
Okay, So let's say, for example,
and someone has written a lot before to

2321
02:36:15,240 --> 02:36:17,680
let me find it next

2322
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:23,520
boolean.

2323
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:27,040
Okay, here is the next boolean.

2324
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:32,440
So again, someone has written some for me
inside different

2325
02:36:32,440 --> 02:36:37,040
different methods dividing the problem
further and divide and conquer.

2326
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:37,640
Okay.

2327
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:40,320
And then they have written different
different logics.

2328
02:36:40,680 --> 02:36:43,200
So right now we have learned a very simple

2329
02:36:44,600 --> 02:36:46,680
way of creating a class

2330
02:36:46,680 --> 02:36:50,400
and then defining a logic and,
then having a properties.

2331
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:54,880
But I explicitly went
I intentionally ran to.

2332
02:36:54,920 --> 02:36:59,840
So you used those examples,
those simple examples.

2333
02:36:59,840 --> 02:37:01,240
But this is the goal.

2334
02:37:01,240 --> 02:37:03,960
This is what we will be doing
with the help of classes.

2335
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:07,480
This is how you guys
will be building your frameworks.

2336
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:08,640
Okay?

2337
02:37:08,640 --> 02:37:14,120
If You have to open a browser,
you will define a class, you will say open

2338
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:17,400
browser class,
you will define a method, open Chrome,

2339
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:20,480
open Firefox, open it, i.e.

2340
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:22,320
Inside these

2341
02:37:22,320 --> 02:37:24,800
methods you will write logic
to open and Google Chrome.

2342
02:37:25,360 --> 02:37:29,400
Then you will write a method
to move to a specific website.

2343
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:32,160
You will write a method
to click on different different buttons,

2344
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:34,920
getting the output interacting
with that side.

2345
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:39,560
That's how you guys will be building
your name books.

2346
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:42,920
Yeah. So it's just a stock.

2347
02:37:42,920 --> 02:37:45,880
Is it clear
how you guys will be using these classes,

2348
02:37:45,880 --> 02:37:48,840
methods, properties

2349
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:53,960
and so, so

2350
02:37:57,480 --> 02:37:58,360
don't worry,

2351
02:37:58,360 --> 02:38:01,560
you guys will start building
your framework after selenium.

2352
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:06,480
So if just one month, then you please
show us again how to go in again

2353
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:09,560
order to undo defined

2354
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:12,600
command is control S or X control S?

2355
02:38:13,160 --> 02:38:14,160
Yes, I think so.

2356
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:16,240
But my opinion going to blow up.

2357
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:18,120
Don't worry, it will not blow up.

2358
02:38:19,120 --> 02:38:21,200
These are just dramas.

2359
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:25,080
I know.

2360
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:26,840
I did not go there.

2361
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:29,840
One they do work in the

2362
02:38:30,280 --> 02:38:32,400
So you hold down your control

2363
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:34,240
and then press f

2364
02:38:36,880 --> 02:38:39,360
I feel more relaxed today.

2365
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:42,320
Thank you for going slow
and reading our questions.

2366
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:45,160
No, don't worry
if you guys have any other suggestions

2367
02:38:45,800 --> 02:38:48,360
that you want me to do.

2368
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:50,480
You guys can also tell me those ideas

2369
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:54,960
and then I will try to learn concrete
from the next class.

2370
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:59,400
Do other values complain to
or just us and these dramas?

2371
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:03,320
Yes, everyone does knows
the industrial dramas.

2372
02:39:03,720 --> 02:39:04,880
Don't worry

2373
02:39:05,640 --> 02:39:07,080
all Bachi advice.

2374
02:39:07,080 --> 02:39:08,520
They used to tell me who was there.

2375
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:10,320
We are about to jump from the window.

2376
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:14,640
What you have shown us how we will
be able to do that blah, blah, blah.

2377
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:16,560
All of them. They are doing their job now.

2378
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:20,000
So after you press control F,

2379
02:39:20,360 --> 02:39:26,200
then you can type anything
that you want to search for on this file.

2380
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:26,640
Okay.

2381
02:39:26,680 --> 02:39:29,280
And those
who are still unable to get in here,

2382
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:32,000
let me close this.

2383
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:36,560
So there are multiple ways you can right
click on the name of the class.

2384
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:38,720
You can click on Open Declaration,

2385
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:41,880
and then you guys should see

2386
02:39:41,880 --> 02:39:44,240
that class in here

2387
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,200
is not

2388
02:39:52,400 --> 02:39:57,840
complex. Yes,

2389
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,120
I need to place the part.

2390
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:04,040
Yes, you guys need to place
the part of your JRD.

2391
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:08,880
So you remember you guys installed
that in JDK in the start of Java classes.

2392
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:14,760
So so for example, in our in Windows

2393
02:40:19,040 --> 02:40:20,480
and those so

2394
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:27,160
most of you will be having your Java

2395
02:40:32,560 --> 02:40:36,960
inside C inside program files, then Java

2396
02:40:37,800 --> 02:40:45,280
and there you have basically
you have to give this part to the page.

2397
02:40:45,280 --> 02:40:49,640
So here you import scanner just to show us
then that have nothing to do

2398
02:40:49,640 --> 02:40:51,200
with the task of the amount.

2399
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:53,520
Yes. And I, I'm just

2400
02:40:55,240 --> 02:40:56,560
use their standard

2401
02:40:56,560 --> 02:40:59,120
class to show you a real life example.

2402
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:01,920
When I watched that YouTube video today

2403
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:07,080
and the comments out there
that everyone was so happy with the video,

2404
02:41:07,080 --> 02:41:12,480
I thought I was the only one
who didn't look at it.

2405
02:41:12,480 --> 02:41:15,040
Yes, that's true.
Do you understand it now?

2406
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:18,640
So now I want you to go back
and watch that video again.

2407
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:21,360
And now everything will make sense.

2408
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:23,160
Should make sense.

2409
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:25,360
You saw that part. It's not that.

2410
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:32,960
It's all about explaining.

2411
02:41:32,960 --> 02:41:37,040
So we have only the element of blooming.

2412
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:37,640
That's

2413
02:41:41,360 --> 02:41:42,320
what I will be sharing.

2414
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:45,080
B This slide

2415
02:41:46,040 --> 02:41:48,960
and the next ones for the next class.

2416
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:52,080
And I want you to read those slides
before the class

2417
02:41:52,840 --> 02:41:54,400
and I will try to find it easier.

2418
02:41:54,400 --> 02:41:56,520
The videos from next time.

2419
02:41:56,520 --> 02:41:58,800
Okay, I will try to find easier videos

2420
02:42:00,360 --> 02:42:02,000
and we will recap this

2421
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:06,120
class in all those lives in the
in the next class.

2422
02:42:06,120 --> 02:42:08,360
Okay. So don't worry

2423
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:12,000
now. He was moving

2424
02:42:13,600 --> 02:42:15,080
for 10 p.m.

2425
02:42:15,080 --> 02:42:17,280
is the British

2426
02:42:20,320 --> 02:42:21,040
holidays.

2427
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:25,440
If you have any questions
and post in the sports

2428
02:42:25,560 --> 02:42:28,640
channel and

2429
02:42:28,640 --> 02:42:31,440
I will be, make sure you complete

2430
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:34,160
your project before tomorrow's class.

2431
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:37,440
And from now on I will be sharing

2432
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:40,680
videos and slides

2433
02:42:40,680 --> 02:42:41,880
at least

2434
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:46,080
3 to 5 hours before the class,
although I will try to share them

2435
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:49,320
one day before the class and

2436
02:42:50,800 --> 02:42:53,760
try to have a look
at those slides and videos.

2437
02:42:54,040 --> 02:42:56,280
We wish course to get out from this class.

2438
02:42:56,280 --> 02:43:01,360
Yes, from now on, all of you should push
all of the code to the GitHub.

2439
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:04,360
Anyone knows how to look at program

2440
02:43:04,360 --> 02:43:09,440
files on Mac.

2441
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:11,840
So I posted this for dinner.

2442
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:12,960
Maybe a class knows

2443
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:15,640
how to find out that

2444
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:20,560
rule of five.

2445
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:24,440
All our guys
take some of us and exploit it today.

2446
02:43:25,480 --> 02:43:28,640
I see you tomorrow.

2447
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:29,920
Oh yes.

2448
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:31,840
There are hundreds

2449
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:37,160
of yes here are be homeless

2450
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:50,200
let me poster of course announce

2451
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:54,280
I have posted people out

2452
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:57,960
homeworks and equals task one does

2453
02:44:04,040 --> 02:44:05,040
on our guys. Bye.

2454
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:07,200
I take some of this

2455
02:44:09,720 --> 02:44:13,160
and board and push for will do today

2456
02:44:13,480 --> 02:44:16,960
I will be pushing all of the code

2457
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:19,560
now when we start using intelligence

2458
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:22,800
okay I will combine all the code
from all the classes.

2459
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:27,760
I will push it on the Google on GitHub,
and then you guys will be able

2460
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:37,200
to see all the codes on the data.

2461
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:39,600
What is the due date for the task?

2462
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:41,360
The due date is Saturday

2463
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:42,920
this coming

2464
02:44:42,920 --> 02:44:51,120
Saturday.
