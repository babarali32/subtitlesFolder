00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,800
As the young guys.

2
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,280
Welcome to the class.

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,280
Let's get started in, like, six, 7 minutes

4
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,520
and waiting for everyone to jump on,
and then we'll get started, guys.

5
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,440
Excited to have a fun class today.

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,840
Class or.

7
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,760
Today's class is going to be fun.

8
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,160
You're going to enjoy it.

9
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,360
We're going to do a group project

10
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,480
and we're going to do a
we'll do a quiz today in class.

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,680
Will see you Enjoy that.

12
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,960
And yet a lot of review,
but mostly the group project

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,680
you guys will get in groups of 5
to 6 people.

14
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,560
So if you're thinking already of groups,
yeah, next couple hours

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,640
you will be with your groups
and doing an exercise.

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,160
So I'm excited to

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,080
go through that
with you guys and let's see how it goes.

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,600
I'll wait another 5

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,640
minutes till we get everyone on here
and then we will get started.

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,160
Guys. Let's see.

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,560
So do start thinking of your group
members.

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,400
Guys, if you are in a specific area,
meaning you are from New York,

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,160
you guys can absolutely get along
with individual from New York

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,840
and things like that.

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,920
So be very wise
in who you pick a little bit later.

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:25,640
Not at this point, though, but still.

27
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,240
All right, guys,
I will just wait another 5 minutes

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,600
till all the members come on board
and then we'll get started.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, guys,

30
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,080
I don't know where everyone is today.

31
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,880
They're coming in slowly

32
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,960
and then see, they're welcome.

33
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
Everyone, as you guys join.

34
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,960
Perfect.

35
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,600
That's.

36
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,240
You're on the right.

37
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,000
How am I doing?

38
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
I am doing well. I'm doing well.

39
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,000
Sorry. Bye, guys.

40
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,760
Your Sunday class got, unfortunately, got
to cancel the very last second, missus.

41
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,920
So she did get a very high fever, though.

42
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,360
So was unexpected.

43
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,640
We did it. No,
we thought everything was really good.

44
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,360
See you.

45
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,760
Only if you only had one Java class.

46
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,600
So she's doing well.

47
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,160
She's feeling a lot better.

48
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,040
We'll see if she will be able
to teach this Saturday or Sunday or not

49
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,840
if she's not able to.

50
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,200
You know, we have other instructor
lined up for you guys.

51
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,840
This in that situation, you never know.

52
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,480
And it might be coed.
It might not be COVID.

53
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,440
I don't know exactly,
but I'll keep you guys posted.

54
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:01,760
You know,

55
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,160
and yes, sorry about that.

56
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,760
You guys missed your one.

57
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,080
You had only one Java class
and we had to cancel last second there.

58
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,840
I hope you guys at least enjoy today
a bit of programing.

59
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,840
So you will be definitely exposed
to a lot more now very soon though.

60
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,560
But hopefully it wasn't too difficult.

61
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,840
Even if it was, you know, you'll be fine
as long as you practice.

62
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,400
The team members are here to help you
out, supports you, if any questions comes,

63
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,640
anything like that.

64
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,440
So I am glad that,
you know, a lot of you are participating,

65
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,960
some of you not much, but still it's fine.

66
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,160
Yes, we missed you.

67
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,120
She'll be back hopefully by this Saturday.

68
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,000
She will be back so she can continue
with you guys in the programing side.

69
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,120
All right, guys.

70
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,000
I think more and more
people are coming now, which is nice.

71
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't know why a lot of people are
a little bit late today, but it is fine

72
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,400
and we will basically get started.

73
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,440
So, guys, today's agenda simple.

74
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,320
What we will do is we will definitely do
a little, little review

75
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,120
just to make sure everything is clear
cut for you guys.

76
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,040
It makes a lot of sense.

77
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,760
And then what the goal is from there on.

78
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,240
I have a in-class quiz for you guys.

79
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,320
It'll be a lot of fun.

80
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,880
You will enjoy it for sure.

81
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,680
So we'll do it in class quiz
and then we'll get into groups

82
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,360
five, six, seven people, maybe
bigger group, whatever.

83
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,160
I'll explain to you
and you guys will have to get together

84
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,320
once you've formed a group
and you guys will do an activity.

85
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,200
The reason why we do so much repetition of
this will a lot, a lot of times I do,

86
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,160
you know, review of this material
and things again because I want this.

87
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,280
This is important.

88
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,200
Even though some people might not think so
much, but SDLC Agile, Agile

89
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,360
especially is extremely important
and it takes a little time for

90
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,600
for you guys to have had it
basically stick in your brain, right?

91
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,600
So we'll do review of that
and then you guys

92
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
will do the project with each other.

93
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,800
And that's just the very first project.

94
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,000
You'll do a lot more project in the future

95
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,480
and together also, you know,
this would be a good time

96
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,240
when we do the project today, kind of
break the ice with your team members.

97
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,240
You guys will see each other today
for the first time in video

98
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,240
since the project you guys do
will be video.

99
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,840
So, you know, that will kind of break the
you know, the

100
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,080
you know, the icebreaker
basically for you guys and get basically

101
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,480
acclimated and, you know,
get into the rhythm of working together.

102
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,080
So we'll do that
and we'll definitely do that.

103
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,960
And that way, you know,
I'll give you time.

104
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,320
I'll show you basically

105
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,280
how previous batches done everything.

106
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,120
You guys will spend time on that,
whether we're done

107
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,960
with the review quiz
and everything earlier, it's fine.

108
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,960
But I will basically make sure you were
the one

109
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,680
where Samir Someone sent

110
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
me, you ask,

111
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay, so we'll basically

112
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,240
get into that and yeah,
then the class gets really

113
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,640
you will focus on the group once
and then the following class.

114
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,000
You know, I will show you guys or Mr.

115
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,720
Diego who takes over me.

116
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,080
He'll basically go over
and show you all that.

117
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,560
So we ready to just do a quick review.

118
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,200
Let's get started.

119
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
Awesome. Awesome, Awesome.

120
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
Good, good, good, perfect.

121
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,480
Let's get started then.

122
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,960
You guys can see the screen right now.

123
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,360
I just want to make sure that you
see the has to it.

124
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,880
Perfect.

125
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,760
Okay.

126
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,240
All right.

127
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,280
So we covered of course,
we're not going to go to the very

128
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,400
first class, though, but sure,
we can just do it at a very high level.

129
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,680
What did we cover from
my very first class?

130
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,000
What is SDLC?

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,840
Just to kind of see

132
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,360
software development lifecycle?

133
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,040
Absolutely.

134
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,400
Who wants to break this software
development lifecycle?

135
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,440
What exactly?

136
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
Let's go into the the each phases.

137
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,680
What do we have there?

138
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,200
Let me see if I can show you a picture

139
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,200
we're planning.

140
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,640
Okay, let's go.

141
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,720
Let's break this down.

142
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,640
We're.

143
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,920
We're planning analysis design.

144
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,880
Yeah.

145
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,920
Implementation and then testing,
Integration and maintenance.

146
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,240
What do you usually have over here
in the planning phase?

147
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,400
What exactly is that?

148
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,880
Is my volume too low? Is it for everyone?

149
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,400
Let me check us.

150
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,080
Is it better now?

151
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,720
Okay, I guess.

152
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm sorry about that.

153
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,320
I didn't realize.

154
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,600
Okay. Yes.

155
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,720
So what happens in the planning phases?

156
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
Exactly.

157
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,480
First, you do the market analysis our way.

158
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,120
If there's going to be
a successful project

159
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,880
or non analysis phase,
we do collect requirements, right?

160
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,240
Great.
People already know their requirements.

161
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,440
What exactly Our requirements, by the way,
what exactly what

162
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
what does he mean by requirements.

163
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,840
What the clients want
the functionality man.

164
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
Good job, guys.

165
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,080
Absolutely. That's exactly what happens.

166
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,360
Gather there now do we as a testers,
do we start testing in

167
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,480
the analysis part or no? Yes,

168
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,960
remember, we do.

169
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,000
We checked the requirements, right,
against the smart criteria.

170
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,920
So technically
we are doing our testing from there on.

171
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,440
I was a little tricky.

172
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,920
And right then after this
we go into the design phase.

173
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,160
What happens in the design phase, guys

174
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,120
UI, UX, Okay, user interface.

175
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,480
Okay, user experience.

176
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,240
Okay, sure.

177
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,440
That's basically the interface is created.

178
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,880
The other things that happen, user name
design phase,

179
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,600
maybe also what coding language
they will use, right?

180
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,360
What, what, how many servers
they will need, all the backend part of it

181
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,560
basically.

182
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,040
But also remember there are multiple
people involved in that.

183
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,000
We have architects, we have developer
and we have UI, UX individuals.

184
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,680
They all are part of that.

185
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,080
Basically the design part
and the whole point of it is to make sure

186
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,320
in the future understand
whatever the system they're building,

187
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,760
it's going to be, you know, scalable,
meaning whatever.

188
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,760
If traffic gets they all traffic
increases.

189
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,520
You know, the softwares don't crash
or the systems don't graduate.

190
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,680
So they basically come up
with the blueprint,

191
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,880
they come with the Y wireframe.

192
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,680
Basically they come up with, you know,
what language to use, what servers are

193
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,440
going to have all that great.

194
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,720
And then from there on,
what happens once this is finalized,

195
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,440
we go into coding.

196
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,400
Yes, absolutely.

197
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,360
Now, coding is done by developers, right?

198
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,760
Strictly developers.

199
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,360
We as testers don't do that.

200
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,840
But let's say the coding is done,
the right development is done.

201
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,600
What happens from there on?

202
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,960
What do we do as a tester?
What is our job?

203
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,920
What is our job as a tester?

204
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,120
Exactly

205
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,840
as the code from find the mistakes.

206
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
That's what we do.

207
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,200
We don't really test the code, you know,
we can't really of course,

208
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,240
when we write coding and everything,
automation from our end, yeah,

209
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,720
we check on code,
but we can't really test the code.

210
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,800
We have to see the functionality.

211
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,600
Are the functionality build first
and what according to the requirement,

212
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,360
what the client wanted,
if they're not right, all the issues

213
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
and everything, right.

214
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,240
So when we find all these files
mistakes and everything,

215
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,960
do we go ahead and fix it ourselves?

216
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,520
No. Right. Absolutely not.

217
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,920
We report it to the developers
so they can work on it and fix it.

218
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,480
Usually when they fix it,
it comes back to you.

219
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,720
Check it, make sure it's working
fine and everything.

220
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,720
That's all it is.

221
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,120
And from there on it
goes into production, right?

222
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,240
When the testing everything is sparse,
then it goes to production.

223
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,040
That means it's
basically finally available on,

224
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,240
let's say, Dublin, WW dot, Amazon.com
or whatever it is.

225
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,760
Right. Which are the Web series.

226
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,840
So that means the customers,
whoever you build the software for,

227
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,920
they can actually play with actually

228
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,880
is needs news testers.

229
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,400
Well,
they had some internal issues yesterday.

230
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Well that's what they claim
they could be that whistleblower.

231
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,480
The who knows right this way.

232
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,520
Okay then from from from the production

233
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,600
you know,
some companies will have maintenance.

234
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Not all companies have maintenance,
but some companies will have maintenance

235
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
for that project. Right.

236
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,600
So that's basically SDLC.

237
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,040
Now, the approach of SDLC in real
time, right?

238
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,200
What are the two methodologies we call the

239
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,400
roll?

240
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,840
You said Twitter never fails.

241
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,960
You sure They got a high

242
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,840
waterfall and agile waterfall and actual.

243
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,280
Absolutely. These are basically the truth.

244
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,200
The two approaches

245
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,600
Are these the only approaches out there,
the methodologies out there in the world?

246
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Absolutely. In our right.

247
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,440
No, there's plenty other out there.

248
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,640
This spiral framework,
There's so many vSphere out there.

249
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,200
There's so many different ones out there.

250
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,320
I don't know generally who else uses
those, though, but they're not as popular.

251
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,280
Most ones, popular ones are waterfall
and agile waterfall.

252
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,760
Let's just just kind of get an idea
which type of companies

253
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,480
usually or individuals
really use waterfall.

254
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,800
A lot of times you will see on small
projects and government site, right?

255
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,480
Perfect. That makes sense.

256
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,200
When does waterfall work really?

257
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,880
No one they want simple.

258
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,080
Yeah.

259
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,720
When you have very clear requirement
and you know exactly what you want.

260
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,680
Speed is also not the main thing, right?

261
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,920
The quality matters

262
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,920
and the requirements has to be crystal
clear from the beginning.

263
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,480
Right?

264
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,520
That's basically the main thing
to understand about Waterfall. Now,

265
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,440
what are some downside

266
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,280
of waterfall methodology?

267
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,680
No change, right?
That's one of the biggest.

268
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,800
When you can go back once each remember

269
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,720
that, you can go back once
each phase is completed.

270
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,560
Now if you find bugs
that say you are a waterfall project,

271
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,480
can you fix them or no?

272
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,880
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

273
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,520
You guys, when you find bugs
and everything, you can fix bugs.

274
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,600
You cannot change the requirements,
but you can fix the bugs.

275
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:51,800
Right?

276
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,160
That's a very simple, simple thing.

277
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,000
But I know a lot of people
get this confused, but yeah,

278
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
you can actually do that.

279
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,480
Too much documentation. Absolutely, guys.

280
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,720
Way too much documentation.

281
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,160
Sometimes I would say
unnecessary documentation,

282
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,360
but everything is documented.

283
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,000
There's plenty of that.

284
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
And what happens is
which face gets affected the most?

285
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,640
Which face do you think it's a first?

286
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,400
Like if we were to think of from SDLC
perspective testing, right?

287
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah.

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,960
So testing is one of the main thing
that gets infected more than waterfall

289
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,720
because the first let's say,
I don't know, one or two years, whichever

290
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,280
time they took maybe on coding on other
other phases, that might take a long time.

291
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,720
So you can't really predict,
you know, you know,

292
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,440
or have maybe time the right time
frame for testing.

293
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,440
So it gets affected the most.

294
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,680
A lot of times
what happens when budget is running out,

295
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,800
you know, and we're the last one,
so they might cut corners, right.

296
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,680
Okay. We don't need to test.

297
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,160
We need for testers.

298
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,840
But maybe ten testers were great, right?

299
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,640
They were able to find issues.

300
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,760
So those are some of the pitfalls
of waterfall.

301
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,880
Now, waterfall, is it

302
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,480
still let's say, for
example, is is waterfall led?

303
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,000
How do I put it?

304
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,000
Waterfall is still usable.

305
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,880
It only works in a specific context,
meaning

306
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,280
it only applies better
when you know exactly what you want.

307
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,200
If you don't know what you want,
then it doesn't work

308
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,680
and it can be still used to this day.

309
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,880
As long as people know
how to navigate through it right,

310
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
they are able to understand
how that works.

311
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,840
Now we cover basically waterfall,
all of that.

312
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,880
The advantage, this advantage of it,
we cover all of this stuff

313
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,320
before, but
let's see what happens to the next one.

314
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,480
Now we go into we cover and spend
a good amount of time was agile.

315
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,280
So what is Agile methodology?

316
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,800
Guess what are some advantages of Agile
methodology?

317
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,520
Flexible.

318
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
That's number one thing.

319
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,840
Yes, the flexibility of it is very

320
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,720
fast, flexible change.

321
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,320
We can make changes, build software
incrementally.

322
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,160
Absolutely.

323
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,640
So that means you have a working software
after a sprint is done.

324
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,880
Basically allow a change, more meetings,
lots of meetings that you saw.

325
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,600
You know, we kind of have tons
and tons of meeting in in in Agile.

326
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,680
And it shows you
that it's a very group effort

327
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,600
built in stages more.

328
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,200
It is a true approach. Yes.

329
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,040
Less documentation. Yes.

330
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,240
Some timing on documentation can be good,
but sometimes

331
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,520
less customer collaboration.

332
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,200
Absolutely. Absolutely.

333
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,160
So there's there's more in
when we look at basically an agile.

334
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,080
Agile is built in in a team manner,
meaning a lot of involvement.

335
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,760
Everyone is basically involved
in this whole process.

336
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,840
When there is isn't a clear picture
that then you are

337
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,000
the this is the perfect methodology,
agile.

338
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,040
See, the thing is, if the customer
is not very familiar, right,

339
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,520
or are not familiar,

340
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,400
so if they don't have

341
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,200
an idea what they want,
I mean, that can happen a lot, by the way.

342
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,400
You know,

343
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,040
you don't know what the final product
needs to be, you know,

344
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,560
because you work with them and you build
the software in piece by piece,

345
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,120
module by module. Right.

346
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,280
They eventually will get
what they exactly want.

347
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,800
And it's better for people, better
for projects when there is a little bit

348
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,720
uncertainty or uncertainty as far as what
they want built, can they get messy?

349
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,040
Absolutely, guys.

350
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,520
It can get messy
when you have a massive project

351
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,280
and the customer is still
is unsure of what they want.

352
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,280
I went through actually a project
like this, which was massive project.

353
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,600
Like I said, the United States
Postal Service.

354
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,880
I yeah you
they pay you sometimes for work and double

355
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,200
the work you keep on repeating
because you're pleasing the client, right?

356
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,040
So those are some things
that can happen in Agile.

357
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,280
I remember there's there's good,
good things out of it, but then there's

358
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,640
some bad things about,
about Agile as well, the pros and cons.

359
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,160
So at the end of the day
when we really think about it,

360
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,040
it comes down to the context.

361
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,360
Each method ology works fine,
it works fine.

362
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,840
But, but you know, it depends on how,

363
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,200
which company, which client,
so many things.

364
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Basically, there's a lot of factors,
but they use waterfall,

365
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,080
they use a combination and they did not
really use waterfall or agile.

366
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,640
They combining
made it into their own version, basically

367
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,200
some things from waterfall,
some things from agile.

368
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,760
Now remember, guys don't be, you know,
shocked when you go to let's say companies

369
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,880
they companies might not follow exactly
100% of agile, right.

370
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,920
They might not do certain things of Agile.

371
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,440
They might customize it
because remember this, these are just

372
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,800
theoretical approaches or,
you know, tested approaches

373
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,600
that, you know, you can use towards
building a software in this fashion.

374
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
If you agile, you'll be successful.

375
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,880
These are things, right?

376
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,120
However, you know, the thing is, you know,
companies will do whatever they want to.

377
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,160
You know, it all comes down to that.

378
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,520
I'll give you a good example at Syntax.

379
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,760
We are very agile.

380
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,880
We do a lot of things,
you know, very quick.

381
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
If we see something is not working,
we change it, this and that.

382
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,880
But then there are things, you know,
we we follow waterfall,

383
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,080
we have adjusted to basically
whatever works for us.

384
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,600
So you remember this.

385
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,560
Whenever you go to any company
that you work tomorrow, don't expect.

386
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,080
Exactly.

387
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,200
They're following basically word for word
and how it's supposed to be.

388
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,880
Are there companies who do follow that?

389
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,680
Absolutely, 100%.

390
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,760
But then there's a lot of companies,
you know, who add their own things,

391
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,000
terminology that we cover
in which we will go over a little bit.

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,880
Right now, you know, those terminologies,
you know, these are the ones standardized

393
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,840
in, as you know, when you're
trying to become a scrum master and stuff.

394
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,560
But, you know, sometimes, you know,
they have their own terminologies,

395
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,120
don't remember this.

396
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,560
Maybe they'll have instead of
spring grooming,

397
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,320
they'll call a different meeting. Right.

398
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,280
So companies will have different terms
and terminology

399
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,720
because they've changed
certain things that work for them

400
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,040
Sometimes.

401
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,280
DEADLINE missed the methodology
in the way of project.

402
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,280
Angry Yes, it can, but at the same time,
you have to look at it this way

403
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,160
Deadlines are important
for when you're trying to achieve,

404
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,520
let's say, developing a project
within, let's say, a certain time.

405
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,600
Deadlines cannot be met
sometimes that that that doesn't happen.

406
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,520
That's absolutely possible.

407
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,000
Just look over here, guys.

408
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,680
We went over this the the waterfall
or project fairly waterfall was this agile

409
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,880
rate 42% nice project
failed in in in waterfall methodology

410
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:40,560
that means 23%
only 77% is basically a passing rate.

411
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,360
You can see if on a bigger project
23% is a big number.

412
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,760
If you look at it still on a failure
aside, if you're looking at Agile

413
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,480
so remember this, you know
these things happen, they still fail.

414
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,680
Things will happen all the time.

415
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,200
There's no such thing
as a perfect methodology,

416
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,680
you know, It's
just that, you know, nowadays this works.

417
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,960
Maybe in the future

418
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,640
there will be another system
of creating or way of creating a software.

419
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,280
But for now, Agile is taking the
the way basically leading the race

420
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,640
at this current moment. Right?

421
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,600
They have other version of Agile,
like I said, eight different ones.

422
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,560
We particularly focus on which one

423
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,240
those a question you

424
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,280
which one of which part of under the Agile
methodology scrum.

425
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,560
Right.

426
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,360
Scrum is the one that we focus on right.

427
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,880
They are different flavors.

428
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,120
They like I explained to you last time,
like ice is going to have different

429
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,280
flavors, but 70% of them are using

430
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,480
Scrum are the ones companies use them.

431
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,120
They have a little bit different changes
and things like that.

432
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,120
For a hard
you said I'm on Zoom from cellphone

433
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,520
can I switch to my lab done
for how you can do that Just remember that

434
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,840
and log out of it because it might not
let you jump into the laptops.

435
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,640
Remember, the zoom
has their own restriction so it doesn't.

436
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,400
So you can log out and then jump there.

437
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,880
Okay. Yeah.

438
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,040
So there are different
flavors, are there, right, as we see.

439
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,880
All right, let's break down and do a quick
review because remember, pay attention.

440
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,040
We going to play a game.

441
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,640
All right.
So who is the person product owner?

442
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,880
What is their job?

443
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,280
Is the big boss. Right. And

444
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,280
they're in charge of

445
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,800
basically,
you know, communicating with the client.

446
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,320
Right.

447
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,600
What else they do, they're basically
are they are so they're

448
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,240
they are writing the user story.

449
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,920
They are technically should be no business
analyst when we think about agile

450
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,800
methodology
the job of what a business analyst does

451
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
is technically
what a product owner is supposed to do.

452
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,640
However, I like I mentioned to you,
I've seen it in a lot of companies,

453
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,960
so we should consider an Agile
that there's a business analyst.

454
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,200
They don't Marmot
They don't pay for the project.

455
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
They're the one assigned to the project
supervising

456
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,640
all of that, making sure
the project is succeeded, right?

457
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,160
That's what the basically manager look
one way is looking is like a man, manager,

458
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,200
supervisor is more the scrum, remember
that defines the goal and focuses on

459
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
product backlog,

460
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,160
what they can prioritize
and they can do that. Yep.

461
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,320
So that's that's the product order.

462
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,480
Then there's an individual
called Scrum Master.

463
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,080
What do they do?

464
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,040
Supervisor. Coordinator. Right.

465
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,520
Their job is basically to run the meetings
and make sure that, you know,

466
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,840
you test tester developers,
whoever is is basically on track.

467
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,160
You know, they, they cannot fire you,
they cannot hire you.

468
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
They cannot do anything like that.

469
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,440
But they can be
the one that you can talk to

470
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,280
if you want to get the message across
to the product owner.

471
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,720
They are the middle person.

472
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,800
They're part of this with Scrum
Master are on your site.

473
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,160
Technically,
we got to give it to them, right?

474
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,800
They can give you a task either.

475
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,640
Now, remember when we talked
about the spring grooming planning,

476
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,960
they can basically clarify
those tasks and everything

477
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,840
and then at the same time
make you guys choose that

478
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,880
a bridge between the dev team and client
like the best way to look at.

479
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,080
Yeah that the money like you said there
they make sure everything goes smooth

480
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,720
that's what their job is to make sure
everything is going smooth.

481
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,000
We're following the scrum methodology.

482
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,680
Let's say they're that's
why they're running all that.

483
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,480
You know, the scrum
was there meetings and things like that.

484
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,040
They're usually the ones, you know.

485
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,000
Yeah. Protecting you from obstacle Marina.

486
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,640
Like you said, they're their,

487
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,960
their role is kind of important
in this field because, you know,

488
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,080
they're the one, the middle person, the
middle person and really understanding,

489
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,200
making sure everything is going smooth
and have a good oversight of it.

490
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,200
I am absolutely recording.

491
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,760
Region All right.

492
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,880
And then always the development team,
what happens in development? You

493
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,120
I should that's the
good it's like you're comfortable working

494
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,960
you have everything successful absolutely
Let's say maybe you're falling behind

495
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,080
or things like that.

496
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,600
They're the one basically pointing out
that, hey, everything is good to go.

497
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Yeah. In the development.

498
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,640
See, we are tester business analyst,
designer developers.

499
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,520
Yeah, that's basically the entire team of
the engineers, testers, beard designers.

500
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,000
They're all basically called
the development team here.

501
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,720
Yeah, that's
basically the typical development

502
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,920
you hear that picture that we talked
about last time product

503
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,400
or as we can see, as you can see,
it's talking to the business individual

504
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,080
end user domain experts, Scrum
master on the side, a little bit lonely

505
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,800
right here where the real workforce
that makes the software happens, right

506
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,640
where basically those construction workers
for building the house right

507
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,640
where the same workers
basically building the software

508
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,360
we have hierarchy in basically
within the software world as well, too.

509
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,240
That's the best way to look at it.

510
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,640
Yeah, we are the real workers.

511
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,920
We're the ones who is doing the labor
work, building the software,

512
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,800
making sure everything is good and smooth,
but not comes into the tech work.

513
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,720
So if we look at it, guys,
the way I remember,

514
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,800
I remember how I explained to you

515
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,600
the example at the beginning
how product is made the same way.

516
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,520
If we look at it,

517
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,760
we're just getting different names
in terms and things like that now.

518
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,440
All right.

519
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,240
Okay. So we covered that then.

520
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,840
What was the product backlog?

521
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,320
Do you guys remember?

522
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,480
Product backlog has all the user stories
in task everything, right?

523
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,000
That's the combinations of all of it,
right?

524
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
All the requirements.

525
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,560
Basically the user story,

526
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,520
you remember this before in Waterfall,
we call them requirements.

527
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,160
Now we call them user story.

528
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,920
The time has changed,
but it's the same thing.

529
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,560
Basically the requirements read.

530
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,360
So they're all

531
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,960
the user story is all the tasks
that are broken down to smaller ones.

532
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,520
All the feedback.

533
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,480
Remember that that feedback is everything
goes back into the product backlog.

534
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,360
Do we complete everything from the product
backlog all at once?

535
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,320
Guys?

536
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,360
Not possible, right?

537
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,120
There's it's almost impossible to do that
because you can have thousands of items

538
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,600
in the product backlog.

539
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,280
So we complete those products
basically in a spring.

540
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:21,920
So what would be a sprint backlog then?

541
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,360
Sprint would be
you've taken some basically

542
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,280
user stories, tasks
and everything from the part of backlog.

543
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Let's say ten user stories, you two
and you're working on those in that sprint

544
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,480
basis to bring backlog would be the
the backlog of just that sprint.

545
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,600
So 20 items you be working. All right.

546
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,480
These are the 20 items

547
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,880
in that in the Sprint backlog
that we'll be working, we will assign to.

548
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,800
Now, someone mentioned let's say this,
the sprints can be how many weeks can it

549
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,280
be? One week, two weeks, three weeks,
four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks.

550
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,520
Can it be longer than four weeks?

551
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,440
No. Right.

552
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,520
It has to be one through four.

553
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,440
It's not max three Now, does
can this sequence change?

554
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,480
Let's say one month
we did four weeks sprint the following.

555
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,560
It can be three weeks or two weeks.

556
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,000
Nope.

557
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,040
It stays consistent in whatever
the company chooses

558
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:18,520
from the beginning it all
or it will remain the same guys.

559
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,840
It will remain the same.

560
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,360
So the company decided to do it
from beginning of the project

561
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,320
that we're going to have three weeks
since they will go with that

562
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,320
for the completion of the project.

563
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,280
1010. Things change.

564
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,800
Absolutely can change. Companies can.

565
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Let's say they had three weeks to launch.

566
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:34,960
Sure.

567
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,640
Because at the end of management,
whatever they decide can happen.

568
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,080
But is that happening?

569
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,120
Usually not really.
That doesn't happen. Right?

570
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,560
Burned down chart.

571
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,760
What does it calculate? What does it do?

572
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,000
I showed you in JIRA.

573
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,440
Remember last time.

574
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,720
So burn down chart basically
looks at the progress we have made.

575
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,920
How much work is done.

576
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,120
It's a visual representation. Right?

577
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,080
There is. Let me see a picture.

578
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,320
Visual representation.

579
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,000
We start from
the top needs to end up at the bottom.

580
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,680
Is this important for us?

581
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,120
It just shows us what work is done,
what's remaining.

582
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,640
It's more for management, it's more for,
let's say, a scrum mass in product

583
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,320
owner to look at, see are we on timeline,
are we going to make it?

584
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,480
It's there multiple.

585
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,960
Let's say, for example,
there's multiple reports out there in JIRA

586
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,080
and other tools, but it's a visual, visual
representation of basically

587
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,960
what work is done, what has been,
what is remaining,

588
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,240
and are we going to make the deadline
basically. Right.

589
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,320
So that's what we're looking at
when we look at the burned out check.

590
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,800
Then we have some meetings, right?

591
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,480
We had some meetings.

592
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:53,560
What happens in a daily scrum meeting
guys?

593
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,160
It's a 15 minutes meeting, right?

594
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,600
It can be standing up.

595
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,680
It can be sitting down, you know,
in the picture to showed you standing up.

596
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,400
But what do we talk in this, what you did
yesterday, what you're planning to do

597
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,360
and at the same time
so everyone goes one by one and talks

598
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,880
about what they worked on yesterday,
what they'll be working on.

599
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,120
And the main thing of is if there's
any issues, any impediments, any blockers.

600
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,880
Right.
That's the main thing of this whole thing.

601
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,400
Everyone gives the status,
meaning testers develop or design

602
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,760
or whoever is in that scrum meeting,
you know, they all do that.

603
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,080
Basically they give that status of that
and making sure that,

604
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,120
you know, we don't have those issues,
any of their issues.

605
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,960
You bring it up over there
so that way you can come to a conclusion

606
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,000
and there can be some resolved meaning,
you know, the scrum master will take notes

607
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
if there's any issues
and then have a meeting.

608
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,040
Okay, how can we fix it?

609
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,800
How can we get to the bottom of it?

610
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,920
So that's basically your daily scrum.

611
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,640
Then we had something called a spring
grooming meeting.

612
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,120
What happens in
a spring grooming meeting as

613
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,760
we understand the

614
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,240
user story, we click clear the user
stories, add

615
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,200
the person, take out details to I,
you know, break them down.

616
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,760
Whatever we need to do, basically
by making the main purpose of

617
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,320
is to making sure understand
all the user stories

618
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,240
and take out
any use a story that are unnecessary,

619
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,440
clean them up, make sure you know
we're good to go for future.

620
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,080
You know what you working on
you clarify all those things

621
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,280
in basically a spring grooming
just you know, grooming.

622
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,360
What is the word grooming mean?

623
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,960
We know grooming your cleaning up
and everything.

624
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,120
That's basically what we're doing in that
spring grooming meeting for those users.

625
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,320
Story making it tidy. Absolutely.

626
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,040
That's the purpose of it, to make sure
everything is smooth and everything.

627
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,120
If there's information that you don't know
or we're missing, you know, the business

628
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,200
and is people will contact basically,
you know, client and get that information.

629
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,520
We break it down.

630
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,600
We break down even into smartass.

631
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,760
We're here right Then after this,
we have another meeting now,

632
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:07,160
by the way, this basically keep in mind

633
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,920
when you have, let's say, for example,
a two week sprint, right?

634
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,560
So maybe at the very beginning you have
a spring grooming and all of that.

635
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,920
Let's see at the very beginning
now in this let's see, two weeks spend new

636
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,920
if you did is for this current spring
that's going to happen right in between

637
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,320
you might let's say on the second
on a Tuesday you can have another spring.

638
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,600
By the way, grooming and planning
meetings, I'm sorry, spring grooming

639
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,960
meeting for the future ones
as well to future springs,

640
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,320
because, you know, they have to clean up
and be ready ahead of time.

641
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,160
So that can happen sometimes you will
sometimes happen

642
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,360
within your regular spring
that's going on.

643
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,160
You'll have another spring grooming
meeting or the future springs as well too.

644
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,480
And remember, it can take time.

645
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,800
These meetings can take anywhere
from one hour to 4 hours.

646
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,800
It all depends on how you know,
if you follow a

647
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,440
one week spring, two, three, four
and how many uses do you have?

648
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,320
All depends,
but typically can take 2 to 3 hours.

649
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,720
Right?

650
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,280
Then what happens in the spring meeting,
guys?

651
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:10,760
What happens there?

652
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,080
How long is User story is going to take?

653
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,840
Absolutely.

654
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,640
How long is going to take for development?

655
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
How long is going to take for testing?

656
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,800
So basically, we're estimating here all of
and keep in mind, these are estimates.

657
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,920
Does it mean they're 100% accurate?

658
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,320
Absolutely not. Can one use a story?

659
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,200
Let's say developers say that, hey,
it's going to take 4 hours to develop.

660
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,880
Does it take 4 hours?

661
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,040
No, it could take longer.

662
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,560
Can you take longer
or less time in testing?

663
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,880
Absolutely.

664
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,920
Here, basically in this meeting,
what we do is we ask

665
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,600
we basically assign
that estimating time for these.

666
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,040
And then within the team ourselves,
we pick which one we will work on.

667
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,280
Basically,

668
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,280
I issue we use, for example,
JIRA is one of the softwares.

669
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,400
There's there's bunch of other softwares
out there.

670
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,440
Rally is very popular one there's mid-year

671
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,400
I as one of the more popular one there is
what else is out there?

672
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,360
HPL PLM was another popular one other
there's a bunch of versions

673
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,720
out there of similar one,
but JIRA is one of the more popular ones.

674
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,800
The one thing, by the way,
just a side note for this, right?

675
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,080
So let's see what you guys go to work,
right?

676
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,840
A user story.

677
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,120
Let's say it says 4 hours, right?

678
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
There's just something to remember
on the site.

679
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,000
Okay.

680
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,800
If a user says a story says 4 hours and
you tested this thing in 2 hours, right.

681
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,720
That's great.
You know, just give you a heads up.

682
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,400
You can do all of that
and it's absolutely fine.

683
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,120
But remember,
you might be assigned multiple users.

684
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,880
Three if all of them you're doing.

685
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,280
I had a time just a note.

686
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,040
Remember,
try to when you follow the company.

687
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,240
Let's when you get into the company,

688
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,760
follow along with with the user story
timeline and everything.

689
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,360
By this I mean this guys are

690
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,720
what can happen is let's say a user story

691
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,480
estimate is 4 hours and you do it in,
let's say 30 minutes or 20 minutes, right?

692
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,720
And you get all your user story then
will remember more work is going to come.

693
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,200
But just don't worry about the work
by more user story.

694
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,320
Sometimes what happens
just so you have an idea,

695
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,160
you're going to make the other testers
look bad because they might be like, Yo,

696
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,920
this guy did this in 4 hours
and is making this look back.

697
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,280
You could create some enemies
there, right?

698
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,080
So remember what I suggested.

699
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,960
You go to work, follow along, follow

700
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,360
along at the beginning later,
I'm sure if you want to do it fast.

701
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,520
But remember, go with the flow,
how things are right.

702
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,520
If something takes 4 hours
and you know it's going to take you

703
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,520
30 seconds or let's say 30 minutes,
just drag it out.

704
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,160
That's the best way to do it, because
I've seen this in real life, right?

705
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,040
We have seen others like,
hey, this guy's getting done so fast.

706
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,760
And then, you know, the management is
like, look, you're taking too long.

707
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,240
What's go, go.
Why is this person doing this?

708
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,040
Just to not understand
the work politics, Right.

709
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,320
You'll see that in real life.

710
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,840
You know, when you go to work,
there is going to be work politics, Right.

711
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,160
So take it easy.
That's a good way to look at.

712
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,480
Take it easy and follow along,
especially at the beginning.

713
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,160
When you start off
with your new career, right.

714
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,200
Once you get comfortable and things

715
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,760
like that,
you know, it's all different, though.

716
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,400
But remember, work, politics and things
like that is always there, you know?

717
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,200
So just be be careful with that,
especially at the very beginning.

718
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,720
Be a team player. Exactly.

719
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,120
I remember there
I'll be very honest with you guys.

720
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,440
I used to get use a story.

721
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,120
Sometimes it's says 6 hours
and I got it done in 30 minutes.

722
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,480
And of course, did I'd say I've done it

723
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,320
30 minutes and I dragged it out
because I know for a fact

724
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,600
if I do all of this now, remember,
you can do one thing.

725
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,800
Just a side note, I'll tell you.

726
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,680
Okay, guys, you know,
overachieving is great sometimes,

727
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,960
but it can bite you
and I'll tell you exactly.

728
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,360
I've seen this with
some of our students in the past, right?

729
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,520
I tell them, look, when you do work fast
and you're ahead of the other people,

730
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,680
it's great.

731
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,840
You'll get some very good,

732
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,800
you know, notice that, hey,
you're doing awesome and everything.

733
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,320
But what happens sometimes is, you know,

734
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,760
when you're the overachiever, then
anything in the happened in the future,

735
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,560
they just going to give you the work
and they can expect a lot more from you.

736
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,280
So just be prepared.

737
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,240
If you haven't worked in the corporate
world, that can happen as well, too,

738
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,520
because I have seen this.

739
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,400
I've seen even a student tell me, Hey,

740
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,720
I do my work so well and everything,
you know, but now I'm getting sick

741
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,000
and part of it
because now in the future, you know,

742
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,080
now what's happening
is they're giving you all the work now

743
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,640
because no one else is doing it.

744
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,600
All the burden is getting

745
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,120
so you have to be very careful with this,
you know, do the work,

746
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,000
proper job, but at the same time,
don't overdo it, because what happens is

747
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,080
management
will basically sometimes exploit that.

748
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,080
You have to be very careful in that.

749
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,560
So and you will learn that

750
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,520
when you really work in the corporate
field, you know, just know how to get it.

751
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,720
Not just on the side note,
you know, my friend,

752
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,720
because sometimes work
just a couple hours a day.

753
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,680
Yeah, that's typical.

754
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,920
Sometimes you want to have a lot of work,
you will do a lot of work, and sometimes

755
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,360
you won't

756
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,200
get. Advice?

757
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,880
Yes, well, this this is how it works.

758
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,400
You know, you got to survive.

759
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,840
You know, you got to know how it works

760
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,080
and, you know, get along
with your coworkers, you know, chit chat,

761
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,640
you know, make small talks,

762
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,280
whatever, talk about football, whatever
it is, interest rate,

763
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,720
Those are the very good things
that, you know, Remember this

764
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,000
when you want to go climb up the ladder
and things

765
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,760
like that, you know, if you drink
or you don't drink, go to the happy hour.

766
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,400
You know, get involved in those things
when you're in the corporate feel

767
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,920
is going to help you significantly build
strong chemistry between team members.

768
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,000
But at the same time, you know, it's it's
just good way to also go up the ladder.

769
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,520
That's also very important.

770
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:53,760
Yeah,

771
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,040
there's some side notes.

772
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,240
I'll give you some more notes
and things like that, that you can do it.

773
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,000
But you know, I can give I can sit here
for hours and talk about this.

774
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,840
If you have a 6 hours, I'm in turning 32nd
before that.

775
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,080
Yeah, I don't do that.

776
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,320
I'm like, that would be a good idea.

777
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,240
All right, let's go back on track, though.
So we have Sprint grooming.

778
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,320
Sprint planning.

779
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,400
Okay,
so then what happens in the Sprint review?

780
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,680
What happens there or Sprint demo

781
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,440
one of the meetings, Right.

782
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,320
So we are basically showcasing everything

783
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,360
all the client members,
stockholders, whoever.

784
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,720
Basically the project building is
a presentation of basically what you built

785
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,040
in the last one week, two weeks,
whatever it is.

786
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,880
So all the software that was created,
you're showcasing that

787
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,560
who usually presents this, right?

788
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,520
Like is it a developer business?

789
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
And as product owner
who usually does that?

790
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,040
So there's two people, right?

791
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,680
Subject, same e subject matter expert
that could be the person who's the most

792
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,800
senior, the right who has the great idea
about the system, right?

793
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,680
It could be anywhere.

794
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,720
And that's his or if not usually tester,
usually a senior tester,

795
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,120
someone we call a test lead. Right.

796
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,400
Are the one basically
person product owner.

797
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,560
Sure, they can do it too,
but I've seen usually testers do it.

798
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,320
I remember
I had to do it in front of like 60 people.

799
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,440
It was very annoying.

800
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,000
But you know, you kind of go through that,

801
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,440
you know,
but that that's that's part of the game.

802
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,920
That's part of the job description. Right.

803
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,520
So and it's not very difficult.

804
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
You know, you go slowly step by step.

805
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
This is what I created.

806
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,480
I click on it literally showing
step by step everything you've done.

807
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,320
And meanwhile,
when you're doing this, remember this

808
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,080
feedback will come, right?

809
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,240
Feedback will come.
Why don't like this, this and that?

810
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,200
That feedback is noted down by business
and this grand master product owner.

811
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,200
They're taking all the notes of what
the customer wants because remember

812
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,280
that feedback is going to go
where you guys

813
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,880
where is this feedback going to go?

814
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,560
Product backlog, right?

815
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,120
That feedback later on

816
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,680
will be turning to user story
will go into the product backlog, right?

817
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,200
So those are
the things that we will work on Iran.

818
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,280
All right.

819
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,880
So that's your Sprint demo.

820
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,400
Now after this, we have one
last final meeting that happens.

821
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,680
And what is that Sprint retrospective?

822
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:19,200
What happens in Sprint retrospective,
internal meeting?

823
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,360
What worked well, what did not work?

824
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,600
How we can improve
all the things that you talk about.

825
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,960
Yes, it's within internally, like,
you know, things that didn't work.

826
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,280
Maybe, for example, you know,
you got delayed because your environment

827
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,280
where you're supposed to do
testing wasn't working.

828
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,320
The developer took too long
and I was rushed into testing

829
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,040
because you did not
develop the story on time.

830
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,600
You know, you can
you can talk about all these things,

831
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,960
how you can prevent things
that stops you from productivity.

832
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,480
Right?

833
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,280
And also you can talk about good things,
You know, what things work with.

834
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,160
It's an open ended discussion
for everyone,

835
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,240
for the things that are going well
and things that are not going well

836
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,120
and how they can improve. Basically.

837
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:02,280
You can absolutely be very open here
and complain from mass about devs.

838
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,560
Yeah, you can.

839
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,880
Hopefully devs are good by the way,
when you go to the real world

840
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,120
and you get along and you will work
with developers all the time.

841
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,360
If you go back to SC office

842
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,520
in general, you know you, you would
definitely interact with developers

843
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,120
all the time.

844
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,160
You get to see their job
can be a little bit more challenging,

845
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,280
so you have sympathy for that sometimes.

846
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,800
So guys,
that's basically our quick review.

847
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,200
I think Recovered everything from Agile
Raid seems pretty clear,

848
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,040
but yeah, we cover
almost everything right now.

849
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,400
Let's test it out.

850
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,960
Let's see how you guys
are going to do this now, real time.

851
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:48,200
Are we ready for a quick quiz?

852
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,160
Will someone ask a question?

853
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:58,920
Let me see someone have a question first.

854
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,240
Sorry. You said what the.

855
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,600
Let me see. I see a lot of
questions are coming. Let me follow.

856
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,360
Let let me answer some of the questions
and then I'll do that.

857
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,360
Can you tell
please tell that to please can

858
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,360
you do about e w s is a good extra and

859
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,200
yeah I will Amazon web services
all is great.

860
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,120
We will be kind of going over that
at the end of the class.

861
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,120
Not today,
like end of the course basically.

862
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,760
So you get into that
with all organization.

863
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,560
Follow the same chain of meetings
typically the meetings

864
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,520
yeah they usually fall
if they remember this the individual

865
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,600
who you know usually if they're falling
I just there's similar meetings

866
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,840
they followed to very extent
but remember it cannot be 100%.

867
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,320
Sometimes they will add things to it.

868
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,120
It doesn't have to be 100% to the point,
but majority of them do fall like this. We

869
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,600
had 20

870
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
right guys.

871
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,200
It would be that difficult.
We're going to make it fun.

872
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,360
Okay, So let me see.

873
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,000
Let's play this game.

874
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,040
All right.

875
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,360
Classic one is

876
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,480
we pay.

877
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,320
All right, guys,
we're going to play this game.

878
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,040
How are we going to play this game?

879
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,760
Companies a work.

880
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:17,760
All right.

881
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,200
Go to this website.

882
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,960
Go. Who got it?

883
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,800
Okay, you guys need to go.

884
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,400
Hey, I'm not the person I really.

885
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,840
And enter the spin.

886
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,040
You see the website right here?

887
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,360
Who done it?

888
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,080
Now, remember,
you can do this on your phone.

889
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,840
You can do it on your.

890
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,360
I will share right here.

891
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:45,000
I want a little bit.

892
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,120
So go there and enter the pin
so we can get all the players in here

893
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,600
and use your real name.

894
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,920
I'd be nice

895
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:04,080
once you guys are majority of you guys
come here, then we'll get started.

896
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,280
I know sometimes a lot of people join
and why, but this is a fun game, right?

897
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,160
So join this guys,
go to cohort dot i.t and enter that pin

898
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,360
so we can get all the players
and we can play a

899
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,480
we have one

900
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,560
game is 4830349.

901
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,520
This is your pin on the screen.

902
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:43,040
If you're seeing it
then you're right on down for you, man.

903
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,920
That's fine.

904
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,520
And your mom

905
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,880
and we are worried

906
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:02,560
about where you guys are.

907
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,680
All right.

908
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:13,440
Now get numbers are coming slowly.

909
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,680
I'll give it about another minute or so
and then we'll get started, guys,

910
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,120
because I don't want to be too long
and I'll keep the pin in here.

911
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,080
So, guys, more people.

912
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:27,880
Just one guys.

913
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,160
Alex, you said,
can you tell us about rules?

914
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,680
You mean rules
as in in this, in the Agile one

915
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,160
we have Project manager.

916
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,560
Sorry, Game rule. Game rules. Oh,
this one.

917
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,360
This is simple.

918
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,800
You see, right now

919
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,280
what happened
we had so many now is decreasing

920
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,520
is supposed to be decreasing
guys not downward

921
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,280
really want to go God

922
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,360
I'll give it 30 more seconds than that.

923
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,240
And people are getting guys.

924
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,480
I know there's more than 70
people already.

925
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,360
It's I don't know what's going on.

926
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,080
Don't be afraid.

927
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:10,040
It's okay.

928
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,880
Yeah, we're way more than 60 people.

929
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,440
Guys got it.

930
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,120
When it reaches 70 guys, I'll start.

931
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,760
That's fine.

932
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,040
So more people just start.

933
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:31,800
I don't know where
the rest of you guys are, but that's fine.

934
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,280
So the member guys go to this website code

935
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,000
page or T dot it.

936
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,560
When you get there,
we'll give you the pins.

937
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,800
Yeah. I don't know what's going on.
It goes up and down.

938
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,840
All right. That's
why, guys, we'll get started anyway.

939
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,240
I'm not sure.
Maybe they'll join in between.

940
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,440
Okay.

941
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,960
All right, let's get start again.

942
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,320
So this game, Let's do this.

943
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,880
Remember, guys, you must watch the screen.

944
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,040
Okay, My screen.

945
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,040
Because the questions
will come here on your screen.

946
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,800
You're only going to see shapes
and colors.

947
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,680
Okay. Those are the way to answer.

948
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,480
So again, the questions
will be on the screen that I'm showing.

949
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,120
Okay.

950
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,560
So let me show you right now.

951
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,200
This hour, you need to go to code dot

952
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,600
i t and then play a game and enter
that print.

953
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,280
What does SDLC stand for, for example?

954
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:24,840
Right.

955
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,440
The question is here,
the options you have are on your screen,

956
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:43,920
so select which one.

957
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,680
All right.
There you go. That's how we did there.

958
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,640
Are you right to make sure everything is
good, Diane?

959
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,160
The very first question. Okay.

960
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,160
What does SDLC stand for?

961
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,160
13 of you said software testing lifecycle.

962
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,240
I know, I know.

963
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,840
Your buttons slip maybe by mistake. Right?

964
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,360
But majority of you said software
development lifecycle.

965
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,320
That's the right answer.

966
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,200
It's not software design lifecycle
or is not software driven lifecycle.

967
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,160
Okay.

968
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,240
Some slip your fingers.

969
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,680
That's okay,
but that's the easy one, right?

970
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,800
Understanding how the game works
question will come on the screen

971
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,760
and your answers will be basically
coming on your screen and solve

972
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,280
and you get to answer that Pretty simple
and straightforward, right?

973
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,080
All right.

974
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,400
Next question. Let's go.

975
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,400
We have 20 questions to go.

976
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,320
Who was the faster and not nyah?

977
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:30,800
Awesome.

978
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,760
And least you Geeta.

979
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,200
I hope I didn't pronounce your name right.

980
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,880
Perfect. Awesome. Awesome.
Now we're in media.

981
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,120
I think more than 70. Now,

982
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,400
which of the following is not?

983
00:54:42,400 --> 00:55:04,160
Remember not a phase in SDLC.

984
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,560
All right, There you go.

985
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,840
That's awesome.

986
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,800
63% of you said performance based.

987
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,320
Absolutely. That's correct.
That's correct. Right there.

988
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,560
Only two three people got it wrong
that by the way,

989
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,160
it's code dot I, you spelled it wrong.

990
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,440
And this saw in the screen.

991
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,920
That's why you're going to the wrong spot.

992
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,720
You are URL is wrong.

993
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,480
All right. Good job, guys.
Very good. Jody.

994
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,160
You guys got it.

995
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,080
So that means we have
what is it, six people joint Should

996
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,000
maybe more will come in the future.

997
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,400
Louis All right.

998
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,760
Louis Number one, that means your look
at Mama G is a four pin place is.

999
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,440
Good job, Maria.

1000
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,960
All right, let's.

1001
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,320
At which phase of SDLC testing begins.

1002
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,600
I remember this question

1003
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,840
on site.

1004
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,440
Woo hoo hoo!

1005
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:15,800
Wow. We're very split over here
at which phase of SDLC testing begins.

1006
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,400
And remember, guys, Yes,
of course we do the physical testing,

1007
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,600
manual automation and the testing phase,
but we don't do it in the design phase.

1008
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,960
We don't do any development.

1009
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,520
We do in the requirements phase.

1010
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,200
Remember, that's
why this one is a tricky one though.

1011
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,680
But it's good
at least you guys are getting.

1012
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,600
So remember, testing starts
in the requirement efficiently when we are

1013
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,040
all verifying
basically through the smart criteria.

1014
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,240
All right, this one, we could have done
better, but that's fine.

1015
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,760
It was a little tricky.

1016
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,760
Joseph. Okay. Joseph, one time.

1017
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,320
Let's go.

1018
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,520
Let's go.

1019
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,600
In the question, what is the requirement?

1020
00:56:53,600 --> 00:57:02,880
Very simple questions, guys.

1021
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,160
Read carefully everything and then answer

1022
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,680
it or

1023
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,160
all of the above.

1024
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,760
Sometimes,
you know, I'm in college or high school.

1025
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,760
A lot of times
when you got all of the above,

1026
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,880
you just might ask
usually the correct answer.

1027
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,120
So remember, it might not be sometimes
what is a requirement, it is a description

1028
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:35,440
of functionality of the target system
is the expectation of users from software.

1029
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,320
Product is a description of services
that software must provide.

1030
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,120
So all of it makes sense, right?

1031
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,000
And it applies to all of the above
for this one, that's the safest answer.

1032
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,080
Absolutely right.

1033
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:49,960
All right.

1034
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,080
Well,
that has the highest answer for good job,

1035
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,680
at least until we know
the following is true

1036
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,840
about Agile methodology,
which is true true

1037
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,760
all of the above it.

1038
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,840
Here is the incremental process
to build software.

1039
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,440
Absolutely.

1040
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,760
Remember, we build it in spin is a process
where changes are adapted easily.

1041
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,120
Yes, absolutely.

1042
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,080
Because we get them in the spring demo
and then we basically make it happen

1043
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,160
is a time box of true
approach for software delivery

1044
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,240
time bugs basically means
is that can sprint right All of the above

1045
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,600
and arrested that's

1046
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,520
okay guys it happens but overall
good good job on this one.

1047
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,680
Better better could have been
a little better but still very good.

1048
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,760
All right.

1049
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,840
We got we got some
we got changing happening.

1050
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,840
We'll see towards the end
who's the winner?

1051
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,960
Which one of the following is not a scrum

1052
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,440
artifact?

1053
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,680
The artifact

1054
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,800
you got to live with Sprint backlog.

1055
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,680
Remember, on the artifact
side, burned down.

1056
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,400
Try this point backlog.

1057
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,720
We look at the official one.

1058
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,280
There was no.

1059
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,360
You grew the story,
of course, part of the sprint.

1060
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,240
The stock was specifically
in that category.

1061
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,600
There is no use history as theory.

1062
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,600
So little tricky question.

1063
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,480
I know, but you guys still did
pretty decent on this one.

1064
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,440
That's what we went over review, right?

1065
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,400
Why I'm doing so much practice because
this thing will take time to stick in

1066
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,160
and that's why the group
project is very important.

1067
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,840
All right, let's see.

1068
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,640
Alan is on top. There you go.

1069
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,600
We got a completely new people now.

1070
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,640
I said, All right, great, great.

1071
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,840
Number seven.

1072
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:21,080
Which one of the following
is not a scrum row?

1073
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,760
And therefore we just looked at

1074
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:48,720
this is not a scrum.

1075
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,440
Oh, okay.

1076
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,560
There you go.

1077
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,280
Remember product owners? Absolutely.

1078
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,760
There, guys, Come on. The product.

1079
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,000
Good is
there is a scrum roll development team.

1080
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,200
We test through everyone.

1081
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,200
I was the head scrum master there.

1082
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,080
We don't have a product manager
as a title in there.

1083
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,520
Right.
So there you go. It gets a little tricky.

1084
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,400
So now I know majority of you got
got it right.

1085
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,160
But still remember Product Order
Development Team and Scrum Master

1086
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:16,040
they're part of the they are
the scrum will product manager however

1087
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,800
is absolutely
not are you guys doing so far

1088
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,960
out of the contract

1089
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,960
that will keep it going.

1090
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,640
Who is responsible for prioritizing

1091
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:38,240
the product backlog?

1092
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:38,680
Don't

1093
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,880
remember prioritizing

1094
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:52,840
the product backlog.

1095
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,280
Right.

1096
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:01,280
It adds suspense.

1097
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,280
All right, good, good.

1098
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,920
Majority of you got a good amount of

1099
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,760
you got a guy who is responsible
for the product backlog, right?

1100
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,920
Only one person, product owner
who can move things around testers.

1101
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:14,080
Scrum has no one.

1102
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,800
Then there's no project manager
title in Agile.

1103
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,600
Remember that?

1104
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:23,920
So product owner is the only one who can
take away your work not accepting it.

1105
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,080
Client wants this.

1106
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,680
They can basically organize
and prioritize times

1107
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,920
meaning okay, what's going to be worked on
in the future?

1108
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,800
Sprint Right.

1109
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,960
They can be the only one
making that decision.

1110
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,040
All right. Good job.

1111
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:43,840
Let's see if Alan, Luis or Jose,
which are the following

1112
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,200
meeting, is not part of Scrum
and some tricky ones.

1113
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:48,440
There

1114
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,280
is going to be

1115
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,280
this little is losing

1116
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:18,360
in rank product review meeting.

1117
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,000
We don't have this as part of a meeting.
Right?

1118
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,200
See, remember daily stand up is always
their sprint planning meeting.

1119
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,640
Is there Sprint retrospective meeting?

1120
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,560
Is there a product review meetings?

1121
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,800
We don't have such meeting like that.

1122
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,480
That's called product review meetings.

1123
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,680
We got a money guy.

1124
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,720
That's a good job, guys.

1125
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,680
Very good

1126
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,680
arena for how to write.

1127
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,400
Good for team player.

1128
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,480
Just hit answers.

1129
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,560
Good. Awesome. Awesome.

1130
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,920
Let's do a burn down chart shows what

1131
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:21,240
items of want.

1132
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,960
Good job, The progress of the work
and futures completed.

1133
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,680
Very good on this with the decline
in energy level on the team.

1134
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,800
What I hope
that's that was a mistake right there.

1135
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,080
Right

1136
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,960
so guys good job on this

1137
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,520
island. Island is on fire.

1138
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,400
It looks like someone's about to take us.

1139
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,840
No one is challenging Alan higher
to the podium and say question in limbo.

1140
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,920
What is a sprint at the one

1141
01:04:55,600 --> 01:05:15,520
in? I know some of the reason

1142
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,760
one president said the phone came

1143
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:24,200
okay at time but spirit of potentially
shipping will work.

1144
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,680
Yeah that's
what it is is definitely not the phone

1145
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,680
carrier in this context guys

1146
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,760
it is not directly during the last week

1147
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,320
or two of the project
period of high productivity.

1148
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,520
No is just the time for a timeout meaning
where basically a product

1149
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:42,680
is created incrementally. Right.

1150
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:46,800
So I know someone
that's someone by mistake

1151
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:50,760
I'm pretty sure pressed
and they grabbed the red button by mistake

1152
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,520
but we've got
a tricky out tries through it a little bit

1153
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:59,640
tricky questions sometimes
some easy ones there but some tricky ones.

1154
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,240
The reason for holding Sprint
respective is

1155
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,560
what is the reason in

1156
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,520
why do we hold spectrum

1157
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,840
allows the team to take a red dot

1158
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:41,960
so that allows learning that can be used
to improve team performance.

1159
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,360
So you hear you thought, okay,
we're just going to take all of the above

1160
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,760
and you get the right answer.

1161
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,440
Absolutely not the right head.

1162
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,960
I mean, this was part of it.

1163
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,280
You had build it. Absolutely.

1164
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,960
Yes. Allow learning that can be used
to improve team performance.

1165
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,240
That's the whole purpose of it, right?
Yeah.

1166
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,320
You complain here and there.

1167
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,360
But the ultimate goal is to make sure
we get some productive out of it, how

1168
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,880
we can improve the process in the future.

1169
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:09,840
That's not an issue.

1170
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,160
That's
what you just saw allows, and that's the

1171
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,720
next one.

1172
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,640
What do we have?

1173
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,840
And still feeling
it is meeting that demonstrates

1174
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,560
to the product on team
that what was accomplished

1175
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,560
during Sprint and

1176
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,480
yeah no all of it

1177
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:35,720
I just went overall and that's right
20 minutes ago

1178
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,680
or less

1179
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,040
what happens.

1180
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:01,080
All right good sprint review
slash demo meeting that's the main

1181
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,920
one you have where you're showcasing
what was built, right?

1182
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,640
That's what we focus a lot.

1183
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,360
Respect, respected, not sprint planning
or stakeholder meeting.

1184
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,560
That's not even part of Scrum.

1185
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,800
There's the good job so far.

1186
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,280
Let's see.

1187
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,560
Wow. Luis back
and then Marino for HUD and Bill.

1188
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:20,800
All right, great.

1189
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,160
The bill has the highest answer
streak of 12.

1190
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,400
You got while writing the runner Bill.

1191
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,440
Good job.

1192
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:32,880
Also,
who defines the business priority of every

1193
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:37,280
business?

1194
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,520
I'm thinking

1195
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:52,960
right

1196
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,680
now on a business priority of every user.

1197
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:03,240
And remember, a product owner is the only
one who prioritize the backlog, right?

1198
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,280
They're the one who knows the case.

1199
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:08,160
Customer client wants this
this items to be worked on.

1200
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,240
We need to some business priority. Right.

1201
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,560
So not the scrum mass and not Scrum team.

1202
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,240
Scrum team project manager doesn't exist.

1203
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,680
It's the product or a good job on this.

1204
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,880
A lot of you guys got it right. Awesome.

1205
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:21,920
All right,

1206
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:27,000
speed testers, back with an answer

1207
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,840
or the do we have
what is Scrum Master rule?

1208
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:31,520
That's the easy one

1209
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,840
or jab all of the above

1210
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:57,080
this time to work right Ensure
scrum is fully functional and productive.

1211
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,440
Communicates to product owner and team
shield the team from external interfaces.

1212
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,280
That's the role of what a Scrum Master is
supposed to do the job on this one, guys,

1213
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,120
they do multiple things.

1214
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,880
By the end of the day
they are a benefit to us

1215
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,640
in the delivered straight street,

1216
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,960
Asia and street right now to

1217
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,920
where are all the user stories
to all of them.

1218
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:27,880
So database and the burn down chart

1219
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,720
but really

1220
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:46,800
this is in the product backlog
guys that are sprint

1221
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,840
backlog and is definitely not a database
guy it's not.

1222
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,920
I know that's a tricky right
there is definitely not in the burn out

1223
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:57,040
absolute product backlog have

1224
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,000
all the user stories do I remember

1225
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,240
is that accumulation
and combination of all of it

1226
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,120
and it's still on top with
looks like we know who's going to be

1227
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,240
the winner and is going to come back
with three in a row.

1228
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:10,480
Good job, man.

1229
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,040
We need everyone's good. Good.

1230
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,040
All right.

1231
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,240
What is the time?
Bucks for daily scrum meeting

1232
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:36,680
and and then

1233
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:49,760
they go 15 minutes, not 5 minutes.

1234
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,520
Absolutely not.

1235
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,520
Not 30 minutes and not 45 minutes.

1236
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,240
15 minutes. You know, it's funny.

1237
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:00,640
I see sometimes 76
people have answered them, sometimes less.

1238
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,920
Let's go. I've got to go try to attempted

1239
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,240
even if you don't get the answers
wrong, attempted.

1240
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:07,560
All right.

1241
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,160
Good job.

1242
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:08,640
Good job.

1243
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,400
15 minutes is all I can.

1244
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,000
The meetings go over that? Absolutely can.

1245
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,960
But according to standard practice
of Scrum, it's supposed to be 15 minutes.

1246
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,560
I definitely will.

1247
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,600
You will see where time meetings
go a little bit more than that.

1248
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,520
All right.

1249
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,760
We have only three more questions left.

1250
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:46,280
What is the main
purpose of the daily standup?

1251
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,920
You're really

1252
01:12:51,440 --> 01:13:00,600
the majority of you got it.

1253
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,200
All right. You know, that's not majority.

1254
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,440
Should they give US status report this
commission?

1255
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,520
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1256
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,680
That's not the whole purpose

1257
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,840
to share what you've achieved
and all this possible impediments.

1258
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,280
That's the whole,
the whole purpose, you know,

1259
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,000
just to make sure
we don't have any issues.

1260
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,080
No. Added.

1261
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,880
Let's see if you're speaking,
if you feel us.

1262
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,640
Oh, he's still on top. There you go.

1263
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,640
All right.

1264
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,760
Looks like
we know who's going to be the number one.

1265
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,800
No, that I haven't seen. All right.

1266
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:35,480
My question nine to when is a sprint over

1267
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:59,880
and I

1268
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,680
would this to be with you

1269
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,680
more?

1270
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,480
Well, a lot of you

1271
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,760
still got this right, which is good
when the time box expires, right?

1272
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,400
That's good.

1273
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,360
Okay. So, guys, remember,
the sprint is over.

1274
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,600
We have a deadline.

1275
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,680
By that time, things are not done.

1276
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,080
Let's say this development testing
is not done on a user

1277
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,160
story was back to the product backing,
but Sprint will be done.

1278
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,880
We don't extend the for no reason.

1279
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:30,000
All right.

1280
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,880
So when the time bugs expires,
that means when the sprint is completed,

1281
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:35,640
if deadline is 5 p.m.

1282
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,920
Friday, that means everything stops.

1283
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,840
So that time everything must be done.

1284
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,680
If not, it goes back to product backlog,
some of the items that are not completed.

1285
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,960
So good job on here. Alan.

1286
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,000
Yep. Looks like you're the one,
you're the winning.

1287
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,960
One last question.

1288
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,760
What is the recommended size
for a development team?

1289
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,320
One eight people
739 less than would be guessed

1290
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:59,440
it was in the slides

1291
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:08,880
by the way.

1292
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,280
And then everyone gets

1293
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,320
more right?

1294
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,120
3 to 9. That's good.

1295
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:19,480
Less than 20 yet sure, but 3 to 9 is
the one we're looking at.

1296
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:22,080
Okay, Great job, guys. Woohoo!

1297
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,280
That was it. Let's see who we got.

1298
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,400
17 out of 20 was all far.

1299
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,400
Muhammad out one second.

1300
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:34,080
And of course
that's going to be Mr. Allen.

1301
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:35,280
I think so.

1302
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,440
What are you going?

1303
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,360
All right, guys.

1304
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,280
Good job, Alan.

1305
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,560
You got 17 out of 20 only.

1306
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:44,200
Thank you.

1307
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:48,480
All of you got 17 out of 20
was just the speed.

1308
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,360
Yeah, I mean, Ali was very competitive. I

1309
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,600
lot of guys will do games like this
all the time.

1310
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,360
Time to time,
of course, as topic gets strange,

1311
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,480
but I hope you guys enjoyed it Did.

1312
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,480
You guys enjoy this game,

1313
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:05,600
right?

1314
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,280
Yeah, it's won a lot of people.

1315
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,360
It was

1316
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:15,760
it gives a little bit of more excitement
to it.

1317
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,280
Right.

1318
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,200
All right, guys.
Now what we're going to do.

1319
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,840
Okay, I'm not going to give you a break
or anything today

1320
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,120
because the rest of the class,
you guys will be now working as a group.

1321
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,800
So let me explain to you
what is the next task that we have?

1322
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,520
Okay.

1323
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:34,680
So to do this case,
we have a task of this.

1324
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:35,280
Okay?

1325
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:39,240
What we want to do is
I have these some simple rules.

1326
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,080
Let me show you.

1327
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,520
First, let me show you
what our students do in the past.

1328
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,840
So you have an idea group activity, which

1329
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:51,040
let me pick some the two.

1330
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,120
Hello, everyone.

1331
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,000
This is our team. With

1332
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:57,360
what?

1333
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,440
What did I do? All right, good.

1334
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,680
Sorry, I say I just called America.

1335
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:07,280
Plus, overseas, we have a seven members
and we will talk about that right off

1336
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,680
topics today.

1337
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,200
It's a continuous collaborator and

1338
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:16,480
and he can hire us first
and he can fire lodging, I'll tell you.

1339
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,640
So he's a very important person
I would like to look at

1340
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:23,640
Role does not have any
I won't go into that.

1341
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,800
But let me show you quickly basically
what I want you guys to do, right?

1342
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,560
This is 19.

1343
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,640
The whole purpose of this activities,
guys.

1344
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,280
You see,
I went over the review with you guys 130,

1345
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,440
40 minutes reviewing it,
and then we did the quiz over there.

1346
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,000
Some concepts are still maybe
not too clear. Right?

1347
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,000
What I want you guys to do, right.

1348
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,920
This can be within 5 to 7 people.
Remember?

1349
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,320
Now you pick each other.

1350
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,520
It's going to be activity, right?

1351
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,080
I want you guys to pick each other.

1352
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,200
Let's see whether you are problem
specific.

1353
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,520
Stay plenty.

1354
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,280
You got to have to communicate now.

1355
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,080
And if someone is left out,
I'll help out over here.

1356
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,520
Right.

1357
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,800
What you guys want to do?

1358
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,920
Get together and then accordingly we have

1359
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,040
some basically
the same thing that you went over.

1360
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:10,680
We want to explain each and every part
under one group, right?

1361
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,800
So let's say Scrum team
and artifacts will go like this.

1362
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,080
If you have six members in a team, right,
you will go each and every one of you

1363
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,600
first
talk about this. Okay? We need to explain,

1364
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,240
you know, what is a product owner?

1365
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:23,960
What do they do?

1366
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,880
What a scrum match development.

1367
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:28,560
Each person participates in this

1368
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,000
recording like as a group, basically,
and explaining what they do.

1369
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,040
What you understanding
is, can we be nine people?

1370
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:37,920
Yeah, you can.

1371
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,760
But remember this.

1372
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:42,200
You might have to pick,
let's say a couple of these, right?

1373
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,160
I give you a complete freedom
of which one you want to pick.

1374
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,000
But don't do this.

1375
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,200
If you're six people, you shouldn't
be picking one, two, three, four.

1376
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,320
You should be picking one with six
and that's it, right?

1377
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,440
So you guys can pick the team.

1378
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:59,280
And what the whole point of it is speaking
because you need to know this verbal.

1379
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:03,920
You should be comfortable basically
speaking about what a product owner is,

1380
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:08,640
what a tester, what sorry, what
what sprint planning is stand up meeting.

1381
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,640
Spend time on this first,
when you get in a group,

1382
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,480
what you guys are going to do is
first of all, once you guys get in group,

1383
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,640
you guys are going to do this
on, you're going to do on Zoom, right?

1384
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,120
So basically the way how people
did their recording to each other,

1385
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,440
I recorded them stuff.

1386
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,600
They got on Zoom

1387
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,840
each person went ahead and explained,
Let's see what a product owner does.

1388
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,160
Someone might say, What a Scrum
master, whatever,

1389
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,800
whichever activity group
they picked, basically, right?

1390
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,280
That's what you can guys
come up with your own team,

1391
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,080
whatever you want to call your seven.

1392
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,240
We've seen some funny names.

1393
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,520
Let me see
what some of the names were before,

1394
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,720
but don't pick these names.

1395
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,120
But let's see what we have.

1396
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,880
Bunker buster
as the software is due to the minions.

1397
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,400
Whatever names
you want to give each other, you know,

1398
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,160
just get together,
use Zoom, talk to each other.

1399
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,000
Here, I'm going to give you this activity.

1400
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,120
I'm going to download this and I'm
going to post this in announcements.

1401
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:00,720
Okay?

1402
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:04,120
So I'm going to post this in as a PDF.

1403
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,480
That's fine,

1404
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:06,840
guys.

1405
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,360
This is your group activity.

1406
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,880
Okay, So look at

1407
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:18,840
I'm just attaching this

1408
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:26,400
in groups.

1409
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:26,920
Okay?

1410
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:32,040
That's basically where you want to pick
your, your, your, your caddy.

1411
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,360
You want to speak. Okay.

1412
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,320
This is you're going to start it today.

1413
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:39,120
Some of you can finish this, but
I want this absolutely done by tomorrow.

1414
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:39,720
Right.

1415
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,040
And I'm going to give you the link guys.

1416
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,200
You're going to be sharing this.

1417
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,320
Let me put this the link over here.

1418
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:46,200
Whoops, Not here,

1419
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,200
you guys.

1420
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:49,840
That's

1421
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,160
a low pick.

1422
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,920
There's so many groups.

1423
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,280
Sometimes it gets confusing.

1424
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,800
I share this, so let me copy this.

1425
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:06,040
Oops.

1426
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:06,440
Okay.

1427
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,640
I put this group in here
that's in the course announcement.

1428
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:14,200
Here is where basically
you gonna record your responses, guys.

1429
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,280
So look at the course announcement
when you click on that.

1430
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,720
For example,

1431
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,400
you were

1432
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:25,160
it takes you to the SDLC
as a response rate.

1433
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:28,680
So what you want to do,
guys, is within your group together,

1434
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:33,520
you know, get together all talk about it,
record your recording by the rate,

1435
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:37,800
record it to zoom locally which are you do
and then you can add your responses

1436
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:42,480
You can either recorded here
or you can basically upload the file right

1437
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:47,040
This allows you flip, it allows
you about 5 to 10 minutes.

1438
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,280
If it goes over, it's absolutely fine.

1439
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:50,920
It can be, let's say,

1440
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,520
more than five or 10 minutes
because we want you all to do it.

1441
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,040
So this is a group activity.

1442
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,240
Unless you do not finish guys,
unless you do not

1443
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:02,760
finish, then you can basically try
to finish by tomorrow.

1444
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,800
But I want everyone right now to go ahead
and start talking to each other.

1445
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,880
Remember, you can do each other or create
groups over here,

1446
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,800
get together and do this activity now.

1447
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,840
And remember,
if you're a six people, pick something,

1448
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,400
either six or if you're five, people
pick scrum ceremonies, right?

1449
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:24,360
If you have four, then
you still see all five of them, right?

1450
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:27,680
If you are more than four,
you're like eight of them.

1451
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,760
Try not to go too crazy
with the team, right?

1452
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,040
Then pick at least couple of them, right.

1453
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,960
Six and four or something like that

1454
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,800
and I can explain how to record it. Yes.

1455
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,840
So, guys, what you do is when you're going
to do this, remember this.

1456
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,240
You can log off from this class today.

1457
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:48,080
Once you get together in Zoom, you know,
you can record it

1458
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,720
and you can upload the five.

1459
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:53,720
Now, this allows you to record
over here as well do when

1460
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,760
when you click on let me Libya open that
and it will tell you

1461
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,520
what the limitation I've seen
if you do the recording through flip

1462
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,960
get directly
you see right here and response

1463
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:08,160
it allows you to start recording
if you allowed camera and everything

1464
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:11,440
but the only thing is limited to
you do it at all.

1465
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:11,760
Yeah.

1466
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,600
There's a scene in my bedroom
and I want to show you my bedroom.

1467
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,000
But anyway, see you right here.

1468
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,920
Basically you to record right there.

1469
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,560
Once you record it, what happens is

1470
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,160
it allows you only few minutes.

1471
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:29,520
So it's better to use
actual zoom in there.

1472
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:33,600
Once you use zoom,
it can be longer than five in 10 minutes

1473
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,960
and you can upload the file.

1474
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,640
So it gives you the opportunity
to upload the file.

1475
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,360
Actually.

1476
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,680
So this how we do doesn't make sense.

1477
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:42,160
It's pretty straightforward,

1478
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:46,200
but unless someone is confused,
I want to make sure I am clear on this.

1479
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,640
Anyone to join our team?

1480
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,120
Remember guys, you can say this.

1481
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,320
Alex, Anthony, lock down
whoever it is where the team busters.

1482
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,960
Remember, you guys get together,

1483
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,720
we need a member of three or four,
let's say, right.

1484
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:00,600
Got to need four. Okay, Communicate.

1485
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,760
And by the way, in Slack,
you guys can do each other.

1486
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:08,160
I don't know if you guys know this or not,
but you guys can DM other.

1487
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,640
So in Slack in direct message, you can add
people in, start a conversation there.

1488
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:18,160
So I want anyone who doesn't have,
let's say a group or anyone, right?

1489
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,640
I can try to assign here.

1490
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,920
My hope for our goal right now
is to make sure you guys

1491
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:25,920
have team members.

1492
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,160
So Mohammad, the brother and sisters
are in team who wants to join them.

1493
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,840
Remember, I want you guys to communicate

1494
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:39,120
more this way because I in the past
we would create the groups for you.

1495
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,400
But what happened was
you don't want to break that barrier.

1496
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,520
You know, you guys are classmates, right?

1497
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:47,480
So try communicate with each other, right?

1498
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,840
So maybe guys, you can say it is New York.

1499
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,040
Who's from New York?
Anyone wants to join here?

1500
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,520
Let's join. Who's from West goes.

1501
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,600
Okay, me, me, me.

1502
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,600
Let's join together.

1503
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,000
Okay. Virginia guys can be together.

1504
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,280
Your group?
Absolutely. International groups.

1505
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:08,200
You guys can meet together. See?

1506
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,360
Was in California

1507
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,320
the way someone is doing it, right?

1508
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,360
Who's in California?

1509
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,080
Respond to that comment.

1510
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,520
Who's around Texas?

1511
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,800
That's fine.

1512
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,080
Remember the best way
to get this organized

1513
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:28,080
is, let's say,
Mustafa Common, Virginia tester.

1514
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,720
You probably want to comment under there,
right?

1515
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,360
Hey, I'm here. Let's join
let's join Virginia test right.

you know,

1576
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,760
I'm not a fan of math, but I'm using my

1577
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,880
in this class once I get

1578
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,960
one of them nice piece of equipment

1579
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:53,520
I issue. Yes.

1580
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,320
When you want to do your zoom meeting

1581
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,400
amongst each other,
you can leave this meeting.

1582
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,240
I'm just here
to navigate people and everything.

1583
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:03,360
All right, So let me change my chair,
my screen definition.

1584
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:07,120
You can see you share it when you do this.

1585
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,560
All right, guys,
you can see my screen right?

1586
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:10,800
Right here.

1587
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,160
Right.

1588
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,920
So, guys, remember,
you can direct chat each other, right?

1589
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:18,240
So, for example, James, let's see here

1590
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,240
are, let's say, right
and all the people right.

1591
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,680
And you can basically start stars
start a group this way, right?

1592
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,440
Once you do this, you know,
you can add people, right?

1593
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:31,800
Add this people and you can start a chat
together this way.

1594
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,320
So do that, this way, this way.

1595
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,760
You guys can all just communicate
with each other

1596
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,640
whether you want to do it
now, later on, whatever you want to do.

1597
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:48,360
But I think this is going to be
the best way.

1598
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,760

01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:47,760

1687
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:54,480
I'm trying to break
the ice is like matchmaking over here.

1688
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:57,720
And we were
I used to create teams, but I was like,

1689
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:02,640
let me make them get together,
you know, open the conversation.

1690
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:04,480
Okay, Ahmad, you need a team right now.

1691
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:07,480
Why don't you go ahead and join

1692
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,320
Mohamed's team right there?

1693
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:11,640
Go ahead.

1694
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:11,960
Okay.

Alexi And you guys can join Mohamed's team
Sometimes If you have more than,

1696
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:22,640

01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,880
Yes, You need to

01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:29,760
The same way that you joined Zoom right
there, you can edit

1700
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,360
and you can start a new meeting.

1701
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:34,480
Once you start a new meeting,
you know, everyone just share that link

1702
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,240
and you can basically be there.

1703
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:40,160
Oh, sorry, guys.

1704
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:43,040
Let me let me make the public one second.

1705
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:45,640
Thank you. Well, I will make that public.

1706
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:46,560
Everyone that

1707
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,480
should be active.

1708
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:09,160
No, no, no.

1709
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:10,600
You don't come back here today.

1710
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:13,720
I want you guys
to all focus on this today.

1711
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:37,480
No worries.

1712
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:39,680
Okay? Who wants to join the Bulls team?

1713
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:43,520
Anyone missing who doesn't have anyone who
whose by themself?

1714
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:46,320
Let's get real.

1715
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:49,320
Let's get you some two more people

1716
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,640
missing members.

1717
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:59,320
I have a group speak now.

1718
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,320
So, Mohammed, let me just make it clear.

1719
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,440
You depending on your team size, pick

1720
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:07,120
any of these topics, Scrum ceremonies,

1721
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:12,120
Scrum team and artifacts
as DLC or terminology.

1722
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:15,800
Pick whichever one if you're six members,
pick any of these one right here.

1723
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,760
So once you pick this, okay,
then you assign each other aide.

1724
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:22,760
I'll talk about product order,
what a product owner does, what

1725
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:23,880
their role is, etc.

1726
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,160
Then another person will talk about
Scrum Master,

1727
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:27,720
someone else will talk about development.

1728
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:28,960
And who are the people that Sarah

1729
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:32,640
Yes, guys,

1730
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:35,360
I give you full freedom to pick
whichever one you want to.

1731
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:38,480
But remember,
if you're six people and do not pick

1732
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,280
the one as deals
sorry, don't pick the terminology

1733
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,600
because there's only four points
over there. Right?

1734
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,920
So pick six or five.

1735
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,320
Someone can repeat again if that's par.

1736
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:53,480
If you guys want to pick either
organize, you have the freedom to pick

1737
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:57,840
whichever you want to.

1738
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,280
Yeah, let me check on the link, guys.
Give me one second.

1739
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:02,880
Let me figure out what in the world
the link is not asking

1740
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,480
me one second.

1741
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,280
Meanwhile, let me get you together.

1742
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,160
I will work on this

1743
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:23,880
one second.

1744
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:25,920
Guys, let me figure out why
the link is not working.

1745
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,360
But meanwhile, still,
keep in mind, guys, get going each other.

1746
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:32,320
Let's see. We're seven people.

1747
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,080
What do we choose?

1748
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,480
Mohammed? Remember,
you can pick any of them.

1749
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:38,680
And remember,
you can add an extra one from there.

1750
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,720
When you
leave this room and start a group.

1751
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,720
Yes, you can. Let me work on the link.

1752
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:45,600
Let me make it active.

1753
01:38:45,600 --> 01:39:31,400
Guys, one second.

1754
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,800
It will

1755
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,440
actually

1756
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:45,960
important

1757
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,560
guys, don't worry.

1758
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,800
Just get in the groups right
now. Record your video.

1759
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,800
I'm working on the link

1760
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,800
and there's a little problem with it,
but you can button next to 3 minutes.

1761
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,400
I'll fix it. Get the topic.

1762
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:04,240
Topic is I one was no

1763
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,720
guys still any members
who don't have a group.

1764
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,280
Please speak up so we can add you.

1765
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:44,920
I can navigate you.

1766
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:49,000
Yes. Or one you can choose any topic
you want to remember.

1767
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,000
Try to choose between the group size.

1768
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,320
If you're six, try to go with the 613

1769
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:04,520
ones.

1770
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:05,280
It might work

1771
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,880
and you

1772
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,120
agree is working fine.

1773
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:22,280
I'm just changing the settings
because I think it's not allowing people

1774
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:26,040
to jump on this for me one minute

1775
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:50,240
and everyone in there,

1776
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,400
remember,
if you need to do your group, think zoom

1777
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:56,760
once you need to log out of this ones
and join there.

1778
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:57,960
You don't need to be here.

1779
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:16,080
You can do both at once.

1780
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,520
I live there in the course announcement,
guys.

1781
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,600
Course announcement in the channel
right there.

1782
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:22,440
You'll see right there, of course.

1783
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:25,240
And I was on the left side under channels
is where you're going to see

1784
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:27,840
all the instructions
and you're going to see

1785
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,160
at the same time the flip get ring.

1786
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:34,800
But meanwhile work with your team members
get together,

1787
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,000
flip, girdling, let me fix it.

1788
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,040
Something is up with that.

1789
01:43:38,040 --> 01:44:09,800
So I'll I'll fix that for you guys. Yes.

1790
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:12,400
You guys can leave the meetings
and then you can join

1791
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,120
you can join your each other teams.

1792
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:17,280
And that's where you can do your

1793
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:18,960
Mahamat.

1794
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:22,160
Try to also DM each other.

1795
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:29,280
For how many members are in your group to

1796
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,080
I live depending on your team size.

1797
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:37,240
Pick the one from the from the pdf.

1798
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:41,400
Whichever one you can do the ceremony is
you can do the artifacts whichever

1799
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:50,560
depending you guys have freedom to pick
whichever you want to.

1800
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,720
Let me figure out what's going on with the

1801
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,200
flip grid.

1802
01:44:54,200 --> 01:45:39,960
Guys, can you one second?

1803
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,920
Yes, I guess I'm just trying
to work on the link that I muted myself

1804
01:45:44,520 --> 01:46:11,040
just for the time being,
but I think it's going to be working now.

1805
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:11,560
All right, guys.

1806
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:14,160
I'm seeing more people joining this,
so that's good.

1807
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:19,480
You guys should be able
to go ahead and record in there.

1808
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,800
I see more members join that.

1809
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,000
So that means the link is working fine.

1810
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,640
Anyone else lost or confused right
anything?

1811
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:49,840
Just speak in here so I can navigate you.

1812
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:50,800
Okay, Nabeel.

1813
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:55,760
Okay, so now all your members, all what
I want you to do the time each other.

1814
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:57,720
Eight Start a group, chat with each other.

1815
01:46:57,720 --> 01:46:59,880
Let's say all get together.

1816
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:04,120
Someone will log out of this one,
share a Zoom link grade

1817
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,800
a meeting with each other.

1818
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,000
Then all of you join.

1819
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:11,120
Basically join, discuss
which topic you want to pick.

1820
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:12,240
Let's say from there,

1821
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:16,440
why don't you select the topic once
you select the topic, then okay, start

1822
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:17,120
recording it.

1823
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,760
Once you record that you know what
you recorded,

1824
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
you can upload the file from the zoom on
or directly in flip it.

1825
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,240
That's basically how you want you do it.

1826
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:27,040
And the view

1827
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:30,840
all the members that you talk to,
you can just tag them in here in chat

1828
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:32,880
and then you can start a conversation
with them.

1829
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:36,360
So Once you guys have at least an idea of,

1830
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:50,640
you know what's going on and you can
then start recording it.

1831
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:53,320
So if you remember who
your members were in your group,

1832
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,280
so can tag them and then

1833
01:47:56,280 --> 01:48:00,080
let's see, okay, It's a hard

1834
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:52,760
or a hard let's see who else was there?

1835
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:54,480
Mohammad, Which group are you in?

1836
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,320
Okay, let me ask you this.

1837
01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:01,040
Only people who don't have a group right
now just type in, not in the live form.

1838
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,880
So I can then give you guys groups

1839
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:18,760
notation.

1840
01:49:18,760 --> 01:50:06,200
You don't need to come back to Zoom, put.

1841
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:06,960
Yes. I'm sorry.

1842
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,840
You need to leave the meeting
and do a meeting in Zoom with each other.

1843
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,640
You group members? Absolutely.

1844
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:28,720
Now you got it.

1845
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:33,600
Everyone from one group, just one person,
Mustafa from the group can record

1846
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,600
and then one person can basically upload
for the whole group.

1847
01:50:37,200 --> 01:51:01,560
It's easier
instead of uploading separate one. Yes.

1848
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:03,760
Everyone should be presenting
in the meeting. Absolutely.

1849
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:05,520
The whole point of it, again,

1850
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,400
is to get you guys comfortable
in talking to each other

1851
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:12,800
and at the same time
speaking about these ceremonies again

1852
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:16,720
every day because a very critical part
of the of the class, let's see

1853
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:41,320
if someone else is lost
and still help out.

1854
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:43,800
Let me do this, guys,
to make it easier for you.

1855
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:49,080
I see whoever doesn't have a group,
I'll add you right now myself in a DM,

1856
01:51:49,440 --> 01:52:00,240
so I'll get you guys all together.

1857
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,560
Okay. Mohammad, You.

1858
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,080
Let's see. Amara, let me do this.

1859
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:09,120
You guys have a group
I can add you to Amara in the Bills group.

1860
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:10,160
Let me do this. Let me.

1861
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:12,320
Let me message you guys. Okay, I'll say

1862
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,640
and do this

1863
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:18,800
more.

1864
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:19,840
We'll

1865
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:23,080
get this.

1866
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,520
Perfect.

1867
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,560
Now you see my message right there, Right.

1868
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:32,280
Okay,
who else do we need in there in that chat

1869
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:37,880
you can add in there.

1870
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:40,200
All right, Omar, Nabeel,
you guys can chat.

1871
01:52:40,200 --> 01:52:42,400
Let's add Mama to your group as well. Do.

1872
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,960
And in this group,
when guys to get together,

1873
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:59,080
someone just to Centrelink
and get all my thing,

1874
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:02,400
they Jordi everyone right now has a group
and they've started.

1875
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:06,280
But again, if anyone has lost anything,

1876
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:12,960
I'm here to help you get a team,
which is the easier process to do it all.

1877
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:39,280
I think it gives it a challenging,
but we're getting there.

1878
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:41,280
No, Nabeel,
you don't need to create a new account.

1879
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:44,000
The zoom you have,
it gives you an option of a meeting

1880
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,760
so you can see the meeting option in Zoom.

1881
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:50,800
So if you have downloaded Zoom in general,
you can use it.

1882
01:53:50,800 --> 01:54:19,360
And when you open zoom, you will see
you will see an option of meeting.

1883
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:23,160
By the way,
I shared another link also in in Zoom,

1884
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:27,840
so I might even zoom in in Slack you can
you can try it over

1885
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,160
there should work fine for you guys

1886
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:43,600
perfect new link I

1887
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:46,720
put in there guys
you can click on the SDLC all.

1888
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,120
We are from the flip grid one.

1889
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:50,320
You can just do it there

1890
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,960
for anyone else.

1891
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,560
Let's see anyone else
who does not have a team.

1892
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:25,360
A little fast.

1893
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:25,960
Anything.

1894
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:35,440
Let me work with you
so you guys are good to go.

1895
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:36,840
Oh, very good.

1896
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:39,520
If you want to start a meeting
within, let's say

1897
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:44,040
each other,
you can just do this entire meeting.

1898
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,200
I mean, that's.

1899
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:50,320
So are you communicating, Noel,
within your team?

1900
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,080
Team members,

1901
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,360
stop recording this progress.
