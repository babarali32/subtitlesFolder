1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,480
According to Smith,

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,360
all road students

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,200
last number

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,160
eight

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,080
according to canvas
last class of the timber

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,720
fire.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,000
And we're almost on the verge to complete

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,520
their paperwork will deliver almost 90% of

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,400
the remaining 10%
desirable contribution metrics.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's pick Right.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,280
So first, let's quickly go to
what are the links, the debates,

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,520
what are the things we covered in
yesterday's issue?

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,080
Edmunds?

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:01:04,560
What was the first thing
that we really asserted?

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,080
Scruggs.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,440
What was the first topic
we learned in the studies class?

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,320
Got it. Got it.

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,240
The first thing was using

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,920
each object more of

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,480
the right

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,600
functions in in

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,840
respective classes.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,120
Correct.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,080
The very first thing, what we did

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,200
this one correct.

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,600
Now, according
to this particular function,

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,920
according to this particular function,
what we are doing here in this function

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,200
is related to one particular class.

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,760
Right.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,680
If we have any function which we see
which is given for this particular screen

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,000
in the application.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,880
So instead of writing that function
in our class,

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,120
according to three locators
there, we can write

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,200
this particular method in this class
or to set in the speech itself.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,000
And then instead of calling to three
locators begin, simply call one method

36
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,520
correct. This

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,600
disconnect, and

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,880
then we can do these things
for polymorphism.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,400
Yes. Yes.

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,080
Correct.

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,640
Now, after this, in common methods,

42
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,080
we came up with the requirement
of very common operations.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,080
The operations
which we perform every now and then,

44
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,040
for example, say,
to give the operation Click operation.

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,520
And then we saw a couple of more scenarios
associated to this particular

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
operations. For example,

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
same gives method.

48
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,240
But every time when we are going
to send the data before that,

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,720
it might happen that there is some data
available in that particular suit.

50
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,880
Right.

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,840
In that case,
if I'm simply sending the new data,

52
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,760
it will come, it will add
with the previous data, existing data.

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,320
So for example, if it was this day
and I am sending one, two, three,

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,520
so my final value becomes
absolutely not going to be correct.

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,520
In that case, in that case, missing
that he was going to create.

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,640
So now, according to the minimum,

57
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,000
what we have to do
first, we have to clear the

58
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,200
and then we have to save the date.

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,600
These are the two things
we need to perform.

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,960
But if I'm using these operations,

61
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,040
it gives operation
every now and then in the application. C

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,600
15 times, 20 times are 2000 times, right?

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,640
Every time I have to call the near doors,
it gives me an

64
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,280
uneasy. Suddenly I'm coding same methods.

65
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,000
Two times I do methods this much of times
again and again.

66
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,080
It's not going to make any sense.

67
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
So what we did,

68
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,720
we created a class called Common Methods

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,640
in this Common methods.

70
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,360
In this common methods.

71
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,760
We added the function here,
and in that function

72
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,160
we provided no clear method,

73
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,920
but so this time
we are overwriting only element

74
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,920
and the data which we need to
parse in the form of string.

75
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,720
This is what we are doing

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,000
and it's

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,200
this is what we are doing.

78
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,760
Fine.

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,240
So next time I don't need to call out
Delimiter.

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,720
Dawson gives method. No.

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,400
What I will do simply is I will call this
particular method same text

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
file locator.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,440
I already have great in mind pages
according to object model

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,520
designed by then.

85
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,080
Basically I'm using initialize
all those elements.

86
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,720
When I initialized all those elements,
I can call anything

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,920
from there
while creating the object object

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,800
I had created in big initialize
this class.

89
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,440
Next page initialize this class.

90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,440
I extend it in my common methods. Right.

91
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,880
So the same object is working
throughout my project or not.

92
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:36,280
The same object is working
toward my project.

93
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,480
So now.

94
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,760
So now things are getting to be used.

95
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,080
Things are getting absolutely reduced

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,920
and you see object calling particular

97
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,920
data is coming from either Excel by right

98
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,960
or feature file or properties
file from anywhere,

99
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,920
and the method is performing
its operations.

100
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,160
That's how we wrap up every single thing

101
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,680
with the concepts of Java.

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,080
Now we are able to connect

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,200
every single point
a method connected to my classes.

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,240
Classes are connected via objects
we are calling constructor.

105
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,560
Initialize
all these objects using my script.

106
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,360
Pre feature
files are connected to the steps.

107
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,840
If steps are connected to my
This features are connected to my classes

108
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,480
and the classes are connected
to my politics that I have already.

109
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,960
Right?

110
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,760
So now my entire project becomes a big

111
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,600
this big becomes a complete big

112
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,680
and that's what we need
single execution point.

113
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
When we use Mavin project
in Mavin project,

114
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,480
we have a single execution point
going from Don extremely high and

115
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,040
due to

116
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,800
this reason we added this particular part
as a plug in.

117
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,760
We call it Mavin.

118
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,240
Sure.

119
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,560
Why is plugging now?

120
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,680
What does what display
plugging that specifically this plug in?

121
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,360
Mavin sure.

122
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,440
But like in generally
makes our project in the form of a bead.

123
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Will a single unit connect
all the glasses, collect

124
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,160
all the packages, checks
all the functions, check all the code,

125
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,760
compile
this code, execute this code in a single

126
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,360
fully understood

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,000
always

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,040
remember

129
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,320
either you use this dandy

130
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,840
framework or you use Kimber framework.

131
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,840
You will use much better plug in
because this plug in

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,920
is related to your Mavin
notwithstanding the conversion rate.

133
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,200
So if we are working with the project,
we will always use

134
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,440
Mavin should be lucky is that everyone

135
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,680
All right.

136
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,280
So the very first method be completed

137
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,720
in the class was same method, right?

138
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:23,760
So put it in the notes.

139
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:32,240
Should note

140
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,440
the second operation in this song
was clear completion.

141
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,000
Right.

142
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,160
But we using this click operation
every time

143
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,520
without providing bit in my application.

144
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,960
It is loading
sometimes the selenium will not lead

145
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,360
unfortunately like this is will be right.

146
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,160
If it will be my best guesses then it will
affect my overall automation coverage.

147
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,800
So according to the standards, we have to
provide a sufficient amount of bead

148
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,120
so that my bead becomes loaded properly,

149
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,640
my element becomes visible on the screen

150
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,600
and it will becomes visible on the screen.

151
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,560
I can easily perform
whatever the operations

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,880
I want to perform
on the particular element, right?

153
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,640
So for that reason,
we learn to operate in selenium, right?

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,360
What are those tools?

155
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,920
Nice.

156
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,280
We have two types of works
implicit and explicit.

157
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,360
Click right between these.

158
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,760
What is the difference
between implicit and explicit?

159
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,080
Nice.

160
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,800
Christine Implicit.

161
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,880
Wade That relies on

162
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,880
time.

163
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,240
Implicit which relies on time and explicit

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,560
will relies on completion.

165
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,400
Explicit, which relies on condition.

166
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,160
Fine. Now,

167
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,960
when we talk about implicit,
we have a separate method for this

168
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,600
that were not managed
by most are implicit rate correct.

169
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,960
We have this method directly Selenium.

170
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,880
Unfortunately for explicit
we do not have an environment

171
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,960
manager timeout not explicitly.

172
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,200
We do not have a method.

173
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,280
So what we have to do,
we have to use a degree of explicit weight

174
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,840
and that a degree is web driver with

175
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,960
that driver beat

176
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,600
underscore.

177
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,720
I gave you one more explanation when we
were taking a selenium review fluently.

178
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,960
What is the difference?

179
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,400
Driver do what are explicit?

180
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,200
What is the difference

181
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,440
is before

182
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,120
explaining the topic of window
and as I gave you this explanation

183
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,360
that Luther

184
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,680
one, I'm just asking you a question
from that informative you today.

185
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
I didn't start anything yet.

186
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,440
We are just still revising.

187
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,960
My question is

188
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,400
right now.

189
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,440
So right now
we are talking about implicit weight

190
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,800
and explicit weight
in our function, right?

191
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,760
In selenium in framework.

192
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,320
So implicit work which relies on

193
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,680
which relies on implicit

194
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,680
and explicit, which is the one

195
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,720
which relies on condition setting.

196
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,000
But when I was taking, I was taking
your review sessions for selenium.

197
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,080
And that point of time
I explained one more type of make

198
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,040
implicit explicit in explicit

199
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,680
the driver and another one
was blue in the late right.

200
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,200
So when I ask what is the difference
in between the blue?

201
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,160
So how would you answer

202
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,160
that? And

203
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,640
we end.

204
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,200
We will also be relying on conditions

205
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,720
by the number of quotations
be provided in blue, incomplete.

206
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,040
So based on those number of liquidations
it removes its cycle rating.

207
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,200
Yeah, it correct or correct,
you just google it.

208
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,280
No, it just Google it.

209
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,440
Excellent.

210
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,760
The where do you see
appalling delinquency.

211
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,800
My I got this what is available there.

212
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,320
I know what frequency right.

213
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,280
So basically rate
basically when we talk about it

214
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,840
we simply for example you want to wait
for this particular condition.

215
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,000
For particular condition.

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,280
So you really wait for this condition
three times increments.

217
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,000
Then seconds one stands again is completed
again, the cycle

218
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,040
for insisting that it would again
to print the cycle audience.

219
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,280
It goes how many times? Three times. Why?

220
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Because the Model three predictions
you provided is three

221
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:26,360
ways reputation

222
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,440
of you define the reputation of times,
reputation

223
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,120
of cycle in a

224
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:48,600
the final.

225
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,360
So right then

226
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,280
that's why I always anecdotes from here
and then illustrate

227
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,360
to do this

228
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,400
maximum time for the driver
to wait for the condition the other one

229
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,480
they expect of doing to make it to
the game is used for define

230
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,000
and what is the remaining definition.

231
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,320
This is how

232
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,960
maximum determines what the

233
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,520
what exam. But if you provide 10 seconds.

234
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,120
Right and you provide three depredations,
maybe the big once is three.

235
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,240
So how many times
I wish time it would make for

236
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,920
end plus ten plus ten, three times.

237
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,120
That is a constraint.

238
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,760
This is the maximum.

239
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
So it is just
for the interview question, Right.

240
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,640
So you should know.

241
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,920
You should know what is doing great.

242
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,080
What is the primary rate?

243
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,840
What is the difference between this Indian
and any other way to use whatever

244
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
documentation mode?

245
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,760
Everyone knows it.

246
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,520
You will use the same. But it's true.

247
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,400
Names are always using the same.

248
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
I know couple of students
who have been working in a different last

249
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,120
five six years in the industry.

250
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,480
They're still using technologies
sleep an implicit every bit.

251
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,800
That's what I'm explaining. So

252
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,760
as well

253
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,040
as the frequency rate is used to define,

254
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,040
you'll give me a Venetian
if my maximum length.

255
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,440
There's why I argue is the half of
the definition is what is the big one.

256
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,600
See with which we want to check
the condition before throwing in.

257
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,600
Great.

258
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:38,160
So this is the frequency
limit number of reputation.

259
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,080
Great.

260
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,760
So now here, here we are using
which one goes in click method.

261
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,320
When we provide the method

262
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,920
which which way we could see

263
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,640
when we are providing this big method,
wait for the community method.

264
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,480
So we are using explicit, oblique,
explicit way.

265
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,760
It means migrate is relying on the mission

266
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,720
to make the element becomes clickable

267
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,400
and you'll see this condition
employed in my function.

268
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,080
Right there is

269
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,120
is this correct or not?

270
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:29,440
Then we be 11..

271
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,840
One point.

272
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,440
I just remember

273
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:40,240
already based.

274
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,640
So now now here

275
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,680
I've been using this

276
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,680
particular
for two methods for applicability

277
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,480
click method same next to method.

278
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,320
Sometimes it's important.
Sometimes it's very important, right?

279
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,880
So that everyone, everyone can be
a part of this conversation right next.

280
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,040
So we learn Excel.

281
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,240
In my opinion, lecture should not be

282
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,280
a one week conversation

283
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,120
right
when I'm delivering the lecture point.

284
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,000
When it comes to topic,
then only I should explain.

285
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,080
Right?

286
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,400
And I never allow anyone to distort
their decorum of the class when I'm

287
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,120
something important.

288
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,240
But at the same time I have to make sure
that my superiors are not getting bored.

289
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,280
I need to involve them with
the communication, with the conversation.

290
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,080
You guys can open up great. Like this.

291
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,880
If you guys get an opportunity
to speak on this particular platform.

292
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,600
Right.

293
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,840
And if I ask you to play your part here.

294
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,040
Right, definitely.

295
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,400
It will boost up your confidence.

296
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,440
At the same time,
you will get more interest in my classes.

297
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,040
I got to

298
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,960
correct

299
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,960
this philosophy for kids
also came from this background, right?

300
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,640
From the business, from here.

301
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Engagement is extremely important.

302
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,160
Business engagement rates plus liquidity,

303
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,160
and that level of engagement
is extremely important

304
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,720
the way they live.

305
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,200
And I'm saying engagement is important.

306
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,160
Everyone starts planning to get to get to

307
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,560
finance.

308
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,920
Just it's hard.

309
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,720
Congratulations.

310
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,480
And you didn't invite me very big.

311
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,120
I purchased new T-shirt for your function
and you didn't

312
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,200
wait with.

313
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,960
Excellent. Excellent.
You are very free now.

314
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:00,840
It is utilized Google go it completely.

315
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Although you have people upset
or you're frustrated.

316
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,280
I think it

317
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,680
Excellent, excellent.

318
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,880
She is happy.

319
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,560
Nice.

320
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,240
We are not, you know

321
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,000
even thinking of the boss to
and you are ready for the second one also

322
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,600
excellent second inning
is going to start nice All the very best

323
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,600
and see

324
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,800
for me is thinking about when I'm

325
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,880
going to teach in base 12.

326
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:53,840
So cutting

327
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,560
exactly

328
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,440
the moment you'll see

329
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,920
there is a restriction

330
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,240
to your freedom, to your thought process,

331
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,400
where you are
not finding new things to block

332
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,880
better the need that please

333
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:26,040
immediately.

334
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,600
Sometimes, sometimes you have
to understand one thing liquidity.

335
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,960
At this point it's start.

336
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,440
What a question, Alex.

337
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,760
It's like how you can execute your script

338
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,920
without writing it.

339
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,080
If you need to build a failure report,
you need to write or commission

340
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,680
script first, like

341
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,880
by guys,

342
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,440
now click method,
send text button vibrant.

343
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,480
Let's talk about JavaScript,
execute the method.

344
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,600
Why do we need JavaScript?

345
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,480
Execute method 10 minutes

346
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,400
Students

347
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,520
Right.

348
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,440
Sometimes in our application
there are a couple of operations

349
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,560
on which my selenium normal command

350
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,200
doesn't work, such as completion.

351
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,360
So when interacting with the code,
if my nightly operation is not working

352
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,120
or any other operation is not working,
I should be having an alternative, right?

353
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,120
So we do one alternative here
for completion

354
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
by a JavaScript execute there. Great.

355
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,800
So what is the difference in between
JavaScript executing and normal take?

356
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,520
I told you

357
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,360
this normal still in complete command
always checks for two things

358
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,280
whether the element is available there
or not, what it is intractable or not

359
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,880
great in UI clean,
but at the same time with the same thing.

360
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,720
If we talk about JavaScript
bleep work here,

361
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,640
it works with the code,
it interacts with the code.

362
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,640
All right.

363
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:15,480
The good header give you have
within the next edit beneath there.

364
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,720
So that's the difference.

365
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,080
That's the difference
in between JavaScript, execute

366
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,200
and normal click method.

367
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,080
So far so good.

368
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,600
Everyone to this point.

369
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,160
Then after that after they
we downloaded something from someone.

370
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,680
Junior. Remember this particular plugin?

371
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,920
We downloaded this part great board
because we need,

372
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,440
we need the Google
Maven report right to do MAVEN report.

373
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,320
So we got one guy called Damian.

374
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,600
Great call Damian.

375
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,880
Let me show you once again

376
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,200
this guy,

377
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,000
this guy.

378
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,280
Great. Damian

379
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,560
So this guy wrote
one particular plugin for us.

380
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,120
So then with this plugin we can generate
very good report or graphical report

381
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,640
current and see how, how generous

382
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,120
this guy is.

383
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Yet a jigsaw
once we are happy with by this number.

384
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,760
So much with brother even will this number

385
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,920
all right.

386
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,320
Excellent Alex What a beautiful quality
Everything he had.

387
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,320
I didn't understand that.

388
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:52,440
But now, now you see here
it says Maven move or that you can

389
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,560
by reporting put this into your politics
AML file right run this command.

390
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,000
But we had an ambient test command. Right.

391
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,800
And the reports are generating
in target folder in the combat

392
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,120
multiple supported fine.

393
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,240
So we added this particular plugin
yesterday in our class.

394
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,200
Right.

395
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,800
And we deleted some
of the optional code played

396
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,080
below Asia.

397
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,680
Great.

398
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,160
So now here we change the project name,
which is the input directly grade.

399
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,000
We changed this version, right?

400
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,560
If this project is not working for
someone, drive it 5.5.0.

401
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,080
Right. That right there.

402
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,880
It will work
if that region is also not working.

403
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,960
I me give you a couple of more words,
but majority of people

404
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,560
were able to solve this problem yesterday
joining the workshops.

405
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,960
Please do it.

406
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,400
All right, guys.

407
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,160
So we changed this particular part

408
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,600
execution point

409
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,120
so far in this part, right

410
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,960
after reading this particular plugin
from here.

411
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,880
B they do R and R class
and when we went to our class,

412
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,360
we and here would bring together
a part called GZ Target.

413
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,080
Could you, can you see this?

414
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,520
Can everyone see this

415
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,840
right now when we are executing, remember

416
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,360
to generate this report we have to

417
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,560
execute automatic simplify.

418
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,320
If you're executing only a smoke,
it will not generate this report.

419
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,280
Bomb not accessible
will generate this report grade.

420
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,360
So after executing from an excellent file,
we got this particular folder

421
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,200
he had collected.

422
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,480
You were a team of report and there we see
all these reports available

423
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,520
so you can see for tags,
related steps, related features,

424
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,280
related failures selected
indisputably What

425
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,840
screwed everyone

426
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,080
from. Yes.

427
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,480
Got it. Got it.
So I'm coming to that point. Nobody.

428
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,880
I'm coming to their point now.

429
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,640
Now, I gave you one task yesterday, right?

430
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,880
And Jimi, I should I must acknowledge
you did a great job.

431
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,880
This guy did a complete function
in the common methods, Right?

432
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,640
The task which I gave
and his code was working absolutely fine.

433
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,360
The best part is he applied within two,
3 hours after the completion of the class.

434
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,160
It shows his consistency.

435
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,680
It shows his particular,

436
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,480
you know, commitment towards the job,
towards his work, work to the study.

437
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,680
I must appreciate it.

438
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,080
Good job, Jimmy.

439
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,080
All right, fine.

440
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,040
Or if I need that kind of dedication
from your students.

441
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,880
So now, now that function, that function,

442
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,400
we are going to add in a common methods
played.

443
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,480
Common methods. Correct.

444
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,240
In this

445
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,760
common
methods, we are going to add a function.

446
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,600
Through that function we will select
any drop and we will select any drop down.

447
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,120
So now, before writing that function,
that idea

448
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,560
or drop drop down selection

449
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,640
or dropdown selection using

450
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,920
text, see now

451
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,240
tell me if I want to select any value
from there.

452
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,440
Drop down how many things I need.

453
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,520
Just think about the code for select
class 18.

454
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,560
How many things we need to automate.

455
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,760
One dropdown

456
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,400
greetings.

457
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,800
All right.

458
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,040
What are those two things the most is

459
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,400
all right.

460
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,120
All right.

461
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,680
Well, element is one thing.

462
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,920
What are remaining to value?

463
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,800
Second thing and select glass 35.

464
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,880
So variables think is very

465
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,040
first thing is all the geniuses

466
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,040
we need to write the function.

467
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,960
We need to write a function, select

468
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,840
the dropdown.

469
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,240
We need to write the function.

470
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,840
This is the very first thing

471
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,520
we have done it

472
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,400
for dropdown in choosing date and calendar
with this month.

473
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,800
Correct. I wrote the code.

474
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
It disturbs your whole mark,

475
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,680
but their task was to write
this function in common method.

476
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,600
Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.

477
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,680
You can copy this
because see what I'm saying?

478
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,720
Basically, next time
you don't have to use this function here

479
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,880
and then simply call this method, provide
the web element, provide the dataset.

480
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,080
Okay.

481
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,240
So first thing
first thing we need web element,

482
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,680
and second thing we need is text read

483
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,560
is this Critics

484
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,360
see not what I'm writing in the function.

485
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,200
I think select is is equals to nil select
and I'm passing this element

486
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,080
now again,
again, the concept of polymorphism

487
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,280
method overriding what will happen here.

488
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,560
I will override the element. Right?

489
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,800
And now I have this method in select
class selected by value, select by index.

490
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,640
Select my visibility text.

491
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,760
If I'm providing select by index
instead of providing here in the argument

492
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,480
is doing what I do plus

493
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,600
integer symbol,
then I can override the integer.

494
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,520
Right?

495
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,840
If I want to pass the value,
then again a string.

496
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,720
If I want to mask the text,
I can pass complete text from the string.

497
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,360
Does it make sense to everyone?

498
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,680
Does it make sense to everyone?

499
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:51,000
Does?

500
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,040
Is this clear to everyone based
what I'm doing.

501
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,120
So now, now, next time.

502
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,240
Let's see.

503
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,200
Did say in your inheritance.

504
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,480
Can someone please.

505
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,680
Okay,
get someone please share the code for that

506
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,800
particular one so I can copy and paste it.

507
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,040
Code is their task homework
and they can write

508
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:30,280
here.

509
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,440
No, no, not discord.

510
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,400
Yeah, that

511
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,920
is fine.

512
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,280
I just want. Okay, let's do it.

513
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,120
Let's do one thing. Let's do one thing.

514
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,240
What I'm going to do is post here.

515
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,800
Let me show you the application
right here.

516
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,880
This is the application we have.

517
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,160
If I click on an employee here,

518
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,040
I can. So

519
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,640
when I save it

520
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,520
after this,

521
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,680
I have to click on this every time

522
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,400
I used it. Which code?

523
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,520
But code four month,
which I gave you right.

524
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:38,800
Yesterday in the task,
did you complete the task.

525
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,360
Fine.

526
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,440
So now, now I'm
coming to this particular screen rate.

527
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,480
In this screen
I have a code, if you remember, but

528
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,520
ending the employee training.

529
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,040
So let me quickly read
once the menu. Right.

530
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,280
And then hit a button, click on it.

531
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,760
Option right.

532
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,880
I will try to select any one part
such as nationality.

533
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,960
Just one thing I'm going to show you using
this particular function, would they be

534
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,360
okay,

535
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,640
So let's do it in an employee feature.

536
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,800
If I'm adding one particular employee.

537
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,640
So this in already this one

538
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,200
clicks on, see a button and the employee,

539
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,600
if it successfully
let me go to this particular store

540
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,120
and here it is
the gear discord forced just to check.

541
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,920
So I'm seeing here,
instead of changing these

542
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,320
dropdown

543
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,800
and here I'm writing

544
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,720
dropdown

545
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,280
first, I just want to check

546
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,600
whether my
this particular function is working

547
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,520
or not

548
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,320
working.

549
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,920
Click on Save Button
after clicking on Save button.

550
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,640
What it does,
it will take me to this particular page

551
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,840
right now here, I need to find this edit

552
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,040
option to place.

553
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,120
That is going to be my point.
What I'm doing here.

554
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,320
It will take me to this particular
edit option.

555
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,320
So let me take this edit option.

556
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,680
It says I did button. Steve

557
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,880
Let's take way of value.

558
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,800
This type

559
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,600
based export

560
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,400
rate.

561
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,960
Yeah, that's fine, but I'm just checking.

562
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,440
I'm just it just for this purpose.

563
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,480
Don't worry.
I mean, I'm not going to do this.

564
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,000
Follow this completely. Everything.

565
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I can put it anywhere.

566
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,720
So there's a new employee page here.

567
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm going to write this
particular function, but edit option it.

568
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,040
And then the second look
that I would need is

569
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,240
marital status post. See,

570
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,160
it says Here it is, this one

571
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,400
item.

572
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,080
So let me go for this idea

573
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,080
I'm putting in guys again.

574
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,240
I'm saying in an employee pay rate,
not employee detail speech

575
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,360
or employee less
because I didn't clear the pages of now.

576
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,400
Okay.

577
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,160
Just to show you
I'm doing this member status.

578
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,880
And then another thing is
don't don't get confused with the task

579
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,520
for your task
is you have to create a new page for this

580
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,320
and I will go

581
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,000
check with the nationality

582
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,280
first.

583
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:45,680
Names in combination,

584
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,920
find marital status
or nationality and adoption point.

585
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,560
So not if I go in my date Employee here,

586
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,120
Employee successfully going to declaration

587
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:58,760
employee here.

588
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,240
I'm going to write dashboard

589
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,640
Redemption

590
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,880
here I need to perform Click completion.

591
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,240
Right.

592
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,440
So let me put it into the click operation
post after this.

593
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,680
I'm talking about select dropdown for it,
so it is asking for two things.

594
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,320
So first one I'm going to take is stored
marital status, comma.

595
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:35,880
What would be the value
of the mental status?

596
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,440
Single married, other.

597
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,360
Let's talk about here other.

598
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,800
How can you say married?

599
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,120
Lot of people are planning
to get separated if you're not married?

600
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,200
It's either.

601
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,840
Then the another one is select dropdown.

602
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,320
Again, I'm taking an employee page
or nationality.

603
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,280
Right.

604
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,520
And here in the
nationality this time select.

605
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Let's take the easy one.

606
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,880
British, British one.

607
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:22,080
And then here is going to click
on Save option.

608
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,680
So again, this particular word I can use

609
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,800
is this correct?

610
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,920
This just to show you
I'm putting this code

611
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,880
and putting up this putting up this code
just to show you.

612
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,800
So let me go ahead

613
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:39,960
and this time

614
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:51,760
execute this task.

615
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,560
Yeah,
I clicked on Steve option already, Jimmy

616
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:07,240
and I'm doing great.

617
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,480
See it selected British selected
other entities successfully saved like

618
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,400
right case

619
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,200
So now your global function

620
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,440
your global function is working
absolutely fine.

621
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,880
Which function working
absolutely fine or drop down automation

622
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,840
right now let's talk about
another important function here.

623
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,440
You'll get the finally,

624
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,240
your favorite part is into the picture.

625
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,160
Yes, Correct.

626
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,920
So we are going to work on

627
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,920
screenshot method.

628
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,160
Screenshot method.

629
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,080
Thanks for being patient with me.

630
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,440
Now I see what they want.

631
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,600
The reports we are providing doesn't
mean that how we have executing the code

632
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,960
and whatever the things we are doing
absolutely fine.

633
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,880
But we do not have any article is not.

634
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,440
We do not have any idea it is open now

635
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,760
that it

636
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,200
started.

637
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,120
So let's write a function.

638
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,400
Let's write a function for screenshot.

639
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,440
So here I'm going to write
this particular function.

640
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,360
This particular function will return
me, will return me

641
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,120
the screenshot of the scenario.

642
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,440
I am going to execute.

643
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,360
This function will return
with the scenario.

644
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
I'm going to execute. All right.

645
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,480
All right.

646
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,280
Great.

647
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,720
For every single execution
which we are going to make, this function

648
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,360
will then make a particular screenshot
and just put everyone

649
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,800
nowadays don't write anything right.

650
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,320
Focus here
what I'm trying to do very first thing

651
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:53,680
I remember, can we find this method in

652
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,640
which materials

653
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,400
dropdown selection?

654
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,280
Yes, obviously.

655
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
Why not?

656
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,040
I'm going to put it into the code.

657
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,520
Everything will been developed.

658
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,720
This is what I'm doing for you
when needed.

659
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,200
So you get it.

660
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,840
So now see the remember whenever we talk

661
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,160
about the grammar,
whenever we talk about Gutenberg.

662
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,840
So he can do always returns,
always returns

663
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,760
and able find

664
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
what it returns

665
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,360
life it returns and able byte.

666
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:39,000
So when we get when we get the data
multiple, multiple bytes,

667
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,520
multiple bytes existence
which means area of byte.

668
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,680
Understood.

669
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,440
So in part function we read the function
for taking the screenshot in the

670
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,960
could remember it will return one thing
that is area of byte.

671
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,480
So in the end.

672
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,200
In the end I have Eddie Obeid
also were writing the function button.

673
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,440
So what would be the return type
in this case for my function?

674
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,200
What would be the return date in this case
case?

675
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,480
Ariel Bait. Simple.

676
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,880
Let's go ahead and write.

677
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,120
One function was to be public

678
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,520
stating write public stating.

679
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,520
And I'm seeing my

680
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,360
name would be a

681
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,160
screenshot.

682
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,520
Now see

683
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,160
now see it is giving me right now

684
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,360
it is giving me this

685
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,160
right.

686
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,760
So here
it would be my edit of my understood

687
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,240
edit of Mike and here

688
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,960
I am going to write
so terminates in selenium

689
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,840
which might be used for screenshots.

690
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:59,080
We use a screenshot.

691
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,360
This is equals to

692
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,240
x screenshot

693
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,440
driver.

694
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,680
I hope everyone used this particular
method.

695
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,120
This particular part
in your selenium classes.

696
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,800
I hope everyone used it.

697
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,360
If someone didn't do

698
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:22,680
slide

699
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,480
this lately, we are going to change this
according to this particular framework.

700
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,640
That cucumber that we are using.

701
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,040
Yeah, that's what I am saying. So

702
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,320
here, here.

703
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:38,880
Right.

704
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,480
What we can do basically is simply
we can simply change it

705
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,000
according to the consumer functionality
that we are using.

706
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,640
All right.

707
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,400
So that's why I implemented any of byte.

708
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,880
Now see what we are going to change
in this function,

709
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,000
read this function and even most days

710
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,760
don't get screenshot s right.

711
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,200
So here we provide
what output takes, output based output.

712
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,320
Then what you generally
provide is still me.

713
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,480
You provide FYI.

714
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,320
Correct

715
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,840
here because it is returning me
any overbite.

716
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,680
So do we need to provide file
or do we need to provide something else?

717
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,360
You see three functions d function.

718
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,840
So which one we should provide
because it is written by it.

719
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,960
So we have to provide bytes.

720
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,200
We have to provide bytes.

721
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,600
Understood.

722
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,000
Since it is returning bytes.

723
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,280
So here I writing the object
that I'm going to store it as big bytes

724
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,800
picture of bytes
which is mine, which is my edit,

725
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,840
which is my body.

726
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,480
Understood.

727
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,080
Understood.

728
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,240
Now, Now when it is returning,
it is returning.

729
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,920
I need to store this screenshot
somewhere in my framework.

730
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,440
I need to store this
the screenshots in my inbox

731
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,960
when I need to provide
one particular files.

732
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,280
Right So here I am writing five. Right.

733
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,680
It would be my list of source five,
maybe eight. So

734
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm going to write it as dot

735
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,400
get screenshot as

736
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,840
so now here it will be my file.

737
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,400
This payment would be

738
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,320
split output.

739
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,240
They would be mine for free.

740
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:45,680
Whatever.

741
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,200
Okay, now see what I'm going to write you.

742
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,840
I'm going to write 10 minutes
to access the file, to access the file

743
00:45:54,840 --> 00:46:00,040
and copy the code which file utility
we have to do with the file in Java,

744
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,320
which utility we use.

745
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,080
I knew this

746
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,600
and we use pilot in space

747
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,200
Dark copy fight is this method correct?

748
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,360
What I'm writing
it is asking source by so source fine.

749
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,120
Which one?

750
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,360
I've already provided Source my right.

751
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,840
It's his destination
by destination by now.

752
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,960
Right. The destination by now.

753
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,880
I am going to define like this
C needle fly.

754
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,280
And here in this new file
I'm going to provide the bottom

755
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,520
right arm location.

756
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,040
So do we have any location
for the screenshot as of now?

757
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,840
Do we have any location
for this screenshot?

758
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:52,480
As of no, we do not.

759
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,760
Right.

760
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,120
So let's go ahead and do it.

761
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,680
Let's go ahead and do it.

762
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,800
Open your constants class,

763
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,360
Open your constraints class

764
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,480
and provide a box
here in your constants class.

765
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,840
Provide a but

766
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,040
what would be under your package?

767
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,080
Enter your package. Great.

768
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,160
So now see in constants, I'm
going to provide a public

769
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,560
static final.

770
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,440
I'm going to provide the path is

771
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,400
a screenshot

772
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,600
screenshot file, but

773
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,360
great

774
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,600
in this point code would be C

775
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,680
and then here I am providing I'm
providing the path for the screenshot

776
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,040
is under the screenshot

777
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,920
folder under the screenshots folder.

778
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,120
Okay.

779
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,760
So now tell me if I say under screenshots
folder.

780
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,000
Maybe have to create this
particular volume

781
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,320
where we have to create this order.

782
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,080
It'd be

783
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,880
nice.

784
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,640
I'm not a Jardim is here, here, here.

785
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,480
So now.

786
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,240
Now let's do.

787
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,520
Let's do it here like this.

788
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,840
It should be more screen.

789
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,840
Can you see
I haven't already announced interest

790
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,840
Can everyone see
I have this folder A screenshots here now

791
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,320
right

792
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,000
now go into your common interests

793
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,680
so far any questions
how we provided this part

794
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,680
so for any question for this anyone

795
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:46,520
is that clear.

796
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,320
That clear.

797
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,320
Guys please don't die Please don't date

798
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,680
been responding

799
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:55,920
short.

800
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,040
Are you want me to show again?

801
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,440
Okay.

802
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,160
Now see, guys here.

803
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,440
We provided this part in the context
because this thought

804
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,360
is not going to change. Correct.

805
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:13,720
So we provided always those boxes
when these are binding in our constants.

806
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,200
Plus, what is your user idea?

807
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,600
What you in the class
When I explain this part of city

808
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,880
user data is always redundant.

809
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,480
It is a command,
right of operating system.

810
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,760
It's always written from Java,
the back of your project.

811
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,840
So whenever
whenever you are executing this command,

812
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,440
it returns
the part of the Project Builder project,

813
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,000
but it returns the command,
it returns output.

814
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,800
Okay, is the SO user territory.

815
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,840
Okay, so user directory students
for part of this particular

816
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,480
no issues, That's what I would say.

817
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,280
So now it becomes odd part global

818
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,160
because if I write this in your machine
it will return the part of your machine.

819
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,600
If I ran it in my machine,
included in the portal by machine.

820
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,440
Right.

821
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,880
So if I write this one,
it makes our base globally on

822
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,280
an inside this, this bot are constants.

823
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,280
This button constant dynamic,
these quantities and this could now be one

824
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,200
point.

825
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,000
So now let's go into the common method.

826
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,600
So here, here and with the right enemy.

827
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:27,880
No, my file location, I have a mark,
I have a file location.

828
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,000
Is it just a screenshot Facebook

829
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,560
extension Facebook group.

830
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,240
It is

831
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,560
giving me the error mode a chance to
I get.

832
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,320
Fine. Let's do it.

833
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,560
We take it to over. And now.

834
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,040
Now here
simply I'm going to say it returns

835
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,280
it returns my big box.

836
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,240
You see guys this function

837
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,880
you see guys this function is

838
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,200
clean screenshot.

839
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,320
Can you see it?

840
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,000
Everyone.

841
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,400
But but I can see one problem
in this function I'm seeing find

842
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,880
should be saved in this screenshot file,
but which need

843
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,360
which name right with what name

844
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,400
we need to provide.

845
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,240
And you see any name being provided.

846
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,360
The facebook? No.

847
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,880
We deployed. Right.

848
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,640
And can you predict
the name of the scenario?

849
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,840
With scenario we are going to execute

850
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,400
how many submenus
we are going execute can predict. No.

851
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,160
So if
we cannot predict something like this,

852
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,400
if we cannot predict what scenario
we are going to execute our minister,

853
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,560
we are going to execute
which one is going to be parsed,

854
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,680
which one is going to be fiend,
What is the name of the method?

855
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,280
We cannot see anything
because it completely depends

856
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,880
on the requirement of what execution
our required.

857
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,720
We we would change this, right?

858
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,680
So first first what we will do,
we will provide a global FYI,

859
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,800
we will provide a global file name.

860
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:14,520
And this we will hand in here
in our method in terms of kingdom.

861
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,320
So now you'll see

862
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,520
in terms of correct firstly

863
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,240
timestamp we will do the mission,
we will do that bundle.

864
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,360
So first thing you see, find nameplate

865
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,760
is correct

866
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,200
or not.

867
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,440
Now now here, now here. What is happening?

868
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,800
If I provide this tiny right,
you might provide this by name,

869
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,240
then what would happen here
after providing the file name, right?

870
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,560
If I'm executing one
just because it will generate the report,

871
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,920
take this feature if I provide second best
because then execute it.

872
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,800
What would happen?

873
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,840
What would enter?

874
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,760
It can override this one.

875
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,200
It will replace.

876
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,400
So will I get the previous one here?

877
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,800
Will I get the previous one? No,
I won't see.

878
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,480
So let's let me show you this here
what I'm seeing.

879
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,960
Let's see my screenshot name is ABC.

880
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,400
After first execution

881
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,960
after second execution again,
ABC report will be generated

882
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,400
so here I executed ten scenarios
and here I execute in five scenarios.

883
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,080
Right.

884
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,600
So tell me which one would be the last.

885
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,120
This one is the latest one.

886
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,080
So we will not be able to get this one.

887
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,520
We will be able to get only
this one right.

888
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,360
It means my this data is gone, right?

889
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,240
So I don't want that kind of setup here.

890
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,360
I want to set up
where I can find this one.

891
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,640
I can find this one. Got it.

892
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,720
Got it.

893
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,920
So what can I do?

894
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,280
I can see this file.

895
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,880
Instead of writing this ABC pilot, X,
Y, or Z byte,

896
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,480
I can save this fine with some parameters.

897
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,240
Those parameters which are unique.

898
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,120
So when it comes to unique, what is unique
design is unique.

899
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,600
Maybe did seem

900
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,520
maybe month the same, maybe even seen,

901
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,880
maybe our same in the same one hour.

902
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,120
We can execute multiple things
because this or not.

903
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,080
Instead we guys

904
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,040
maybe minutes also same guys.

905
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:41,040
In one minute
we can execute multiple or not.

906
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,600
Maybe state gives also same.

907
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,760
If it is a small execution.

908
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,280
In a small execution,
we can execute a mistake,

909
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,040
but milliseconds would not be seen.

910
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,120
Right.

911
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,560
So you'll see this much of time
we can provide right in the file name.

912
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,400
So if we get exact date,
execute the month, execute it,

913
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,400
execute our commitment sequence

914
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,520
and exit the milliseconds plus destiny.

915
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,800
If we provide a file name like this,
then everything, even

916
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,320
if it is executing up to 1 milliseconds C
one millisecond it takes one millisecond.

917
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,400
It always takes to open the browser,
to close the browser.

918
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,920
And this is the smallest scenario.

919
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,240
So now after every execution

920
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:35,000
we will get separate payload,
We will get separate by cutting

921
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,000
final.

922
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,600
So to do this, to do this,
do we have any parameter

923
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,600
right now to provide timestamp here?

924
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,000
Do we have any parameter?

925
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,480
No, we don't have, we don't have.

926
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,600
But in Java, in Java

927
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,680
we have a clause going deep

928
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,040
which class we have in Java date.

929
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,960
And this data class
basically returns, returns right.

930
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:04,560
The current date.

931
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,200
So let me write for the time it's
been writing yet

932
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,440
public static string.

933
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,760
I'm writing because I need something
in return of this method.

934
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,480
So I didn't get time stamps again.

935
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,760
Time stamp? Yes. Fine.

936
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,160
Now tell me guys, first first, let me show
you something and I will ask this.

937
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,400
Is it did

938
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,280
is it was do

939
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,400
you did this

940
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,400
now here,

941
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,520
right here by default, by default,
the better by default.

942
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:47,560
The python is here.

943
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,320
Great. Our

944
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,640
great state games and.

945
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,120
This is the default format which we get.

946
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,640
Great guys.

947
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,680
Correct.

948
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,600
Hello.

949
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,360
Right now,

950
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,600
maybe it returns something else for me.

951
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,040
I don't want this particular format.

952
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,760
I want something else. Great.

953
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,080
I want something
that is so what I can see.

954
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,960
Okay, In this particular bar,
I will define my own python.

955
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,560
I will define my own python. In which way?

956
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,920
Then I need you to return me that big.

957
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,800
I will define my own return in mass in
any that I want d I want minutes.

958
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,440
I want only milliseconds.

959
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,680
I want only is against whatever
the things.

960
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,920
I will define it on my own.

961
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,120
So now I'm going to write here C Simple

962
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,360
date for me

963
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:54,440
equals to new simple date for me.

964
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,120
And according to date,
which did better the python

965
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,280
which I will be providing
so it will return me.

966
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,360
Simple is the method for me
and it does this object we think

967
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,800
any question

968
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,080
in this function let me right here
I'm writing it is

969
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,280
for made B

970
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,440
according according

971
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,040
according to r choice.

972
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,840
We have to use this function

973
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:34,320
which function is d of simple date
for make function.

974
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,600
We have to use this function. Why?

975
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,280
Because Java is returning one particular
date in one particular for form.

976
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,680
I don't want that by another date.

977
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,600
I want my own back
and so I have to rearranged.

978
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,720
I have to form a statement.

979
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,040
And for me, that particular victim,
two things I need first function

980
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,160
through which I will form and second
by which I mean boss in that function.

981
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:56,960
Right.

982
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,080
So this is the function which I am
using simple date for me to formatted

983
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,640
according to the method.

984
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,880
And this back
then I will provide in my scenario

985
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,560
while providing the
name to my student industrial

986
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,200
and the school

987
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:21,800
disk is going to see it.

988
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,160
So now see what I'm doing, what I'm doing.

989
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,120
So far
when I provided this final nameplate

990
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,120
file name I can provide, but I might need
maybe to file names.

991
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:36,080
Can be seen as of now is off
now if I can was simply so let me.

992
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,400
Makes it different.

993
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,200
Even if the file name is seen, the
remaining parameters will be different.

994
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Now let's see through label programing.

995
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,320
See, first
I will provide the space in the name.

996
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,040
Most I will provide is space in the mean
and output is this.

997
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:56,360
I will provide here this particular
method called big time step.

998
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,640
So it is asking for paper. Yes.

999
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,760
Guys, can you see

1000
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,920
it is asking for pregnant.

1001
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,760
I am providing the name dates.

1002
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,160
I'm planning to provide the name
so it is asking for Baghdad.

1003
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:16,360
Can everyone see it?

1004
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,280
So then here I'm going to provide
which button I need.

1005
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,160
I need. Let's see. Viva

1006
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,160
in name.

1007
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,280
You can
find this button on Google exhibit.

1008
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,440
You can find this picture on Google is
what do you need?

1009
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,560
Because month is in capital

1010
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,680
hours is in also capital grade.

1011
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,560
It is by default.

1012
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,000
But then I'm not doing in
capital name use for months.

1013
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,120
If people use but I would say small

1014
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,960
D four days is more like one year.

1015
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,480
And after this

1016
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,480
small in 4 minutes

1017
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,840
and the small is positive is

1018
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,040
understood. I need 10% gain.

1019
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,240
Sorry I don't want this
milliseconds in all is discussed

1020
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,560
and that's what I'm saying.

1021
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,160
Yes, but it

1022
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,960
nasty guys now see

1023
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,280
in this folder
but in this folder portrayed

1024
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,840
it will save my file getting

1025
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:19,160
this will save my file this file
having the fighting name with file name.

1026
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,320
I will provide the reason for that.

1027
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,240
You consist of this right?

1028
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,880
For example, if my name is

1029
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,520
if I name is ABC so it will save

1030
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,320
ABC 2021 right.

1031
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,640
12238

1032
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:44,040
2133 something like this
file would be like this and one

1033
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,840
Why are the month what is kept?

1034
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,200
Remember like I said, it is a pre
defined a format reading define it.

1035
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,760
We are simply using it from Java eight.

1036
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,760
So why we should ask this to the students
of Northeastern University.

1037
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,200
Straight

1038
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,600
or Sun Microsystems?

1039
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,000
Basically?

1040
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,080
No, no.

1041
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:14,280
After this, the last thing which
we have to provide is in which for weight.

1042
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,840
I want to see my file in this screenshot.

1043
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,640
So what is the most common for me?

1044
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,520
We have a flood to go

1045
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,680
with being right, So fine, let's provide.

1046
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,320
Don't be in default.

1047
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,320
I need to save this point.

1048
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:36,480
I want not be in default mode
to save this point.

1049
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,200
So for any question in this function,
this store, for any question

1050
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,840
in this function
and in this lecture did me

1051
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,360
is there

1052
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,080
anyone who has any question

1053
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,080
in this particular function

1054
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:02,720
experience,

1055
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,000
please don't take the code
in answer to my question, please.

1056
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,760
But it's perfect.

1057
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,720
The only thing might line them,
but a bit fine.

1058
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,640
So here, here.

1059
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,960
I seen this line, right?

1060
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,160
Because we need a unique
findings category.

1061
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,440
We need unique findings.

1062
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,800
Can we use project
name for device or expose?

1063
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,120
No, no, no.

1064
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,080
I will tell you that we can do that

1065
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,600
because we didn't
call this method anywhere.

1066
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,400
Okay, So what you need to understand
is why we're providing this timestamp.

1067
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,840
Because seen if your tool file names
are similar, it will over your fight.

1068
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,360
It will override your flight. Correct.

1069
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,600
And it would overwrite you have been
you will know

1070
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,680
you will lose your previous report.

1071
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,360
So that's
why to make a pretty board unique

1072
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,200
we need to provide
this is just a name of your flight.

1073
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:54,600
Okay.

1074
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:58,280
This would be the name of your flight
with your finally actually it

1075
01:03:59,040 --> 01:03:59,680
now I understood

1076
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,960
almost would

1077
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,720
find for example
let's say you are executing your test case

1078
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,520
having the name log right
So first time if you create

1079
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,080
and if you don't provide timestamp create
and file name by providing right, let's

1080
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,240
say whatever the mind is to name is
that would be my Finally

1081
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,160
for the screenshot

1082
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,920
yet no one because milliseconds
we don't need fade.

1083
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,400
Like I said, this is our own vector
so we are providing 10 seconds.

1084
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,440
That is fine because we need,
even if there are 2 seconds

1085
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,480
plus one, execute it in second one
and second one executing second.

1086
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,400
Then obviously these are two things.

1087
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,440
Now just consider one scenario.

1088
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,800
You have a log in, test,
your scenario name is no name.

1089
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,960
You execute your scenario.

1090
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,600
Big APM, for example.

1091
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,680
So what would be the name of

1092
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,840
your scenario in screenshot if you don't
provide good gives stack loaded

1093
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:00,880
because you

1094
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,280
calling that and you want to save your way
with the name of the scenario.

1095
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:09,720
So there is nothing it in being again
you executed those teams in any way

1096
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,840
so against in would be generated
and this time we

1097
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:14,480
the screenshot

1098
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,960
next is what I am seeking

1099
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:22,120
so it runs in seconds
also you see that's why 2 seconds.

1100
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,480
So in my project in my project if you see

1101
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,040
even if you consider the most fastest
isn't any

1102
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,600
how much time it takes to open
the browser is to represent or not

1103
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,360
those like. Right.

1104
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,760
So if in executing do the forensic games
would be a different name or not,

1105
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,520
even if it is in seconds.

1106
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,760
So now just consider the situation
without get name.

1107
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,840
Instead, what would happen

1108
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,960
if you execute using that you would now

1109
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,400
give me free and you provided
the fighting name is the scenario name.

1110
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,920
So first it executed, then it got it.

1111
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,680
Give you the name of
this creature does not indicate B

1112
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,280
Now you'll again execute in this scenario
it might be

1113
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:10,880
so this time again it will give you
the screenshot name as logging.

1114
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,160
Right. So when do files are on same name?

1115
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,880
The latest one
always replace your previous one.

1116
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:23,760
It happens or not.

1117
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,200
Great.

1118
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:27,400
So again, I have to either rename it
or it will get replaced.

1119
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,920
All right, fine.

1120
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,000
I don't want the situation right everyone
to face the situation in my project.

1121
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,880
So that's why I came on with.

1122
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,280
I will provide some feedback on this
with my final name.

1123
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,640
So now, even if my filing is same,

1124
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,920
but this topics information
will not be the same.

1125
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,640
It will change every name.

1126
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,960
And then so I will get all of my points
right again.

1127
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:51,160
Universal function, global function.

1128
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,520
No dependency on hard hardcoded

1129
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:00,840
loophole.

1130
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:05,320
The date is coming right from the calendar
so we can do it.

1131
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,240
Yes. Correct.

1132
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,560
So what panel execution
has to do with this?

1133
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,800
Even in the parallel execution,
you know, the concept of Multithreading

1134
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,480
when you get tickets online at one time

1135
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,160
for watching any movie,
like for example, Spiderman,

1136
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,560
if anyone is trying,
everyone is trying to move that they could

1137
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:25,080
implement is a way to access this screen.

1138
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,840
But this application is providing
multiple threads

1139
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,960
to multiple user one, 3 to 1 user.

1140
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,920
For us,
we see it executions, best example rate

1141
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,040
rates on providing to all the users
that one day.

1142
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:42,000
But there is a delay even in nanoseconds,
milliseconds microseconds

1143
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,320
because like it's correct, there is a
delay in every single trade rate.

1144
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,720
So same thing be playing here.

1145
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:53,520
So you should also include work rate.

1146
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,280
Fine, fine.

1147
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,960
Now what we are going to do see,

1148
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,560
eliminate,

1149
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,720
think be soon master
this part clear to everyone.

1150
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,960
This particular part clear to everyone

1151
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:12,720
then is just

1152
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,840
just 5 minutes
the I'm completing this part

1153
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,640
and then I will give you
when I'm completing this part just by.

1154
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:20,520
Okay.

1155
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:22,920
So far, so good.

1156
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,600
Everyone.

1157
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,720
Now, now I missed the part for the byte.

1158
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,440
The mirrored
basically the area of by trade computer

1159
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,160
always any of it in terms of screenshot.

1160
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:42,320
Okay.

1161
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,160
No, it's not required. It's up to you.

1162
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:47,120
It's up to you. It's
why we provided this area of writing.

1163
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,480
We are handling area of rate.

1164
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,360
That's why we're not putting our name.

1165
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,320
Don't buy we are putting out good.

1166
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,240
But it's not.

1167
01:08:55,240 --> 01:09:00,280
Day is when we did a screenshot.

1168
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:11,120
When we did a screenshot.

1169
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,680
No, no we can not we can not use
you saw we got just three options.

1170
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,960
Bye bye.

1171
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,680
So see you see the 64 link

1172
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,280
verify something when we're

1173
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,280
not at the end of the disconnect
passing at the end of it.

1174
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,320
What it is doesn't matter
whether it is past

1175
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,720
or it is spilled or whatever, it is great.

1176
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,280
Whatever it is, we need a screenshot
with every single report.

1177
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,760
Correct.

1178
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:42,520
But we need to ensure we use digital
domains to highlight the error.

1179
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:44,800
Yes, JavaScript code is something else.

1180
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,720
Great moment.

1181
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,680
Don't get into that part of the register.

1182
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,200
Get confused. Right.

1183
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,000
So now we don't need listeners.

1184
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,280
Tell me which part
of which part of article, but has that bar

1185
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:00,120
it will always execute after my code

1186
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,760
that we always execute
after my code into interview.

1187
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,720
But we have the portion already.

1188
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,680
Which portion is there?

1189
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,520
Yes, yes, we have hooks.

1190
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,720
We have hooks in hooks.

1191
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,040
Remember precondition, post condition.

1192
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,400
So precondition out of school
we don't need as of now,

1193
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,000
we need post condition.

1194
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,160
So it is my hooks and then of my esters.

1195
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,240
You see this method.

1196
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:28,760
I can

1197
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:30,840
you see this method?

1198
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,880
I have ratings.

1199
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,800
So now here in this method I'm c

1200
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,960
before closing the browser,
before closing the browser.

1201
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:46,360
In the end, when my post condition
executes big the screenshot

1202
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,920
and recover the screenshot,
that's what I'm seeing already.

1203
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:59,320
Well, read.

1204
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,480
No no.

1205
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,640
Here, here.

1206
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,480
See what I'm seeing.

1207
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:13,280
Let's see.

1208
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,960
This is my

1209
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,040
the screenshots folder.

1210
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,160
I executed five scenario

1211
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,960
how many screenshots it will generate.

1212
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,200
Hooks will execute many times

1213
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,560
for five scenarios. Looks good.

1214
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,280
Executed five things.

1215
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,040
So how many screenshots we will get here

1216
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,240
in the screenshot folder?

1217
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,520
It's been short one.

1218
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,080
This screenshot to exclude showed three

1219
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:43,680
in short four screenshot from

1220
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,240
after execution.

1221
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,480
While looking into this folder here,
can you see with scenario

1222
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,720
as Boston was to use the

1223
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,880
can you select this there?

1224
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:00,600
This is pass.

1225
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,480
Does this pass?

1226
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,360
Does this feel

1227
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,720
this is failing

1228
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,320
and this is big.

1229
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,360
Can we say this
by looking into this menu for

1230
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,320
no from the report?

1231
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,960
That's what I'm asking. From here
we can see or more.

1232
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:20,120
No, we can not,
because there is no distribution.

1233
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,560
The distro distribution.

1234
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,760
Now what we will

1235
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,360
see under this situation,
this problem in this one,

1236
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,680
what kind of problem behavior?

1237
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,280
Everyone understood this part.

1238
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:36,680
So now

1239
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:44,040
that you understood the problem,
let me give you the solution.

1240
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,320
We built article.

1241
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,080
But to save this screenshot.

1242
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,280
To save the screenshot.

1243
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,640
How if they are fail,

1244
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,560
put it in the fail folder in their Bosque.

1245
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,160
Put it in the passport section.

1246
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,840
Now if I execute five scenario

1247
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,760
my and out of them
three passed and two are failed.

1248
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,840
So my document will provide

1249
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:18,120
two scenarios inside this folder
and three scenarios inside us.

1250
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,680
For understood

1251
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:21,880
understood

1252
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,120
how how we will do it.

1253
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,240
Let's see.

1254
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:29,480
Isn't it interesting part
that we are going to do now?

1255
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,320
See, guys,
I need your attention for just 5 minutes.

1256
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,520
Just 5 minutes. Here.

1257
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:36,960
Here.

1258
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:44,800
We have to use one class from the number.

1259
01:13:44,800 --> 01:14:19,560
So maybe.

1260
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,440
Maybe this is

1261
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,400
sideways. So.

1262
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:30,000
So now here, now here.

1263
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:34,840
What I'm going to do
is I am going to use one particular class

1264
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:39,720
from the computer,
and we call this class as in, you see,

1265
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:45,000
I will talk to Jumbo or Java,
we will call this class is scenario.

1266
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,600
So we will use
the object of this to let us

1267
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,840
which class we are going to use based.

1268
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,360
We are going to use scenario class.

1269
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,200
Understood.

1270
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,680
The is just just by for the next
really interesting part is going on

1271
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,400
grade don't don't focus it

1272
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,000
focusing right now I am going to see

1273
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,440
all right
my convert is going to return what

1274
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:18,080
the screenshot method is returning, what

1275
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,160
based

1276
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:22,680
big any of my trade

1277
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,840
any off buying it is returning any of it.

1278
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,560
So I'm seeing the object
first for this area of like

1279
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,160
understand what is next.

1280
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,640
Now I want to capture the screenshot,
find with this scenario method.

1281
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,360
So remember this scenario.

1282
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,680
Plus I'm going to right here.

1283
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,480
Right. I'm going to right here.

1284
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:49,240
This scenario class from from

1285
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,800
December because the complete information,

1286
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,280
the complete information
of your execution,

1287
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,040
what it does, it pulls the complete
information of your execution,

1288
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,840
what you have executed,
what is the status of your executed,

1289
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,480
what is the name of the scenario
that you're executing?

1290
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,560
It would a single thing that would

1291
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,560
understood.

1292
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,680
So now now what I'm going to write to see,

1293
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,680
I am seeing see how distribution is done.

1294
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:27,440
If if I'm using this object.

1295
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,000
My scenario is feed.

1296
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,960
If my scenario is three,
then what you have to do

1297
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,440
in the area of byte,
if this object creates this big object

1298
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:44,040
for the area of byte
I'm seeing in this object, call my method.

1299
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,960
Take a screenshot point,
call my method, take a screenshot.

1300
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,160
Now what is not filing?

1301
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,920
It's providing my findings.

1302
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,680
So I'm seeing a scenario
not get me scenario.

1303
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:58,080
Don't get him would be my file.

1304
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,040
Can you see? Okay.

1305
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,560
Because I told you my scenario is holding

1306
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,160
all the information, all the information
straight of my execution.

1307
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,840
So now I'm providing scenario not get name

1308
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,120
else and see else I'm seeing.

1309
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,200
Save the screenshot
for big screenshot again.

1310
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,920
Big scenario.

1311
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,720
Don't get

1312
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,240
No, wait, wait.

1313
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,520
With the weather.

1314
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,840
My scenario is
if my scenario is free, right?

1315
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,200
If my scenario is filled,
it is going to take the screenshot,

1316
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:43,440
find it otherwise
also it will going to take the screenshot.

1317
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,600
So what the situations are saying,
can you see

1318
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,360
if it is forced
taking the screenshot, taking the name

1319
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,720
if it is taking the screenshot, taking the
screenshot of response, taking the name.

1320
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,440
There is no distribution for feeling mask
still

1321
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,000
because we are just checking the status
here.

1322
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:04,200
If it is feel is going to seem like this.

1323
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,000
If it is forced
screenshot saved like this.

1324
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,440
We are

1325
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,120
very to see
this screenshot of failing bus.

1326
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,840
So one more thing we have to do is here

1327
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:19,320
I'm going to write
create one folder called

1328
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,440
Goal feed.

1329
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,280
Right

1330
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,640
only for those where my screenshot is big

1331
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,280
and create one more folder here.

1332
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,080
Say run for it here, go

1333
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:39,960
paused right or buzzed so dag nasty nasty.

1334
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:44,400
If my scenario is feed
it will take the screenshot

1335
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,440
seaweed under the feed folder under

1336
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,240
screenshot folder with my scenario name.

1337
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,400
Right.

1338
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:55,080
And here also
it will see under my scenario understood

1339
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:56,920
and desperate.

1340
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:01,440
Everyone.

1341
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,800
So it will exist in India. Great.

1342
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:05,760
Now see,

1343
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,320
now see, one thing is done.

1344
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,240
One thing done.

1345
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,520
In my scenario

1346
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:15,840
selected is screenshots will be captured
under is screenshots folder.

1347
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,040
Right.

1348
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,560
And then the screenshots folder.

1349
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,560
But do we need food for them?

1350
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,800
Why don't we need food for the utility?

1351
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,320
Why don't we need this?

1352
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,720
We are discussing the point.

1353
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,240
Yes, we have to.

1354
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,040
We have to.

1355
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,800
We have to add this build and fast folder
we automatically

1356
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,840
we generated because we are putting them
in this script.

1357
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:40,800
Right.

1358
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,960
So this folders will be generated.
Correct.

1359
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,720
My take a screenshot whether we generate
the folder based on the

1360
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:51,000
what we have provided in the common matrix
and they take screenshot function.

1361
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,120
That function we have called here.

1362
01:19:53,120 --> 01:20:02,160
So it will create itself right? Yes.

1363
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,960
Yes. Got it.

1364
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:06,840
Got it.

1365
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:12,400
So now see here with this method,
what I am seeing, this is storing mind.

1366
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,720
This is storing and capturing
my screenshot and the screenshot spoiler.

1367
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,080
But I don't want this.

1368
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,520
These screenshots
only in domestic interest folder.

1369
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,280
I want this.

1370
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:28,280
The screenshots
will be attached with my report.

1371
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:32,120
I want these screenshots
to be based with my report.

1372
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:32,920
All right.

1373
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,360
So next time I execute my scenario,
I want to see this

1374
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,560
screenshot week
based in my reporting system.

1375
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:41,920
All right.

1376
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,000
So to do this just one command
I need to add.

1377
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,920
This scenario will do everything.

1378
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:49,320
So now you don't bug batch.

1379
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,720
Can you see?

1380
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,520
Can you see it is asking post by default.

1381
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:59,040
It is asking any of my Do not tell me guys
Eddie of Berkeley do the asking.

1382
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,600
So I am writing area of byte I have big

1383
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,600
I have big.

1384
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,640
This big is the object
that I've created for Eddie Obeid.

1385
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,480
So it can be by asking for maybe a date.

1386
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,640
So what would be the media of this image?

1387
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:17,840
So I will provide image
sort of image, which image being image

1388
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:19,320
feed.

1389
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,640
And then the third thing
it is asking is string name.

1390
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,800
So here the name of the string
that I would be provided release theme

1391
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:31,120
name named
Keep it simple, Let's keep it simple.

1392
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,400
Only the name of the video industry.

1393
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,080
So what it will do it

1394
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:42,960
will it will attach the pics

1395
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:46,440
in the food

1396
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:51,440
and putting these commands also so
that you can understand what we are doing,

1397
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,320
so that you can understand
what we are doing.

1398
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,560
Is this part to everyone?

1399
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,560
Is this part clear to one

1400
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:07,200
easy, just four lines, be easy and

1401
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,520
now let me do one thing

1402
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,520
to execute one very common scenario.

1403
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,280
Take this batch 11 one plate.

1404
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,840
It would take this bent elements in edu.

1405
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,000
So I'm going to put it in my

1406
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,000
things

1407
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:29,640
and I'm
going to execute this scenario from mine.

1408
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:33,840
But I'm not extremely fine guys from my

1409
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,360
which any

1410
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:42,560
bom not exemplify point.

1411
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:48,160
No. See, I am going to execute this menu
from here from my to make fine.

1412
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:50,000
So test

1413
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,400
build success based

1414
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,480
will success is just

1415
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,840
can you see here
can you see here under the screenshots

1416
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,200
folder generated called parsed can you see

1417
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,880
folder generated parsed

1418
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,560
and this and here

1419
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,120
you'll see this is my scenario
name really and mini log in.

1420
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:48,240
Great this is there for me
the burden which we passed I see

1421
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:53,000
this is the format between must not be in
g now just match this

1422
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,520
with this particular part see

1423
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,520
is screenshot file
but the provided file name.

1424
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,920
So finally we provided a scenario
don't get me

1425
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,840
great scenario,
don't me scenario name. See?

1426
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,480
But it

1427
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:13,960
is based you see here this, this
and then here.

1428
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,320
So here you see is month.

1429
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:22,280
So you see January day 23 hours 22

1430
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:26,160
See here 2226 minutes 25

1431
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:30,440
just one minute ago and seconds
continue forward.

1432
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,600
Don't be

1433
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,240
eight days.

1434
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,920
The same format what we provided
my code is working according to that.

1435
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,040
Correct.

1436
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:42,960
Is this correct?

1437
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,400
Everyone, now,

1438
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,800
now let's open this open report.

1439
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,200
It's open adequate. How?

1440
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,680
We open the report right
click open in any browser.

1441
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,320
Open in any browser.

1442
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,680
Can you see this report right.

1443
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,640
Can you see this report?

1444
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,280
We want

1445
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,880
open it

1446
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,400
going to looks can you see

1447
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,800
now this time of hooks execute trade

1448
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,920
this hooks it says that is an attachment.

1449
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:28,920
Now click on it is this this screen
where I completed my execution.

1450
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,480
Is this the script for the last display
when my execution stops?

1451
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,040
This is right.

1452
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:41,080
Correct.

1453
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,800
Correct. See,

1454
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,760
I got all the details straight.

1455
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,680
I got all the details. Wait,
how many steps fast?

1456
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,120
It it'sit's everything.

1457
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,440
And here also
it is attaching my screenshot visible.

1458
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:00,760
See this?

1459
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:05,800
Is this part clear to everyone?

1460
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,120
Right? Exactly.

1461
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:13,080
Damian remembers idle.

1462
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:21,240
So for any question in this part,
but they're taking them on.

1463
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,560
For example, I didn't provide anything.

1464
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:26,160
They mean bombarding similitude.

1465
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,360
Where have you seen this that I provided
big name in

1466
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,360
which take moment

1467
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:35,000
which you are not involved

1468
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,240
match 11.

1469
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,080
No it's not going to take some insert

1470
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,640
expander your small cricket
it is more enough

1471
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,760
under small

1472
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:57,280
point.

1473
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,880
Let me come in this code

1474
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:04,920
so for any question in this part strings

1475
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:09,520
there

1476
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,000
is any question so far

1477
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:17,320
no question here

1478
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:18,960
except

1479
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,560
now you in a big it's

1480
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,960
been almost 2 hours already 2 hours

1481
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,120
code is
can we take to the repository right.

1482
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,240
Let's take a break. This

1483
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,280
at the middle Like I said the

1484
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,880
like I said,

1485
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,280
it does only any overbite.

1486
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,360
That is the only thing that's big.

1487
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,720
But yeah, you can read it and
then you will deprecate very easy part.

1488
01:27:49,960 --> 01:28:00,760
This remaining all the steps
are symptoms of selenium bar.

1489
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,840
I totally understand.

1490
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,320
Another important topic guys.

1491
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,480
After the break we will discuss.

1492
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,120
Let's see.

1493
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,440
Sebastian is already got the screenshot.

1494
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,120
Is this part working for everyone of

1495
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,920
my screen?

1496
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:25,640
So guys, let's take a break.

1497
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:27,920
Let's take a break for 15 minutes.

1498
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,240
And after 15 minutes we connect again.

1499
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,120
Okay.

1500
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,320
One store next.

1501
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,520
So far, so good.

1502
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:47,560
Everyone.

1503
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:48,000
Nice,

1504
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:49,880
nice place.

1505
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,840
I produced it as everyone gets
so we can proceed for the please

1506
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,280
of big screen quickly.

1507
01:28:55,280 --> 01:29:13,880
But fine.

1508
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,720
So now.

1509
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,080
Now ready to not do more things.

1510
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,400
Very interesting thing.

1511
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,080
I did not get that feature.

1512
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:24,920
It would

1513
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,560
Sir Richard McWhirter talking about

1514
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,840
which feature

1515
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,360
This one.

1516
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:37,960
This one?

1517
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:38,600
You mean

1518
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,200
So I can clearly see, right?

1519
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,040
I can clearly see it's already of liberty.

1520
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:53,920
It was just you expanding this way.

1521
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,560
The view is going.

1522
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:57,960
It just you expand there just to,

1523
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,120
you know, hold it
and then you will get that to put

1524
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,680
or maybe execute it one more time
and then you will get the connectivity.

1525
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:06,720
Look, in this part,

1526
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,760
when you're talking about this
particular part, right,

1527
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:11,280
You from here.

1528
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,280
From here,
if you see you have to click on this,

1529
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,680
it will get highlighted
and then can open this part or

1530
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:18,960
right

1531
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,080
now, do we have reviewed the model?

1532
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,520
Yes, ma'am, we do have we do have

1533
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:30,040
your welcome, sir.

1534
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:30,600
All right.

1535
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:36,440
So now see, guys, Aisha.

1536
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,240
Yes, I will tell you that also,
I read in their notes

1537
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:43,200
we don't have to do it
explicitly will have in function for them

1538
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:48,240
one commander, we do everything okay.

1539
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:51,360
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

1540
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,320
Let's come here.

1541
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,080
Just let me execute.

1542
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,400
Let me execute this log in so you can

1543
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:01,840
you see everyone?

1544
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,000
Everyone. You see this log incident?

1545
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,160
Sometimes what happens,
Sometimes what happens?

1546
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,480
Basically,

1547
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,080
if you execute hundreds in that you do
scenario,

1548
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:17,400
maybe for this and then you wait,
you execute this mercenary.

1549
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,680
Also, there's a out of hundred scenarios

1550
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,960
in Evil boss and 20 will see

1551
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:24,960
it happens.

1552
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,680
Many names take these.

1553
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,800
Remember the example
of parallel execution?

1554
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:33,600
It happens multiple times, right?

1555
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,280
When you execute scenarios,
some of them passed, some of them feel

1556
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:41,320
they please, please join me. Now.

1557
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,640
We have already done writing the code,
copying the code.

1558
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,200
Everything now
makes it more than two conversation.

1559
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,720
It's important discussion.

1560
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:52,920
Now what happens is basically
if this premise scenarios

1561
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,600
are failing,
these two scenarios are free raid.

1562
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,080
So it's not necessary that these are
these scenarios are failed

1563
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:02,360
because of issue in this script.

1564
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:06,360
Because if you execute them one by one,
then this

1565
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,720
you pass, right?

1566
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,360
So maybe due to some unforeseen
circumstances such as application

1567
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,600
not loaded doom was not available

1568
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:21,240
station not created Selenium time out

1569
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:25,680
because of some x, y, z issue,
because of these exceptions and issue.

1570
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,400
Sometimes here disk is good big,

1571
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,160
but sometimes you just get speed.

1572
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:37,320
So now what we are doing as of now,
if my if I executing my request,

1573
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:40,200
guess in the batch execution
I hope everyone knows

1574
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:43,960
what is better execution
they expect already at the time of destiny

1575
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:45,720
there

1576
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:49,600
batch

1577
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:56,760
execution.

1578
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,080
Fine, fine.

1579
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,520
So now, now, now see

1580
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:04,480
what are doing
If we are executing raid by a batch.

1581
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,040
So if hundreds
and that is I'm executing 23.

1582
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:12,200
So again
I'm executing 100 scenarios to test.

1583
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:18,720
That's what we are doing so far,
but that's what we are doing.

1584
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:19,840
Correct.

1585
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,320
Now, Now I do not want to do this.

1586
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,640
I want if I'm executing hundred scenarios,

1587
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:30,280
if 80 bars

1588
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,680
and 20 fail,

1589
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:38,400
I want my convert to execute
only destroying these scenarios again,

1590
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:40,080
because

1591
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,080
if my ID are already paused,
why should I execute?

1592
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,160
Do it again?

1593
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,880
I just want to execute this
20 scenarios fake.

1594
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,400
So what make me do passes
make dumas's point fine.

1595
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,200
What I will do
I will execute your scenarios.

1596
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,200
If you're a designer, use paused.

1597
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:00,440
I'm not bothering
that I'm more bothered about this 20

1598
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:05,600
so I will give you the name of this
20 fields in areas,

1599
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:10,040
name of this 24 scenarios
and then you can execute

1600
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:14,160
only these 20 scenarios which are already
available in just one peak

1601
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,680
in just one thing.

1602
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,880
And just so we can rerun

1603
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:23,840
only three scenarios.

1604
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:28,800
First execution all the scenarios,
then return one more execution

1605
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,560
only for privacy settings,
that kind of sector we need in our.

1606
01:34:33,560 --> 01:34:38,520
Now tell me, isn't it very effective that
if I'm executing 100 of these scenarios

1607
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:42,880
out of them, 100 past four people, So
next time I don't need to execute those.

1608
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,640
I just execute remaining to be

1609
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:48,600
and then they will also be passed
and it is still the issue exist.

1610
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,600
Then maybe we can go
and check our script, right?

1611
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:52,880
So right away

1612
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,440
on the script and changing it
and then it's not a good solution for us.

1613
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:59,120
Give this scenario
speaking to one or two prior

1614
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:00,840
and then come off with your script.

1615
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,560
At this point.

1616
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,960
So what it does to the overview,
the situation, the condition

1617
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:09,960
which we are going to implement now,

1618
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,240
everyone, let's

1619
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:17,680
go ahead and do it and implement
this part.

1620
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:21,480
To implement this part first,
what I'm going to do is

1621
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,680
I am going to open my small guest.

1622
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:27,240
If I'm going to open my smoke, relentless.

1623
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,080
And here in this plugin,
in this plugin, I'm

1624
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:36,400
going add under the blanket
and that plugin name is Reason.

1625
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:40,480
What is the name of this plugin these

1626
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,680
days?

1627
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:45,800
Reading and in zero plugin issued

1628
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:49,000
under target folder.

1629
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,200
Under target folder create one

1630
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,920
the XD file with the name feed.

1631
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:58,920
So now what would happen?

1632
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:02,040
What would happen here is C

1633
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:05,520
this thing disappeared

1634
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:11,760
or b XD by holds

1635
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,040
all the scenarios, all the scenarios

1636
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:19,880
which are which are feed

1637
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,680
during execution plus two

1638
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:33,360
industrial days.

1639
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,520
And now.

1640
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,440
Now when it comes to execute
only those scenarios

1641
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,760
which are field during the execution,
what we have to do

1642
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,880
we need this the file but

1643
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:48,480
read this but we need fine
so when we need this

1644
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:51,960
but how we can get it to see I'm
going to create

1645
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,720
another another class go

1646
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:57,640
read.

1647
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:01,680
What I'm going to create
is an additional class going

1648
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,920
children of right
and in this field, in this

1649
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:10,640
take you let me create
this in the class now see

1650
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:16,240
in this field and then what I need

1651
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,400
let me copy this part

1652
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:21,480
from here to read complete but from here

1653
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,120
and I will pasted here.

1654
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,880
Now tell me this

1655
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:33,640
Do we need this dry rectangular

1656
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,640
to check whether my steps implemented

1657
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:39,880
or not?

1658
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,000
Do we need this bag?

1659
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,520
Also,
are we going to execute based on base?

1660
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:50,720
No, we don't.

1661
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:53,880
Do we need this written like any of

1662
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:57,480
the we need this plugin?

1663
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:02,440
No, because the employee is
generally used to generate the field,

1664
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:06,920
not the XD and they should not be
well executed from here.

1665
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:10,320
So when we're executing already
for the scenario.

1666
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:13,280
So this time why do we need we don't need

1667
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,520
the do we need this reports
guys, this reports

1668
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,600
but we need this import once again we

1669
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,720
know because
reports we are already generating from our

1670
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:27,480
or not render classmate
a smaller regression analysis like

1671
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:32,040
Eric.

1672
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,520
Let's do it.

1673
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,040
Let's do it. It's pretty.

1674
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:39,600
We are keeping it because this pretty well
print all the execution steps in action

1675
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:44,520
so we'll keeping now tell me,
is this the right but is this the right

1676
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:50,040
path to get my finger to see
is this the correct one.

1677
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:52,440
No. Right. So what is the right but

1678
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,960
where where my the extreme
will be generated under

1679
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,720
under target aid.

1680
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:03,200
So to write target the folder

1681
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,720
we have to provide but like this

1682
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:10,160
not to get in under target under target.

1683
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:11,400
What is the name of my clinic?

1684
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,240
That's field.

1685
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,880
Don't be

1686
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:18,480
adherent or the normal field don't be.

1687
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,560
This is the finding we have seen

1688
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:22,800
here.

1689
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,040
This is done by newbie applied.

1690
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:29,760
Can you see?

1691
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:36,520
Can you see that we want.

1692
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:40,400
So now let me do one thing.

1693
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,080
Let me execute

1694
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:48,320
batch 11 mistake here also

1695
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,920
and let me end this big here also.

1696
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,160
So so now in burst
well it is this username

1697
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:57,600
and password

1698
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:04,840
intentionally.

1699
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:08,160
I'm going to feed this one scenario.

1700
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:12,400
I'm going to make three out of 384.

1701
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,160
Let me just execute two scenario.

1702
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,960
Otherwise it would take more time.

1703
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:19,800
So these two scenarios,
these two I'm going to execute

1704
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:24,360
and in this scenario intentionally,
I'm going to pass one

1705
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,800
and I'm going to fill the second one
just to

1706
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,760
right now.

1707
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,680
Let me first change this batch.

1708
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,920
1.11 is right.

1709
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:38,320
And here.

1710
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,000
Here. See what I'm going to do now?

1711
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,920
I'm going to execute my bomberg exemplify.

1712
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,640
So based double click on test,

1713
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:51,040
double click on test to execute this one

1714
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:13,560
for scenario, execute

1715
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:17,960
not it is executing the second one

1716
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,520
will feel played

1717
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,200
beautifully.

1718
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,560
No issues,

1719
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:27,320
Nancy.

1720
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:30,120
According to the setup
which I've made grade.

1721
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:34,440
According to that setup,
I should be able to see their test case

1722
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:36,440
name, which is field under me

1723
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:38,320
and then

1724
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,400
and then Target.

1725
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,680
Can you see in the target
it generates one point call field

1726
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:48,400
or the

1727
01:41:51,800 --> 01:41:56,040
can everyone see this point?

1728
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:58,520
Now let's double click and open this blank

1729
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:04,440
Can you see it
says FYI is is not to see test results

1730
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:07,600
this features log in don't feature line

1731
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,240
number seven do not see

1732
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:14,680
log entered feature line
number seven being

1733
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:19,400
it means this in any any valid
is this log in this one failed or more

1734
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:26,720
this one thing point

1735
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,960
No Now tell me

1736
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,680
how many scenarios of have executed

1737
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:37,440
two How many of you got here?

1738
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,080
One late only failed when we got eight.

1739
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,920
So next time, what do we do?

1740
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:46,960
Let's go into the scenario
check already and find this.

1741
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:47,920
And that is failing.

1742
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,440
My vote is waiting.

1743
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,360
Oh, there is an issue with the code.

1744
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:57,560
I notice I'm going to change this part
with an I need to fix it.

1745
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:58,880
And now.

1746
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,800
Now I don't need to execute
the past scenario.

1747
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:05,160
I will execute only the fields

1748
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:08,160
in any right
to execute the field scenario.

1749
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:08,600
Here.

1750
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,480
What I will do,
I'm simply executing it from here on

1751
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,920
right Click Return

1752
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,160
just to show you.

1753
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:20,440
So this time
how many scenario will get executed

1754
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:26,040
just once in a grade C

1755
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:29,400
spaced, just one scenario got executed.

1756
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:30,560
Understood.

1757
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,760
So this particular fight

1758
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,800
now see can you see it is creating the do
folder

1759
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:40,520
based on field also because
my one scenario of liquidity is this in

1760
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,480
it gave me the name of the scenario
with the paper.

1761
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,720
Also for the screenshots
you can see this things, right?

1762
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:51,840
So my screenshots are also working
according to my condition,

1763
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:55,040
the condition which I passed by

1764
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:00,880
students, what can you see it

1765
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:05,120
in here?

1766
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:05,680
Here.

1767
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:11,840
This part is also working fine.

1768
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,360
What happens to the text file
after the world's biggest file?

1769
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,480
It generates read.

1770
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,360
It generates their data
for all the failure text case

1771
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:22,160
and we provide this file.

1772
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:28,360
But we provided this file
support from field or the field runner.

1773
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:33,360
So next time, whatever their best guesses,
we get this best guesses

1774
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:38,080
details inside this field running via
ready to not be fight.

1775
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:40,400
So now you can run from momentum.

1776
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:42,640
Your report.
Yes we can run from memory as well.

1777
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:45,120
We need to change
this from the field on the

1778
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,400
moment you can read that.

1779
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:55,040
But also right you can go I had this
but also just wanted to show you.

1780
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,320
That's why I execute from your point

1781
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,920
nine guys.

know.

1784
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:17,440
Now let's do something interesting

1785
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,160

These are all three fast.

1882
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,600
It is just playing with the terminal.

1883
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,480
I'm just playing with the terminal.

1884
01:51:29,480 --> 01:51:30,120
Playing

1885
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:33,600
against this one.

1886
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:36,840
See, again, I'm showing

1887
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:39,760
this is your folder part right click here.

1888
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:43,960
I see and the interesting to

1889
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:47,160
you are in your particular CMT command

1890
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:50,200
terminal part.

1891
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:52,920
Yes correct. Correct.

1892
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:55,760
Third place the best yet because
this is the shortest one the shortcut.

1893
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:58,680
No, no.

1894
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:04,080
Here first for see,
I'm not going to execute anything

1895
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:09,240
from my intelligent line
because I can execute my bombarding

1896
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:14,360
symbol flight from my command prompt
if it is available here,

1897
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,600
if my method is available in my machine

1898
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:23,600
and I am in the correct folder repository,
if I'm in the correct project group

1899
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:29,520
with my ribbon so I can execute everything
from my command prompt,

1900
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:32,520
I can execute everything so

1901
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,120
my command prompt understood this point.

1902
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:38,440
Remember I told you forced

1903
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,680
execute everything from feature point.

1904
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:42,640
Then you will execute

1905
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:46,120
everything from remote
plus then you will execute everything from

1906
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,160
textbook fine and.

1907
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:53,040
Now without even in intelligible,
we will execute everything

1908
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:05,840
correct?

1909
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,920
Correct. Yeah. Correct.

1910
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,480
So now see what I'm going
to write the first.

1911
01:53:10,760 --> 01:53:15,040
First, let me tell you how we can execute
simply right in the end

1912
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,880
in the space clean.

1913
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:21,840
Why we use clean the base to remove

1914
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:26,160
and to delete target
for the right to clean up project.

1915
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:29,880
If we get big sexist message here.

1916
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:33,720
If we get sexist message here,
what do we do?

1917
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,920
We simply executing.

1918
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:40,080
If we get this message,
then we will execute our actual code.

1919
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:43,560
All right. Alright

1920
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:48,280

No, you don't need.

1925
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:18,840
You don't

1926
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:23,600
come.

1927
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:27,600
So now, now

1928
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:31,160
with this in being clean
with this inventory.

1929
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:34,560

01:54:39,480 --> 01:54:40,520
inventory.

1932
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,840
So now I am going to run this command.

1933
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,080
And what I'm expecting that message,
I expect.

1934
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:46,360

01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,360
in this great

1946
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:32,720
feature

1947
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:37,840
feature?

1948
01:55:38,360 --> 01:55:39,320
We have to.

1949
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:42,840
No, no, I'm doing this for you
because I want a genius.

1950
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,360
We are going to execute great.

1951
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:51,200
We are going to execute our exhibit
quite right in this command.

1952
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:54,720
We used to execute bombed or similarly

1953
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:57,880
in that complex you will find we provided

1954
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:00,840
the bottom smoke in smoke.

1955
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:03,680
We provided a couple of tapes,
customize missions,

1956
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:07,200
we provided feature point,
but there's so many other things, right?

1957
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:11,000
So the we are bombed
or ExxonMobil was executing

1958
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:14,080
big failure to see the full strength
project to in-situ.

1959
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,320
There is no bombing there.
That is the remnants.

1960
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:19,760
What I am seeing again and again,
you have to be in the right repository.

1961
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:21,080
You are executing it.

1962
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:25,200
Another user is not in the project,
so radio project is available

1963
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,560
right where your bomb external file
is available.

1964
01:56:28,760 --> 01:56:31,960
Open your terminal on that point
and then will execute.

1965
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:34,480
Otherwise your operating symbol
is not available there.

1966
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:36,560
How will pulling the courier
project? Right.

1967
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:38,520
I showed this earlier as well.

1968
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,280
No, that's fine. Let's wait. Fine.

1969
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:41,320
We it's totally

1970
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:43,920
all right.

1971
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,880
So now, now, next thing,
what I'm going to do the moment

1972
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,440
I have run this command in being clean
and being based

1973
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:55,680
the way it was executing my small grammar
using exhibit

1974
01:56:55,880 --> 01:57:00,120
in the same way
it will execute even without intelligence.

1975
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:02,480
So let me be in print

1976
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:08,680
what an invalid now needs to be

1977
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:11,560
compiling.

1978
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:20,120
So it would be great for me, I think.

1979
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,520
Very good resource.

1980
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,680
So need to see the

1981
01:57:23,680 --> 01:57:26,080
maybe it is a double Olympic minus again.

1982
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,080
Explain this point. Let me quickly fix it.

1983
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:42,320
I can fix signatures.

1984
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,040
Your works videos. Yeah, that's fine.

1985
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:46,680
Despite being

1986
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:50,640
not Nazi

1987
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:53,840
Nazis. As if I'm doing it.

1988
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:57,480
See, I'm doing it from my.

1989
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,720
From mine.

1990
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:00,960
Come on, from
now. See, it is working fine.

1991
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:05,200
It is working fine.

1992
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:06,040
Correct.

1993
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,840
This is this like scenario
which I am executing.

1994
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:09,960
Correct.

1995
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,000
Getting

1996
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:18,560
correct Nazi mine to test fast

1997
01:58:19,120 --> 01:58:22,280
even without touching my intelligence.

1998
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,000
I got the result.

1999
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,400
My two best
first grade don't test run to failure.

2000
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:31,320
Zero errors zero zero.

2001
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:34,440
Correct.

2002
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,680
Is this correct?

2003
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:38,520
Grade

2004
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:43,600
some output
that is in console rate putting in console

2005
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:47,960
in your command company auditing,
getting every single information.

2006
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:54,280
Every single information in this command
appropriate.

2007
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:57,800
Good. Correct. Correct. No.

2008
01:58:57,800 --> 01:59:01,000
We're directly dealing
with the data management tool, right.

2009
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:05,080
Directly
dealing with the written management,

2010
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:05,560
which

2011
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:13,200
already correct

2012
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,800
already industrial.

2013
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:25,760
We should test we want to run from
city of the I'm coming to that point.

2014
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:28,080
You get that for us to learn
what I'm teaching.

2015
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:29,160
Right.

2016
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:31,640
And then coming to the point
which I will teach later

2017
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:34,840
is that any so far which I lived,

2018
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,120
I didn't

2019
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:40,280
leave any single point
covering one by one.

2020
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:45,040
But the problem is
I am only one guy so I can cover 1.1.

2021
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:47,680
But after some time
I will take another topic.

2022
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:48,400
Okay,

2023
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:51,240
so now, now here from that's

2024
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:55,200
how developers work.

2025
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,880
They never execute, right?

2026
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,080
They do not execute from intended

2027
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:02,760
or from a glimpse because the project
is available in some repository

2028
02:00:03,080 --> 02:00:06,440
somewhere right there
to the updated project in their folder.

2029
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:09,600
They simply open the command prompt
in this input on this command

2030
02:00:09,600 --> 02:00:11,200
and it's working point there.

2031
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:14,200
So they work in the studio

2032
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:20,200
indisputably on how they work.

2033
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:27,320
Is. Yeah, please knock, please.

2034
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:31,440
Plus a

2035
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:33,000
knock.

2036
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:33,720
There's one time.

2037
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:36,080
See, I will cover this point.

2038
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,280
I will cover this point week.

2039
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:41,680
I just explained this is one time.

2040
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:46,680
Don't expect everything.

2041
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:48,360
Can you repeat that one? Yes.

2042
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:49,080
So how?

2043
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:52,960
If we do not want to execute our best
guess from intelligent from anywhere?

2044
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:54,480
What do you have this project?

2045
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,640
Do you have any your good right?

2046
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:57,480
What do you do?

2047
02:00:57,480 --> 02:01:00,320
Just take the updated code
from the gate in your machine.

2048
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:04,600
Once you have this code in your machine,
open the folder.

2049
02:01:04,600 --> 02:01:09,000
You have vulgar ExxonMobil
in your local computer time command prompt

2050
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,920
or open that particular folder
in your terminal or in command prompt.

2051
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:16,760
Very apologetic symbolism
and then simply run this command.

2052
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:19,480
Now you need an intelligent eclipse.

2053
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:21,080
You don't need it. Got it.

2054
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:23,600
You don't need it.

2055
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:24,320
You don't

2056
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:28,040
quite So now

2057
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:31,760
coming to the last point, coming
to the last point of this particular path.

2058
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:32,720
Right.

2059
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:34,080
Got it.

2060
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,560
Coming to the last line
of this particular work. See

2061
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,960
if I want to run,

2062
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:42,360
if I want to run both these things

2063
02:01:42,360 --> 02:01:46,200
together in being clean and being busy
right now, what we are doing,

2064
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:49,200
we are cleaning
first in the existing best.

2065
02:01:49,680 --> 02:01:53,640
Now we are doing and being clean and test
both together.

2066
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:56,880
Press enough,

2067
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,240
see first it cleaned everything.

2068
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:04,480
It deleted their target folder,
then it is started the execution.

2069
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:09,120
When it started the execution, it executes
all of my best case

2070
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:12,680
once and executing all of my best guess.

2071
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:22,920
See, Aisha

2072
02:02:24,720 --> 02:02:26,440
is there answer to your question?

2073
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:29,160
Do we need to execute clean
always before test?

2074
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:34,320
So the answer is no one
command will work for both cleaning best

2075
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:37,880
understood everyone

2076
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:40,960
there is everyone understood

2077
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:48,680
this.

2078
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:51,000
Nice. Now last one.

2079
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,160
Last one.

2080
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:54,600
What if.

2081
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:58,560
What if I am on to override my bag?

2082
02:02:59,080 --> 02:03:01,280
I don't want to execute
only smokes in animals.

2083
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,800
I don't want to execute only integrations.

2084
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:05,960
Usually I want to execute

2085
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:09,360
scenarios based on their dates
I would be providing here on me.

2086
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:10,800
Right here only.

2087
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,080
So what is the resolution to that point?

2088
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:16,080
How we can do that

2089
02:03:19,880 --> 02:03:21,960
and as to what I'm seeing.

2090
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:24,560
So now.

2091
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:26,360
Sorry, can you show the last command?

2092
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,720
It's Ambient cleaning based together.

2093
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:31,480
Ambient cleaning this together. Right.

2094
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:33,080
So the one

2095
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,600
what do you want to see them

2096
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:40,920
the last command executed in
we end up next.

2097
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:43,480
We already discussed this in being clean.

2098
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:44,600
So your target folder,

2099
02:03:45,720 --> 02:03:46,280
if you guys

2100
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:49,280
want to see which command
you executed last.

2101
02:03:49,480 --> 02:03:54,360
So simply simply place this over
the upper end, over.

2102
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:57,000
See, I typed in your keyboard.

2103
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,400
It gives me the command
which I executed last.

2104
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,400
Before that I executed.

2105
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:02,800
And we invest one more time.

2106
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,720
If I click this upper, it'll

2107
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:07,200
give me that command.

2108
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:09,600
This would be my last third, last third.

2109
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:11,200
So last again.

2110
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:12,040
Last command.

2111
02:04:12,040 --> 02:04:18,960
Can you see this?

2112
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:19,640
Right.

2113
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:21,840
So now it's time.

2114
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:24,120
It's time to override.

2115
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:27,680
Let me go here.

2116
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:28,840
Let me go here.

2117
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:31,640
And this time. Right.

2118
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:35,280
Let's change this to change changes
to ambient.

2119
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:39,320
Let's change is to me in back right now

2120
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:41,720
see in my smoke which they use available

2121
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:45,240
even if we ran

2122
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:49,320
it from terminal would still go
Yes yes it will still be report

2123
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:53,920
because to me
we are executing our protection and import

2124
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:59,440
exam will be I to plug it in so intimately
it is creating report everything

2125
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:03,480
paid rate.

2126
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:06,920
So now
now guys, what I'm going to do here I'm

2127
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:11,360
going to I'm going to
what am I to my big brain?

2128
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:12,360
How to do that?

2129
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:15,560
See here I will write ambient

2130
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:19,280
test my normal command

2131
02:05:20,560 --> 02:05:22,600
and weirdest is my normal
command of delete.

2132
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:25,680
That is

2133
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,160
going after this.

2134
02:05:28,160 --> 02:05:33,680
I have to date minus B minus
B, then I have to write

2135
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:37,600
here it go letter dot options

2136
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:41,440
minus D into my dot options

2137
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:44,640
without space minus d

2138
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:48,120
to compare dog options is equals to

2139
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:51,680
is equals to double

2140
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:54,840
and the will cause minus minus

2141
02:05:55,480 --> 02:05:59,120
six, minus minus x.

2142
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:00,760
And you see guys

2143
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:11,560
minus maintenance bags

2144
02:06:11,560 --> 02:06:13,680
at the rate mean

2145
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:17,960
whatever I think very ambient.

2146
02:06:17,960 --> 02:06:19,800
You see everyone this

2147
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:24,480
so this time doesn't matter.

2148
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:30,920
This time doesn't matter which particular
bag you have provided in your book.

2149
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:32,880
Smoker enough right.

2150
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:36,360
This Vonnegut exhibit
will take you to smoke or not,

2151
02:06:36,560 --> 02:06:41,200
but will replace this bag
from your ambient big so only scenario

2152
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:47,280
which is I mean in being dead
will get executed afterwards.

2153
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:48,720
That's this point everyone

2154
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,280
wants to be one industrial designer.

2155
02:06:54,280 --> 02:07:03,280
What?

2156
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,400
No, we don't need to change anywhere.

2157
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:08,000
We don't need to change anything any bit.

2158
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Everything will be going from here.

2159
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:21,120
No, see, no.

2160
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,000
Didn't take it.

2161
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,280
Didn't think there would be something
wrong happen

2162
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:33,480
to a john and badge eliminate about target

2163
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:40,080
port number
is this take a smoking bench 11 blade

2164
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:43,440
so they take a look right
Let me change this

2165
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:48,640
Let me change this command to

2166
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:51,920
minus D to convert

2167
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:54,560
or are free to talk.

2168
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:58,720
X is equals two

2169
02:08:01,360 --> 02:08:03,000
is equals to this time.

2170
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,360
And that in

2171
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:21,760
you it won't see.

2172
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,800
So now know which command
we have to use gate

2173
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:29,080
See my ambient best is my normal command
rate.

2174
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:35,360
Ambient best is my normal
command minus d controller dot filter

2175
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:40,560
dot bags is equals to
and the rate in which did I want the bus.

2176
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:42,280
So now

2177
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:47,960
now if you see here it executed
it executed my wish take a direct ambient

2178
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:51,760
is this the scenario be executed
so there is no match 11 now

2179
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:52,880
can you see

2180
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:57,560
and you see how we override

2181
02:08:57,560 --> 02:09:00,040
how we override this part C

2182
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:04,080
B ambient best minus D could convert

2183
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:07,960
not free dog because the ambient let me

2184
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:10,360
put this command.

2185
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:12,520
If we put this command in

2186
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:15,000
in No you're not.

2187
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,080
So it is the most

2188
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:20,760
to execute from

2189
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:24,520
from CMB or

2190
02:09:29,240 --> 02:09:30,120
in place.

2191
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:31,440
One command

2192
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:35,080
post is another command in being clean.

2193
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:39,160
Is this under the command in its mind
as de

2194
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:43,480
da to

2195
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:48,760
don't fix is equals to iterate

2196
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:53,480
whatever you want to provide
from the override already base

2197
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,840
it a couple of more points

2198
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:03,360
open, open the CMB or terminal,

2199
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:08,160
open this DMV or
terminal in the project Root

2200
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:11,640
beer on dark.

2201
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:14,320
Examine is available

2202
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:18,560
and then execute

2203
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,720
it. Your commands

2204
02:10:22,720 --> 02:10:25,200
and just put this part

2205
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:28,240
and dispute this part.

2206
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:30,960
Let me take another one.

2207
02:10:30,960 --> 02:10:33,440
Let's take any scenario, for example here.

2208
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:37,320
Go in in school here and take any of those

2209
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:39,400
in any of

2210
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:42,280
maybe from this book.

2211
02:10:42,280 --> 02:10:45,720
So let's finish facility grade point,

2212
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:50,720
go here and instead of ambient
I want to execute dashboard,

2213
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:53,520
let's execute.

2214
02:10:54,480 --> 02:11:14,280
See it executed one scenario

2215
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:34,680
and which one it executed.

2216
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:37,040
Number 33.

2217
02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:40,280
x is equal to the rate

2218
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:48,600
in the fish board.

2219
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:49,160
Wait, wait.

2220
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:50,680
I want to show you the remote.

2221
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:51,760
That's why

2222
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,640
this should be visible correctly.

2223
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:57,520
It opened the scenario

2224
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:01,880
and it got executed now.

2225
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:03,040
So see

2226
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:07,760
here it executed for data main beam,
live time

2227
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:12,000
recruitment performance dashboard
that both things in the message

2228
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,040
all values or tables are equal in best
guess his past which best kids exist.

2229
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:17,800
This board

2230
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,560
ought to be overriding their next or not.

2231
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:22,120
Nice Tell me here

2232
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:26,320
are we overriding their tanks or not?

2233
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:30,800
So if you want to execute your smoke,
just simply say no.

2234
02:12:30,840 --> 02:12:32,720
Come on, it will execute.

2235
02:12:32,720 --> 02:12:35,320
If you want to execute the ignition one,
come on,

2236
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:40,280
it will execute the student.

2237
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:42,840
They want the new member
to execute their test.

2238
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:47,000
Because this idea that advantages
of not so many things

2239
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,640
to compile your code to make your code
rate is a single boot.

2240
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:54,600
Yeah I already coming to this command
right in your

2241
02:12:55,720 --> 02:12:58,240
in your code
but still see this is the command

2242
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:01,440
ambient best minus

2243
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:05,680
the jumper not filtered
or x is equal to the rig.

2244
02:13:05,680 --> 02:13:12,360
Whatever you want to pass on replace.

2245
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:19,000
All right, guys.

2246
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:22,440
So now now practically for code

2247
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:25,760
writing part
minuses will probably I did typing wrong

2248
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:34,960
correct.

2249
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,200
Correct. Probably.

2250
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:40,080
You're typing something wrong this way.

2251
02:13:40,080 --> 02:13:42,720
So now we are done with that.

2252
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:45,720
The chamber framework portion.

2253
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:48,000
We are done with the input crucial rate.

2254
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:52,440
All the coding related part,
big part conceptual part.

2255
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:55,200
Everything is done.
Just one thing is remaining there.

2256
02:13:55,400 --> 02:14:00,480
The explanation code moment that I will do
after the break or after the break

2257
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:03,120
with see what member means.

2258
02:14:04,440 --> 02:14:07,200
Let's take a break guys, for 15 minutes

2259
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:12,000
of the minutes before

2260
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:18,360
10 minutes admin instead of a beep

2261
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:27,880
note the text.

2262
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:29,040
It's completely

2263
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:44,800
code is committed pushed.

2264
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:45,480
Right.

2265
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:48,240
All right.
I see you attempting to escalate.

2266
02:14:48,600 --> 02:14:52,080
11 2332 2347 We meet once again

2267
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:56,160
15 minute.

2268
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:58,480
All right, base final

2269
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:13,320
alright can you Napier ambient clean

2270
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,800
can it be here

2271
02:15:21,480 --> 02:15:23,800
intended need I just want to check

2272
02:15:35,960 --> 02:15:38,160
what is the output really successful
for you

2273
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:49,800
looking by now.

2274
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:56,160
If it is really success with ambient bleed
it means the problem is with a big test.

2275
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:01,280
See it says will success rate
now it is working fine now blink ambient

2276
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:04,640
test simple in being pissed right
and we entered

2277
02:16:08,120 --> 02:16:11,280
late in ambient test sick and

2278
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:17,000
I give you one by moment.

2279
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:21,280
I didn't give you the complete
information of ambient test.

2280
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:25,440
Minor could convert or not
baked in the plus short and we are just

2281
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:29,320
then ambient clean ambient
clean this together

2282
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:33,840
and then overwriting that take me do it
step by step so that you can check

2283
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:40,720
whether your code is working
correctly or not.

2284
02:16:40,720 --> 02:16:41,560
Well, read

2285
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:45,400
my source for Max.

2286
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:51,120
Everyone is here now.

2287
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:53,520
Right? So now this is the problem
with your another class.

2288
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:55,840
I could totally see this in the error.

2289
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:58,520
The problem is with yet
another class. And what class

2290
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:05,400
this time problem is with your class.

2291
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:06,400
Put it in the support.

2292
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:10,760
They will help you Shiva, if your there
in the sample, please help on one read.

2293
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:13,360
She is having some really basic
problem. Right?

2294
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:16,120
These are committed

2295
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:18,840
by good okay students.

2296
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:22,000
So now. Now here

2297
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:22,320
here.

2298
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:25,360
See I'm looking about

2299
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:26,800
Melbourne.

2300
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:28,480
No segment

2301
02:17:30,720 --> 02:17:32,080
if you see

2302
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:37,680
clean validate compile
this package ready by install side deploy.

2303
02:17:37,680 --> 02:17:40,320
Can you see all this like sake?

2304
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:43,200
Can anyone see this

2305
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:45,640
right now?

2306
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:47,000
What is the meaning?

2307
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,960
What is the meaning of this lifecycle?

2308
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:52,920
Why we use let me tell you, higher grade

2309
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:54,920
here,

2310
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:56,560
here,

2311
02:17:57,480 --> 02:17:59,280
here, here.

2312
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:03,480
When we talk about clean grade,
when we talk about clean.

2313
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:06,480
So the moment you run in being clean,
what it does

2314
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:10,320
it briefly, it performs
three actions be clean,

2315
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:12,320
clean,

2316
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:15,120
forced, simple.

2317
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:15,840
This clean.

2318
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:19,200
If we talk about in the clean action,
it removes

2319
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:23,520
and cleans my mine.

2320
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:26,640
But a good friend of mine I did it for

2321
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:28,840
industrial.

2322
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:34,040
It bleeds my body food industry everyone.

2323
02:18:34,040 --> 02:18:37,240
Now this is the $7 billion

2324
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:40,360
7 billion after clean.

2325
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:43,760
What did this see after clean
what it does.

2326
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:47,080
So here we have complied

2327
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:51,600
we have test

2328
02:18:51,600 --> 02:18:54,480
we package

2329
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:57,400
we have installed

2330
02:18:57,400 --> 02:19:00,120
we have deployed.

2331
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:02,840
We have really by

2332
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:04,760
grade we have been

2333
02:19:04,760 --> 02:19:09,560
put in a stored and there is some movement
the repository site available

2334
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:13,240
break this part. Now

2335
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:18,080
when you actually test
when you actually run the command call,

2336
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:22,880
when you actually run a command record
and read a test.

2337
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:27,000
So what it does,
what this command is first,

2338
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:33,760
first
it combined your code, it can verify its

2339
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:40,720
if if there
is something which we need to install.

2340
02:19:40,840 --> 02:19:44,840
Let's say you read a dependency rate
but operating the dependency

2341
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:46,520
you reload your project.

2342
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:50,440
So installation is yet to be done
if you run in your test.

2343
02:19:50,680 --> 02:19:56,640
So clean install those jobs
dependencies as well and then it converts

2344
02:19:56,640 --> 02:20:02,280
your entire project into a package
so that it can make a single build.

2345
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:06,320
And after that
it will execute your test case.

2346
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:10,840
So before execution
it combines your code capability,

2347
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:13,960
but it's within your code is not

2348
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:17,240
build, build your part installed.

2349
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:21,920
If there is any dependency
or job widespread that needs to be added

2350
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:26,640
and then convert your package
into convert your code project

2351
02:20:26,680 --> 02:20:30,920
into a package form
and then simply execute via test.

2352
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:31,320
Come on.

2353
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:34,600
I'm not talking about deploy

2354
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:38,960
because this deployed it's
not that deploy the deployment.

2355
02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:42,320
It is something as diplomacy elements

2356
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:45,880
relating to the server
to execute for execution

2357
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:48,200
or discord.

2358
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:48,960
Everyone

2359
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:54,120
everyone understood

2360
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:56,160
will lifecycle.

2361
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:58,960
If we make it very clear

2362
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:02,360
that we used

2363
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:06,360
cannot be put there.

2364
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:09,000
So it would be your

2365
02:21:10,960 --> 02:21:15,440
compiler test

2366
02:21:19,720 --> 02:21:21,400
package

2367
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:26,280
for installing

2368
02:21:27,240 --> 02:21:30,480
deploy.

2369
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:32,200
We deployed

2370
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:34,840
clean.

2371
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:38,760
So here
I served three actions three clean, clean

2372
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:42,320
and paused clean.

2373
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:43,440
And this is available.

2374
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:46,960
You signed there.

2375
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:50,040
So that's how

2376
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:53,040
things work.

2377
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:54,920
This is Europe.

2378
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:57,240
This is your Melbourne.

2379
02:21:57,520 --> 02:22:04,280
This is your Melbourne Lifecycle.

2380
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:05,640
Remember life cycle.

2381
02:22:05,640 --> 02:22:10,680
Everyone, everyone,

2382
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:26,040
guys, come on.

2383
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,880
Any questions?

2384
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:30,160
Look, in this park,
what is movement lifecycle,

2385
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:44,960
how we generally use it?

2386
02:22:44,960 --> 02:22:47,840
Is there anyone who has
any question about this park

2387
02:22:53,440 --> 02:22:54,280
currently

2388
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:59,560
not correct, but that's what
we generally do rate many of the year.

2389
02:22:59,760 --> 02:23:03,000
It is doing everything on it,
so we don't need group

2390
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:05,120
rate.

2391
02:23:06,200 --> 02:23:10,760
This is all the visitors information,
all the business of measurement.

2392
02:23:11,240 --> 02:23:16,160
That's why we use measurement
as a mood management tool to compare.

2393
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:19,040
But with both

2394
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:21,480
basics and framework

2395
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:29,080
is done.

2396
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:31,480
Correct? Correct. Right.

2397
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:36,200
See, this is a part of lifecycle inventory
validate compile Best buy.

2398
02:23:36,200 --> 02:23:38,000
Get ready by installing deploy site.

2399
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,480
Everything is a part of lifecycle trade

2400
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:42,880
correctness.

2401
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:48,400
Can you see this on my screen?

2402
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:51,560
Come on students display
start typing days.

2403
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,520
I'm going to commit the code in that.

2404
02:23:53,520 --> 02:24:01,440
Importantly.

2405
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:02,680
Nice nice.

2406
02:24:02,680 --> 02:24:05,760
Fine. Fine.

2407
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:11,360
So finally we are done with command.

2408
02:24:11,360 --> 02:24:17,160
So prior to 2 minutes, how is the journey?

2409
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:39,360
How is the journey so far?

2410
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:42,000
This is something you have to do
for the entire thing,

2411
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:49,640
not just the last part, but Angelica.

2412
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:52,440
I hope
that is no concentrate with and as food,

2413
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:55,560
there is no concept we should get it.

2414
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:57,560
You got every single concept.

2415
02:24:57,560 --> 02:25:05,080
What did we.

2416
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:06,440
I'm talking.

2417
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:11,280
I'm asking from understanding
perspective, explanation, perspective.

2418
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:13,440
Was that anything?

2419
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:16,680
Was there anything from my side
that you made a mistake?

2420
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:21,920
Is there anything or is there any concept
that you guys didn't understand?

2421
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:45,560
It was like a monster for you.

2422
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:49,440
Concepts are clear.

2423
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:53,760
It's great.

2424
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:56,160
Seen for that right before that
once you are done with the course.

2425
02:25:56,160 --> 02:26:00,120
I read that you remember all of this

2426
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:23,440
was totally in the stomach.

2427
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:27,560
No, not one important point as I see many.

2428
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:30,920
You got exhausted because of
not of information recovered to date.

2429
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:35,160
Great greatness.

2430
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:36,000
Students, come on.

2431
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,880
Just a couple of more minutes with me
and then you will be to play.

2432
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:44,800
I know you guys are exhausted because
we have learned a lot of information.

2433
02:26:44,800 --> 02:26:47,200
So now I'm going to give you some ease

2434
02:26:47,920 --> 02:26:52,320
rate and we do give you
some is what we are going to do today.

2435
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:57,120
I was supposed to cover one more topic
related to testing, right?

2436
02:26:57,800 --> 02:27:01,040
So this is we can create a project

2437
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:04,840
level project with best integration
work, best engineering related.

2438
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:07,920
It's a because we've seen 90% see,

2439
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:12,480
but because by looking at
your responses here and the

2440
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:15,600
energy level rate for everyone,

2441
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:18,200
I decided to postpone this

2442
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:21,360
big group the models class.

2443
02:27:21,360 --> 02:27:23,600
So in tomorrow's review,

2444
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:26,320
it's a must attend review for all of you

2445
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:30,640
because in the first portion
of that particular review,

2446
02:27:30,840 --> 02:27:34,680
we will create this energy
based framework, right?

2447
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,080
Based on the best framework
in just one hour.

2448
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:40,240
What it will take, hardly
one hour will make just one or two test

2449
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:42,800
is not more than just one or two gives us

2450
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:49,920
have to be true during the review class.

2451
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:54,920
Yeah, very important but important piece
because it doesn't make any sense

2452
02:27:54,920 --> 02:27:57,320
if I beat you right.
Not as the new framework also.

2453
02:27:57,360 --> 02:27:59,720
And you guys get confusion,
both of them. Right?

2454
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:06,520
I totally understand that you guys need
practice that

2455
02:28:23,320 --> 02:28:24,280
already today.

2456
02:28:24,280 --> 02:28:24,880
So now

2457
02:28:31,480 --> 02:28:33,360
Yammer,
you might want to hear the standard

2458
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:35,240
but then you this topic, right?

2459
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:37,760
This topic is you can watch right?

2460
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:39,680
You can watch this topic.

2461
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:45,160
And in the recordings, basically it won't
take more than an hour for me to explain.

2462
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:46,320
So I will do that.

2463
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:48,600
And you guys would be comfortable
for that.

2464
02:28:48,600 --> 02:28:53,520
I know I'm pretty sure that
because the hardest part, the hardest part

2465
02:28:53,880 --> 02:28:56,520
you guys are going through already,
you guys are done

2466
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:00,000
and you guys did really well
In the hardest part.

2467
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,680
That was the framework.

2468
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:03,840
If you understood the framework,

2469
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:11,800
if you can, the framework, right.

2470
02:29:12,160 --> 02:29:14,520
If you understand this,
if you can explain this,

2471
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:18,040
that the intention, the

2472
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:21,280
of attending the asset class is achieved,

2473
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:24,000
it's achievable.

2474
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,640
If you can explain this framework part
according to the expectations,

2475
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:29,440
if you can do it,

2476
02:29:30,520 --> 02:29:32,560
definitely everything is done.

2477
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:33,200
Quick question.

2478
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:39,360
I don't know if you're already answered
this, that that's what I'm saying.

2479
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:41,840
We are going to create one thing
working out tomorrow.

2480
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:45,000
Do you in the top that would be best
and you work with whomever

2481
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:49,320
the correct.

2482
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:50,800
I will.

2483
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:54,200
I would be too late

2484
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:55,680
already.

2485
02:29:55,680 --> 02:30:00,480
One more class with all of you and
then you guys will be free from mistake.

2486
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:03,200
Okay, I think I'm done from my sailboat
race class.

2487
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:05,200
If you guys have any question, please ask.
