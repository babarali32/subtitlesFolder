1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,560
Nobel Peace Prize.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
These go to tanks.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,240
I was connected about an hour ago.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
Is there any antivirus or
something like that

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,440
that might be stopping you from connection
or something like that?

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,000
Maybe you should restart your computer.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,840
Only three more weeks of classes
until interview prep.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,160
Oh, you guys are already done
with the course?

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,320
Yes, you.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,720
You are just left with the AP classes and.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,440
Yep, the two genuine classes that sit.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,680
Yep. Yep.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,600
So finally,
you guys are ready by David D batch

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,640
and they are doing very well.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,640
One group is all for around.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,440
It's their third week.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,080
For the second group,
it's their second week.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,480
And 15 of them, they already have offers

19
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,360
which which they have accepted

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,440
and other around other ten more students.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,520
They are in process.

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,440
So hopefully by the next week
they will also be finalizing

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,760
their offers,
being drawn up by the state of mind.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,320
I refuse to accept.

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,360
So if you guys want,
maybe we can invite some students

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,320
from Belgium
as well on Sunday or Saturday.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,680
Remind me if you guys want to meet them.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,760
I am scared.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,120
We are all grown up.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,200
Okay.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Remind me on on Friday.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,560
I will.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,200
And I will invite some of them again.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,160
How was your homework, guys?

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,240
What are you guys able to do?

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:15,040
It was easy, hard.

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,200
It was pretty easy.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,280
Just took a little bit of time
to find the right column names.

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,400
E That database is

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,440
is huge.

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,120
It has kind of.

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,240
How about earlier?

43
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,480
How did we find these columns
or a term job title

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,800
as such a chart employee A Our dependance

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,080
you guys

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,640
then you didn't find these tables.

47
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,000
Did I miss something?

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
Yes. These are tables,
not columns actually.

49
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,320
So you guys can have a look at

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,760
these tables

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:12,440
in here.

52
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,800
Almost done and everything is gone.

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,960
I did not say a word.

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Somehow I lost it.

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,800
This at just a job. Employees.

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:32,800
If you go inside the columns,
they all the columns.

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,040
If you guys want, maybe we can agree

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,360
we can go all the some homework
otherwise I think they were pretty easy

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,160
can go around

60
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,760
doing homework.

61
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
All right guys,

62
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,160
let me do this.

63
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,840
Let's
let's give some winners for the region.

64
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:11,560
But so let's start from

65
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,520
this database team.

66
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,320
So can you guys tell me
what is in database?

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,000
Hello?

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,440
Hello.

69
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:35,240
And why we are learning about databases,
software to store and fetch

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,720
data from.

71
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:55,800
Okay, organize and manage data.

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,000
So it's a specialized software that stores

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,960
and manages the information for you.

74
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,840
Right?

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,600
It is a storage.

76
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,640
Yes, it's a storage tree.

77
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,040
And most of all, what are those three VMs

78
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,640
manipulate, manage.

79
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,400
Good question.

80
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,680
Can we go over little hole ask page file,

81
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,720
curious to see and below other icons?

82
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,200
Oh yes.

83
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,960
In here

84
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,160
I seem to you in this one

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:51,480
I or you mean these icons in here?

86
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,640
I think otherwise joining to a different

87
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:02,520
class.

88
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,720
So this

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,520
button in

90
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,720
here it says
create a new obscure tab for executing.

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,680
So if you click on you will be having it
kind of your same

92
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,160
as if you guys are creating
new classes in intelligence.

93
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,400
So it will open a new file
where you can write your queries.

94
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,800
And this one is to open

95
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,200
the already saved scripts

96
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,440
that you might have on your computer.

97
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,160
This one is open, Inspector

98
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
for this selected object.

99
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,080
So most of the time
you guys will not be needing them

100
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,680
because there are high chances
that you guys will be using

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,600
a different software and you will find
different buttons and functionality

102
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,360
in that piece of software.

103
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,600
How we can change a name.

104
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,760
Uh, because this is the

105
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,600
most advanced software ever created,

106
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,080
you guys have to first

107
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,520
store the file to make changes.

108
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,200
So you see,

109
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,120
I just clicked on that work and then,
I don't know, maybe I have to start this.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,520
I assume this is because of you will see.

111
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,520
You asked me about that.

112
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,160
Oh, let's not go over the next icons.

113
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,400
Otherwise
I don't think we will be able to continue

114
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,320
on this class.

115
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Okay. I am sorry.

116
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,480
Please, please respond back to me.

117
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,080
Please close this program.

118
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,320
No rules.

119
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:17,560
Yes, but I'm really around

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,720
the line of what I thought was like
almost salaam set

121
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,240
the has.

122
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:37,480
Try these buttons
and let me know what these buttons do.

123
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:46,520
Or maybe we can have a separate ball
after the class.

124
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,400
So let's.

125
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,080
Let's focus on the things that work.

126
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,040
This is your database.

127
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:07,480
These are the tables inside your database.

128
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,520
And if you want to
have a look, let's see inside

129
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,760
each of
the tables and there that are types

130
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,440
and then you can expand them.

131
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,960
This foreign key then triggers indexes.

132
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,920
I will teach you later.

133
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,160
For now,

134
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,880
you should only care about these

135
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,760
column names,

136
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,680
these indexes.

137
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,520
They are something to make your queries
faster for keys.

138
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,480
We will learn in next class and triggers
are you guys can do it.

139
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,560
Pretty simple.

140
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,080
Triggers are special events

141
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,640
that when whenever those events happen

142
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,160
and if you want to execute a special duty

143
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,600
against those events,
you can provide those days.

144
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,480
In here, for example,
if a rule is inserted inside a table

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,840
and you want to do something special,
you can do that.

146
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,280
If something is deleted from a table,
maybe you want to create a backup of

147
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,680
that role which is being deleted
from a table inside another table.

148
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,160
So usually we implement
these kind of things in the triggers

149
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,560
triangle threat.

150
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,560
But you guys still remember
those drawings of wrappers.

151
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,120
Okay, maybe I should watch that video

152
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,160
for you guys.

153
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,600
You guys give us time to Muslin, right

154
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,720
out of it.

155
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,640
Please don't give him a tough time.

156
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,720
He is magic one.

157
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,000
Anything he I think he married like

158
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,040
just before this bash started around
four months or five months.

159
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,800
So those were his initial days.

160
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,920
Maybe that's why he was confused

161
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,320
about those drawings.

162
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,480
If you

163
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,040
so well,

164
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,560
what is the difference
between my school and school

165
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,040
guys?

166
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,960
The difference between my school
and as you know, at

167
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,000
he is still trying to forget
those wrappers.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
I think it's

169
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,120
a school is a spender
and my school is an open source database.

170
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
Great answer for the a perfect answer.

171
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,480
So is the standard and skill stands
for Structured Query Language.

172
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
While my school is a database
which is an open source

173
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,360
spec, our base.

174
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:38,240
So these are the three M's manipulate,
manage and maintain.

175
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,520
And a database is a storage system

176
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,120
that allow users to keep, organize
and manage data.

177
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,120
Right.

178
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,200
And why should not
why should we not use a software

179
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,840
like maybe Microsoft Excel
or something like that?

180
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,760
Why should we go with the databases

181
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,800
slow, cannot handle

182
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,320
large amounts of data,
cannot implement security.

183
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,960
For example,
if you want to allow the access

184
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,640
for certain tables to certain employees,
it will be possible with the skill,

185
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:24,480
but it will be hard
and it will not be scalable.

186
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,440
Can you guys tell me the names of maybe

187
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,560
three famous databases

188
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,680
because of amount of data?

189
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,000
My skill? Yes.

190
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,040
The open source

191
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,600
for companies will be using my school.

192
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,080
The which companies will be using Oracle

193
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,320
and the companies
who don't care about their products

194
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,240
and good quality of service.

195
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,080
They will be using my SQL Server,
which is the database

196
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,960
from Microsoft. And

197
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,800
so you can judge a company

198
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,760
from the database that they are using

199
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,280
and what about the

200
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,000
what about the guide that will be helping
you regarding your database?

201
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,960
It is, let's say, for example,

202
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,680
if you want to ask

203
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,120
to reset to your bill, your password,

204
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,880
or if you want to create an

205
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,280
if you want to have the credentials
to connect to the database

206
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,640
or if you are facing
any issue with the database.

207
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,440
So to whom
you should connect in your company,

208
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,560
you should connect the
to database administrator, right?

209
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,440
They are called a DB is the word,

210
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,640
but we always use Oracle in our job
or only my assortment.

211
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,240
Depends on your company, which company

212
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,760
you will be using Oracle for Company
you will be using my ask you.

213
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,880
So they are called DB as database
administrators and it's a separate team

214
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,280
that only manages your databases.

215
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,720
So we have a team of developers,
we have a team of testers,

216
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,000
we have a team of dev ops guys

217
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,160
who will be taking care of

218
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,240
all the softwares that you might need

219
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,080
to install on your laptops
to perform your duties.

220
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,320
And we will be having database teams,

221
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,000
we will be having admin teams
who will be taking care of your things,

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,040
like providing you
with a laptop and all of that.

223
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,200
In interview, I will first ask

224
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,920
which you obviously are using your

225
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,960
SO are there only one types of databases

226
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,080
or will we have multiple
types of databases?

227
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,720
Is a squirrel is a database? I think so.

228
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,440
I think so.

229
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:32,880
Yes, it is a database,

230
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,960
but it also looks that

231
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,880
someone from back six
or seven has great good

232
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,560
discoveries
from the look and feel of this.

233
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,880
And when they say my skill, we will say,
don't bother sending me and all offer us.

234
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,720
They told me you guys are more oh they
might we been good to their employers.

235
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,680
That's why they might be cutting the cost
from the tools and do

236
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,440
databases is also possible

237
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,000
and there is a donate button.

238
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,680
No it is not a database.

239
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:09,920
Yeah,

240
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,280
it might be an open source that is

241
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
it is a universal squirrel blind.

242
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,120
I think it's something similar
to my skill workbench.

243
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:32,880
If I am not wrong.

244
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:42,320
A software to interact
with your back to this.

245
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,200
Okay.

246
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,280
Your voice is making me sleepy today
or it always happens with me

247
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,280
whenever my machine learning
professor here

248
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,680
starts to teach half of the class.

249
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,240
Go to sleep.

250
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,440
Yes, it happens.

251
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,720
Me What should I do?

252
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,800
Let me start again.

253
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,560
Hey guys, let's do the database today.

254
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,000
What is it?

255
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,960
Better.

256
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,880
Okay, so

257
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,160
can you guys tell me the.

258
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,040
Well, what is the relational database?

259
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,400
That is why we love you.

260
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,120
Thank you, guys.

261
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,600
Well,
what type of databases do you guys know?

262
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,360
Two types of databases.

263
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,760
Two main types of databases, right?

264
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,720
One are

265
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,080
your voice
is like from a meditation video.

266
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,480
I don't know, Maybe I just woke up.

267
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,640
That's like my voice is
something like this.

268
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,120
I was dreaming of all of my

269
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,080
next thunderclap, all of that.

270
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,200
And then I And then my alarm

271
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,160
woke me up

272
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,360
just about waiting

273
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,920
most of our.

274
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,720
How do you know?

275
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,760
Are you also single or planned long time?

276
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,120
No, I am not.

277
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,720
Okay, guys,
let's see what happens with me.

278
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,000
So can you guys tell me
the types of databases I have?

279
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,840
Toolkits, all my bunch.

280
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,600
You were dreaming.

281
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,280
I was dreaming about my credit card
being used to its full limit.

282
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
And then I woke up relational
and not relational databases.

283
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,760
Right.

284
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,160
And what are these relational databases?

285
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,040
Is this the database?

286
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,240
My skill that we are learning right now?

287
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,720
Is it a relational database

288
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,400
comes through sometimes, Yes.

289
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,480
She just told me
she is looking for solutions

290
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,520
and so we are planning a family dinner.

291
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,360
Then.

292
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,040
She has already searched
all the restaurants

293
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,160
and salons and everything

294
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,640
that is available
in the heart waste of money.

295
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,480
I don't know.

296
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,920
So also I ask her, Well,
what do you want to have?

297
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,800
Do you want to do this alone?

298
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:30,600
So she gave me a very long list and
I thought maybe she is all of the magic.

299
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,640
Your particular I don't know,
what are these things?

300
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,480
And then this.

301
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,520
And then I ask her,
So is there anything for me?

302
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,200
She told me there is something
for me as well.

303
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,240
So let's check

304
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,480
what is it?

305
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,000
Easy to this loan for me

306
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,720
as that is room on me.

307
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,880
So can you guys

308
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,920
tell me about the relational databases

309
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:08,640
this is only the beginning.

310
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,160
Relational database.

311
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,000
It is this my skill and Oracle
are the relational databases

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,760
or what are the sequence database?

313
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,440
Okay, see or more.

314
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,560
Can you please elaborate a little bit?

315
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:32,680
What do you mean by sequence of database?

316
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:38,680
So I am asking
if my school is a relational database

317
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,840
or it is a non relational database.

318
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,000
Relational databases are called sequence
that ABC stole.

319
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,360
I think it is that are stored
based on tables.

320
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,880
So most of the industry is still using

321
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,520
a relational databases and why
they are called relational databases

322
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,960
because the data is stored
in the form of tables.

323
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,960
And these tables
they have some kind of relationships.

324
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,200
We will learn how to tables
can have a relationship and how

325
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,240
we can

326
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,280
create a new relationships
and how we can analyze

327
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,440
the existing relationships and why
we even need to create multiple tables.

328
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,520
Why not store
all the data inside a single table?

329
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,680
So we will learn that in the next class.

330
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,640
Then we will be looking at joints
and the other types of databases.

331
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,320
They are called non relational databases

332
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,960
and they there are quite a few of them.

333
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,640
And MongoDB is also very famous,
non relational database

334
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,080
supplier base is also a database
that is non relational.

335
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,480
It is from Google.

336
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,560
So most notably
you guys will be interacting with Firebase

337
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,800
or MongoDB if you will be working with non

338
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,200
relational databases.

339
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,920
And the good news is
that even though these databases

340
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,720
they are not relational
database is still you guys can use

341
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,720
50% or 60% of the skill knowledge

342
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,640
to query
the data from those databases as well.

343
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,280
So this skill will also be helpful

344
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:38,920
for building good data
and non relational databases.

345
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,400
And as data is stored
in the form of tables,

346
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:50,520
tables have rows and columns,
same as Excel files.

347
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,960
And this is a very important interview
question as well, guys.

348
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,160
What is a primary key?

349
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,680
Why? Why? You would need a primary key.

350
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,000
Can we have a crash session on Firebase?

351
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,640
Sometimes?

352
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,280
Damir It depends if you guys are

353
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,720
if yeah, if the Firebase database

354
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,640
is being used in the testing environment
or not.

355
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,600
Otherwise from my side.

356
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,480
Yes, I can deliver a very good session
because you have been

357
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,320
working with Firebase
for quite some time in the past.

358
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,880
I think you I still will be having some

359
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,760
instances that I created in the past

360
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,320
for my projects
for Android applications in here.

361
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,680
So this is how the Firebase database
looks like.

362
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:58,120
Guys.

363
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,080
It has this real time database.

364
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,760
And then there is
this flier store database.

365
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,600
This is the document based database

366
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:22,680
that I was talking about yesterday.

367
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:39,520
Let me just give you a look.

368
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,280
So this is a database

369
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,160
that does not have tables
and it does not have

370
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,680
columns and rolls.

371
00:25:53,680 --> 00:26:22,000
So instead it has documents.

372
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,480
So in here.

373
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,560
So this

374
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,640
this is the database that I have created.

375
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,480
This is the folder inside of this database
in here.

376
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,000
I can add a document and inside of
that document I can start adding the data.

377
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,240
So for example, I have added firstname
and I have spotted a value inside of that.

378
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,520
So instead of having those rows
and columns,

379
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,040
this is how you guys can store
the data inside it.

380
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,200
Then we have a bar also,

381
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,600
which is called Real time databases,
most of which get applications.

382
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,080
They are built
using this real time database.

383
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,080
So it will be stored in the data
in the form of developers.

384
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,800
So this is the database name.

385
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,160
It has this user and inside the cluster,

386
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,720
let's

387
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,960
say I can create a developer like email

388
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,720
the password and the role
and things like that.

389
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,640
And then if you want to store
images, videos or other files,

390
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,200
you have this storage option in here

391
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,680
so I can upload the files in here.

392
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,760
Let's say, for example,

393
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,520
in the same text banner

394
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,680
and you guys can connect this to your

395
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,320
applications.

396
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,800
Like, for example,
I can share the link with you

397
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,840
and you guys can see this image
from anywhere.

398
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,400
If you have the proper credentials.

399
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:10,400
Oops,

400
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,800
check.

401
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,120
I think this is building
for this website. Yes.

402
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,000
So most of the

403
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,520
android applications
on the iOS application, they

404
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,120
they are using these kind of databases and

405
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,000
these kind of storage systems
now because they are highly scalable.

406
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,760
They can support billions of users.

407
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,360
So Android applications, they have already
started hitting billions of users.

408
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,920
New build.

409
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,960
I think last month
it appeared the 10 billion downloads

410
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,120
and these are some functions
that you can write on over the databases.

411
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,560
And if you want
to have some machine learning

412
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,280
and here you will find and by the way,
these are free.

413
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:11,040
And some of you,
if you want to have a look at your end,

414
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,400
you guys can also do this.

415
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,240
Just go to Firebase and you can start
using the Firebase Direct base.

416
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,360
So this is how a non relational database

417
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:27,000
looks like.

418
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,520
So primary keys must contain unique values
and can't contain null values.

419
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,960
Yes, that is correct.

420
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,920
Primary key, unique key
that differentiates

421
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,000
between those same records

422
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,600
in say column.

423
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,160
Okay, primary key is to have a unique part

424
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:50,280
to information stored in a adroll.

425
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,400
Well, why we need a primary key, guys.

426
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,880
Why we need a primary.

427
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,320
We can't really store or retrieve big data

428
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,600
without the primary key

429
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,400
to uniquely distinguish our data.

430
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,280
So let's say if we have duplicate data

431
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,640
or if we want to create a relation.

432
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,800
So primary is
and foreign keys will make much more sense

433
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,360
in the next class,
then we will be looking at joints.

434
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,240
So it will be super, super clear
why we need the private keys

435
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:34,200
and the foreign keys.

436
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,800
So as a tester
we mostly use select statement

437
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,160
to extract select specific data
from a database.

438
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,520
So this is what you guys will be doing
most of the time.

439
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,400
All other things are setting up
a database, creating users,

440
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,840
creating tables,
creating functions, storing the data.

441
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,520
Most probably you guys will not be doing
that, right?

442
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
Yes, obviously.

443
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,480
And deleting the data
and getting fired from the company.

444
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,200
You can also do that.

445
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,840
So we discussed about some of reserved
world word, the famous wizard world.

446
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,400
If we have to fight to do that out
from our database now please

447
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,240
can you guys tell me those wizard
What if I have to do that now

448
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,200
with which word my security will start?

449
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,480
It will start from this select E word
and after the select keyword.

450
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,240
What do I specify? Guys,

451
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:38,960
After the select keyword
worldwide, specify,

452
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,720
we can specify the columns
from which we want to fetch the data.

453
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
Right.

454
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,240
And after
mentioning the names of the columns,

455
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,960
what is the next keyword
that we need to specify?

456
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,040
We need to specify the from keyword
and after.

457
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,480
From keyword we specify the name of the

458
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,400
table
from which we want to fetch that data.

459
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,120
And so if I want to filter out
the columns,

460
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,640
I can use the select statement, right?

461
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,280
Let's say after this statement,
if I am specifying only

462
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,640
two columns, I will be getting good data
from only two columns.

463
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,680
So if I am specifying

464
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,640
three columns, all three columns,
so I'm kind of filtering the columns

465
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,640
from a table using the select statement

466
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,800
right.

467
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,160
And if I want to filter out the rows,
if I want to filter out the rows,

468
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,320
which keyword I can use.

469
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,480
So to filter out the columns,

470
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,880
I specify

471
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,480
those columns after they select
the filter are the rows I use.

472
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,880
The where clause right inside
where clause.

473
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,000
I can specify
different different conditions.

474
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,280
So in the last class all you guys learned

475
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,760
about these conditions,
like let's say for example,

476
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,280
you want to only bring those rules for
which the value of age is greater than 25.

477
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,560
And it is less than 20, right?

478
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,320
So this condition,
it will basically filter out the rows

479
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,280
from that table.

480
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,960
All right.

481
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,920
And again, I again,

482
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,240
again, you can we said that the data
that we stored inside the database,

483
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,840
it will always be having
some kind of order or or is it random?

484
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,160
Can we say that
the data in which you and the

485
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,560
the order
in which we are inserting the data,

486
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:53,280
we will be getting the data
in the same order?

487
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,960
No, right.

488
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,080
It totally depends upon the database
software,

489
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,680
how that database software
is storing that data.

490
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,520
But what if I

491
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,280
have to bring the data in a certain order

492
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,280
which keyword which clause

493
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,440
I can use for that?

494
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,760
The order by clause. Right.

495
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,920
And what do I specify after the order

496
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:27,480
by clause, the name of the column

497
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,120
based on which I want to perform
this sorting.

498
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,200
And by default, if I don't specify
ascending or descending,

499
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,920
yes, the default is ascending right?

500
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,080
So if the column contains
an automatic data,

501
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,800
it will be in the increasing
order of numbers.

502
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,600
If it contains the string data,

503
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,160
then it will be looking at the

504
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,360
ASCII values of that data

505
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,160
and it will be performing disheartening
in alphabetical order.

506
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,080
Right.

507
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,760
So order by class or clause is

508
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,040
we we write this order by clause,

509
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,080
then we write the name of the table.

510
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,920
So let's say if we only exit,
I hope the font is readable.

511
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:38,920
So if I only execute this query.

512
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,120
Oh yeah. So I'm getting an error.

513
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,120
The NSA has no database selected
what I am doing

514
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:49,960
wrong in here.

515
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,040
You have to run the table, execute
first line to indicate the database.

516
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,960
Right, so as there can be
multiple databases inside the same server.

517
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,080
So first we need to tell

518
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,400
which database we want to query,

519
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,920
we on which database
we want to execute these duties.

520
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,920
So if I execute this, a statement
that is yours

521
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,480
and after the use, we have specified
the name of the database.

522
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:43,120
Now if I execute the queries, okay,
so now I see my data.

523
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,360
So right now if you guys observe

524
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,960
the data does not have

525
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,840
any special order.

526
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,880
So ID 23 is first,
then we have gone be done 30.

527
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,640
But if I want to solve that database
based on maybe name or age,

528
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,040
what I can do, I can write this order

529
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,680
by clause and after that I can specify
the name of the column

530
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,400
based on which I want to sort this data.

531
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,240
So right now we see John and Mary

532
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,480
and I leave, but after I execute
complete period that has order by clause

533
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,920
and the first name you guys will notice
that the data will be sorted

534
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,400
according to the first names.

535
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,560
And again, I also thought my database
on multiple columns,

536
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,160
maybe more than one column.

537
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,360
Yes, right.

538
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,840
In that case, the first priority is given
to the first name

539
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,280
column and if there is something

540
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,920
that is duplicate.

541
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,560
So according to the first column,

542
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,120
these three names may look
same. Right? So.

543
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,080
So the sorting will look
same for these three columns.

544
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,520
In that case, the skill will try to look

545
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,920
for the values

546
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,240
that are inside the second column

547
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,280
that we have specified in here

548
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,520
to perform this article.

549
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,880
And then if we want to do it
in descending order,

550
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,640
we can specify this descending in here

551
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:39,840
right.

552
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,280
All right.

553
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,120
So how the nulls are treated in school
are the null values?

554
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,800
Are they
are the equivalent of empty values?

555
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,120
Are they are empty values are null,
values are the same.

556
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,000
They are different. Right?

557
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,440
So if I want to filter out

558
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,960
the role roles to based on

559
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,760
null values, can I use the equal to sign
or the not equal to sign

560
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,080
that we learned in the last class,
or I should treat them

561
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,960
specially.

562
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,080
So if we are working with the null values,
we cannot use the equal to sign.

563
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,760
Right.

564
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,160
But I am sure after sometimes,
maybe after three weeks,

565
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,600
if you guys will be writing some queries,
you guys will be using

566
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,160
those equal to sign
and you will be getting incorrect results.

567
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,560
So instead of that equal to sign,

568
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,440
you guys should use the is null
and is not an operator.

569
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,200
Right.

570
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,080
And if we are interacting

571
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,080
with character based data

572
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,200
and if we don't use the course,

573
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,400
we can also get unexpected results.

574
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,360
So we also have to make sure that

575
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,320
if the data type

576
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,240
of the column

577
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,680
is nomadic, we are not using the course.

578
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,360
And if the data type
is based on the metric based,

579
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:27,240
then we are using detect our types.

580
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,240
And this is same
as what you guys have been doing in Java,

581
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,120
specifying the conditions based on and
and between.

582
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,520
Is there any difference
between using this between operator

583
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,840
and using this greater
than or less than sign?

584
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,600
No on the same right.

585
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,080
But some of the databases
they might not support

586
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,320
this between operator

587
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:58,800
Okay.

588
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,160
Here is a question for you guys.

589
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,320
Let me write a query in here

590
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,320
and you guys have to tell
if I can write this query in a better way.

591
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,160
So I select all from I'm
not using the uppercase.

592
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:14,960
Yeah.

593
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,080
So that we can type
with cluster to select all from

594
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,920
person.

595
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,800
We have

596
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,520
first name is equal to

597
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,440
maybe John

598
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,680
or last

599
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,200
name is equal to

600
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,440
maybe John

601
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,920
or ID is equal to 23.

602
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,120
So my question is,
can I replace this acuity

603
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,560
with the operator?

604
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:11,520
Can I use the in operator in here?

605
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,800
And at first you said we can use in
and now you are saying

606
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:22,120
no, yes or no.

607
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,000
What do you guys say?

608
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,920
Can I use the operator here?

609
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,120
Not sure with the words.

610
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,640
If we can.

611
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,480
They are not from the same column.
Oh my God.

612
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:41,240
From the last time I remembered you were
struggling with the Java and now your.

613
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,520
Your answers. They are perfect, man.

614
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,680
I'm very happy.

615
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,840
I thought you would write the same column.

616
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,600
Okay, so in is shorthand

617
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,720
for or right after Java,

618
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,440
he became very smart.

619
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,280
Yes, I remember.

620
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,960
So I can not use the interpreter
in here. Why?

621
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,720
Because this is a different column.

622
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,200
This is a different column.

623
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
And this is a different column.

624
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,440
For example, I can not do this.

625
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,840
You guys are almost ready, right?

626
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,560
I cannot do this. We are first name

627
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:33,600
in Dawn.

628
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,440
Because, you
see, I also need to specify the column.

629
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,760
So if I don't specify the column,

630
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,920
because why does it say it's shorthand
for or Indian or.

631
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,840
Yes, it is a shorthand for the or

632
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,000
if you are writing the condition
for the same column.

633
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,920
Maria, while you were in March,

634
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,720
we grew up, so I cannot do this right

635
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,520
or so I hate it like this.

636
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:10,880
Right?

637
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,640
Because this is this belongs to a column.

638
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,320
This belongs to last column.

639
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,160
But if we write this,
you re using the in operator.

640
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,080
All of these values will be treated
as if these are the values

641
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,360
inside the first name column.

642
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,480
So that's why we cannot use the
in operator in here. Here

643
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:41,480
you will be getting incorrect results.

644
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
All right.

645
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,560
All right.

646
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,600
And then we learned
about the like, operator

647
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,720
and you guys tell me

648
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,920
or do this like operator

649
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:08,880
All right.

650
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,200
You literally
you guys named your group as repositories

651
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,360
or you guys are just getting

652
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,080
that,

653
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,360
Oh, my God, I'll let you go.

654
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,480
I mean, by any mistake,

655
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,880
if the instructor has done
something wrong, you guys are not

656
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,280
you guys are not forgetting that,
Inspector.

657
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,840
Right? You will follow him to the end.

658
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,680
We named it
Repository in tribute to drive.

659
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,360
Now I will definitely look while I'm
watching that video.

660
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,960
It's know Tell him.

661
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,240
Actually, I didn't tell him.

662
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,560
I just gave him a hint

663
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,720
when I heard about those drawings

664
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,360
and he started speaking himself
telling me why why

665
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:08,880
he did those drawings
and why it went wrong and all that.

666
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,760
So I got his point.

667
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,400
I will never forget how it happened.

668
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,080
Slide. I will.

669
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,360
I will
look at that with your during the break.

670
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,160
I did not

671
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,160
know.

672
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,480
I cannot have patience.

673
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,400
How do you explain?

674
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:37,760
You guys also have the

675
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,760
I mean, by any mistake,

676
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,800
if you're a senior
he is doing something wrong.

677
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,440
Right.

678
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,920
He will be in specific trouble.

679
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,000
And so

680
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,680
this like operator,
we can use this like operator

681
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,600
to perform

682
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,480
the searching based on wild card
operators.

683
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,240
So this and this person did
it is called the wild card operator.

684
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,000
This underscore
it is also a wild card operator

685
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,800
and how this person based sign works.

686
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,880
So let's say, for example,
if you want to search

687
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,120
the rules
that start from specific letters,

688
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,600
you are not doing something wrong,
but something totally different.

689
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,520
And that night, honestly,
I could not focus at

690
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,280
if so,

691
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,960
if let's say you want to perform
a flexible

692
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,920
search,
you can use this wild card operator

693
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,840
and this person design.

694
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,840
And in here what we are saying,

695
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,960
we are saying that he ask
you will give us all the rules

696
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,360
for which the first name

697
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,480
starts with the letter E,

698
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,400
and after that letter A, we don't care
how many,

699
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,440
how many letters are there,
or what are those letters?

700
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,280
So we don't care about the length
and we don't care about the type.

701
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,760
So it will bring you all the rules
for which the first name starts

702
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:44,640
with the letter.

703
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,520
So you guys will notice all the letters,

704
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:53,520
all the rules that Discovery has brought.

705
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,560
They all start with like that.

706
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,880
Can you guys tell me if I execute the same

707
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,160
and if I have the same data
on an Oracle database,

708
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,320
will I get the same result or will
I be getting slightly different results?

709
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:17,160
So if we execute the same, I think

710
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,640
well, we will

711
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,680
be getting different results on

712
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,240
on on an Oracle database.

713
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,240
I think you guys are too much growing up.

714
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:32,960
Right.

715
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,680
Okay.

716
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,960
For all.

717
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,040
Not really.

718
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:49,240
Not after those grinds as well.

719
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,400
Now I see

720
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,040
while my skill is case insensitive. Yes.

721
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,040
So if we had these same data

722
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,200
on an Oracle database,

723
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,760
for example,
we will not be getting this result. Why?

724
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,520
Because this law

725
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,920
has the name letter,

726
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,600
but it is in the case.

727
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,280
No, I know.

728
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,480
And in here
we have specifying the uppercase A right.

729
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,760
So Oracle database
because it is case sensitive

730
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,760
inside these course

731
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,200
that's why we will be getting different
those

732
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,720
yes for the Oracle database

733
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,040
we need to specify lowercase

734
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,800
and the uppercase in here.

735
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,280
Yes. This is the only difference.

736
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,760
And today we will learn how we can avoid
writing uppercase

737
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,840
and lowercase things because So
then we will learn about the functions

738
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,840
which can actually convert your vector
into lowercase or uppercase.

739
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,960
Same as you guys learned
about the starting met

740
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,080
methods in which you guys had the,

741
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,360
you know, the case
lowercase or uppercase or things like that

742
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,040
for these type of databases,

743
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,680
which are case sensitive.

744
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,920
And if we specify this person to assign

745
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,880
us, that also draws but
in a very complicated way to confuse us.

746
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,400
And Ms.

747
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,240
in instances like that,
if that ever happens.

748
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:41,040
Okay, so if we specify this person
design guys before

749
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,360
and then if we specify the letter

750
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,680
after back, how it will

751
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,480
how the results will differ in this case,

752
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,160
how a school will treat the first names.

753
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:02,840
If we specify the person based sign first,
and then the vector.

754
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,880
So it means there can be.

755
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,200
So all the first names that end

756
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,520
add the letter M, right?

757
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,600
There can be any number of detectors
before and

758
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,800
there can be any characters before.

759
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,920
And but the last letter should be M So

760
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,280
it will give us all the rules

761
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,840
for which should be first name.

762
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,200
Then paint ends at the letter M

763
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,280
So now

764
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,680
so you see first name.

765
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,440
Adam First names, right?

766
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,920
So all both of these
they and add the letter N

767
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,440
And if we want to perform a search,

768
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,840
like for example, something,
something similar to the contains

769
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,240
method that you guys learned
in the string classes, right?

770
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,440
So this time we don't care about

771
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,240
any number of letters
before a certain letter

772
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,080
or there can be any number of letters
after starting letters.

773
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,600
Right?

774
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:18,240
So it is, it is similar
to the contains in that type.

775
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,360
So now

776
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,040
wherever

777
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,040
you guys have a letter M

778
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,280
inside the first name column,

779
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,320
it will bring all those rows
if we execute this right.

780
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,680
Yes. Person did I, for example.

781
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,120
So in this first rule,

782
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,920
in this first case,
we have the letter M at the very start

783
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,560
in here, also at the very start.

784
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,640
And here start in here at the end.

785
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:58,400
And in here at the end as well.

786
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,360
And what what is the difference, guys,
between this person sign

787
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:11,960
and this underscore sign?

788
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,440
Two letters. The first is m.

789
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,960
And so if I ask you
which one is more restrictive,

790
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,040
A, is the underscore more restrictive

791
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,640
or the person based sign more restrictive?

792
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,960
The second one, right? Why?

793
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,480
It is more restrictive
because it also counts

794
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:37,040
how many letters can be
before that specific letter

795
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,240
or how many letters can be after
that specific letter.

796
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,960
Right. In the person they sign.

797
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,160
We don't care how much

798
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,760
that there can be any number of letters
before or after that.

799
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,480
M But when we use the underscore sign,

800
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,200
it means that there can be

801
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,520
only two letters in the first name column.

802
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,200
The first should be M,
and the second can be anything.

803
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,480
So it will only bring the doors, the rows

804
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,560
first that have only two letters.

805
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,400
And also the first letter should be

806
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,000
and a m in here.

807
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,600
In here
we are saying that as you'll give us

808
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:27,400
the results from the table,
but only give us only those results

809
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,320
for which the first name
column contains at

810
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,400
a contains three letters.

811
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,840
And the first two letters should be G
and you and you.

812
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,400
You can have this flexibility there.

813
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,800
And the third letter
can be anything, right?

814
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:51,080
So will it bring the.

815
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,520
So we see only two letters.

816
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,960
What do you guys think?

817
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,200
Can it also bring the results, let's say,

818
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:03,240
and if we have a first name
that contains two letters

819
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:09,640
or it will only care about
the first names, which have three letters

820
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,720
that are three letters, Right.

821
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,840
Very restrictive.

822
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,320
And most of the time
you guys will be searching

823
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,560
date of third inside the database
using these wild card operators.

824
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,720
But you can also search last name,
the last name.

825
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,400
So these two wild cards

826
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,520
and they will be very, very helpful in

827
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,080
bringing
when whenever you guys will be writing,

828
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:43,440
be curious
to bring some data from your back on base.

829
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,360
So now tell me if some of you have faced

830
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,080
any issues with the homework questions.

831
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,720
They were very simple,
but we can solve some of them for you.

832
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,320
I can solve some of them for you.

833
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,240
If you guys had a hard time

834
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,400
solving those.

835
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,840
How many wild card operations we have?

836
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,400
The famous one are these two?

837
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,280
Hossein I have never seen.

838
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,040
I have never used them.

839
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,480
There might be more,
but I have never seen any developer using

840
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,760
other wild card operators than these two.

841
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,160
I think there is one more famous
that is that forward slash thing, but

842
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,880
it is not supported by all the databases.

843
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:33,560
So this person design and underscores
saying you will be able to use

844
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:37,680
in almost all the databases
last one freelance

845
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,600
and the developer. Yes.

846
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:50,280
I think
Silva also asked about this question.

847
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,320
So there is a table

848
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,600
in which we have specified the titles.

849
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,840
If we find they will follow you

850
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,800
in the whole

851
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:03,520
group.

852
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,400
I think it's all a title

853
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:14,880
or something like that.

854
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,720
Yes. Job tracker.

855
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:29,320
So if you query this, this table,
is this table empty or not?

856
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,920
Yes. I assume unfortunately,
we gave the access to

857
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,960
I think it was by seven or by six,
and they almost destroyed our database.

858
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,880
That's why you guys will not find out by
in some of the tables.

859
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,520
After that we started restricting things

860
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,040
and from that day we have some that are in

861
00:58:52,040 --> 00:59:04,480
some of the tables.

862
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:12,960
So if you look carefully,
you have the titles in here.

863
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,480
Don't you have a backup?

864
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,400
No, we only set up this database

865
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,800
for our testing purposes. Right.

866
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,520
We are not using this website
to do any business.

867
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,000
I mean, obviously it is being used,
but not with that priority.

868
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,640
So we kind of
just set up the start of base for you guys

869
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,080
and then we realize, yes,

870
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,920
we should be having a backup.

871
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,720
Is it plus two or three?

872
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,680
So we actually covered two classes
in the last class.

873
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,760
And so, yes, it is class number three.

874
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,200
They are family members.

875
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,800
How did you write the name for the class
Batch 11, Class three or unit two?

876
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,440
So, for example, you need to click on this
sign to have this new editor.

877
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,160
And once you click on control controls,
then this

878
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:13,680
great software created by

879
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,640
Google, it will allow you to

880
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:22,800
have a name for your editor.

881
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,880
The name of the database is syntax
item underscore skill.

882
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,240
The name of the table is person
y, The name is person while

883
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,520
it should be papers
because everything falls under tables,

884
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,800
please explain.

885
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,000
So I'll do the same

886
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,040
until you are saying that this table name

887
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:55,880
should be tables instead of person.

888
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,720
So why?

889
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,440
Why? Why?

890
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,640
Why do you think so?

891
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,720
Why we call it person?

892
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,400
Why we should call it table

893
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:15,080
person is all the way down.

894
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,680
That person is all the way down.

895
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,360
I don't know what person is
all the way up.

896
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,000
I don't know.

897
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,040
All the tables will have the same name.

898
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,440
So you want to call every table as table
maybe.

899
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,960
Table
one. Table to table three. Table four

900
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,120
person is the name of the table.

901
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,280
And to be at that, it's

902
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,760
I don't worry about this.

903
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,480
You can name your tables.

904
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,520
Anything person is all the way

905
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,920
at the end of the table.

906
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,720
A person is all the way.

907
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,200
What do you mean by person is all the way
at the end of the table

908
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,680
person folder.

909
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:05,240
You mean in here?

910
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:09,480
So that's why
you think it should be called a table

911
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,200
Because it is lying all the way.

912
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,440
It is lying in here
because I created this table

913
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,760
after all of these tables

914
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,160
and I created this table

915
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,160
for you guys
so that I can explain the concept

916
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:36,200
on a very small table that has a few rows
of data so that you guys can

917
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,600
easily understand the concept.

918
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,240
Previously, for previous batches,
we were using these big tables

919
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,920
and students are having a hard time
understanding the concepts.

920
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,400
So that's why I created this short table.

921
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,240
So there is no purpose,
there is no meaning.

922
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,480
The only purpose this table exists is

923
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,600
so that you guys can understand
the concepts easily and I created without

924
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,360
looking at their names
or something like that.

925
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,720
The only reason why it has the name person
because it contains

926
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,600
the personal data of a person.

927
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,640
That's why I give the name person.

928
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,240
But if you want to give it
a different name, yes you guys can do

929
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,560
it is usually decided
by architects and higher management.

930
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,640
What will be the tables?

931
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:24,680
Table names
so you guys don't need to worry about

932
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,840
because you guys
will never create in your tables,

933
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,600
either the libs or the developers

934
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,040
will create table person.

935
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:37,360
Yes, you guys can also table person
because in databases

936
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,120
sometimes there is a confusion
between triggers.

937
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,120
So there are so many things in a database.

938
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:46,560
There are functions,
procedures, views and tables.

939
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:52,040
So yes, I met some of the companies
they follow this convention that they put

940
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:58,000
table before the names of the tables
so that they can easily identified

941
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:05,560
if they are interacting with the table.

942
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:09,960
I hope it is better now.

943
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,840
So what what I

944
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,120
okay, so I was saying that in here

945
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:21,600
you guys have these ideas
and you have the job title.

946
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,160
So let's say, for example,
if you want to find out

947
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:30,280
all the freelancers,

948
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,360
if the bad seven
has not deleted a freelancer,

949
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:41,560
you should have a freelancer in here.

950
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,680
So here we go.

951
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,360
So the idea for the freelancer is

952
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:49,200
29, right?

953
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,880
So what we can see

954
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,160
a freelancer has the idea 29.

955
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,120
Now, if you go to the

956
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,240
at just a job employee payable

957
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,240
and if you go to the

958
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,840
if you focus on the column, you will see
you have mission code,

959
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:43,480
you have employed
gender code, marital status.

960
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,880
And in here you will see

961
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,040
there is

962
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:53,160
this column that says job title code.

963
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,920
And now you guys can

964
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,400
then can you tell me
what does this quantitative means

965
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,960
They are
because actually of the job titles.

966
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,960
So if you guys focus in here

967
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,600
where it is equal to 23,

968
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:20,960
you guys can find out
what does this 23 means.

969
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,120
So 23 means it is
this person is an API tester.

970
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,840
So this table contains
because but not the actual job title.

971
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:36,120
So first you have to find out the actual
job titles from this or item job title.

972
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,480
And then you have to structure your query.

973
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:45,880
So for example,
you have to say here, look,

974
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,680
we're job

975
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,600
title

976
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,600
code is equal

977
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,000
in 2029.

978
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,920
If this for Freelancer,
what was the other requirement?

979
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,640
Freelancer and

980
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,000
when you double click on the table

981
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,960
limited capacity to the code
or the column name developer

982
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,920
and let me just give me one moment.

983
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,440
I will explain what happens
when we do that.

984
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,160
So it is a feature that helps you write

985
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:29,760
queries faster.

986
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:35,120
Come on.

987
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:37,200
So developer have the code of ten.

988
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,040
All right.

989
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,760
So now it will bring all the freelancers

990
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,360
and the developers, if there are any, left

991
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,320
by the great batch

992
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:52,440
six and seven.

993
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,320
Oh yes, there are a lot of them.

994
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:00,040
So all of them,
they are either freelancers or developers.

995
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,920
So this is how you guys
were supposed to do this

996
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:11,280
task.

997
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,480
Does it make sense? Guys

998
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,520
select employ first name, last name

999
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,040
from a just a job or

1000
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,520
not really.

1001
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,880
It is wrong,
but this is a topic of the next class.

1002
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,120
I am glad that
if you guys have written this security

1003
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,600
and if you guys are able to

1004
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,400
figure out how you can

1005
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,800
combine two tables like this,

1006
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,080
it requires a slight modification and

1007
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,000
you will be getting good results.

1008
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,600
But we will discuss
that in the next class.

1009
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:58,280
Can you tell again
how to solve out of code 1040, Mahmut,

1010
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:03,720
I have not memorized
the because of all the errors.

1011
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,480
Can you tell me
when can you can you show the error,

1012
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:11,720
please?

1013
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,720
1046i don't know.

1014
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,320
I don't want to show me the error.

1015
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,960
Please.

1016
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,040
I think if you get this error
when you have not selected it

1017
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,760
that obvious, I am not sure.

1018
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,040
Okay.

1019
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,560
104610461046.

1020
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,400
No database selected.

1021
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:45,400
So if you are getting this error,
you have to execute this query use

1022
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,600
and then the database name
and then you should not react.

1023
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:55,320
This.

1024
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,680
Can you please confirm
if you after executing this use

1025
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,760
and then the database name
if you still get the error.

1026
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,240
All right.

1027
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,840
Those so yes.

1028
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:12,200
Are there other homework questions
that you guys want me to solve?

1029
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:18,040
Why didn't you start
with the user statement as in previous?

1030
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:22,320
So now we have to execute that duty
only once.

1031
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,280
When we started the MySQL workbench.

1032
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,280
After that,
it takes that value by default.

1033
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,440
But if you are writing this script
for a different database

1034
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,320
and this one for a different one,
then you can execute that again.

1035
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,440
Just for the inside info.

1036
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:44,240
I also like the back note in the use.

1037
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,360
Yes, that is not in use as well.

1038
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,160
I'm not sure if you are right.

1039
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:54,960
So as we have in operator,
we also have that not in operator.

1040
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,120
Is there any other homework question
guys that you want me to solve?

1041
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,080
Maybe you guys had a hard time
understanding something, or

1042
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,440
maybe it be that I was not present.

1043
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,480
So simple. Stupid.

1044
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,120
The question that there was no data
against a specific employee ID.

1045
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,960
So yes, this is possible.

1046
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,800
Some of the data
might be deleted. And these

1047
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,120
these

1048
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,120
these questions were designed before that.

1049
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,680
Can you add a select first name?

1050
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,200
Last name.

1051
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:29,200
But your job title on the nine
or ten in yours?

1052
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:33,600
Then you add I said,
What do you mean by ADD.

1053
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,000
You want me to execute this query in here

1054
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:45,080
like this?

1055
01:11:45,080 --> 01:12:14,840
Okay.

1056
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:16,560
I did that.

1057
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:31,760
It is still same.

1058
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:36,880
I think you make sure you are specifying
the correct of the database.

1059
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,520
Let me actually copy this.

1060
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,680
Execute this on your editor.

1061
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,840
Look like mine is showing
just the job title

1062
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:48,840
column.

1063
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,960
Mine is showing just the job title column.

1064
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,720
That is not possible
because you have not specified the job

1065
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,840
back in the select statement.

1066
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,400
Then how can you get the job title column

1067
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:08,240
on your editor?

1068
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,800
Can you guys please confirm?

1069
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,600
Can you guys also execute this
and tell me?

1070
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:38,280
If you guys get the job
title column in the output? Yes.

1071
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,520
Let me try on new page.

1072
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,120
No, I think you don't need to try
on the new page.

1073
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,320
Make sure that you select
this duty like this

1074
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,160
and then you execute it.

1075
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:54,720
It is possible that might be
your cursor was here or here and.

1076
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,480
You just clicked on this button in here?

1077
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,280
Yes, ma'am.

1078
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:05,560
There might be a spelling mistake. Why?

1079
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,080
Get what?

1080
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,320
Oscar has no script.

1081
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,880
So if you guys don't have

1082
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,640
any questions,
let's have a ten minute break.

1083
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,840
And after the break,
we will start the today's

1084
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:25,240
class.

1085
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:31,320
My escuela is same as your school.

1086
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:31,680
So did.

1087
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,120
There was a joke also about this.

1088
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:35,880
My school.

1089
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:36,960
So we were using this.

1090
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,400
My school
and the information that I based from IBM

1091
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,880
and our manager
was a non-technical person.

1092
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:48,120
So we told her
that my school is not working.

1093
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,400
So I told her my,
my school is not working here.

1094
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,320
She said, please, your

1095
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,920
my colleague was channel
and he told me, please use the condoms.

1096
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,560
Ask us to ask you,
but I need this work to be done

1097
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:04,200
by the end of today.

1098
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:08,680
So yes, for the non-technical person
sometimes it might be confusing.

1099
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,800
The manager will just say I don't give you
someone else to that school.

1100
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:20,520
I just need the work done.

1101
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,520
Were manager

1102
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,840
C accidentally gave me a box.

1103
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,680
Actually not accidentally.

1104
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:28,920
She was the same manager.

1105
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,840
I told her that I can do this with.

1106
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,280
I can write a piece of software and
we can solve this problem maybe in a week.

1107
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:38,640
But she told me, No, you have to do it
manually.

1108
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,960
And I told her it will take like
three months to perform this manually.

1109
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,160
She said, It's okay, it's fine.

1110
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,440
And still I wrote that piece of software.

1111
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,640
I corrected all the data using acuity

1112
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,800
and I enjoyed
three months in my last company.

1113
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,520
So they are also blessing
actually these kind of managers.

1114
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,520
They are also blessing.

1115
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,360
So please
don't argue too much with your manager.

1116
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:04,800
If they are saying

1117
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,400
you have to do it manually,
tell them okay, we will do it manually,

1118
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:18,200
but then write a piece of software
to solve something like that.

1119
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,480
Yes, this is a very important device.

1120
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:27,120
Your manager is always right. It's

1121
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:31,600
God, it is an automatic.

1122
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,320
You come back.

1123
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:37,320
The selecting. The whole rule helps.

1124
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,320
I thought this blessing
because that after I will do that.

1125
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,040
Oh I cannot fool my my wife.

1126
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:48,000
That is a very big problem
because she is also a software engineer

1127
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,120
and doing her masters in CSS.

1128
01:16:52,120 --> 01:17:02,920
I will be in a little trouble.

1129
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,080
All right, guys, see you in 15.

1130
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:15,440
Please remind me about that
recording as well. The

1131
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,080
All right.

1132
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:29,000
So today

1133
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,320
we will discuss about the functions

1134
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,480
sometimes people need

1135
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:45,000
a little more motivation.

1136
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,280
So in

1137
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:56,520
in school, we have two types of functions.

1138
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,880
So they are categorized

1139
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,920
and you do

1140
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:07,840
you guys know
if you only know how to make the.

1141
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,960
And she has already told me

1142
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,120
that there
that that is the best that you can do.

1143
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:20,440
So don't expect anything from me.

1144
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,280
Yes, I can cook
because I spend a lot of time

1145
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:28,080
in the hostel when I was in my engineering
so I can almost cook everything

1146
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,520
but she only knows how to make the

1147
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,680
SO two types of main functions.

1148
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:43,080
One of them are called single
row functions

1149
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,520
and the others are called multi row
functions,

1150
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,920
the single row of functions.

1151
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,920
So the single row function,
this is how they work.

1152
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,680
They will take

1153
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,720
a value from a row, from a table

1154
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,560
and they will apply that function
on that value and they produce.

1155
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:11,960
It is also one row as the input,

1156
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:16,360
so one row as input
and one rule as output,

1157
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:20,400
1 to 1 correspondence

1158
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,400
while the multi row functions.

1159
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,320
I still don't know how to cook
and I am having a baby.

1160
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,440
It's fine.

1161
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:34,240
So the multi row functions,
they will take any number of role as input

1162
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:39,200
and they will produce a single value
as the output.

1163
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:40,920
So this is the difference.

1164
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,480
For example, a multi row
function can take all of these values.

1165
01:19:45,960 --> 01:20:13,400
Actually,
let me show you a different example.

1166
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:18,600
I recently bought an electric cooker
and I cook different dishes.

1167
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,400
Maybe I could better than you. And

1168
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,800
so for example,

1169
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,920
why you selected before running short?

1170
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:44,400
I selected after running for one,
you can just click the second button.

1171
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,560
This one? Yes we can. Yep. Yep.

1172
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,120
Yes You are right,
if that is what you mean.

1173
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,240
Yeah.

1174
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:54,920
So for example,
the multi row function guys,

1175
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:58,040
what it can do,
it can take all of these values

1176
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:03,640
and it can, let's say maybe calculate
the average of these values.

1177
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,960
So it will be a multi function
taking all of these

1178
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,320
values, producing a single output.

1179
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,800
Another example may be taking all of these

1180
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,840
values and produce
as some of these values.

1181
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,680
Another example may be it can tell you

1182
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:24,240
the count of these rules, how many count,
how many values are there.

1183
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:29,080
So multiple functions
they will take multiple as input

1184
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,480
and they will produce a single value

1185
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,440
as the output,
while on the other hand, the

1186
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,600
single role functions.

1187
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,200
They will take a single value as an input

1188
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,680
and they will produce a single value
as the output.

1189
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,320
So if I ask you

1190
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:54,840
the let's say I have a function
that converts the values to lowercase

1191
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,560
the text based values, the string values,
can you guys tell me if it will be

1192
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:10,920
a multi row
function or single row function?

1193
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,600
Is this function taking multiple roles
and only producing a single output

1194
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:25,920
or taking multiple inputs
and producing multiple outputs?

1195
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,760
Let me repeat this lower function.

1196
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:32,600
What it can do, it can take
John and I add the output.

1197
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,400
If there are any uppercase letters,
it will convert those to lowercase.

1198
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:37,760
Right?

1199
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:43,840
If let's say I give it this goal,
it will produce me a good with lower GST.

1200
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,280
If I give MJ,
it will produce me a lowercase MJ.

1201
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,960
So is it a multi row function
or a single row

1202
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,640
function?

1203
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,640
It says single role function, right?

1204
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:04,440
Because for each input
it is generating an output.

1205
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:09,600
Why, if I ask you, let's say may be

1206
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,320
to calculate

1207
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:17,400
minimum value out of these values.

1208
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:22,320
Let's say if I write a function min
that gives me the minimum value

1209
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,320
out of all of these values,
will it be a multi row

1210
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:39,960
function or single row?

1211
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,240
Yes, it will be a multi row function.

1212
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:45,760
Right now let me show you common
single row and material function

1213
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,680
that you guys might be using only.

1214
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:53,960
So this is a set of statements
that performs to a separate

1215
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,640
values, parameters, returns
the process value right?

1216
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,040
So single row functions, add on each row

1217
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,600
and return one result part The rule

1218
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:11,400
can be used select and where clauses

1219
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:14,760
and they can have arguments.

1220
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:19,080
And the arguments will be the columns.

1221
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:23,120
Or you can also use expressions.

1222
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,400
So some of the examples
of single functions, they are character

1223
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:31,560
based functions like uppercase,
lowercase, initial capitalization

1224
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:37,120
of functions, or let's
say may be substring or things like that.

1225
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:42,040
All these first two uppercase
lowercase substring,

1226
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:45,960
all those functions that you guys have
learned, almost all of those functions

1227
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:50,280
that you have learned in the string class,
they are available in here.

1228
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,920
Then we have the date function.

1229
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,960
Like, for example,
if you want to calculate

1230
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,120
the number of days between two dates

1231
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:03,400
or let's say, for example,
if you want to find out the month

1232
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,640
or the year from a given date
in the form of a text or something,

1233
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,480
or if you want to convert a date
from one format to another format.

1234
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,080
So you will be using those functions.

1235
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,640
And then we have a number of functions.

1236
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:20,560
I will show you
the examples of these functions.

1237
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,680
So these functions operate on single row
and only return a single output.

1238
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,320
So for example,

1239
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:35,720
let me show you the lower function.

1240
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:38,240
So let's say

1241
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,400
I am selecting the first name

1242
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:52,960
from person right?

1243
01:25:52,960 --> 01:26:05,000
So, so right now I see these names,

1244
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:09,000
but so some of them,
they contain uppercase letters, right?

1245
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,880
If I don't want those uppercase letters,

1246
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,880
I can use a function
so I can write the name of the function,

1247
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,200
and then I can give this

1248
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,200
column name as the argument that function.

1249
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:29,280
And now what this will do,
it will apply this function

1250
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,600
on E to value of this column.

1251
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:37,400
So now you guys will see
that there will be no uppercase

1252
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:42,960
letters in the output
that function that showed us to convert

1253
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:48,000
the data type from character to pneumatic
was also a function.

1254
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:58,680
So if you want to convert it to uppercase,

1255
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,360
we also have this upper function in here.

1256
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:05,960
Now, again, these functions, they depend

1257
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,480
they can be

1258
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,120
different from database to database.

1259
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,560
Some of the functions
might work on my sequel database

1260
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,800
and they might not work
on Oracle database.

1261
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,120
So and

1262
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,200
they might also have

1263
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:27,920
different names on different databases.

1264
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:33,440
So this lower function,
it might be called something slightly

1265
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:37,000
different on an Oracle database
or informative database.

1266
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,400
But so you can always Google things.

1267
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,600
Yes, we can also define our own functions,

1268
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:49,400
but Most of the time developers
do this kind of stuff as the test of the.

1269
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,000
You guys will not be defining
your own functions

1270
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,160
for defining your own function.

1271
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,200
There is a second part of school

1272
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:01,880
that you guys need to learn,

1273
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,480
and so school is divided

1274
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:06,360
into four main parts DML

1275
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,360
and PCRs and things like that

1276
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:13,280
that I will show you,
I think in fourth class of first class.

1277
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:19,160
So you as a tester will
mainly be focus will be focusing on

1278
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,800
DML, part data manipulation, language.

1279
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,840
The other parts of the school.

1280
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,000
We will not be going into those parts.

1281
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,240
Can we look for first name
that starts with uPAR.

1282
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,240
So Dennis now

1283
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:37,280
as I have told earlier,
it depends on the database.

1284
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:42,120
So you can search on the on the Google
for that specific function.

1285
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:45,880
If that function is available
in the my school or not.

1286
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:46,680
So you want less.

1287
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:51,120
So for example for the first name
that starts with uppercase.

1288
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:57,880
So let's try to search.

1289
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:03,120
Okay, so you want to convert a name,

1290
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,320
You want to convert all the names to

1291
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,600
the names
that have first letter as the uppercase

1292
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,840
or you want to perform a search that.

1293
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,800
The query should give you the results

1294
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,080
for only those letters.

1295
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,400
I think for this one
you have to write something,

1296
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:26,520
something complex.

1297
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,600
How to

1298
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,480
search.

1299
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,840
Because on my school,
the gear sensitive thing is you,

1300
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,480
as you have noticed,
upper and lower settings.

1301
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:40,560
They are same on on in school.

1302
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,480
So I think this question
will make much more sense on how to search

1303
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,080
all the names

1304
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,320
that have first letter as

1305
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,240
uppercase. My

1306
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,680
as you will.

1307
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,360
So then there might be things

1308
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,240
capitalized.

1309
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,760
First letter how we can capitalize.

1310
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,720
I'll find the first uppercase letter in

1311
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,760
the string skill.

1312
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,040
So yes, there are solutions,

1313
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:16,520
but they will be complex

1314
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:35,000
or so in here.

1315
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,200
I think they are first converting the

1316
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,800
letters.

1317
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,760
I don't know.

1318
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,920
The solution does not look good.

1319
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,760
Spring Exercise Display
Select words beginning with uppercase.

1320
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,120
So yes, you guys can go to search,

1321
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,120
but it will be very complex.

1322
01:30:56,120 --> 01:31:02,040
We have substring word one one code led
lighting, blah blah blah blah blah.

1323
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,760
Yes, it will be very complex. In my sequel

1324
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,040
to find out this kind of things,

1325
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,800
you have to combine
many different functions

1326
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:15,200
because you have to find out first
if a letter is uppercase

1327
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:26,320
or not.

1328
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:59,400
Maybe we should search for,

1329
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:04,040
oh, but how are you?

1330
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,840
You make sure
that this is only the first letter.

1331
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:12,000
So us you guys, you can use the substring
method to only pick the first letter.

1332
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:18,560
Then you can try to convert it
to uppercase and then you can compare it.

1333
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,680
Okay. I would say give me one moment.

1334
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:21,600
Yes. This.

1335
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:27,720
So there are multiple tricks
that you can use to solve this problem.

1336
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:29,400
Let me first tell you about that.

1337
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,040
Especially functional deep diving.

1338
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:36,120
Yeah, maybe you should try
these kind of things after this class.

1339
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:37,800
It will make much more sense.

1340
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,240
So but for now,

1341
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,320
let me show you some function.

1342
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,600
So uppercase lowercase,
this init cap again, I think it does not

1343
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:53,520
work on on my school, but it works on on

1344
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,040
oracle one this init function

1345
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:05,080
it converts the first letter to uppercase.

1346
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:07,080
So I think it does not work on my super

1347
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:15,960
yes function syntax,
blah blah does not exist.

1348
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:20,440
But if we try this same function on

1349
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:25,400
oracle live.

1350
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,160
Thanks Maryam.

1351
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:31,320
Now we are all set.

1352
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:35,280
So yes.

1353
01:33:35,280 --> 01:34:08,960
Farhad, if you can use something
like this, default the name of the table.

1354
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:09,560
Right.

1355
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:30,440
Uh, Char employs if I am not wrong,

1356
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:33,000
I think it is also not available here.

1357
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:36,880
Yep. No

1358
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,840
first name.

1359
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:45,080
Oh yes, it is available.

1360
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:48,920
So on Oracle

1361
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,240
now you guys will not be noticed that

1362
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:56,000
all the first letters, they are uppercase
and the remaining one they are not.

1363
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:00,760
Yes, but the binary
one shows only my skill

1364
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,480
I miss not the first letter.

1365
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:09,240
Aisha, What do you mean by Ms..

1366
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:13,080
So you guys have to find out
these functions

1367
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:17,000
which are available on certain databases

1368
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,080
and which are not available
on those specified basis.

1369
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:23,800
There are high chances that the functions

1370
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:26,000
will be available available,
but they might

1371
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,400
have different, slightly different names

1372
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,240
or they might work a little differently.

1373
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,720
But Mike, for example, is not being faced
name.

1374
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,600
Okay, we will have a look at that.

1375
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:38,920
Aisha not ready.

1376
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:41,880
Let's first learn about the basics
and then we will have a look

1377
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,200
how to do that.

1378
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:48,240
Searching.

1379
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:51,480
So so this law function,

1380
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:54,440
it does not make much more sense
in my sequel, but

1381
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:00,400
let's say
if are searching for the lowercase,

1382
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,840
if you are searching something
on the Oracle database,

1383
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,280
you might want to convert your

1384
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,800
all of your names to lowercase,
and then you might

1385
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,480
want to perform this arch
so that if someone has to do

1386
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:18,040
some of the letters s uppercase,
you don't miss those things

1387
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:21,800
on Oracle database
or other databases that support

1388
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,960
these uppercase and these

1389
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:29,520
to a sense us in the inside the codes.

1390
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,640
So this is just an example
that will work on Oracle,

1391
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:37,240
but not all of my secret.

1392
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,720
But let me also show you a demo.

1393
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:42,840
So for example, if

1394
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:57,840
so, let's say

1395
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,680
if we are searching for speech, one

1396
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,480
and let's say

1397
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:14,400
I am not sure if this daemon has uppercase
s or lowercase, if I perform,

1398
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:18,760
if I, if I execute this duty,
will I get something

1399
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:34,240
as a result of this?

1400
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:35,880
The note that I found. Right.

1401
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:38,080
So in those databases which

1402
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,200
check
if we have this law function in here.

1403
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:47,280
So in these kind of databases,
you might want to convert your

1404
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,440
data to lowercase

1405
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:57,880
or uppercase,

1406
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:02,600
and then you might want to perform
that search.

1407
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:05,920
So then you will
you guys will see your results.

1408
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,360
So these functions, the

1409
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:12,600
this is how we use these functions
in the workplace,

1410
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:15,720
but we can also use these functions
in this select class.

1411
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:23,560
If you are looking
for a specific type of data.

1412
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:27,680
So this is, this is the same example.

1413
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:33,480
Now to find out the about the
what is the Fatima group.

1414
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:38,200
It was a company in which I used to work
when I graduated,

1415
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:41,680
actually my first corporate company
in which I worked

1416
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:46,080
and that username
password is from my senior.

1417
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:49,680
So I am still using that username password

1418
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:54,560
because I am super, super lazy
and I didn't create my own

1419
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,960
username and password.

1420
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,120
Oh, okay.

1421
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:04,240
So you guys can search on the internet
about single role

1422
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:13,680
functions in my spirit.

1423
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:17,160
So here you will be able to find out about

1424
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:21,360
all the single node functions in here for.

1425
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,920
Example the the length function

1426
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:29,400
you guys can.

1427
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,120
You guys will be needing this function
a lot.

1428
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:38,040
So for example,
let's say select all from person.

1429
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,200
So I am writing a duty

1430
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,880
in which I only want the employees

1431
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,040
who have, let's say me be

1432
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:51,360
whose name has more than three characters.

1433
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,600
So what I can do, I can here again
use the single role

1434
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,840
function.

1435
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,800
I can say Lent and inside as the argument.

1436
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,680
I can boss the first name
and I can say we are.

1437
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:14,600
The land is greater than maybe three
like this.

1438
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:17,720
So now I will only see those employees

1439
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,240
whose name has more than three likeness.

1440
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:21,840
Right.

1441
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,880
So this is the example of land function,

1442
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:27,600
this concurred function.

1443
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,280
Let's say

1444
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:34,360
you want to get the
first name and the last name.

1445
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,400
So let's say first name,

1446
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:41,520
comma, last name

1447
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:45,600
from person.

1448
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:49,960
So instead of getting separate values
for the first name and the last name,

1449
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:53,640
you guys might want to get
a single value in here.

1450
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,200
So what you can do

1451
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:00,360
and oh, we also have intelligence finally.

1452
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:06,000
So you guys can also see what are
the functions that are available in here.

1453
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,000
So for example, this contract function,
it will take two arguments

1454
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,080
plus name

1455
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:18,200
and the last name.

1456
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:22,560
And instead of returning you to values,

1457
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,600
it will now return you
a single column as the output

1458
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:31,560
in which first name and the last name
will be combined together.

1459
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:36,320
What is the difference between line
ten and 11?

1460
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,880
Line ten and 11?

1461
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:41,400
There is no difference
because there is no function in scale

1462
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:48,000
that can do this.

1463
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,120
Okay, so I see first name and last name
combined together.

1464
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:55,080
I saw you got excited about those out of.

1465
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,800
So guys, there is no space in between
the first name and the last name.

1466
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,560
Can you guys
tell me if I want to have some space?

1467
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:21,360
How can I do that?

1468
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,720
The one trait that you guys can use

1469
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,760
will be last name.

1470
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,480
So using and calling this function
place right in.

1471
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:38,520
So first it will continue to be first name

1472
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,960
with this space and then it will again

1473
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:46,200
continue to be desert of
this function will be under column.

1474
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:51,200
So you guys can also have this nesting
of functions inside the school.

1475
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:54,200
So if you can call a function inside,
another function

1476
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:57,360
that will use the output of one function
inside

1477
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,040
another function

1478
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,160
is it here guys?

1479
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:07,800
What I am doing in here.

1480
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:13,560
Okay,
let me show you more single row functions.

1481
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:18,880
The sub SDR function.

1482
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:24,240
So let's say you only want to have
first three letters, or

1483
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:27,560
maybe middle
letters are the last letters from

1484
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:31,880
first names right?

1485
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:40,880
So you can use this sub string method.

1486
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:44,800
And in here what you need to specify

1487
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,160
is the name of the column

1488
01:43:49,320 --> 01:44:01,320
and then maybe the starting index
and the ending index.

1489
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:05,320
So I only see now
first of two letters from the first name.

1490
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,280
I think you guys will be able to

1491
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,720
to understand these functions easily.

1492
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:16,120
XYZ If I give you this page, maybe
and you guys

1493
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:19,280
just go through these functions

1494
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:23,760
once, by the way,
they have also given the examples

1495
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,520
of these functions in here,
if you guys don't understand.

1496
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,400
So this is a date function.

1497
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:33,840
By the way, I, I saw in date function

1498
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:38,400
that was used in some of the interviews.

1499
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,640
Let me check
if I can tell you about that function.

1500
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:45,920
So the question was

1501
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,160
there was a date of joining in air

1502
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,240
in an hotel and the leaving date.

1503
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:57,960
And we have we had to select
only those roles, although those persons

1504
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:02,320
which stayed in the hotel
for more than two days. So

1505
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,720
I saw this question in

1506
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:10,560
an interview yesterday or some time
there as some days before that.

1507
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:28,960
So I don't know if we have a table
that contains two dates or not, but

1508
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,800
you guys can go through these functions.

1509
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:35,160
I mean, you don't even need to go through
all of the functions.

1510
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,680
Just have that in your mind that

1511
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:44,760
if you want to do something in school,

1512
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:47,400
there are functions that you guys can use

1513
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,360
and you can simply Google it.

1514
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:53,440
How to do certain thing

1515
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,440
in school using that function land days
greater than two.

1516
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:03,520
Yes, now, but you have to calculate the
the number of days from the dates.

1517
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:06,160
Select uppercase or substring.

1518
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:08,360
First name and two from person.

1519
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:13,120
So it will select the first two letters
and then it will convert them

1520
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,080
to the uppercase. LIMA.

1521
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:17,280
So Google is your best friend again?

1522
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,480
Yes, always.

1523
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:22,160
If you are in the tech industry,
Google is your best friend.

1524
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:27,600
So in here for the date of world, we have

1525
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:31,080
a column.

1526
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:34,320
So let me check if

1527
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:39,520
it's me or B and

1528
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,280
I want to add one month

1529
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,880
to each of the date of working here.

1530
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:54,400
Something like this?

1531
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:55,160
Yeah.

1532
01:46:55,240 --> 01:46:59,720
Adam Months not available.

1533
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:00,720
Our date or time.

1534
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:16,080
So this function is not available in here.

1535
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,280
So there are so many functions.

1536
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:22,320
So instead of
going through all of these functions,

1537
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:26,880
if you are looking for something special,
you guys can just Google it

1538
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:31,920
and then you can use it.

1539
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:39,040
No, these are not available in here.

1540
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:44,040
This is the function that will read
from the position of a letter.

1541
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:46,640
This will add a spaces

1542
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:51,960
before and are on towards the left
and right side of the screen.

1543
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,880
It will bring to him same as or

1544
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:59,320
your java function replace also same four

1545
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:02,520
months between add months.

1546
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,840
We have to search again

1547
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:11,360
how to add two months in there.

1548
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:15,760
My ask you it is

1549
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,600
add function we can use

1550
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,360
is the synonym of added date.

1551
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:30,200
My skill date time value with the date

1552
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:34,280
it can

1553
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:37,840
and my recipients are doing this week
with our blah blah

1554
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:40,560
air date.

1555
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:43,240
We specify the day and then the interval.

1556
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:47,160
So for example interval and B is

1557
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,400
the last

1558
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:57,840
like this.

1559
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,040
So this is how you guys can just

1560
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:06,400
search and perform things and

1561
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:15,040
our date

1562
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:24,360
and instead of adding it
to a hardcoded value,

1563
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:30,400
maybe you can add it to all the values.

1564
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:35,440
So if you guys observe now
the results this, these are the results

1565
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:38,600
when we once we have added
ten days to the date of birth.

1566
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:43,000
So plus to 26
and now the updated date is 308.

1567
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,640
So this is how you guys can search
on the Internet.

1568
01:49:46,640 --> 01:49:51,360
And instead of just
memorizing the functions and remembering

1569
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:54,840
how they work,
just remember that there are functions.

1570
01:49:55,200 --> 01:50:00,440
And if you need something specifying, just
search on the internet and use it there.

1571
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,320
Are you guys good?

1572
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:07,400
Well Victorians
warned against handling of that website.

1573
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:10,360
The it is the same website

1574
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,800
so these were all of

1575
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,880
these were single row functions.

1576
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,280
Now let me show you some famous multi

1577
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:22,800
functions

1578
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:38,320
and again remember,
those are some of the functions

1579
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:42,880
they might work on and on a database and
they might not work on another database.

1580
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,120
Some of them.

1581
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:48,440
They might have a different name
on one database and a different name

1582
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:53,520
on another database.

1583
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,560
So for example, these are some famous

1584
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,560
material functions

1585
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:04,640
that's

1586
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:07,080
lists

1587
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,400
that might be helpful.

1588
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:15,000
So let's say if you want to

1589
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,960
calculate, how many drawers

1590
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,040
this query has returned,

1591
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:24,840
you guys can use the count function.

1592
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:27,440
So what can will do?

1593
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:32,160
It will take all the values
and all the rows as the input

1594
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:36,000
and it will count and the number of rows
and it will return to the number of roles.

1595
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:39,880
So there are 22

1596
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:43,040
rows that are being returned
by the security, Right?

1597
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:48,080
So let's say if you want to use
these results in your school later on,

1598
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:51,280
I will teach you how to combine your skill
and Java together

1599
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,000
to perform the testing there.

1600
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,400
You guys will be needing them.

1601
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,400
And another famous function at all

1602
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,560
function is

1603
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,040
can we actually do this?

1604
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:10,880
Let me actually combine
all of them in here so

1605
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,720
I can use this sum function.

1606
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:17,200
It will sum all of the values.

1607
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:19,720
I can use the count function.

1608
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:23,800
It will count all of the values
from the age column.

1609
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,240
I can use the mean function.

1610
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:30,000
It will count the minimum age
from the column

1611
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,520
I can call to the maximum value

1612
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:35,760
from the column.

1613
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,680
I can calculate the average

1614
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,840
from here.

1615
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:43,200
So again, you guys don't need to memorize
all of these.

1616
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:46,360
If you need something, just Google it

1617
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:51,200
and you will be able to find out
a function for there.

1618
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,440
Most probably.

1619
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:56,600
But even if you don't have a function,
you guys can write your own functions,

1620
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:59,920
but most probably you will never do that.

1621
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,080
So right now we see that.

1622
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:06,200
We see the sum of all the edges,
we see the count,

1623
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:10,320
we see the minimum, we see the maximum,
we see the average.

1624
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:15,680
Then we see declaration of these functions
like we did in Java.

1625
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,040
I have to check.

1626
01:53:19,560 --> 01:53:21,880
I have to check if it is allow us to,

1627
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:29,120
to do that.

1628
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:33,320
I think for the paid databases,
you guys will not be able to do that,

1629
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:38,240
but you might be able to do that
for the open source backup basis

1630
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:39,880
because companies, they

1631
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:50,200
don't want to share their implementations,
but it might be possible.

1632
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:51,680
Then you can even Google it.

1633
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:55,400
How to check the internals of a function

1634
01:53:55,400 --> 01:54:00,440
In my sequel workbench.

1635
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:04,640
So these are some of the examples
of multiple functions.

1636
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:07,960
There are other functions
that you guys can search on the internet,

1637
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:11,400
but we will not be going
over all of those questions.

1638
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:14,800
Now the second thing, and

1639
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:20,960
it is very important in the interview,
I have seen a lot of questions

1640
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:24,720
in the interview regarding this concept
that I will be telling you

1641
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,880
now is the

1642
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:32,280
having clause and the group by clause.

1643
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:42,120
So a lot of questions from this group
by clause.

1644
01:54:42,120 --> 01:54:44,760
What this group by

1645
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,520
can do for us.

1646
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:58,680
Let's see,

1647
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:01,280
can we answer in an interview
that we are going to find?

1648
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,840
We answered on Google. Yep, yep.

1649
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:08,120
Even companies there are allow you to

1650
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:10,200
use the Google.

1651
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:13,560
They explicitly say
that you can use Google.

1652
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:17,600
Why do you keep retype Bing select
all from person?

1653
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,920
Oh, I don't know.

1654
01:55:20,920 --> 01:55:23,320
Maybe just to show you guys

1655
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:27,360
that I can type

1656
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:31,480
so I can take the

1657
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:35,680
visit. You

1658
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:41,400
Okay, so let's say guys,

1659
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:45,360
we have results from this query, right?

1660
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:49,280
And I can I want to find out

1661
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:54,640
how many mails and females are there in
this are sex.

1662
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,960
And can you guys tell me,
how can I do that in a single query?

1663
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:02,000
I want to find out
how many male and females are be

1664
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,600
counted gender if gender is equal to and

1665
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:21,960
I have I had I like to talk to you

1666
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:24,640
about these conditions.

1667
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,080
Some gender is equal to and

1668
01:56:34,360 --> 01:56:36,080
then you guys try writing a query

1669
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:41,760
for that. Yes.

1670
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:44,480
Let's say I want to find out

1671
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:47,600
the count or maybe the average age of men

1672
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:56,120
and average age of woman,
if you put gender

1673
01:56:56,120 --> 01:56:58,160
is equal to I'm in the rare condition,

1674
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:02,760
you will not be getting the results
for the females.

1675
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:05,520
I will be back in a minute.
Today's Try to write a query

1676
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,760
to calculate maybe

1677
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:12,600
the number of men and number of women
in this resource.

1678
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:14,400
I will be like that

1679
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:42,720
Wife is calling.

1680
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:43,840
No, Sebastian.

1681
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:47,000
She is sleeping while I am waiting. You

1682
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:50,800
select count

1683
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:55,000
Gender is equal to M.

1684
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:02,560
Are you good executing these queries
as well to verify the results?

1685
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:06,080
And Silva, you are sure that the query
that you have written

1686
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:11,360
gives you a correct result?

1687
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:24,720
I don't know. So

1688
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:29,000
it gives the wrong with FS

1689
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
if it gets is

1690
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:37,360
so remember, guy is school 90% of the time

1691
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:41,800
it will not give you an error,
but it will give you wrong results.

1692
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,360
So you have to cross-check things.

1693
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:48,320
So the one of the ways to achieve

1694
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:51,000
this is by using the group by class.

1695
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,200
So let's see.

1696
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,640
You want to count

1697
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:01,560
that?

1698
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:07,240
How many males and females
are there inside

1699
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:12,240
this gender column?

1700
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:12,520
Right.

1701
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:16,040
So what you guys can do,

1702
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:20,320
you can tell the gender
and then you can put

1703
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:23,640
the count of that gender from the person

1704
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:26,560
and you can see, hey, school

1705
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:31,400
group by the results,

1706
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:51,120
by the gender.

1707
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:53,400
So what happened in here?

1708
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:55,560
So Pascual did

1709
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:58,680
so mine was okay. I don't know.

1710
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:03,360
You guys got ten for male, nine,
nine for female.

1711
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:11,520
And there were three null values.

1712
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,600
Mine was for me.

1713
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,920
So let me explain.

1714
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:25,520
Do you guys understand what,
what happened, how we got these results?

1715
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:46,680
And you guys sure.

1716
02:01:46,680 --> 02:01:48,000
Yes. By grouping.

1717
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,240
So looking in settings,

1718
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:53,480
this is very important.

1719
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,200
Very, very important.

1720
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:57,920
I all in almost all the interviews,

1721
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:04,840
this group by class is used.

1722
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:08,000
So what we are seeing in
the security, we are saying

1723
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:13,680
give us the gender

1724
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:16,320
and then also count

1725
02:02:17,040 --> 02:02:21,600
how many rows fall under that gender

1726
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:26,000
that you are specifying in here.

1727
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:31,320
And we are saying group by the results
with respect to gender.

1728
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:34,000
So what Pascual will do

1729
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,440
is Google will pick this m in here first

1730
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:40,680
and then it will scan

1731
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:45,360
the complete dataset set and it will count
how many ends are there.

1732
02:02:45,360 --> 02:02:49,160
So do we count one,
two, three, blah blah, blah, blah,

1733
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:52,120
and then it will put the count in here.

1734
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:55,920
So then it will put

1735
02:02:55,920 --> 02:03:00,320
and then it will pick
the next to unique value from this

1736
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:02,040
column.

1737
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:05,040
So this gender column has three
unique values.

1738
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:09,000
It has F,
it has M, and it has another values.

1739
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:14,360
So it will group all the data
with respect to these three values.

1740
02:03:14,360 --> 02:03:18,160
So all the M's are in one portion,

1741
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:21,400
all the FS in one portion
and all the nulls in one portion.

1742
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:26,080
Then what it will do,
it will count those rows

1743
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:30,200
that fall under M F and null

1744
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:34,040
and it will display
the count in here. Now,

1745
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:38,400
these multiple functions, they are.

1746
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:41,040
So this group by clause

1747
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,440
is most of the time

1748
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:46,200
it is used with the multi functions.

1749
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:49,640
And if, let's say are not using the group

1750
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:53,760
by clause in here.

1751
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:57,520
So some of the databases they
they will still give you the results

1752
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:01,400
but the results will be wrong.

1753
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:06,640
So in here
it says there are 22 mens in the gender.

1754
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:10,000
This obviously these results
they are not correct.

1755
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:15,480
But school is not giving you an error
and it is still showing your results.

1756
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:18,480
So make sure guys always whenever

1757
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:22,040
you are using the multiple functions

1758
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:26,040
and if you are performing this grouping,
make sure you put group by clause.

1759
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:30,240
Also, I think the Oracle database
gives you an ETA

1760
02:04:31,120 --> 02:04:36,280
if you try to use group by without.

1761
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:36,520
Okay,

1762
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:40,680
so select

1763
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:46,160
may be

1764
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:49,920
the salary

1765
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:53,640
and count

1766
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:57,280
how many employees
have the have that salary

1767
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:02,680
from at your employers.

1768
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:06,560
And if we don't use the group by clause,

1769
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:12,480
I think the Oracle one
gives you an error. Yes.

1770
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:18,120
So it says not a single group group
by a function.

1771
02:05:18,120 --> 02:05:23,240
But if we put this group by

1772
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:26,280
and we tell that, how

1773
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,600
well do you guys know why
we got the error?

1774
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:32,800
Because check this out.

1775
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:38,480
This salary column has
it might have like for example,

1776
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:43,720
ten values, 20 values, 30 values,
but you remember the multiple functions.

1777
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:47,600
They only give you a single value
as the output, right?

1778
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:51,560
So the the result set will be imbalanced.

1779
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:52,280
Right.

1780
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:56,680
For for example, for example,
there is a the salary

1781
02:05:56,680 --> 02:06:00,440
that is 28 and then we are checking
the count in here.

1782
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:04,680
If we don't specify this group by,
there will be an imbalance

1783
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:09,760
because this thing will return one value
while this thing will die

1784
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,480
can return multiple value.

1785
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:16,920
So Escuela or Oracle database,
they don't know how to represent

1786
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:18,440
that result. Check.

1787
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:27,400
So if we put the group by in here. No.

1788
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:30,480
I executed two of them looking exactly

1789
02:06:30,480 --> 02:06:33,800
conjugates.

1790
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:36,760
So now what Oracle is doing

1791
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,920
it is checking how many photos are there

1792
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:42,560
in the salary column?

1793
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:43,680
There are two photos.

1794
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:45,720
How many 70 years out of there?

1795
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:47,560
How many thousands are dead?

1796
02:06:47,560 --> 02:06:49,640
How many? 6000 out of there.

1797
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:51,720
So it is picking each value,

1798
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:55,560
searching the complete column
for the duplication of that value.

1799
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:59,120
If there are duplicate values,
it is counting those values.

1800
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:02,520
And it is it is representing the count
in front of the that.

1801
02:07:03,640 --> 02:07:07,280
So if you want to create some groups
in your results,

1802
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:10,640
let's say for example,
maybe you want to count the

1803
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:14,520
how many employees are there
in each department, right.

1804
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:18,600
So instead of writing the acuity
two separately for each department,

1805
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:22,480
you can use the count function
and you can go to

1806
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:24,720
by your results based on department.

1807
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:28,960
Then you will automatically check
how many departments are there

1808
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:32,520
in the department's column and,
how many employees

1809
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:35,800
have that specific department

1810
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:37,560
as their

1811
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:40,920
department,
and it will count those employees in here.

1812
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:46,600
So same as it is counting how many 40 twos
are there in this healthy column?

1813
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:49,120
How many 70 years are there
in this column?

1814
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:52,000
How many 8000 values
are in this salary column.

1815
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:55,280
So let me show you so that you like

1816
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:58,200
and also

1817
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:01,640
check it.

1818
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:03,200
Really, It will.

1819
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:07,600
It is it is tricky and it will take
some time to understand how it works.

1820
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:11,720
So I, I want you to pay extra attention

1821
02:08:11,720 --> 02:08:13,480
to this group by

1822
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:26,040
so if you guys observe,

1823
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:28,680
we have 1000 in here

1824
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:46,360
then we have to scan all the values,

1825
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:55,840
the one by one.

1826
02:08:55,840 --> 02:09:01,200
How many thousands were there
in the query?

1827
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:04,320
One or three.

1828
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:04,920
Simple.

1829
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:07,560
We can use it for all the common things.

1830
02:09:08,160 --> 02:09:11,120
Okay, There. There are 3000. So let me

1831
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:15,440
execute 20.

1832
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,640
Oh, I am again grouping your device
and exotic member

1833
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:24,040
select salary from these once

1834
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:38,600
a one is here.

1835
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:43,000
Can you guys also verify the results
with me?

1836
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,240
Okay, so it feels more real.

1837
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:45,920
It exists.

1838
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:49,200
It is only showing us
the rows from 1 to 50.

1839
02:09:49,600 --> 02:09:53,080
It is to optimize the database results

1840
02:09:55,560 --> 02:09:57,120
when your page time flies.

1841
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:03,360
I just looked at the time
and it's almost ten oh oh.

1842
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:06,600
Let's find out some other value

1843
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:10,080
for which actually
let me show you from this

1844
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:13,280
not obvious, but

1845
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:18,480
select age

1846
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:22,800
and then the count

1847
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:27,760
of all types of ages
that we have inside the

1848
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,960
first 20, it will easier
to verify the results from here

1849
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:39,400
because there are fewer roads in here.

1850
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:44,280
I don't know how many those are due
to next year to try to count

1851
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:55,200
107. Yes,

1852
02:10:55,200 --> 02:11:00,840
it will be a lot of data
to compare the results,

1853
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:05,480
so I need to grow by,
otherwise I will be getting wrong results

1854
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:11,760
like I got in this case.

1855
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:15,160
So two one employ has aged, wanted,

1856
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:18,920
16 of them has a 23 aged 24,

1857
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:21,600
three of them has 25, 28 and 28.

1858
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:26,640
Now let's verify if we are getting
the correct results are not

1859
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:31,000
and how this group is working.

1860
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,520
So let's verify this.

1861
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:34,640
There should be 320 fives

1862
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:39,240
inside the person table for the Age column

1863
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:50,000
one, two and three.

1864
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:54,280
So you guys can you guys see it combines

1865
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:56,720
all the values which are same

1866
02:11:57,560 --> 02:12:00,360
and then it displays
the count of those values.

1867
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:03,640
Now it is very it is specific.

1868
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:07,200
It is specific
because we are using the count function.

1869
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:09,640
What you guys can also do,

1870
02:12:09,640 --> 02:12:12,640
you guys can apply
the other multi-role functions in here.

1871
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:14,360
So let's say, for example,

1872
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:18,560
you want to calculate the minimum age

1873
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:23,720
of a female and a male.

1874
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:25,440
Can you guys help me write down the query?

1875
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:26,320
How can I do that?

1876
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:29,840
I want to know
what is the minimum value for male

1877
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:44,880
and what is the minimum age for a female?

1878
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:49,080
And you guys, can you guys hear me?

1879
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:54,640
So what is the minimum

1880
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:58,680
age for a male and what is a minimum

1881
02:12:58,680 --> 02:13:05,400
age for a female?

1882
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:09,040
We are typing in my school

1883
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:21,720
so I can see that gender

1884
02:13:22,920 --> 02:13:25,440
and then minimum

1885
02:13:26,120 --> 02:13:29,400
of the age right

1886
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:32,520
from person and

1887
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:35,960
by which column I should grow

1888
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,880
by the resource guys

1889
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:43,280
gender

1890
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:56,040
right?

1891
02:13:56,040 --> 02:14:01,800
So female minimum age for the females
is 20 minimum age for the male is 23.

1892
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:05,880
And the null values
has also a minimum age, which is 25.

1893
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:10,680
So all the readers are grouped by gender

1894
02:14:11,680 --> 02:14:15,400
and we are calculating the minimum.

1895
02:14:16,080 --> 02:14:19,480
So there are many roles that have.

1896
02:14:19,480 --> 02:14:21,520
B gender. M Right.

1897
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:25,320
So our skill is going through
all those roles for which the gender is.

1898
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:29,680
M and it is finding out the minimum value,
then it is doing

1899
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:33,600
the same for females,
it is doing the same for NULL.

1900
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:37,680
If there are, let's say,
ten unique values in the gender column,

1901
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:41,640
it will do these calculations
for all of those ten values

1902
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:55,480
because we are grouping
the results by the gender.

1903
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:59,200
Are you guys getting the idea
behind this group BY It's a little tricky

1904
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:03,360
as I'm worried about this.

1905
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:06,520
So if you guys understand the

1906
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:09,960
this group by telling me

1907
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:15,440
how many employees live in each of
these cities that I you you

1908
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:18,120
to find out

1909
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:20,920
how many employees live

1910
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:25,920
in let's say York, London or Sydney,
I want to find the count

1911
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:28,520
against each city.

1912
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:32,280
How many employees are living
in that specific city right?

1913
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:33,480
Down to you for that.

1914
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:40,600
If you guys have understood.

1915
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:43,400
Yes, I will make it practice. Don't worry.

1916
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:48,560
I will be giving you a lot of homework
and then a big project related to school.

1917
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:50,640
So you guys will be writing right?

1918
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:59,880
Like 50 plus cuties.

1919
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:03,960
So again, I want to find out the count
against each city.

1920
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:08,880
So I say a select city
so that I can see the name,

1921
02:16:10,080 --> 02:16:13,760
and then I will say, count how many rolls

1922
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:17,080
are against each city

1923
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:21,280
from person table and then

1924
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:24,240
group the results by

1925
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:33,320
city. So

1926
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:36,440
there is a city null.

1927
02:16:36,440 --> 02:16:38,400
So employers have the value null.

1928
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:41,520
For the city. It is empty, there is zero.

1929
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,840
There are 14 employees
who are living in Dubai,

1930
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:49,000
five in Istanbul,
one in Lahore, two in London.

1931
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:50,560
Why count that?

1932
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:51,680
I just wanted to count.

1933
02:16:51,680 --> 02:16:55,640
You can take average some minimum maximum,
whatever you want, but

1934
02:16:56,400 --> 02:17:02,520
you're just an example to show you that.

1935
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:04,440
Why count now?

1936
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:08,520
Why triple stars?

1937
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:11,760
No double star.

1938
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:13,960
Can you please rephrase?

1939
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:17,400
Can we try an example of the average
function? Yes.

1940
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:21,600
Why did you use a star?

1941
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:24,200
You want to use something else?

1942
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:26,080
I just want to perform a count.

1943
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:26,880
Right.

1944
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:32,440
So the you guys can go down
to the number of the bar by start.

1945
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:35,440
I mean, count
all of the rows that are there in there.

1946
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:38,480
So count, function, count

1947
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:42,000
all the rows
if you want, do something like this.

1948
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,880
You are
you are saying why I'm not using the city

1949
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:50,800
you guys can

1950
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:52,800
use, you guys can use first name,

1951
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:55,680
you guys can use last name.

1952
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:58,000
You guys can use anything.

1953
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,360
Count means just count the number of rows.

1954
02:18:00,600 --> 02:18:02,840
I don't need to specify a specific column.

1955
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:06,960
You guys can specify any column
first name, last name, age,

1956
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:09,920
city, whatever you want. Count means
I don't care.

1957
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:18,840
Whatever the column name is,
just give me the column.

1958
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:22,240
So sometimes you guys, most of the time
you guys will see called static.

1959
02:18:23,240 --> 02:18:26,400
But if you are looking for a count
for a specified column.

1960
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:29,280
You can also specify that you said

1961
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:33,480
do whatever you want.

1962
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:37,960
I mean, you can use any column.

1963
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:44,840
So Nabeel was saying, can we try
an example of the average function?

1964
02:18:44,840 --> 02:18:50,600
Yes, sure.

1965
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:53,640
So this average function required you

1966
02:18:53,640 --> 02:18:57,120
to boss A Actually, let me create a new

1967
02:18:58,120 --> 02:18:59,000
duty so that

1968
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,000
you guys can practice this group.

1969
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,920
So this average function
calculates the average.

1970
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:09,360
And to calculate the average
we need the numeric that out here.

1971
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:10,200
Right.

1972
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:14,280
So let's say
maybe we can calculate the average age

1973
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:18,240
of the employees in each city, Right?

1974
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:22,360
So this every function
will give us that info in school.

1975
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:26,960
Understanding the results that you guys
are getting is more important

1976
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:29,960
than just writing the query
and getting delivers.

1977
02:19:30,480 --> 02:19:33,720
The you should understand
the query that you should understand

1978
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:36,000
what the security will return to you.

1979
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,680
So right, the security is returning me.

1980
02:19:38,680 --> 02:19:41,880
The average age in Dubai,
the average age in

1981
02:19:41,880 --> 02:19:45,120
Istanbul, the average age in Lahore,
the average age in London.

1982
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:48,160
For all the employees
that inside that city.

1983
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:52,640
Do you guys understand how well what
this average function is going in here,

1984
02:19:52,640 --> 02:19:56,800
Why I wrote Age
and what the city is doing in here.

1985
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:59,600
So grouping the results by city

1986
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:01,280
and inside

1987
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:04,320
the city, take the age
of all the employees

1988
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:07,680
that live in that specific city,
then calculate the average.

1989
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:12,360
You guys can also calculate
the minimum age of all the cities.

1990
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:17,360
Their support Example If you want
to find out what is the minimum age,

1991
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:21,600
all the cities for employees,
you can also do that.

1992
02:20:21,960 --> 02:20:24,360
So it totally depends
what you want to calculate.

1993
02:20:24,360 --> 02:20:26,840
Your first.

1994
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:30,880
The only important thing is
you should understand that

1995
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:34,680
this group by based on

1996
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,680
what column
you want the group to buy your results.

1997
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:39,600
Right.

1998
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:43,600
Let's say you are grouping by the results,
by department, by a city

1999
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:47,920
is by a salary, is by date of birth
or whatever is your requirement.

2000
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:51,440
And the next thing is
what kind of calculations

2001
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:56,480
you want to perform on that,
that that group that you have created.

2002
02:20:56,560 --> 02:21:00,800
So first will create those groups
based on the column

2003
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,840
that you have specified,
then will will perform that

2004
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:07,680
specific function
that you are specifying in here.

2005
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:11,280
And remember, it should be a multi role
function, not a single role function.

2006
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:15,480
What about
two specific a city for example?

2007
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:16,760
New York?

2008
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:19,440
Yes. If you only want to see the results

2009
02:21:19,440 --> 02:21:22,200
for New York,
then you can use the where clause, right?

2010
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:25,320
In that case,
we don't need the group by group.

2011
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:28,680
By is only needed when you don't know.

2012
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:32,040
Let's say
how many cities are there in your table.

2013
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:34,280
You don't know how many cities are there.

2014
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:36,920
Let's say
there are 1 million rows in your table.

2015
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:39,000
You don't know how many cities are there,

2016
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:43,240
and you just want to see the stats
for all the cities that are there.

2017
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:47,760
Then you will perform the group by clause
because in group by skill

2018
02:21:47,760 --> 02:21:52,320
takes this responsibility
of finding out all the unique cities

2019
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:56,400
and then performing calculation
whatever calculation you are specifying

2020
02:21:56,400 --> 02:22:00,600
average minimum, maximum counter,
whatever you want against that value.

2021
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:04,960
So we are clause is when know the value.

2022
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:10,440
Let's say for example, you know for sure
that there is New York in your table,

2023
02:22:10,680 --> 02:22:13,400
but what if you don't know
the names of the city,

2024
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:15,440
then you will not be able
to write queries.

2025
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:18,360
In that case, you will use group buyer
because group buyer

2026
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:23,840
it automatically scan all the values
and automatically automatic click group

2027
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:28,040
all the values based on the data
that is present inside that column.

2028
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:31,880
Does it make sense based?

2029
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:35,720
And I suppose the rest of the statistics
mathematic functions

2030
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:38,760
do exist as well to be searched
and found by Google?

2031
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:40,920
Yep. Yep. Nabeel, you are right.

2032
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:46,000
You there are more than just minimum
maximum average sum count function.

2033
02:22:46,040 --> 02:22:50,000
There are many more multi role functions
that if needed,

2034
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:57,480
you guys can search on the internet.

2035
02:22:57,480 --> 02:22:58,320
All right, guys.

2036
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:06,080
So let me give you one more task.

2037
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:09,720
Can you guys tell me how many employees
have the last name NASIR?

2038
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:12,080
How many employees
have the last name as John?

2039
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:14,280
How many employers have the last
name as Kim?

2040
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:17,360
I want to find out
the count of the employees

2041
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:21,040
who have the same last name.

2042
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:23,600
Can you write me a query?

2043
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:28,000
I want to find out the number of employees

2044
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:31,000
who have the same last

2045
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:36,320
name, and I also want

2046
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:42,000
to find out the name of that
than their specific name as well.

2047
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:56,640
So their specific last name
plus their scope? Yes.

2048
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,040
Is there anyone who is unable
to write this query

2049
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:07,320
maybe who don't understand?

2050
02:24:07,320 --> 02:24:08,280
So select

2051
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:14,000
last name, right.

2052
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:16,560
And then count.

2053
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:18,000
I don't care. You can.

2054
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,680
I am saying hey, a skill
you can use any column in here

2055
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:26,040
for this count to perform from person.

2056
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:28,480
And then I want the group to by

2057
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:37,480
the last name.

2058
02:24:37,480 --> 02:24:42,760
Yes, it is correct.

2059
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:45,960
And you guys can also
compare the results with me.

2060
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:51,520
So John is 13 of the employers
have the same as the last name.

2061
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:54,120
Three of the employers
have a zero as the last name.

2062
02:24:54,360 --> 02:24:58,160
All of the other last names they are
they have occurred

2063
02:24:58,160 --> 02:25:05,640
only once inside this paper.

2064
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:07,680
Okay, perfect.

2065
02:25:08,120 --> 02:25:13,680
I think you guys have started getting it.

2066
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:17,920
Can you guys calculate the average age

2067
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:22,680
of employees who have employee I.D.

2068
02:25:22,680 --> 02:25:25,760
120 or 100 or 230?

2069
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:29,880
So based on the employee I.D.,
I want to find out the average age

2070
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,640
and you guys. Right. For that.

2071
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:34,280
Can we see how many?

2072
02:25:34,280 --> 02:25:35,840
No. Zero on in there?

2073
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:36,720
Yes. Yes.

2074
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:39,440
Then if you can write,
Acuity will find out.

2075
02:25:39,880 --> 02:25:41,240
And let me show you from here.

2076
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:43,600
So there are three in here.

2077
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:46,040
So find out

2078
02:25:46,040 --> 02:25:49,080
how many employees

2079
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,320
have the employer I.D.

2080
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:57,800
What is the average age of the employees
who have the employer I.D.?

2081
02:25:57,800 --> 02:26:02,480
120 What is the average age
for the employee I.D. 150.

2082
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:20,600
What is the average age for the employer
ID 100?

2083
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:22,840
So select

2084
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:26,760
empty I.D.

2085
02:26:26,760 --> 02:26:30,240
and then, uh, 40 average

2086
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:33,600
of age

2087
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:35,760
from person to person

2088
02:26:38,040 --> 02:26:41,440
and by

2089
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:45,160
employee I.D..

2090
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:52,760
All right.

2091
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:56,480
So employed 100 has the average age 25.5,

2092
02:26:56,480 --> 02:26:59,800
130.01 2030 23.

2093
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:04,760
Okay, let's let me check if we are

2094
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:10,880
missing.

2095
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:14,280
So this is the how group by
what's used with aggregate functions.

2096
02:27:14,280 --> 02:27:15,680
So this is important.

2097
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:19,560
It is always used with the aggregate.

2098
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:20,400
Right.

2099
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:23,280
Aggregate functions mean average sum.

2100
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,840
All of those functions
actually that take multiple values

2101
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:29,760
and then aggregate the results
to give one single value

2102
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:34,600
to collect
the data across multiple records

2103
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:42,360
and grouping the results
by one or more columns.

2104
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:46,120
NoSQL has used

2105
02:27:46,760 --> 02:27:48,400
as well as a manually written

2106
02:27:48,400 --> 02:27:51,640
one 2150 and 113 to be every function

2107
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:55,800
entity exited written ID.

2108
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:58,800
Ladies, it's time to leave Syntax.

2109
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:01,440
Please, please grow up.

2110
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:03,720
Please don't do everything as Manuel.

2111
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:06,320
I tried with cities

2112
02:28:07,440 --> 02:28:08,560
of Asia.

2113
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:11,000
If you do something like this on your job,
please

2114
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,680
don't forget to share
with the rest of the batch.

2115
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:17,960
We will be more than happy
to see your great work

2116
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:21,120
that you will perform as you were tested

2117
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:24,400
on your behalf in your job.

2118
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:27,840
This maybe others

2119
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:32,920
can learn from that.

2120
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:34,120
Okay.

2121
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:39,480
But I can tell you one thing
because of you shot and now because of you

2122
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:43,320
other employers, they
they will be benefiting a lot from you

2123
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:48,200
because the the thing that can be done
in, let's say, 5 minutes,

2124
02:28:48,240 --> 02:28:53,040
you guys will be doing the same thing
manually in 3 hours and 4 hours maybe.

2125
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:58,000
So your manager will slowly start
to think that this specific

2126
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:02,040
task actually needed
three or hours and maybe

2127
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:05,080
I'm just kidding, don't

2128
02:29:05,080 --> 02:29:11,800
take it seriously.

2129
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:13,520
Actually, you should take it seriously.

2130
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:20,520
I mean, why are you
guys are still doing things manually?

2131
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:22,160
Okay, don't take it seriously.

2132
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:27,240
You do not take notice
that when you are hired.

2133
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:31,080
So these are some of the examples
of multiple functions.

2134
02:29:31,080 --> 02:29:33,520
Count them in average, blah, blah, blah.

2135
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:36,640
And then you can group them by
and then you can have.

2136
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:41,000
Okay, so now is the final thing.

2137
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:45,560
And it is again, very,
very frequently in the interviews,

2138
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:50,040
this having clause.

2139
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:54,360
First let me show you
what does it mean by having clause.

2140
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:58,040
So you guys did the

2141
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:00,480
you guys brought this query

2142
02:30:00,480 --> 02:30:05,520
to find out the number of employees
who have the same last name.

2143
02:30:06,640 --> 02:30:07,840
I will

2144
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:10,600
all team down in his bad dreams.

2145
02:30:10,920 --> 02:30:14,400
I can remember after said when he gets
married, they will be invited.

2146
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,320
Are still true. Yes.

2147
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,160
Yes, definitely. Still true.

2148
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:21,720
But remember,
there is this tradition here in Pakistan

2149
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:27,680
that when whoever comes to wedding,
they have to bring some kind of gifts for.

2150
02:30:27,680 --> 02:30:31,960
The bride and the groom,
how to practice with timing.

2151
02:30:31,960 --> 02:30:34,680
I mean, how much time and the task needs

2152
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:37,920
always, always, guys, if you think that

2153
02:30:39,320 --> 02:30:41,520
you can do a task in 3 hours,

2154
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:46,000
always, always tell your manager
that it will require 6 hours.

2155
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:48,000
Please don't be smart.

2156
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:51,600
Please don't think that, Oh,
I can do this in 3 hours.

2157
02:30:51,600 --> 02:30:53,280
I will be appreciated.

2158
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:58,840
If you are telling that you will,
it will take 3 hours to complete the task.

2159
02:30:58,840 --> 02:31:03,280
Your manager will start thinking,
okay, let's find out something for

2160
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:08,200
then is that he should do after 3 hours
so it will already have something in mind.

2161
02:31:08,200 --> 02:31:10,200
Once you are done with that
task, believe me.

2162
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:17,160
And in reality we because we are
not machines, we need some time to relax.

2163
02:31:17,160 --> 02:31:17,880
Right.

2164
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:20,600
So always keep that time as well

2165
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:24,840
in your tasks, maybe 15, 20 or 30 minutes
to have some break,

2166
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:28,800
to have some coffee or something like that
after each task.

2167
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:33,200
So please don't be smart
because I have seen

2168
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:36,920
those implies
the only thing they get is more work.

2169
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:39,840
If you have completed the work
that is given to you,

2170
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:45,520
the next thing you should expect
is more work from your managers. It's

2171
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:48,400
Do they ask you to drive? No.

2172
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:50,440
Slowly they will understand you, Aisha.

2173
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:52,040
Slowly they will know.

2174
02:31:52,040 --> 02:31:55,000
We have a great Aisha

2175
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,280
that on average
take months to complete this task.

2176
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:05,360
So they will not bother you to ask again
and again.

2177
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:06,880
I'm just getting up.

2178
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:09,600
Yes, it depends on task.

2179
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:11,520
What do they get? Higher salaries.

2180
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,880
Okay, so here is another thing.

2181
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:16,200
Believe me, the person

2182
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:19,640
who is putting all the efforts on

2183
02:32:20,840 --> 02:32:23,520
on a job throughout the complete year

2184
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:27,480
at Max,
what they will get maybe, let's say

2185
02:32:28,400 --> 02:32:33,440
7% raise or 8%,
and the employee who has done nothing,

2186
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:38,880
he will like around maybe 4% or 5%,
then that's the only difference.

2187
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:45,320
But if you guys are working smartly
so, there is a difference.

2188
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:50,600
Working hard and keeping yourself
busy all the time and working smartly.

2189
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,760
Let's say
if your company is doing something and,

2190
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:57,200
you know something better
that can save cost.

2191
02:32:57,720 --> 02:33:01,080
So instead of keeping yourself busy
in solving task

2192
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:05,080
or think about in that time,
think you can cut down the costs

2193
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:09,520
if you want to be a manager or a director
or on the higher position.

2194
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
So think in a different way

2195
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:15,600
other than just keep on solving things
that are given to you.

2196
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:18,520
Maybe a how you can improve a process.

2197
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:21,560
That's what higher management
usually do, right?

2198
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:23,520
How you can improve processes

2199
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:27,640
to save huge amounts of time,
how you can cut down costs,

2200
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:31,240
how you can improve other things,
maybe security or something like that.

2201
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:34,600
So this is what I have observed.

2202
02:33:35,760 --> 02:33:37,440
How f ESD

2203
02:33:37,440 --> 02:33:41,240
previous batches become team leads
or by the way, it is.

2204
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:42,480
Yes, it is correct.

2205
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:46,840
Not a job joke that some of them
they are directors as well.

2206
02:33:47,560 --> 02:33:50,400
After I think your syntax started in

2207
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:54,840
2017 and it's three.

2208
02:33:54,840 --> 02:33:56,480
It's just five years.

2209
02:33:56,480 --> 02:34:00,360
So let's say if even a student graduates
graduated in the first batch

2210
02:34:00,680 --> 02:34:04,880
in just five years,
if he is a director or manager, I think he

2211
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:07,600
he has done a wonderful job

2212
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,720
and then he will be a great team.

2213
02:34:10,720 --> 02:34:12,680
Lead.

2214
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:14,720
And here is one more advice.

2215
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:18,120
Please make your manager
your best friend if possible.

2216
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:21,800
Believe me,
your life will be super, super easy.

2217
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:23,480
So I was saying,

2218
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:29,240
if we execute the security in here,
what about two testing jobs

2219
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:30,160
at the same time?

2220
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:33,840
Later on you will learn how to make
your manager your best friend

2221
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:37,960
just laugh on every joke

2222
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:41,880
that he or she is making,
No matter how bad is that joke.

2223
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:44,120
I think

2224
02:34:44,760 --> 02:34:47,520
most of you already know, right?

2225
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:50,240
I don't need to tell this.

2226
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:52,520
It's putting put what you are the manager.

2227
02:34:52,520 --> 02:34:53,400
Right?

2228
02:34:54,360 --> 02:35:00,240
So let's see guys,
I want to filter out these groups.

2229
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:02,600
So I have already created the groups.

2230
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:08,320
That's why we will laugh at your jokes.

2231
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:13,320
You guys will get nothing but knowledge
from me as far as I am concerned.

2232
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:18,640
My boss loves me because I bring him food.

2233
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:21,600
If he or she said banana is being say yes.

2234
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:24,800
Yes. This is the
this is also very important.

2235
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:27,200
Manager is always right.

2236
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:27,480
Okay.

2237
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:29,280
We are we still have 10 minutes

2238
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:32,760
so let's talk that you have already
created the groups. And

2239
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:36,480
so there are two types of filtering

2240
02:35:36,480 --> 02:35:41,040
filtering the individual group
and then filtering a group.

2241
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:45,400
The result of a group,
if you want to filter out, let's say

2242
02:35:45,400 --> 02:35:48,800
if you only want those employing names

2243
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:52,080
who have occurred more than twice,

2244
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:57,480
then we cannot use clause in here. Why?

2245
02:35:57,480 --> 02:36:01,280
Because we're clause operates
on an individual role.

2246
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:05,600
If you have group with the results
using the group by clause,

2247
02:36:06,080 --> 02:36:09,120
we have a new clause
that is called having clause

2248
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:15,000
and we need to do this

2249
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,520
filtering inside the having clause

2250
02:36:21,320 --> 02:36:21,880
like this.

2251
02:36:21,880 --> 02:36:24,240
We cannot use the word clause in here.

2252
02:36:24,640 --> 02:36:29,040
And this is the difference between
we are clause and the having clause

2253
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:33,720
where is used to filter out
your individual roles

2254
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:37,960
while the having clause
is used to filter out

2255
02:36:37,960 --> 02:36:41,400
the results of your group.

2256
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:45,240
So for example,
if I execute X to let me create a copy

2257
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:52,240
so that you guys
can observe the difference.

2258
02:36:52,240 --> 02:36:55,920
So in here
I am getting all the groups right if,

2259
02:36:56,160 --> 02:37:00,240
whether, if a name has occurred once
or maybe 13 times.

2260
02:37:00,240 --> 02:37:04,080
But what if I don't want
what if I only want those results

2261
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:08,440
for which the count is greater than two
or greater than one?

2262
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:15,000
Then I can use the having clause
and I need to put this same aggregate

2263
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:20,000
function in here and then I can write that
that I want to apply on deck.

2264
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:22,800
Trust me, if I don't like a person,

2265
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:28,400
I cannot laugh at his her joke,
even if it is funny.

2266
02:37:28,400 --> 02:37:31,960
I say, you don't want to be a manager
or director or something like that.

2267
02:37:32,400 --> 02:37:35,840
So now we will only get those groups

2268
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:43,200
which qualify condition.

2269
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:49,440
So do you guys understand the difference
between having an individual clause?

2270
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:52,440
So if you want to do any kind of filtering

2271
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:55,280
on your groups,
the results of your groups,

2272
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:59,200
we use the having clause
and we put this same function.

2273
02:37:59,880 --> 02:38:02,600
Can you repeat that one more time? Yes.

2274
02:38:02,920 --> 02:38:05,760
So if I execute this duty,

2275
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:09,600
I already have the results, already
have the groups.

2276
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:12,240
Right. But in real life, what can happen?

2277
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:15,600
These last name, there can be millions

2278
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:18,360
of last names in your results right

2279
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:22,240
When you are when you will be working
on a real database,

2280
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:26,040
then you might not want
all of the results, right?

2281
02:38:26,040 --> 02:38:28,920
You might want to filter some results.

2282
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:31,080
And how can we do that?

2283
02:38:31,080 --> 02:38:33,880
We can do that
with the help of having clause.

2284
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:35,720
For example, I want to build a filtration.

2285
02:38:35,720 --> 02:38:38,760
I only want those results
which are of greater than one.

2286
02:38:39,320 --> 02:38:42,600
So I will put my multi-role function

2287
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:45,480
in here
and I will write the condition in here.

2288
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:50,960
And if I execute this query,
instead of getting each and every group,

2289
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:57,120
this time I will only get that group
for which the count is greater than one

2290
02:39:02,120 --> 02:39:05,000
right now we have an assistant principal.

2291
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,320
She knows like I hate.

2292
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:10,720
So this having clause
is basically to filter out

2293
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:19,000
your groups or a

2294
02:39:23,160 --> 02:39:27,040
So can you guys quickly
let me let me check

2295
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:30,000
if you guys have understood this

2296
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,520
actually, let me show you the theory first

2297
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:35,480
where clause used to filter rules

2298
02:39:37,040 --> 02:39:40,680
having clause used to filter groups.

2299
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:42,720
You guys already know
how to create groups.

2300
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:46,840
And if you want to filter out some groups,
will you be having clause

2301
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:49,800
string can also be in a having

2302
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:53,880
filter instance applied before group by.

2303
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:57,120
So we write the word clause
before the group by clause.

2304
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:01,480
Otherwise
we will be getting a syntax at a used

2305
02:40:01,480 --> 02:40:04,880
if condition does not contain
a group of function.

2306
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:08,840
If there are group functions,
we cannot use the where clause

2307
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:12,760
with those group functions
applied after group bias.

2308
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:16,440
So we write the having clause
after the group buy plus we have clause

2309
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:20,640
before the groups
that are having after the group buy

2310
02:40:21,160 --> 02:40:25,200
and it is used if conditions contain
aggregate function.

2311
02:40:25,320 --> 02:40:28,960
Those functions
which take multiple values as input

2312
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:38,640
and give a single value as output.

2313
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:53,080
So can you guys write a few of.

2314
02:40:53,080 --> 02:40:56,760
So I want to find how many employees

2315
02:40:57,360 --> 02:41:00,720
have an MP already.

2316
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,840
So how many employees have an MP added

2317
02:41:03,880 --> 02:41:07,000
That has occurred more than three times.

2318
02:41:07,040 --> 02:41:07,400
Maybe

2319
02:41:11,400 --> 02:41:14,120
you show us a sample with vote and having.

2320
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:17,000
Yes, yes, yes. Give me one moment.

2321
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:19,000
Do we need to fast What a form.

2322
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:22,640
Select the last name gone from person
group by last time before we do

2323
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:23,080
the having.

2324
02:41:23,080 --> 02:41:26,240
Yes, having clause only works

2325
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:28,880
if you are grouping the results first

2326
02:41:31,200 --> 02:41:31,520
alone.

2327
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:34,160
I was very very fast.

2328
02:41:34,480 --> 02:41:37,080
So like B and B already count from person

2329
02:41:37,080 --> 02:41:40,480
by MP already
having count greater than three.

2330
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:41,200
Right.

2331
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:46,160
So only those groups.

2332
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:50,800
So MP ID and then count
of all the employees against that MP ID.

2333
02:41:50,920 --> 02:41:54,000
So if I only execute
this part of the query

2334
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:56,800
just to show you

2335
02:41:59,320 --> 02:42:01,520
we get the counts in here right.

2336
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:06,800
For a two employees have 100
MP, one has another ten nine

2337
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:10,720
employees have 120 as the MPI 8150.

2338
02:42:10,920 --> 02:42:13,040
And then you guys are saying their task.

2339
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:14,040
Well, you know what?

2340
02:42:14,040 --> 02:42:18,400
I don't want all the results
that you are giving me in here.

2341
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:23,200
I only want the results
for which the gulp is greater than three.

2342
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:26,880
So you will see once
I apply this having a to the three,

2343
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:29,000
this one will be removed,
two will be removed.

2344
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:34,680
This one will be removed.

2345
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:37,760
So you see, I now only see four,
nine and five.

2346
02:42:38,160 --> 02:42:40,680
Do you guys
get the idea of having class Now

2347
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:44,360
the difference where and how now

2348
02:42:44,600 --> 02:42:48,360
and then is well saying
can you show us where clause and

2349
02:42:50,400 --> 02:42:51,280
having class.

2350
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:56,040
So let's say for example,
you only want to perform

2351
02:42:56,040 --> 02:42:59,840
this task for the employees
for which the city

2352
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:01,920
let's say

2353
02:43:03,960 --> 02:43:04,840
what type of cities

2354
02:43:04,840 --> 02:43:10,080
are there in our table?

2355
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:13,560
Let's say you only want to do this thing
for the New York place.

2356
02:43:14,160 --> 02:43:15,680
So in here

2357
02:43:16,440 --> 02:43:20,160
first, all the rules will be filtered

2358
02:43:20,400 --> 02:43:26,880
from the actual table
that does not have a city

2359
02:43:26,880 --> 02:43:30,000
is equal to New York
and all of these things.

2360
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:33,120
They will be performed
only on the employers

2361
02:43:33,600 --> 02:43:39,720
for which the city is New York.

2362
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:44,920
So there is no employee in
in the New York City

2363
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:48,160
for which the count is greater

2364
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:52,920
than which means there are no employees
in the New York City

2365
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:56,120
that have the same MP

2366
02:43:56,160 --> 02:44:01,560
ID more than three times.

2367
02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:06,880
Does it make sense right. So

2368
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:10,200
let me show you another example.

2369
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:13,880
It will make more sense.

2370
02:44:13,880 --> 02:44:19,640
So for the Istanbul,

2371
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:23,800
do you think 151 5151 5155 times.

2372
02:44:24,360 --> 02:44:32,920
So if I select this city as Istanbul,

2373
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:34,320
can you guys

2374
02:44:36,440 --> 02:44:38,600
reduce the output?

2375
02:44:38,680 --> 02:44:44,320
Oops.

2376
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:46,400
So if I use the city as

2377
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:55,040
I hope I am writing

2378
02:44:55,040 --> 02:45:01,280
the correct spellings in here.

2379
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:04,560
So the results are five
and why we got this

2380
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:09,920
because it is greater than three
if the results are less than three,

2381
02:45:10,120 --> 02:45:12,360
we will not be getting any data.

2382
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:18,960
Dennis, are you good now?

2383
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:20,280
Any other questions?

2384
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:21,720
Any other confusion?

2385
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:23,760
Can we go over this again in next class?

2386
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:26,280
Yes, definitely. I will revise.

2387
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:29,280
You guys will also revise this
in your review class.

2388
02:45:30,120 --> 02:45:33,960
And you will do
you will solve many tasks related to this

2389
02:45:35,160 --> 02:45:36,640
dispatch guard stand

2390
02:45:36,640 --> 02:45:41,280
five x me.

2391
02:45:41,280 --> 02:45:44,200
So there is one more thing

2392
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:44,400
left.

2393
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:47,320
Can I have ten more minutes from you?

2394
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:52,120
Because you guys waste a lot of my time

2395
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:57,560
that I think you are sleepy

2396
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:00,240
Silva Again,

2397
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:04,040
this emoji emoji I hate to bake.

2398
02:46:04,440 --> 02:46:07,160
You have to bake after this class.

2399
02:46:07,160 --> 02:46:09,360
Oh my God. Yes.

2400
02:46:09,360 --> 02:46:09,920
Yes. Then.

2401
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:15,840
Then this emoji is fine.

2402
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:18,240
Why don't you make a deal with Zima?

2403
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:23,280
Three days in a week, Zima will cook
three days in a week you will cook.

2404
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:26,760
And the other day
you guys will order something

2405
02:46:26,760 --> 02:46:30,560
from outside the

2406
02:46:33,160 --> 02:46:35,680
Don't do blame games with your wife.

2407
02:46:36,600 --> 02:46:38,840
I am baking for parties for years.

2408
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:43,080
Yeah.

2409
02:46:43,080 --> 02:46:45,920
Does the man know how to cook?

2410
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:48,720
So Zima, best of luck for

2411
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:53,400
I don't know why
you guys are having party,

2412
02:46:53,680 --> 02:46:59,280
but I am sure at least 2000 things
go on from Zima bucket for this party.

2413
02:46:59,280 --> 02:47:04,400
Maybe more than 2000, $3,000.

2414
02:47:04,400 --> 02:47:05,080
Best of luck.

2415
02:47:05,080 --> 02:47:09,200
Zima.

2416
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:12,280
So there is this last thing
that I want to show you,

2417
02:47:12,280 --> 02:47:16,800
and then you guys can leave.

2418
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:21,920
If you have multiple conditions in acuity,

2419
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:25,680
you guys can break down

2420
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:28,520
your results in intermediate straps.

2421
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:30,520
So for example,

2422
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:34,480
I'm you guys remember the scary

2423
02:47:37,600 --> 02:47:38,400
sketch.

2424
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:42,200
So for the homework,

2425
02:47:42,200 --> 02:47:47,120
you guys had to manually go to this job,

2426
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:50,520
I guess Oracle at our table

2427
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:55,080
to find out the job titles manually

2428
02:47:55,560 --> 02:48:00,320
and then you guys
had to put those course in here, right?

2429
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:02,360
But what if these scores

2430
02:48:02,360 --> 02:48:06,360
that you are putting in here,
they are in thousands or in hundreds?

2431
02:48:06,720 --> 02:48:10,440
It will be very, very tough for you
to first find out the code

2432
02:48:10,440 --> 02:48:13,440
for all those values, let's say
100 or 200.

2433
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:17,240
Then remember those values
and put inside the in column

2434
02:48:17,240 --> 02:48:19,440
and then execute this query. Right.

2435
02:48:19,440 --> 02:48:21,760
You guys are getting my point.

2436
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:23,280
Yes, I can do it.

2437
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:26,280
Yes, I am talking of for other students

2438
02:48:26,280 --> 02:48:30,480
other than I show.

2439
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:35,400
So again, others get
and you guys put like a hundred or 200

2440
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:39,240
gold in from the
from the other table here.

2441
02:48:40,760 --> 02:48:43,520
Yes. And as well as well.

2442
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:47,320
So this is not for not as good or nicer
you guys absolutely

2443
02:48:47,320 --> 02:48:53,440
just knew that you can anything manually.

2444
02:48:53,440 --> 02:49:05,640
I will get killed by these ladies someday.

2445
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:06,240
Okay.

2446
02:49:10,080 --> 02:49:12,600
So instead what you guys can do,

2447
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:15,640
you guys can use a

2448
02:49:17,440 --> 02:49:22,560
but then your class will be boarding.

2449
02:49:22,560 --> 02:49:26,320
So what you guys can do
instead of doing this manually,

2450
02:49:26,560 --> 02:49:29,280
you guys can use an inner query.

2451
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:34,440
So one you will do is acuity inside
and other acuity.

2452
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:38,520
It calculates
some results, intermediate results

2453
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:41,280
which are used inside and under acuity.

2454
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:44,440
So for example, you guys can say we're

2455
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:49,560
we had a job

2456
02:49:50,320 --> 02:49:55,320
title is equal is in

2457
02:50:01,280 --> 02:50:03,960
in let's say

2458
02:50:03,960 --> 02:50:05,280
developer

2459
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:12,160
or in the job title is let's say

2460
02:50:16,480 --> 02:50:17,920
it was freelancer right

2461
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:24,560
you the answer

2462
02:50:27,840 --> 02:50:28,800
so and

2463
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:31,960
instead of selecting all the data
you guys can select the IDs.

2464
02:50:32,040 --> 02:50:34,360
What what was this guys carefully.

2465
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:36,920
If I exit your discovery.

2466
02:50:36,920 --> 02:50:42,440
Discovery
now gives me the ideas for developer

2467
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:46,080
and a freelancer right.

2468
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:48,880
Uh, a non column dog pattern.

2469
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:58,880
Okay, so I get the idea then.

2470
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:02,880
29 and 31

2471
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:06,080
What I'm getting to the ideas
should not be

2472
02:51:06,600 --> 02:51:09,960
I getting only two ideas

2473
02:51:16,760 --> 02:51:18,920
that you've been talking

2474
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:23,080
with.

2475
02:51:23,080 --> 02:51:26,000
Maybe we have some duplicate
that there's like three ideas.

2476
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:29,360
Otherwise we should be getting towards.

2477
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:33,720
Maybe someone has assigned two
different ideas to developer or freelance.

2478
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:34,680
Oh yes.

2479
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:38,400
So freelancer has 29 and 31 as as great.

2480
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:43,840
The bad 710 stole them.

2481
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:50,040
But what we've been it okay,

2482
02:51:50,040 --> 02:51:53,800
so this is giving me the ideas of

2483
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:59,800
the developers and freelancers right now
what I can do instead of finding out

2484
02:51:59,800 --> 02:52:04,320
these ideas manually and inserting
in here, I can use this query

2485
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:14,320
wrong database selected those.

2486
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:18,640
In fact,

2487
02:52:18,640 --> 02:52:21,720
I can use this already
inside of these brackets

2488
02:52:22,520 --> 02:52:26,200
to let me make it smaller
so that you guys can see the complete.

2489
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:27,720
Now what Eskil will do.

2490
02:52:27,720 --> 02:52:33,800
First, it will execute this query
to find out the ideas and then those ideas

2491
02:52:33,800 --> 02:52:38,040
will be used inside this in clause
to find out the found out.

2492
02:52:38,120 --> 02:52:40,560
Find out those implies

2493
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:44,040
so results of one duty

2494
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:46,480
can be used in an other query.

2495
02:52:46,720 --> 02:52:50,120
If you are bringing the results
from two different tables,

2496
02:52:50,280 --> 02:52:54,120
even if you are bringing the results from
the same table and you want to perform

2497
02:52:54,120 --> 02:52:58,200
some intermediate calculations,
you can also do that.

2498
02:52:58,720 --> 02:53:01,320
So you see
now we are getting all the implies, but

2499
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:06,480
this time we are only specifying
the developer and a freelancer.

2500
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:07,840
We are not doing this first.

2501
02:53:07,840 --> 02:53:09,800
We are the ideas for developer
and a freelancer.

2502
02:53:09,800 --> 02:53:14,600
Then we manually those ideas in here
and then get those employs.

2503
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:16,320
Do you guys get the idea

2504
02:53:32,560 --> 02:53:33,880
the first

2505
02:53:33,880 --> 02:53:40,120
and this duty is executed?

2506
02:53:40,120 --> 02:53:41,760
Okay, I will show you in the next class.

2507
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:44,880
Maybe you guys are not mentally

2508
02:53:44,880 --> 02:53:49,040
prepared for this right now.

2509
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:49,600
I will.

2510
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:51,960
I will create a simpler table
to show this.

2511
02:53:52,720 --> 02:53:54,400
I am typing tired.

2512
02:53:54,400 --> 02:53:59,160
I think you are done from your side
for today.

2513
02:53:59,160 --> 02:54:00,920
We are getting it.

2514
02:54:00,920 --> 02:54:02,000
Yes, please. Okay.

2515
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,800
I will prepare this in the next class.

2516
02:54:03,800 --> 02:54:08,640
This was the last thing
that I wanted to show.

2517
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:09,640
Oh, okay.

2518
02:54:09,640 --> 02:54:13,560
I will post the homework in the

2519
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:16,480
course announcements channel guys,

2520
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:24,960
please make sure you do the homework
before the next class.

2521
02:54:24,960 --> 02:54:27,720
I need to it so tired.

2522
02:54:27,720 --> 02:54:30,000
If someone is tired they should not.

2523
02:54:30,160 --> 02:54:32,360
Should not they be sleeping?

2524
02:54:32,360 --> 02:54:36,360
Why? Even if you are tired again,
that's why you are healthy, right?

2525
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:39,080
Tired. Eat more is not good.

2526
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:42,840
Eat your tonight eat your day eat

2527
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:45,880
Will you cover review classes?

2528
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:49,200
I think I will do the review You class in

2529
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:52,200
morning eat?

2530
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:54,040
Yes Evening Eat.

2531
02:54:54,040 --> 02:54:54,720
All right, guys.

2532
02:54:54,720 --> 02:54:57,880
I hope you guys don't mind my jokes.

2533
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:02,680
It is just to some smile on your faces

2534
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:05,400
so that you guys don't get too bored

2535
02:55:05,880 --> 02:55:08,720
because these subjects,
they are kind of very dry.

2536
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,040
Especially programing.

2537
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:14,320
So it's part of my job, actually, to.

2538
02:55:14,440 --> 02:55:17,160
To make you happy as well.

2539
02:55:17,280 --> 02:55:20,840
We know you're joking.

2540
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:25,440
All right, guys, take some rest
and I will see you tomorrow.

2541
02:55:25,480 --> 02:55:26,160
Okay.

2542
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:30,760
That's what she said.

2543
02:55:30,760 --> 02:55:33,400
Bye bye, guys.
