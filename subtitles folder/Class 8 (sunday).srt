1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:19,920
I month.

2
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,160
All right, guys.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,320
Let's.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,040
Yes, yes, yes. Actually,
like I said, late.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,360
I mean, you there does go. But

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,600
so now, basically, so far what we did,

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,280
we understood the concept of base.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,960
You are right,
which is equivalent to your base.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,000
You are held in Java.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
Rest assured API,
first thing we cover, like

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
we know how to prepare the request, how

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,800
to send the request,
how to get the response right,

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,920
and how to verify and validate
all of the responses.

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,600
Right now, when you say verification
for right when we say verification part.

15
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,680
So in verification and verification,
we are not only relying on one

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,240
particular type of validation verification
check point, we are very plain

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
status code.

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,600
We are verifying body message, verifying

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,360
string in the body, verifying the value
of a string in the body.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Right.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,880
All of these things
we are verify is indeed

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,000
right.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
So these all are the things.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,440
These all are the things we covered.

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,640
Find after this.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,280
A next point which we covered is

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,320
integration

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,320
of rest

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,600
assured API, integration of rest assured
API with

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,760
with particular part

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,920
with key part right there.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,160
Also we did
so we wrote normal scenarios training

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,320
in these scenarios
we are questioning their data.

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,720
So we have seen two ways
to parse their data so far.

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,520
How many of was

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,240
how many was two is the first one is

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,160
the first one is why are they is

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,680
the first one is there

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,640
method

40
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
right where we declare the body right?

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,720
And from there
we provide their data, right?

42
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,640
Using the methodology.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,800
Second way is

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
can we escapes using

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,000
data table from feature.

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,800
Okay.

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,880
So either we can parsed their data
by declaring one particular

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,400
payload of matter in one particular class
called API payload constant.

49
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,960
Or we can simply parse
the values in the form of key.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,920
And when you've been using data table
from P2P

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,200
to industrial,

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,520
despite everyone.

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,440
No, no, here we are, We have seen this.

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,400
But also what is that?

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,040
When we pass the data in the formal data
tables detecting migrate.

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,360
So it is retrieving key and value
which makes,

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,440
which makes maps.

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
So when it creates maps, I'm seeing

59
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,360
what the data table object
I'm using this object will return

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,720
my value as as next flight as maps.

61
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,320
So one key one value together the way
the one that is key value pair mapping.

62
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,960
Right. So we are getting this map.

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,560
We keep adding one by one,
one by one, one by one.

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,720
Make all the maps together.

65
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,280
That's what we are doing.

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,720
Correct.

67
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,800
And if you if you watch the video,

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,560
you must have motivated

69
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,560
find three.

70
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,640
No, no, let's do the same operation.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,400
Right.

72
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's do the same operation in addition.

73
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,560
So far, we pass the data layer data table.

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,800
We pass the data by a normal method.

75
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,440
Remember, we had added

76
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
one more dependency called Jason,

77
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,880
so via JSON, also via JSON object.

78
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,040
Also, we can pass the data
because Java allows to short API

79
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,120
allows us to data to be sent
in JSON tournament

80
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,840
data to be sending JSON forward.

81
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,880
Correct?

82
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,520
That is correct.

83
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,880
Or not.

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,960
So now what I'm going to do is see here

85
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,840
the same scenario, right?

86
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,920
The same scenario.
I'm going to write again

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,920
right this time

88
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,840
I am going to create, this time
I'm going to create the body.

89
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,240
And we declared the employee
in which I am going to pass the data here.

90
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,560
I'm going to see

91
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,760
Jason work through.

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,520
So I am seen here

93
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,760
using JSON.

94
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,120
So now see what I'm going to do.

95
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,880
I would, I think, given a request,
is prepared for creating an employee

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,600
via Jason Field.

97
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,000
Now what is this Jason
This is something we need to understand.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,800
What is this? Jason Field

99
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,680
Guys, any idea, any guesses
what I'm doing here?

100
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,560
What is this?

101
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,640
And build any guesses

102
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,120
like Excel?

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,920
Marty Yes.

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,760
Got it.

105
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,120
Got the body from Swag update.

106
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,080
So first first to let me do one thing.

107
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,360
Let me just create this request first,

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,160
let me create the stem of this request
and then we will do further part.

109
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,200
So from API donor,
I'm going to change this bag

110
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,320
at the moment,
I'm going to change this date.

111
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,760
I will make it to generate this data.

112
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,240
And then when I run this
part, when I run this bar,

113
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,480
that will

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,920
Naughton is not day.

115
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,720
I want to do this.

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,760
Don't.

117
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,560
So first we got this request, right?

118
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,080
We got this step for the request
that I bet

119
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,920
I have to add this particular step
which we just created

120
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,000
once in API workflow steps.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,600
Right.

122
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,160
So here, here I'm going to write

123
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,040
this is that I'm going to write
this particular step. You

124
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,160
now see now see here

125
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,040
I'm going to write
a request is equal to given

126
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,120
dark proposed header
where the values would be.

127
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,000
My API

128
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,960
constants

129
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,400
dark header content

130
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
comma

131
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,680
API Constants Dark content.

132
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,960
Dark.

133
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,720
Another header.

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,040
Again, I'm creating the employee,

135
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,320
but this time I'm going to use slower

136
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,560
shock. No, no, no.

137
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,880
I'm just copying this part.

138
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,480
I could have copy pasted also,
but I'm typing so that you guys can see.

139
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,760
Okay, so now

140
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,000
first for Turner Case
with the given keyword

141
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
first header API cons

142
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,560
contain date
and the value is obtained back

143
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,480
after this.

144
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,800
Another header is guys,
what is another header?

145
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,520
We can try API constant start

146
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,920
header for authorization

147
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,120
and then the value of authorization

148
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
we are taking from which plus from

149
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,240
generate token steps are broken

150
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,360
down to confirm this.

151
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,400
Now here, here we need to provide body
because we are going

152
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,960
to create the employee.

153
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,200
So here we are going to create the body,

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,600
this body, whatever the body,
I'm going to provide it.

155
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,760
We just put it like this.

156
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,760
As of now,
I'm not doing anything because first

157
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:18,600
I have to make the body.

158
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,520
So now, now if you see,
I go here in my payload constricts

159
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,080
So far
I created this particular method, right?

160
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,840
I created this method.

161
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,120
So I provided this particular part
as a normal string.

162
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,640
You see, basically, you see this
aggravated normally the string.

163
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
This time I'm seeing, I am seeing
I don't want to pass this string

164
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,000
because I have JSON
so I can provide my head just an object.

165
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,280
All the vendors, all the vendors.

166
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,880
So the format should not be this much.

167
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,160
If you took the form
which would be very easy.

168
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,760
And what is there for me? Right.

169
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to a public

170
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,720
static method of this grade.

171
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,560
Static method.

172
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,680
I'm c to create, deploy, or D

173
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,480
system by mistake.

174
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,440
And because this method
is also going to return this train.

175
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,680
So I'm going to write the string

176
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,320
because all of the values I'm having,
it all are in the string, right?

177
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,160
So let's see how I write.

178
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,560
I have to write first here.

179
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,080
Jason

180
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,240
Object.

181
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,200
Jason Object

182
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,360
object is equals to nil

183
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,600
is an object

184
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,840
based.

185
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
This is not Jason.

186
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,040
We have already used.

187
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,400
We have already added right enough.

188
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,800
I'm not exempt by remember were

189
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,000
I remember or not.

190
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,640
But are you guys following me as of now?

191
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,160
Fine. So here, here I'm going to write.

192
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,920
See, there's this JSON object
whenever we use the JSON language.

193
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,920
So tell me in just a language,
we pass the values in which one

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,120
is know that the structure is

195
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,480
not satisfying.

196
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,960
In JSON,
we pass values in which what is this?

197
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,480
Yes. Maps key
and then you got a key and value, right?

198
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,560
So what is the method
to add the value in this particular map?

199
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,760
So this object is the map.

200
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,000
So what is the method to add the value

201
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,000
map going to put?

202
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,640
C, it is asking for key and value
book, correct?

203
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,160
It is.

204
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,360
It is asking for both D and value
because both are a string.

205
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
So here d we can provide from

206
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,480
right based.

207
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,600
We can provide a key from here.

208
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,160
Let's provide the key and the value
I can provide from here.

209
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Let's see, the value is

210
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,680
what?

211
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,160
Again, all we did to put

212
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:35,680
in the second key would be my employ.

213
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,320
Last name, common value would be my

214
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,160
doctor

215
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,840
object or put

216
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,760
within,

217
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,240
but it would be my name. It's

218
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:40,800
object.

219
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,600
We should put

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,040
right case.

221
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,840
So it is returning me one JSON object.

222
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,200
It is returning.

223
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
You want one? Just an object.

224
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,720
So to convert any object to a string,
what is the method?

225
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,720
It is returning with this object.

226
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,360
Now delegates which metrolite call dart

227
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,960
goose not do string.

228
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,160
So what this method does,
this particular method will return

229
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,400
one JSON object in a string format where

230
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,440
I'm having all of these values,

231
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,960
but I'm having all of this values.

232
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,720
Is this clear?

233
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,600
And despite

234
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,360
to do one, please take it.

235
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,320
Please write it.

236
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,720
Everyone.

237
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:45,360
Once everyone is done with it.

238
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,480
All right, well, that's great.

239
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,080
It's time they think of this
once they are done.

240
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,320
Otherwise, if they fall behind, it's
very hard for them to follow.

241
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,200
Thanks, but

242
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,880
can you please be sure?

243
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:24,640
Make sure 77

244
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,120
can be a bit true for a second.

245
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,680
Is API workflow or feature API.

246
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
But because

247
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,440
the steps.

248
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,720
Okay, from

249
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,320
there you

250
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,760
here we are going to write.

251
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,040
We didn't write anything yet
so we are going to write now.

252
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,120
So guys, buddy, we have created language.

253
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,240
We use creative when we use opposed
one note.

254
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,560
These are two different approaches.

255
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,200
You should be having multiple features
to try when you work in the industry.

256
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,960
We cannot stick to one particular
approach, right?

257
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,400
That's why

258
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
we are providing you multiple approaches
and then you can do this or do that.

259
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,680
To do that, great.

260
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:39,000
If you provide, it shows diversity
in your experience, one or the other,

261
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,840
multiple features to play

262
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,720
fine.

263
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,640
So now here I'm going to write API payload
constants,

264
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,160
start, create, employ body using Jason.

265
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,280
So this time here
I was calling normal body.

266
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,560
Normal body here
I'm calling my Jason body.

267
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,040
Can you see guys

268
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,080
get I'm calling my somebody cut it

269
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,040
now rest of the things
the rest of the things if you see

270
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,360
a list of all these steps are same list
all this gives us

271
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,080
is this correct enemy

272
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,440
list thunderstorms are seen.

273
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:33,360
Is it is it going to affect?

274
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,480
No. Great.

275
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,160
Because it is just a different way
of passing the data.

276
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,760
But the operation is
anything is going to be see,

277
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,920
it's the operation is team correct?

278
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,200
Correct.

279
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,280
The students

280
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,280
fine.

281
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,560
So now this time, this time
when I'm done with my feature, finally,

282
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,280
when I'm done with my build constraints,
which I created here, write this part.

283
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,320
And then

284
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,920
after this, when I'm

285
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,360
done, my API workflow steps,

286
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,280
which is available here, right,

287
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,040
then what I can do simply
I should go in appearance.

288
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,320
I will run this particular
once in any fine.

289
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:36,720
So this one, working by any

290
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,360
given object, is prepared

291
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,240
for creating an employ
by a adjacent build.

292
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,640
So this time I'm using Jason below.

293
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,600
Post call is made to zero one verify right
employed created convinced message

294
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,400
employed created in value both matches
we got this employ 80

295
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,520
and this employed is also stored
as a global variable.

296
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,960
Right.
Everything is working final one guys.

297
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,600
Tell me

298
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,640
everything is working fine.

299
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:18,360
Nice.

300
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,720
Now let's look at the code.

301
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,240
We actually thought we

302
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,360
panicked and before

303
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,280
every single request it is generating
automatically and capturing this.

304
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
We are using this
for all kind of a request.

305
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,720
So now see guys,

306
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,720
first way we posited industry involvement
in the multi metatrader method.

307
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,520
We called thinking to be repository
data from data people.

308
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,560
How do we we parsed the data

309
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,920
for creating an employee via JSON object.

310
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,200
No thought we

311
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,600
like two approaches here.

312
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,640
I showed from the API perspective.

313
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,800
One approach I showed that is like
detectable from the perspective, right?

314
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,960
So this is not just
just if I were just one way from kicking,

315
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,880
but we should have to this particular
by to break from the Google participant.

316
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,480
So let's do it.

317
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,320
I'm going to write this scenario, right?

318
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,640
I'm going to write this scenario
workflow part right workflow part

319
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,440
in this one, right employee ID
and everything creates contains.

320
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,800
Fine. Let's take this scenario again.

321
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,320
It doesn't matter

322
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,080
whether you are calling this data
from your

323
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,280
first part or second part
anyway, we are going to change it now.

324
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,760
So how are we going to change scene?

325
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,640
I'm going to let here write to make

326
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,760
to make this particular part more dynamic

327
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,040
when I'm seeing more dynamics
to how first to admit ideas and ideas.

328
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,120
So I'm going to write my scenarios, create

329
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,600
I need, I need

330
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,840
better make it

331
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,920
even given.

332
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,800
Okay, see, this is interesting, but given

333
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,520
our request

334
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,640
is prepared for

335
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,760
creating

336
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,680
and employ

337
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,680
creating an employee with

338
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,320
dynamic data.

339
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,400
So guys see how I can foster dynamic data.

340
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,600
The only thing you need to take care of
is the format of posting that indictments.

341
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,240
First name, middle name, last name.

342
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,840
Don't fasten gender.

343
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,520
No forced otherwise in your
first name it is male and

344
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,480
female.

345
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,240
Don't do this right.

346
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
We need to make sure.

347
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,080
We need to make sure
which part we are calling one

348
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,600
by one based upon a generic
creating the employee here you see.

349
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Right.
So what? All are the things we need?

350
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,920
We need first name, last name,
middle name,

351
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,680
gender, birthdate, status, job data.

352
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,560
We need all these things face.

353
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,560
We need all these
things are not for creating the employee.

354
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,840
So now,
now we can pause this data on drink time.

355
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,920
We should not store these things
in our API payload.

356
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,520
Constance Right.

357
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,160
So you mean the sequence minded?

358
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,520
Yes. Sequence maker.

359
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,480
Not here where I tell you that.

360
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,360
Don't worry, I need it.

361
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,360
So first firstly, I'm

362
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,080
going to provide my force
to be as business.

363
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,000
Now see you guys how things work.

364
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,280
Remember, we passed the values

365
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,600
in our scenario itself when we were using

366
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,640
when we are using the killer, like

367
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,560
remember this part of not everyone?

368
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,200
And the second one I would put is

369
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,280
so the third one is the last name.

370
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,440
So I'm going to put this Mike

371
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,400
after Mike,
what is the next thing We have?

372
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,560
Gender.

373
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,720
So gender in for men
because Dennis surrogate

374
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,640
Mike all three are men
according to my understanding point

375
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,840
Now here are

376
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,880
there is no surety for anything nowadays,

377
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,680
but so I'm going to write in

378
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,680
1212 2018
it is both name, last name and then.

379
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,480
Really? Yes. Correct.

380
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,200
Correct.

381
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,720
First name, last name and middle name.

382
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,240
Then your gender.

383
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,520
Then your date of birth after the birth.

384
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,560
Next thing is your employee status.

385
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,480
So I'm saying it is employee.

386
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,600
And then the next thing is your job title.

387
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,920
So I will say you

388
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,040
guys now see this part clear to everyone.

389
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,800
These are the things we provide
generally in the body.

390
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,720
Now I'm providing it in any, you know,

391
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,080
scenario, any issue in this part.

392
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,720
Anyone

393
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,040
let me write it the segment.

394
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,240
So this should remind you that dynamic

395
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,440
to generate the step for us
to see how these things work,

396
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,000
this thing work
to generate the step for us.

397
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,560
I have to go in API and

398
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,080
I have to change this to dynamic

399
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,560
and then I will make it to true.

400
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,720
Now let's run this part,

401
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,120
this one, this part.

402
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,040
Congratulations.

403
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,560
Because this is a

404
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,880
copy this time here,

405
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,400
change it to false again, go to API, work

406
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,880
a step and here in the end simply it is

407
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,800
simply write this one

408
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,160
now. Now if you see

409
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,920
here, what is the next thing we have to do

410
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,800
was to remove this code.

411
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,840
Now Seagate,
it is asking for so many strings.

412
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,680
And you see you guys

413
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,040
see a string string,
two, three, four, five, six, seven.

414
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Right.

415
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,480
So make sure at which point you provided
which is string.

416
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,520
For example, here you provided what

417
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,000
you provided, what the theme

418
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
beat underscore or

419
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,640
forced me.

420
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,400
I'm providing the argument
in the second one you provided here.

421
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,400
The underscore last name

422
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:05,080
in the third one is EMV underscore.

423
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,680
Right?

424
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,280
And then you provided here,
it would be your guys.

425
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,640
What was the fourth thing?

426
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,920
First name, last name, middle name.

427
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,880
And then

428
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,480
gender.

429
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,920
What what would happen
if I did not work here?

430
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:35,280
Then what would happen?

431
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,600
Not for any database.

432
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,800
Not one of the data will come,
but it will hand it right.

433
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,400
Your gender will be handling
your date of birth,

434
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,920
or your date of birth
will be handled in your gender. One

435
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,840
Right

436
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,720
How Arguments Spouse Goes
The first argument will take

437
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,680
which value the first argument first name,
which venue?

438
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,920
First venue second
which venue would we take? Lugo

439
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,800
This argument we take
which will do first venue.

440
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,120
So if you provide the male here,
if you provide gender here,

441
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,880
then what would happen?

442
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,160
Then your gender become like.

443
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,720
If you provide data, what then?

444
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,560
What would happen?

445
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,440
You don't want to become venues, right?

446
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,680
So please take care of this part

447
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
after gender.

448
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,520
That is next thing would be have to
provide is E and B underscore

449
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,360
would be in there scalability

450
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,280
and then we need e and be underscore

451
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,440
and next thing is status
which is status jobs to this correct.

452
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,040
Okay.

453
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,280
Let me split it.

454
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,720
Explore this part. Also

455
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,840
let this part also.

456
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,560
So next thing is E and B

457
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,080
underscore we need is

458
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,440
the job

459
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,560
guys see I'm handling all seven

460
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,520
you all 17 correct.

461
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,880
Correct case

462
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,480
I'm handling all those.

463
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,000
So now now in the multi in the body
how I'm going to write this

464
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,200
that is very important in the body first

465
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,800
first
we have to make a method for this right.

466
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,080
So how we make a method for this part,
that's what we need to understand.

467
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Let's go to the body.

468
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,840
It is the body API payload

469
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,240
constants are two bodies
we have already created.

470
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,600
Initialize

471
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,680
to what is we have already created.

472
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,000
After this I'm creating yet another part

473
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,080
I'm seeing this

474
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,240
public

475
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,280
static which returns this spring.

476
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,200
It is a b load

477
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,560
more than me, b load more dynamic.

478
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,320
But here here what I'm going to do see

479
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,600
using the same JSON object,

480
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,280
using the same this an object you see

481
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,440
the same JSON object I'm using here,

482
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,320
but but I am parsing the string,
the parameters

483
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,440
so the string should be mine and beat

484
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,440
underscored was.

485
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,960
And this part, this part

486
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm going to pass.

487
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,760
It makes sense.

488
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,640
Makes sense. Guys.

489
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,800
What I'm doing.

490
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,360
Guys make sense what I'm doing.

491
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,120
So now let me quickly copy this
things from here.

492
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,960
First

493
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:49,240
is to give,

494
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,080
finalize

495
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,920
C status with status Job
title will go in the job

496
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,600
title, gender will go into gender mode,
they will go into body.

497
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,240
So everything I detail what we are
passing from a feature

498
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,520
by the same detail
should be filled in this particular part.

499
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,480
This students
should be free in this particular part.

500
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,920
Right.

501
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,160
Right.

502
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,880
Based

503
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,680
point.

504
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,760
Now I will go in my workflow steps

505
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,560
where
I have to write this particular steps

506
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,240
so guys see how to prepare the request
for creating the employed.

507
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,680
Simple request is equals to

508
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
given days.

509
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,720
What is the next thing you have to write
given now without looking at the code?

510
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,480
Tell me, given that.

511
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
Come on, stop writing.

512
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,720
Tell me now. Here.

513
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,720
First we are going to make the request

514
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,440
title,

515
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
which I get

516
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,640
first, which ends

517
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,160
PPA constants Dark

518
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,280
Radar

519
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,400
on the date
and the value is also from API.

520
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,000
Constants don't contain the

521
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,160
not another header

522
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,960
API constants don't

523
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,240
for authorization comma value

524
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,160
values coming from my token

525
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,360
not grace.

526
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:10,360
What is the next thing?

527
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,640
Not that body that is

528
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,720
right.

529
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,360
Next thing is body.

530
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,440
So now now in body.

531
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,920
This time
I will call an API below to consider.

532
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,400
It's not which body below
the more dynamic see

533
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,440
it is asking to pass.

534
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,640
It is asking to pass all with a string one
by one.

535
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,360
Correct? Correct.

536
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,720
All the data.

537
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,280
So fine
column was basically and B hostname

538
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,680
comma and B

539
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,440
last name comma MP.

540
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,880
Now MP

541
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,320
after first name, last name, middle name.

542
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,760
Then we need

543
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,600
gender

544
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,120
mark after gender, we need the MP

545
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,240
body Gomer.

546
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,680
Then we need MP

547
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,640
status comma,

548
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,840
then we need MP operator.

549
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,800
Right. And

550
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,440
let's see how many.

551
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,800
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, three.

552
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:35,240
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

553
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,600
So far.

554
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:53,520
So what do we want?

555
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,600
And then just on the part again,
same verification, validation,

556
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,240
everything we can write here.

557
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,280
But right now

558
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,680
I'm going to show you just simple
this request how request is coming, right?

559
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,080
So the request, whatever

560
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,160
the request will be right,
or even if you want to see response.

561
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,800
Also no issues
simply write response is equals to

562
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,000
request or

563
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,880
when door.

564
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,760
The data that we provided in beta file
protected was just

565
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,200
the name of the state. Oh.

566
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:40,880
Which when you're talking
I didn't get that.

567
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,800
This is
this is the method name inside method.

568
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,000
We used to use an object
India some object.

569
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,120
We are providing the key and the value
we're passing in the value

570
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,160
we are passing from this particular part
on right

571
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,240
already.

572
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,880
And then simply,
once we get this data from here,

573
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,080
we can simply verify
based on the values like this

574
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,080
being.

575
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,560
Can someone be sure this method

576
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,680
let's can

577
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,000
someone please share this particular
method

578
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:37,960
with an X?

579
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:50,280
So you guys in this part,
is there anyone who has any question

580
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,400
in this particular part
how we made this law?

581
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,880
The more dynamic any question in this

582
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,200
is a we want done with

583
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:35,280
writing this particular part, like

584
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,480
should we execute this? Not

585
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,600
perfect.

586
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,320
It's going to be at an edge.

587
00:38:49,320 --> 00:39:22,480
This is fine.

588
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,560
Finally, one,

589
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,040
if you want to see what is the response
we got right.

590
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,200
So no shoes

591
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,240
will go here, right?

592
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,640
Well, making the post code go inside this

593
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,080
and simply
we will write here responds door

594
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,000
to print.

595
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,440
So pretty print will always will

596
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,480
always print

597
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,720
a value which we are looking forward to.

598
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,120
Mine says 200.

599
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,080
Okay.

600
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,800
In which point you're making us check that

601
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,680
nasty case.

602
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,600
Is this the value we provided
then is Mike So again

603
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,680
the similar to work and employed
job better and status?

604
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,040
Is this the same?

605
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,760
We provided another feature find correct
so it means correctly the

606
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,760
days passing this

607
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,440
right.

608
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,560
It is taking their data
from our feature file.

609
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,240
In another scenario
it is taking the data from what?

610
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,400
Just an object.

611
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,120
In one more scenario,
it was taking the data

612
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,800
from our normal data table
and in for the scenario,

613
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,800
it was taking the data
from normal method in extreme point.

614
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,880
So we have seen for
we is now trying to create the employs

615
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,720
the same way you can get the employee,
retrieve the employer,

616
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,120
you can do
whatever you want to do, right? Correct.

617
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,360
So now just just want to show you
one small scenario here. Now,

618
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,120
another scenario really is one
very simple one.

619
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,440
I'm going to show you

620
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,040
three different in a post code, right?

621
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,880
Yes. Yes.

622
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,080
Because in most call after hitting the end
point, we are getting the response.

623
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,560
Some pretty prints, implements
receiving the response.

624
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,880
So after hitting the point
of leaving the post code,

625
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,240
we can get the response the moment we got
the response was to detect the student

626
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,600
the least understood

627
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:50,720
this point.

628
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,360
Now let me ask one thing next.

629
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,000
Creating the employee

630
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,080
and updating the employee.

631
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,680
So these are same scenarios

632
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,640
or different scenarios.

633
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,840
Different scenarios might be possible
that I'm generating the employee.

634
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,000
A new embroidery is fine, but it struck
When you do that, I have to update

635
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,800
the details of this only employee
which I just generated or created.

636
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,600
Grade might be possible.

637
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,800
I have two of the details of the employee.

638
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,480
Great.

639
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,800
Which is something else.

640
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,360
Simply to update the details.

641
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,840
We have to rely on one
specific information right.

642
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,440
And that information is unique, correct?

643
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,560
So we have to parse that information
like this one

644
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,520
example my employ 80.

645
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,800
So when we pass the employer,
we pass this data.

646
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,760
Where we pass this data

647
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,680
in order to

648
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,360
update the information
we have seen trigger document.

649
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,200
So the document sees
you have to pass this data.

650
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,720
We're

651
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,440
in method No, Alex, the initial

652
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,080
yes in body of the bus
just to see this document.

653
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:20,880
Right.

654
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,840
And inspect the document,
you would find a difference in the body,

655
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,560
a difference in the body of the employee

656
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,560
and all of the employee.

657
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,840
What is the difference?

658
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,960
Their difference is in one body, employee

659
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,360
ID is mandatory.

660
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,920
Employee 80 is mandatory.

661
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,960
Interpreting the correct.

662
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,200
So now, now let's do this.

663
00:43:48,640 --> 00:44:01,480
Okay, let's do this first.

664
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,600
So now you sent me

665
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,720
here.

666
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,920
Oh, come on, keep.

667
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,800
Recently
we created one particular employee here.

668
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,320
See, this is the employer. But is that.

669
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,400
This is the employer? Correct?

670
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,280
It's. Copy this.

671
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,440
And can you show your API constant?

672
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,840
Sure, Why not?

673
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,800
This is my

674
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:39,400
API Constants.

675
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,200
EPA payroll constant.

676
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,480
Fine. So

677
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,840
shall we proceed further?

678
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:33,600
And this.

679
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,760
So first.

680
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,560
First, let's make the body right
for updating the employee.

681
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,360
Let's make the body
for updating the employee.

682
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,640
If we put it here,
this and I'm going to use

683
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,440
I'm going to use this same object here.

684
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,280
I'm saying here

685
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,320
update

686
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:01,240
employee body cutting,
update employee body.

687
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,600
Right.

688
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,040
And this part, this part
I'm not going to use from here. See?

689
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,080
Audience would

690
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:17,800
right

691
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,400
now, guys, what is the difference here?

692
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,680
The one thing I have to add,
which is a part of my body,

693
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,080
which is a mandatory part of my body,
I should see is

694
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,000
raised and me, what is the mandatory part?

695
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,760
One more thing is here in this body,
we have to change one thing.

696
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,720
What is that?

697
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:47,600
What happened to this?

698
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,720
What is my consumables

699
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,640
output

700
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,080
file?

701
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,720
So not Friday.

702
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,560
All we did not put This should be my

703
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,600
employee I.D.

704
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,280
karma.

705
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,400
This should be my value.

706
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,000
Correct? Is this correct?

707
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,440
Okay, so I'm going to update my value
against this particular user.

708
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,560
Is this one is this one Fine.

709
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,120
So now let's write one scenario.

710
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,000
My body is ready now, right?

711
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,560
This body is for updating the employee
with the body details.

712
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
So to specify one particular information,
one particular entry.

713
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,360
Right.

714
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,760
We have to use this particular part.

715
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,920
So let's go ahead and do it now.

716
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,760
So here I'm going to go and write
another scenario.

717
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,960
My system basically needs restart.

718
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,320
Now you can see 19 date is working.

719
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:44,320
The idea is running on low memory.

720
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,000
I need to close something up.

721
00:48:46,000 --> 00:49:09,120
Let me close this part.

722
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:09,520
Okay.

723
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm feeling okay.

724
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,440
Fine.

725
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,560
So now, after this, after this, I'm
going to write another scenario.

726
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,200
Giving

727
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,160
scenario is

728
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,120
a updating the employee

729
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,280
saying

730
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,160
write

731
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,280
my case.

732
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,080
So I'm going to a given.

733
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,680
Given a request is

734
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,720
for updating the

735
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,360
existing

736
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,800
details.

737
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,640
So then

738
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,360
call is made

739
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,040
to the employee.

740
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,040
Then what would happen is

741
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,040
there's what should be the status called

742
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:13,080
I should get from here.

743
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,560
Update the employee.

744
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:20,240
Then the status would for

745
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,040
you being an

746
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,200
should be 200

747
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,120
200. Right.

748
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,800
So now let me right here.

749
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,560
It says

750
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,880
update employee

751
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,480
it's take this part going to render

752
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,560
provide this here

753
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,280
is equals to date okay

754
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,480
my typing must be

755
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,920
right and right

756
00:51:44,200 --> 00:52:06,480
my next bullet complete this to everyone
and everyone completes.

757
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,560
Then once

758
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,720
for to start morning.

759
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,280
It's evening.

760
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:31,080
Getting a DNA in the morning.

761
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,760
They don't come here in the evening
like it's already 930 by night,

762
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,520
not even evening.

763
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,440
So they come like 7 a.m.

764
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,760
in the morning, 7:30 a.m.

765
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,240
in the morning.

766
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,840
That's when these are times that

767
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,520
daylight saving is over. But

768
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,200
if big if become twice,

769
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,760
it means someone is in trouble
because they never double check.

770
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,040
And if they're double checking,
it means they're going to get someone

771
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:09,840
put into the hospital.

772
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,920
Days delayed saving
say gains are being modified

773
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,000
really great

774
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,040
in March 2nd week first week global

775
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,640
it's 13th

776
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,720
13th of March golfing.

777
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,120
Yes I can work off my trade bill

778
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:45,120
second week of November current.

779
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,920
We don't even we don't have delayed saving
but we have to adjust our timings rate

780
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,160
according to the US. Timing.

781
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,440
Next I'm asking.

782
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,800
Currently
I'm taking session from 5:30 a.m.

783
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,800
in the morning after daylight saving.

784
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,080
I could make the shift from fourth
b m in the morning.

785
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,640
Sketty

786
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,440
next weekend.

787
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,360
We don't have plans, right?

788
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,200
I don't know. That's
but I really don't know Even better.

789
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,920
It started better, to be honest.

790
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,720
All people have, but.

791
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,520
All right, fine.

792
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,040
So let's execute this part.

793
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,680
Let's execute this part

794
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,280
and someone share the upgrade
employee body method.

795
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,480
Jimmy, you see here

796
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,040
you can, right?

797
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,320
You know, just I'm giving you by
you can read

798
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,480
done fine.

799
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,880
It's good to pay at any cost.

800
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,520
Generate the steps

801
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,680
we go to this three steps.

802
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,120
Copy this

803
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,480
going to API workflow steps

804
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,360
here after this part

805
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,520
I'm going to write this three steps on.

806
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,160
Fine.

807
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,920
So now to prepare request.

808
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,040
First, today's fundamental reason
for preparing the request

809
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,480
or it is different

810
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,520
reason for automate for preparing

811
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,680
the request would be similar Mark
because because you are is equal to Ms.

812
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,800
you are in. So it would be seen

813
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,880
not only thing, the only thing
we would be changing here is

814
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,960
I'm going to write read

815
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,880
something to find.

816
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,840
The only thing I'm going to write
is in body.

817
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,880
I'm going to provide API below

818
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,840
the constant start of employment

819
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,960
of employee body.

820
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,920
This is the only thing I change
the method, otherwise the rest all are.

821
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,440
The things are same here.

822
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,960
If you see the all are that
these are see if you see this

823
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,720
clearly one

824
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,760
Now here I'm going to write

825
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,720
this particular write response I need.

826
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:15,400
So for response I have to write a request
for hitting the end point.

827
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,280
Which keyword this

828
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,400
or hitting the end point

829
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,560
which keyword know

830
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,000
yes when

831
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,240
bent to perform action
in order to pick the end point.

832
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,360
No rejection.

833
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:40,920
We are going to provide date, get

834
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,680
to update the employ we need put

835
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,000
we need input.

836
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,760
And here I'm going to write from API.

837
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:57,240
Constance dog of date employee you want to

838
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:02,720
update employee you are.

839
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:12,720
Is this correct?

840
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,200
So now from the response from the response

841
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,160
which I'm getting, I'm
going to perform verification.

842
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,840
So for verification,
which we're going to use,

843
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,360
then start a circuit

844
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,920
board status, put on 200

845
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,320
clear, always,

846
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,440
always done is always
because I used to ask them questions

847
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,920
when I was in college,
even in my organization.

848
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,440
Also, I used to ask questions like day

849
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,640
in music, the response is equal to return.

850
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,160
Yes, you can call this
because this is just a variable name rate.

851
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,320
You can provide variable
anything but that.

852
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,040
The response with the computer,
all you provide should be positive.

853
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,400
But for this to
the supporting student is to

854
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,960
sorry my rate

855
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,080
by now

856
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,120
because we have already passed it
in each of my

857
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,600
actions. Similar.

858
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
Yeah, action would be similar.

859
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:24,160
Action is similar.

860
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:24,680
Fine.

861
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,320
Okay. So far.

862
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,600
So what these three methods,

863
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,480
these three steps clear to everyone.

864
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:36,440
There is nothing like rocket science,
which we are really even.

865
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,720
I know that's the question.

866
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:40,520
And the operation is very small
and very little.

867
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,440
But still I'm asking again and again.

868
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,440
I even I know what we are doing simply
we are updating

869
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,600
one particular part
we have to change in detail to

870
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,640
and if you want you again,
if you don't want, don't

871
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,920
even if you do this
right, it's not going to affect

872
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,480
because optional trait

873
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,160
fine.

874
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,880
Anyone has any confusion,
any question in this

875
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
good guys should

876
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,240
we proceed further in executing

877
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,120
let's go ahead in our people and apart

878
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,120
from here, let's try it
and then sequence to false

879
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:57,720
and execute this.

880
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,120
Why not now? Please ask.

881
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,640
Please ask me. You go based it executed.

882
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,520
We have updated the details.

883
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,640
The employers right

884
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,080
And this

885
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,760
now further verification

886
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,640
very different Yeah so please check
was distracted the complete employed to

887
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:23,120
which employee you made If you check Asia
in our API payroll constraints

888
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,160
we provide that specific entry in our body

889
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,920
of these check rate of in your body
what you are working

890
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,680
because already only happen
when you are providing wrong.

891
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,960
So please check that

892
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,080
he didn't to employees then I think

893
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,840
this by forced

894
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,920
we created the data
and from there I provided this

895
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:16,680
gunning.

896
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,080
Wow got an employee to complete.

897
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,040
Could be a copy paste.

898
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,000
Edit even if it is a part that also
it can be a past.

899
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,360
But what that opinion is,
is waiting around.

900
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:32,400
But what any point or any piece you want
or even a simple matter to click there.

901
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,080
Also.

902
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:35,760
All right.

903
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:41,120
Student So now if you see here in this API
workflow feature, we have provided

904
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:46,200
updated employee passing data
from multiple different employees, right?

905
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,560
Providing data from Jason From data table
from normal part, right?

906
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,760
So it automatically generating same day.

907
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,520
We are getting the information,
also retrieving the data.

908
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,680
Correct.

909
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,680
And it describes

910
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,280
it. We first commit the code
which we have developed

911
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:05,800
so far

912
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,240
for handling the data dynamic exit sheet.

913
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,480
Remember,
we already have the code for sent to me,

914
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,040
but we already have a

915
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:27,120
code for the exam.

916
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,520
So from there, from that particular
method, we have to go in

917
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,360
and we have to handle the keys
and then use right

918
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,960
is released. Yes.

919
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:47,320
The updated code
has been pushed to the repository.

920
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,320
Right guys?

921
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,480
All right. So now,

922
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,840
now here, here

923
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,280
let me write that

924
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,400
and right,

925
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:08,800
we are done.
