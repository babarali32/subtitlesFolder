1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,200
All right,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,000
So from here, guys, we are going to start.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,120
Yes, I already started.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,880
It started already.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,240
So now for the class

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
to let me open our notes

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,320
first,
we will quickly recap all of the concepts

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,960
which we have learned yesterday,
and then we will proceed further

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,200
with the new concepts, with the new topics
which we have today.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,520
What are the remaining attributes of this
distance you are going to learn today?

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:51,720
We will going to work on all of this
things one by one, by.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,320
Okay guys.

13
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,120
So first, what is test engine?

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,640
Currently we are learning testing visa.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,800
Yes, this is our tool

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,280
and framework, which is based on

17
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,720
annotations.

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,480
Correct

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,720
categories.

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,040
Right now we are learning test

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,880
and as a tool we are not learning
testing as a framework as of now.

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,360
Right.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,240
So this is just a tool
which we are learning right now.

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,160
We will definitely implement
the framework part also, but right now

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,560
we are learning it as
a tool. I remember this case

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,880
by now after this interest in D as a tool.

27
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,920
If we are using,
why are we using test engine?

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,640
This is extremely important to understand

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,200
guys.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,080
Why are we using test and

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,600
when it comes to automation
of the best application,

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,680
we already have selenium
when it comes to programing language.

33
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,440
We have Java with us, so to me
all the setup is there.

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,720
Then why do we need testing?

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,480
Yes, to make our life easier.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,800
It provides

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,600
multiple options

38
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,520
for execution,

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,080
which can be

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,160
integrated

41
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,000
easily

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,320
with the name You write,

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,000
for example, on post condition
preconditions.

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,840
Right.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,760
Enable and disable priorities.

46
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,320
So these are the customizations
and multiple options

47
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,960
for the execution list and duplicates.

48
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,720
We can simply integrate
all of this things with ADD

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,440
in selenium,
the code which we are writing.

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,760
Still,
we are writing this code in selenium.

51
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,720
All right. The methods we are using

52
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,880
static, correct?

53
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,520
Right.

54
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,120
So do have some integrated option
to advanced features.

55
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,720
Right.

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,640
In order to utilize all of those advanced
features, we need this synergy by.

57
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,920
Let's talk about the loopholes.

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,360
First, I am writing without testing.

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,440
Without testing G.

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,000
No priority is available.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No priority for execution

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
sequence. Right.

63
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,960
Earlier, we had to execute
all the test cases in a single shot.

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,160
Right.

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,880
In one class, if I'm executing,
I was able to execute the whole class,

66
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,640
but I didn't have any option
to execute the things

67
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,040
the way I want it to execute right.

68
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,760
But then testing did came in. Testing.

69
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,760
This is if you have different test cases
you can better case

70
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,200
all of those test cases
so you can maintain

71
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,200
the sequence of execution
according to your wish,

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,080
according to your choice,
according to your requirement,

73
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
you can maintain
the sequence of execution.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,920
That's what you can do in this, Right.

75
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,640
So without testing, you wouldn't have
any priority for the execution sequence.

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:05:04,880
Second thing,

77
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,520
no way to exclude kits

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,440
from execution.

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,800
Earlier, we didn't have any option through

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,840
which we can exclude artists together
include artist guest.

81
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,200
Now we can have this
or we have this option.

82
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,840
Why? Question What is that option?

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,600
Enable and disable option.

84
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,280
Right.

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Starting

86
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,720
no reporting structure.

87
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,680
We were just executing the things,

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,880
but we were not getting any any report
right.

89
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,920
We were not getting the total time
it took for the execution.

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
How many?

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,000
This we have executed,
how many files we have executed.

92
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,640
What is the result?
How many test cases buzzed?

93
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,800
How many test kits?

94
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,080
This will eliminate test
because this to skip.

95
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,080
We did not have any kind of arrangement

96
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,120
in selenium
to get these kind of detailed reports.

97
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,520
But now when it comes to test
and even we have implemented

98
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,800
all of this fast indexed
and we got this facility, we got this

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,680
feature through which we can get
this kind of detailed report,

100
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,800
right.

101
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,880
That's why without test we wouldn't

102
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,720
all of the things with test in GB,
you have all these things.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
So far we learned this thing, right?

104
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,320
I'm not taking a session right now
because the session part is still pending,

105
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:26,960
right?

106
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,880
Half of the sessions
with video study off of the session.

107
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,520
We will completely know
one by one will see

108
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
and direct test annotation.

109
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,920
Then with days.

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,840
What kind of annotation is this?

111
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,520
So today's

112
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,920
execute test cases

113
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,720
we must write.

114
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,600
Our method are method

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,640
with the test annotation.

116
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,840
Correct.

117
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,360
If I'm going to write any method,

118
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,080
if I'm going to write any method
without a direct test annotation,

119
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,000
I will not be able to execute
that particular test.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,720
Guess.

121
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,080
So at the request, annotation
is the most important annotation

122
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,400
in our entire test tool
as well as interest and depend.

123
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,840
But remember whether we are talking about
code or we are talking about framework.

124
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,200
Our main goal is execution
and for execution we always need this.

125
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,360
A direct test annotation near

126
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,240
word.

127
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Please ask What

128
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,080
do I need to?

129
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,920
What should I repeat?

130
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,400
Okay, fine.

131
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,520
Got to. All right.

132
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,520
So without a direct test,
if you are writing any method

133
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,400
and if you try to execute
when you'll be able to execute that method

134
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,600
or that particular test, guess
which doesn't have this direct annotation.

135
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,880
Can we do that? No.

136
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,480
Second thing,
because we're using a direct test

137
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,400
annotation, so are all of our
methods are annotated methods, right?

138
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,120
Because we are using annotated methods
here or execution with iterate test

139
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,160
annotation, we will not use the method
for our execution.

140
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,680
Correct.

141
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,600
Second thing is we will not use Mende
method for our execution

142
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:14,640
because we have a direct test annotation
here.

143
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,320
Right.

144
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,880
We will
we will discuss on this point also.

145
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,400
Now it's like anything else,
how many at the latest annotation

146
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:32,440
we can have in one class, meaning write

147
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,560
as many as we want according
to the requirement one to infinity.

148
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,520
Correct. Great.

149
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,400
You must have learned this range
for right?

150
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,720
Quite good.

151
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,600
In school.

152
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,720
Grade one to infinity. Okay.

153
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,400
As many situations,
as many numbers as we want,

154
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,200
we can write this at the latest annotation
with methods in one class.

155
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
According to article, we correct

156
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,320
less at least one
we should have In order to execute more.

157
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,440
We can have as many as we want right now.

158
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,320
After this.

159
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,320
If I had some methods,
if I had some method to request annotation

160
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,240
and some methods without it
that it just annotation,

161
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:25,680
would it work?

162
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,960
Okay, class will execute,
but only those methods that execute

163
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,000
that have the request annotation part.

164
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,120
Right.

165
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,520
That categorized then let's talk about

166
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,800
it will only execute that test right

167
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,600
before method.

168
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
What is this guys?

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,240
Before method is also one annotation.

170
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,320
We learned yesterday

171
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,560
fine.

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,640
It executes before

173
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:18,840
any test or before every test.

174
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,400
Before each test.

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,040
Before

176
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,360
for each as a precondition.

177
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,240
We can also call it precondition.

178
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,960
Can we call it precondition or not?

179
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,920
Yes, we can call it precondition.

180
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,520
If you remember, we put our code
for launching the browser, right?

181
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,720
Launching the browser before that code
and also navigating to your end.

182
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,760
We put that code in before method, iterate
before method.

183
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,200
Great annotation. Why?

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,640
Because that was our precondition.

185
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,480
That was a precondition.

186
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,720
Remember, guys, this part,
let me show you.

187
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,880
If you go inside, the logic is right here.

188
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
If Sydney read it before method,
we have used

189
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,840
this annotation to launch our browser
and to navigate.

190
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,440
And you are right,
this was our precondition.

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
So we put it inside of precondition for

192
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,280
now. Let's go ahead

193
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,680
as a precondition.

194
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,680
If I have been tests,
this precondition will execute 14 times.

195
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,720
If I have to be intense, executes
for 15 times before

196
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,400
all the test case is right,
then the next one was after method, right?

197
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,920
We extended that also after method.

198
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:52,800
How we can call this part automatic.

199
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,960
Right? It executes.

200
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,080
It executes

201
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,840
after

202
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,680
every test

203
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,360
as opposed to condition.

204
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Right.

205
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,440
This is at my post condition.

206
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,600
So after every test, yes.

207
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,200
If I come across any requirement
which I need to execute

208
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,960
after every single test,
guess what I will do?

209
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,640
I will put all of those code,
those pieces of code

210
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,360
inside my iterate after method annotation.

211
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,440
Right.

212
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,400
So it will execute

213
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,560
after every single method
which is having this request.

214
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,280
And if they should clear

215
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,200
now after that

216
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
and then before class,

217
00:13:48,200 --> 00:14:07,840
what is it?

218
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,080
Just the one it executes before class.
Okay.

219
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,920
Let me ask one question here.

220
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,800
Let's say I have two classes, right?

221
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Logic based and best in class.

222
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,880
This two class and I put this day before

223
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,360
class insight, this dingy test
and you class here.

224
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,360
So tell me if I'm going to execute
logging test will execute

225
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,440
before loading this class. Also

226
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,560
again, let me repeat my question.

227
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,440
This is my best in class, right?

228
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,320
I put it today before class function here

229
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,040
and I'm trying to execute this class

230
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,960
so that iterate before class will execute
for this particular class.

231
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,200
This is my question base, but it execute.

232
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,960
No, it will not. Why?

233
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,640
Because before class is applicable
only for the class.

234
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,400
When we are writing
this particular annotation. Right.

235
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,160
So it will execute
right before the class gets executed.

236
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,240
Which class where you have mentioned this.

237
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
Iterate
before class for the specific class.

238
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,400
This annotation works so it

239
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,680
executes once

240
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,320
before the class

241
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,800
executes.

242
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,400
Right.

243
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,640
Similarly,
we have edit after class annotation.

244
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,920
So why we use after class annotation?

245
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,080
Okay, one more thing.

246
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,000
What kind of conditions we can have?

247
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,760
What about

248
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,760
we will

249
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,880
we will go through
that part of the security we have.

250
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,440
We have it in a bucket.

251
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,280
So can you think of a situation
which we need to put in this

252
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:16,520
before class and right after class, any

253
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,080
practical situation
or condition that you can think of

254
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,920
while you are working,
let's say on a project

255
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,560
and you think this is the condition
I should put in right before class

256
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,680
or after class.

257
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,920
I gave you one example.

258
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,600
Remember?

259
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:38,960
Right.

260
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,240
So me opening the browser is available

261
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,400
for all the methods, for all the test.

262
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,040
So if we open the browser,
just take one thing.

263
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
It will not work.

264
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
Great,
because I have like 16 just to get this.

265
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,200
So intent is to get this
definitely opening the browser

266
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,240
just one time is not a good option
that it is my remaining main test.

267
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,720
This will fail.

268
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,760
So remember in this think this is this.

269
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,080
If you are writing some data,
if you are trying to pass some properties,

270
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,960
those properties, those data
you put in one file

271
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,720
and that can read in
this before class annotation

272
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,160
got to got it right.

273
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,000
So in that part this properties file this

274
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,120
this data file and you can read
in your address before class.

275
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,920
So before even actually starting your test

276
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,240
execution,
you will be having all that data ready,

277
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,680
which you will be reading in your domain
in ten or 15 or 20 days to get this right.

278
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,680
So this is the exact condition
which you can put inside

279
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,800
your at the rate before class on rotation

280
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,440
rate.

281
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,880
Similarly, if you want to close the file,
then it after class is available

282
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
here, go ahead and use it.

283
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,480
All right.

284
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
So it executes once

285
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,720
after the class executes

286
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,160
the database.

287
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,480
And then I test before my third
after method,

288
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:23,520
before class, after class five annotations
We learned yesterday.

289
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,000
Right now, what what was the next thing?

290
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What was the next thing?

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,680
Which we learn, I

292
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,480
should be sure.

293
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,320
So let's say should if you have,
nobody is before a chance.

294
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,160
We have attributes.

295
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,240
Remember,

296
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,640
there's ten attributes.

297
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,400
Yes, I think so.

298
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,760
Let me give you one example here.

299
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,960
Let's say you are working on word
task, right in your project.

300
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,520
You have a task
that you have to perform log in operation.

301
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,200
Right now, when I say log in operation,

302
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,000
it simply means you have to enter
user name and password.

303
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,880
Then the next one is you have to add one
employee in the application just to add

304
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,480
one employee in the application,
you have to pass your first name.

305
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,040
Last name.

306
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,920
With the name, the condition is
you have to perform both this operation.

307
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,400
You have to perform both this test
because this execution on Chrome browser,

308
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,520
you have to

309
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,200
test this operations
on your test environment, right?

310
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,240
So that you are all of their test in mind.

311
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,640
This Chrome browser name

312
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,120
everything you cannot pass
directly hardcoded in your project.

313
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,840
Right? Right. No.

314
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,920
We are writing hardcoded data

315
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,240
in your practical life
you will not pass data hard for it.

316
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,720
I will say no later than the session.

317
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,760
Only today only we have this topic
in our pipeline to tell you.

318
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,760
So you have to parse this data
from some fight

319
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,520
right from that file
if you're passing this data.

320
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,080
So for launching the browser,
for selecting the browser for us,

321
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,920
for launching that you are enforced,
you need this data.

322
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,880
If you need this data,
you have to read one file with your list,

323
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,440
all of this data, right?

324
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,800
But you have kept this data.

325
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,240
This data is stored in some file
to read that file

326
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,320
because your code is in a read
before the method.

327
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,840
This is your precondition
to launch the browser.

328
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,600
For launching the browser,
you need browser name unity you are.

329
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,560
And so before even before method,
you have to read this file.

330
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,560
So what is the best place to read this
file from?

331
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,320
You can read this
file in iterate before class.

332
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,000
So when

333
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,720
you put this condition
of reading the file straight before class,

334
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,240
what you will do it
will read to complete data of this file.

335
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,560
Now when you go read before method,
remember there is the execution sequence.

336
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,680
First iterate before class executes, then

337
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,160
be formatted, execute,
then your actual test execute.

338
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,680
Right.

339
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,560
So now before class,
you're reading the data from the file.

340
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,480
Before methods.

341
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,800
You are using this data as a browser name.

342
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,480
As a you are everything
in your actual test.

343
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,560
You're using this username and password
from this fight, right?

344
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,600
So that's why you can put these
as a practical example

345
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,760
inside your address before class.

346
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,360
When I say reading the face,
reading the data from the clear

347
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,680
is this clear to everyone?

348
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,200
Students

349
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,960
by the now

350
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,720
we have test and

351
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:54,960
attributes here with us.

352
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,640
All right.

353
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:05,960
What was the first attribute
we have learned yesterday?

354
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,960
Priority. All right.

355
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,160
What is the default value of priority days

356
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,160
by default,

357
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,720
priority is 6 to 0 for all that.

358
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,840
This is. All right.

359
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,720
All right.

360
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,000
One more thing. Before
go into the priority.

361
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,560
If we do not have any priority,
on what basis?

362
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,120
Your test
to execute all of your test cases

363
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,000
in the alphabetical order.

364
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,480
Right.

365
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,440
It follows alphabetical order
to execute your test.

366
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
Guess it's fine.

367
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,640
I don't want this alphabetical order
so I can better taste my test

368
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,520
because according to my requirement,

369
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,400
note of total should itself

370
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,240
political based. Yep.

371
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,920
All right.

372
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,800
So now, next thing by default,

373
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,520
the priority is set to zero
for all the test cases,

374
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,560
right?

375
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,040
Whatever the test gives us, we have
the priority is set to zero.

376
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,160
It's up to us now which priority we will
going to provide to all of our test cases.

377
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,240
Remember, we provided the priority
according to our choice.

378
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,520
Priority one, two, three, four. Right.

379
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,440
That was my defined sequence.

380
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,480
User defined the sequence of execution
and test indeed follows

381
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,640
this user defined sequence,
whatever the sequence I want

382
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,600
to define correct in the priority,
we can do it.

383
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,280
So that was the priority
we know yesterday.

384
00:23:47,520 --> 00:24:00,000
What was the second attribute?

385
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:24,640
All right, fine.

386
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,720
What was the

387
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,960
second one enabled
right, by me using it. But

388
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,120
to include

389
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,040
or exclude our test cases in execution,

390
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,000
let's to update
is because I don't want to execute

391
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,680
all of this to get this in a single shot.

392
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,680
So what I can do in this case,
I can execute some of them.

393
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,520
I can execute.

394
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,960
I can exclude some of them. Right.

395
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,520
For example, smoke test, regression test,
or any of their test rate.

396
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,120
So inclusion and exclusion is depending

397
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,840
on one attribute that a good name is in a

398
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,520
book by default, by default,

399
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,800
every test case is enable or disable.

400
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,160
By default,
every test case is enable to true.

401
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,720
If we need to exclude test case,

402
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,200
we have to stick this

403
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,200
false.

404
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,240
The moment you write
enable is equal to false.

405
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,880
It will not be a part of your execution.

406
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,600
Correct

407
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,400
by Wednesday.

408
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,000
That is not answering today.

409
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,080
I remember
he was asking so many things yesterday.

410
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,160
When is he

411
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,640
agreed to that date?

412
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,320
I want you to provide genuine feedback.

413
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:22,640
Am I going slow now? Yes.

414
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,960
I really need this.

415
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,800
I really need this. That's
what I'm asking.

416
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,280
So, Pop.

417
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,000
All right, do let me know, right?

418
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,320
If you think that I'm going fast,
If you think you're not taking anything,

419
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,800
do let me know.

420
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,960
Thank you, sir.

421
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,080
All right, guys.

422
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,560
So priority.

423
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,240
No, he is not

424
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,600
for testing.

425
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,000
Do you
attribute was priority enable disable

426
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,520
that third one did we use was

427
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,320
what was the third one we used

428
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,040
as version correct

429
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,680
bemused assertion.

430
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,040
Fine.

431
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,160
What kind of assertions
we have seen yesterday?

432
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,680
Assertion is all

433
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,000
two bytes.

434
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,280
No, I am talking about the category

435
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,280
so we used yesterday hard assertion

436
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,400
right?

437
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,240
I explained to you what is hard assertion?

438
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,640
What is our decision days

439
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,280
it the moment

440
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
it finds

441
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,880
an address

442
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,560
it stops

443
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,120
execution

444
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,400
and will give us the

445
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,080
breakpoint right?

446
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,760
Right. Next.

447
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,120
The moment it finds an edit,
it starts execution

448
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,200
and it will give us the breakpoint.
Also on.

449
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,200
Let me right like this a

450
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,600
it gives us

451
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,520
the breakpoint where it was broken.

452
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,280
Correct. That was the hard decision.

453
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,680
Which class
we have used for our assertion,

454
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,960
which class we have used

455
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,280
a third class

456
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:12,240
from where we are
getting is a third class.

457
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,080
We are getting this
a third class from testing.

458
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,240
You know, no java utils.

459
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,000
We are getting this from testing.

460
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Let me show you once again.

461
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
There you go in the section right

462
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,440
when you put here,

463
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,600
just going to the import
and you will check

464
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,280
or repeat test and do not assert.

465
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,680
Right.

466
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,040
We are not using it from Java dot utils,
we are using it from test and you only

467
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:50,000
recognize.

468
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,480
Okay, fine.

469
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,400
Let's go ahead guys.

470
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,200
Let me show you just one more,

471
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,480
one more table

472
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,920
part assertion, part attribute,
and then we'll switch on to the next part.

473
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,680
So remember yesterday
we have seen one assertion assert dark

474
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,440
assert equals, right?

475
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,080
Why we use that assert
thought assert equals

476
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,600
because here if you see
we were comparing two values, right?

477
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,600
We were comparing two venues to verify.

478
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,640
That's why we used assert equals.

479
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,840
But if there is a boolean condition,
if I want to check one boolean

480
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,520
condition, let's say I want to check
the existence of the element.

481
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,040
Can I use then
assert daughters are equals. In that case,

482
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,400
if I want to check just one boolean
condition.

483
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,480
No, we have to use assert, not assert two.

484
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,680
So let me write that.

485
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,720
But I'm going to it here. Assert

486
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,440
or assert.

487
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,000
So boolean condition.

488
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,160
So what is the boolean condition
I'm writing?

489
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,960
Welcome attribute is displayed

490
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,760
right?

491
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,680
Assert true or false?

492
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,640
This is the boolean condition.

493
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,960
If my this condition is true.

494
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,240
Remember I told you yesterday
if we are using assert

495
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,520
assertion is parsed,
it will not give you any message.

496
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,280
It will let you execute
your remaining piece of code.

497
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:15,840
Right.

498
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,120
But the moment it gets an error,
it distorts the execution.

499
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,440
So here I'm going to print

500
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,200
simple data that is

501
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,320
my associate is false.

502
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,480
Fine.

503
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,840
I'm going to write it.

504
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,760
Enable is equal to false.

505
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,600
I don't want to use this one. Fine.

506
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:43,240
So just one I'm going to
execute now, let me run this.

507
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,720
This is the hard assertion, right?

508
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,640
The second method of assertion I'm using,
but still this is hard assertion.

509
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,360
We are not using to solve position.

510
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,280
Remember

511
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,840
working fine.

512
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,360
You see, I got this message.

513
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,120
My assertion is parsed
Where is this message available?

514
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,600
This message is available
on main number 37 by

515
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,720
remember
it follows top to bottom approach, right?

516
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,640
For execution, it means my line number 36
got executed fast.

517
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,280
That's why my cursor went to 37 nine.

518
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,800
Number eight.

519
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,160
And that's why we are getting this message
here.

520
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,240
Right guys?

521
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,600
So a third dart,
a search tool is another assertion.

522
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,000
Method assert, dart assert equals.

523
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,760
It is another assertion method clear.

524
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,440
Is it clear? Is

525
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,320
great.

526
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,520
Let's move forward now.

527
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,600
Time to learn something new,
something more interesting.

528
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:25,440
See, I can see one problem with this hard
assertion days.

529
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,680
What is that problem?

530
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,280
Let me tell you

531
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,360
what example

532
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,920
I'm going to work on one entering

533
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:42,040
scenario.

534
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,200
When I say including scenario,
what does it mean?

535
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,000
Because it means I'm going to perform log

536
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,720
in, I'm going to verify

537
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,240
their state

538
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
dashboard page

539
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,320
and then I'm going to perform log out.

540
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,480
It means what?

541
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,720
The user came

542
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,600
by a log in verified dashboard
page user went out by a local operation.

543
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,360
Write this three thing
if I'm going to log in here

544
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,120
and I got the error here
and I put her decision

545
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,560
to allow me to execute this part

546
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,200
in this part, no.

547
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,160
Right.

548
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,680
But my code is extremely important

549
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,840
and I want to execute
my complete piece of code.

550
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,320
I want to execute all that written log
in verification of dashboard page

551
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,560
log of all this becomes
I want to execute right.

552
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:58,880
And I want to know one thing, how many
errors I'm having in this scenario.

553
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,960
When I say end to end, the scenario,
it means from log in to log out

554
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,760
every single thing it must include.

555
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,640
So when I say entering scenario,
I need some kind of assertion.

556
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,200
I need some kind of assertion
which allow me to go ahead

557
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,320
and execute complete into one scenario
and it will give me the report in the end,

558
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,480
it will not interrupt me in between hard
assertion.

559
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,960
I have a problem with hard assertion.

560
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,480
What is the problem if error comes on line
number two and I have 200 lines of code

561
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,240
to execute, it will not allow me to
execute remaining what may be eight lines.

562
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,360
Right.

563
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,400
That's why I was expecting something else.

564
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,600
And then I found one more kind of
assertion that might be going

565
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,080
stuck.

566
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,040
The solution

567
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,120
right now, one more flexibility,
soft assertion voice.

568
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,120
What is that flexibility?

569
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,320
Let me get

570
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,800
your log in is big right?

571
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,520
Fine.

572
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,400
Or let's see, your log in is passed

573
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,520
it came here

574
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,280
your verification of dashboard pages thing

575
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,640
it is

576
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,240
your verification of log out
is also feed point

577
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,760
it close the browser.

578
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,400
It opens the browser here
the precondition in the post condition.

579
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,640
I'm talking about more soft associated
does soft assertion executes this code

580
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,440
then executes this code, then executes
this code, then

581
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,760
execute this post condition
first precondition, execute

582
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,120
all these three
and then post condition In the end,

583
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,080
it will give you the consolidated report
which says, Hey,

584
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,680
your login was passed,

585
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,480
your dashboard was filled,

586
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,360
and the point of sale is this your log
code was built.

587
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,240
And the point of it is
this is your total execution report.

588
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,320
Now, your all the methods got executed.

589
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,880
Take your entire piece of code
word executed.

590
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:22,080
It was not interrupted inbetween
by the assertion, even though it was paid

591
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,000
right, even though it was not fulfilling
the condition of assertion

592
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,240
it was allowing.

593
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,400
It allowed your entire code.

594
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,600
It allowed you
to execute your entire code,

595
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,520
and then it gave you the report
after the execution.

596
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,840
That's what Soft Associate does

597
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,720
consent clear to

598
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,000
everyone what soft assertion does?

599
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,040
Why we should use soft assertion

600
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,280
is that anyone who having any problem
with this definition

601
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,120
what I just say.

602
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,000
All right,

603
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,240
let's implement you guys, then.

604
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,160
All clear. That's good.

605
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,440
Let's try to implement this first.

606
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I will give you a very basic example,
and then I will give you the same example,

607
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,040
two examples I will give you,
because the concept is important.

608
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,200
I'm going to write you saw

609
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,400
a solution,

610
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,320
one, because I will give you two examples.

611
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,920
So I'm writing soft assertion
one and soft assertion that,

612
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,520
okay, let's say my first is string.

613
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,120
I'm writing sorry.

614
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,640
First I'm going to write my main method.

615
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,080
This is my method.

616
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,440
Now, not mine
method actually unaffected method.

617
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,320
I'm writing here

618
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,800
a solution

619
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,480
is right.

620
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,120
So you guys, what I'm doing here

621
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,080
are test case.

622
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,920
In another test guess question.

623
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,520
Where do we need hard assertion then?

624
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,600
We need hard assertion.

625
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,400
We're a strict check is applicable right?

626
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,680
Vanessa is strict objective simply means
I don't want to execute anything

627
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,840
if the error comes at this point of time.

628
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,120
Right. I don't want to proceed further.

629
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,920
First, take this error, fix this error
and then go further.

630
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,400
Right.

631
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,760
If there is a strict check,
points are available in the application

632
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,640
and I know after this
that is not a much important code.

633
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,120
Right.

634
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,240
This is the more important point
which I want to verify.

635
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,760
Then we have to use hard session,

636
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:46,400
but it wasn't there.

637
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,640
Scored bandit.

638
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Let's do it. I'm going to write to string.

639
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,480
The first one I'm writing
is expected to spring is equals to

640
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,160
batch and is

641
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:09,000
one of the best batches.

642
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,320
Then it's frame stake
and when I'm writing is this is expected

643
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,280
that it might actually spring

644
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,440
batch pain is

645
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,320
one of the

646
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,080
batches fine

647
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,200
then you go

648
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,280
whatever use it.

649
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,200
I implemented

650
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,720
all right and so then we use hard solution

651
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,080
there are called our code

652
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,920
and our verification validation
check point is very strict.

653
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,840
It means I don't want to execute
further code

654
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,520
until unless my this code works right?

655
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
Sometimes you get this kind of conditions

656
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,040
in your project
for example of your log in part

657
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,480
if you log in part is not working
correctly, what you execute your dashboard

658
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,440
verification or load functionality
or any of that thing.

659
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
This is a blocker, right?

660
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,520
If user is coming on your application,
if user is using your web application

661
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,480
and he or she is not able to log in
to the application, isn't it a blocker.

662
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,120
Right.

663
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,400
So there if you use soft assertion
and you try to execute the remaining code,

664
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,640
which is not that important,
for example local verification

665
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,240
or some other verification,
it is of no use.

666
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,360
In that case,
you have to use hard assertion.

667
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,840
I'm being honest,
my log in functionality works fine.

668
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,840
You should not proceed for further. Right.

669
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,560
So we have to identify the requirement
in which requirement

670
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,560
to be able to use
soft assertion and data requirement.

671
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:11,480
We have to use our decision.

672
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,840
All right.

673
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,840
Okay, guys, let's proceed for the

674
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,720
good work.

675
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,840
Good work.

676
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,400
Now see

677
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,600
how decisions how how

678
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,840
we'll use the asset class in the hard
decision base.

679
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,600
We simply wrote assert assert

680
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,360
equals assert assert group right.

681
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,360
We got the assert class directly from test
and in the soft assertion

682
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,160
using software solution in test

683
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,760
is slightly different than hard assertion.

684
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,760
Right.

685
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,720
Guys, I'd like to invite
your complete assertion here.

686
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,640
Sorry, not as I would like to invite
your complete attention.

687
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,520
Okay, fine. My

688
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,200
when you are so much

689
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,960
focused on to their topic,
it happens some day.

690
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,800
All right.

691
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,800
So now see, I'm going to write here

692
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,680
soft assert.

693
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,400
Great.

694
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Now, you see, when I say soft assertion,
it's a soft assert object,

695
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,120
darkest in deep thought, asserts, correct

696
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm going to use this soft.

697
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,920
This is the class that I'm going
to use a soft assert class here.

698
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,280
Now to create the object of this class

699
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,360
that makes it I'm going to write
the soft assert is equal to in Java.

700
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,160
How we create the object

701
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,680
with nil keyword right

702
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,480
positive

703
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,120
bindings.

704
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,600
Is this correct?

705
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,760
Tell me all java developers,

706
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:07,800
is this correct or not?

707
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,920
You actually definitely

708
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,560
looks right to this operate.

709
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,520
Well, thanks.

710
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,800
All right.

711
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,160
Now see, guys,
I created the object of my soft position.

712
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,640
Now I have to use my soft position. Okay.

713
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,480
How can I use this off position?

714
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,160
See, soft assert dart,

715
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,480
Whatever the methods I was using there

716
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,880
I can use here on the soft assert
assert equals.

717
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,960
Can you see

718
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,520
us articles

719
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,240
as they're true also available
assert equals also available?

720
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,760
I'm trying to.

721
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,840
I'm trying to compare to values
to get that right.

722
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,080
So which one should I use?

723
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:00,000
Assert true or assert equals

724
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,800
assert equals

725
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,040
point.

726
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,160
Let me take my strange from here
and I'm writing

727
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,720
expected comma

728
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,440
lecture

729
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,640
correct?

730
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:32,680
Is this correct?

731
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,120
Now let's proceed for the

732
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,200
I'm going to write here say just to show
you just to show you one thing.

733
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,120
See again I'm writing soft assert dart

734
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,760
assert true.

735
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,720
If condition is true,
then I'm going to get to.

736
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,560
But yet I'm passing
intentionally is false.

737
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,400
This condition

738
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,720
now to me when I'm saying

739
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,920
assert, assert true,
but here I'm getting false

740
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,680
bullet.

741
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,440
True or false?

742
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:07,720
Really positive can be in this condition.

743
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,880
Correct or incorrect in this case

744
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:13,800
it is pain

745
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,600
because I'm trying to get to
it is incorrect condition right now.

746
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,560
Let me put one thing here.

747
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,600
My code after

748
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,600
false assertion

749
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,480
right.

750
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,360
I'm going to copy this.

751
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,560
I'm going to stick to my code after

752
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,960
second session.

753
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,480
Let me pick one more.

754
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,240
I'm writing
soft assert dart, a third false.

755
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,440
But here I'm passing two as a condition.

756
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,280
So I'm writing here

757
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,200
my code

758
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,760
after

759
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,240
third assumption

760
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,280
and then again

761
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,840
I'm writing soft assert or assert

762
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,080
false.

763
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,320
Make it false in this condition.

764
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,400
True or not

765
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,920
the fourth condition

766
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,480
my code after

767
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,840
for the session

768
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,200
guys tell me fourth
condition is floor not line number 24.

769
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,280
Is this correct or incorrect?

770
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,680
Minus minus plus false. False.

771
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,440
True simple right.

772
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,240
This time it is correct.

773
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,120
See, I'm expecting false.

774
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:46,520
It is giving me
false statements. Condition two

775
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,920
When condition
is false, then I'm expecting to end.

776
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,640
It is giving me false like line number 18.

777
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,240
This condition is incorrect.

778
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,280
Then line number 21 I'm expecting false.

779
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,920
It is giving me true again.

780
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,320
Condition incorrect.

781
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,600
Line number 24.

782
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,040
I'm expecting false.

783
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,720
It is giving me false condition.

784
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,880
Go minus, minus plus. Correct.

785
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:10,920
For conditions.

786
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,280
I've mentioned to you guys for conditions
I've mentioned here

787
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,520
in this for three are incorrect.

788
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,480
One is correct right this now tell me

789
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,280
now tell me my code for these two
from line number 22.

790
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,520
Line number 24 is extremely potent

791
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,680
but before that I have to verification
point here.

792
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,040
If I use a harder solution,

793
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,880
if I use harder session,
will allow me to execute this code.

794
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,200
Also, if I get any error here. No,

795
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,040
but soft position

796
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,720
allows me to execute
my remaining piece of code

797
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,240
even if I get an error
into the very first assumption.

798
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,160
But this is the basic advantage.

799
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,200
This is the main advantage
of using soft solution that you can have

800
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,080
in number of verification and validation
check points

801
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,480
in your single test case,
and it will execute your complete code.

802
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,560
It will perform all the verification
and validation operations

803
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,560
for all the check points that you have
mentioned by a solved assertions.

804
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,240
Right.

805
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,880
And in the end, once you're done
with the execution, it will give you

806
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,440
the collective report of all the execution

807
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,440
logic

808
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:34,440
guys.

809
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,840
Getting my point.

810
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,640
Okay.

811
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,880
Okay, let's proceed further.

812
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,400
Still, the code is not completed days.

813
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,680
Remember,
it's still the code is not completed.

814
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,240
Right.

815
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,240
I'm going to write one more thing here.

816
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,400
Let's say string

817
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,680
new expected is equal to

818
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,000
is last

819
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:36,800
assertion.

820
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,160
This code will also be passed. Right

821
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:44,440
now. Now, what is the V?

822
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,960
What is the way to guarantee
consolidated report?

823
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,760
Soft assertion
itself will not provide anything.

824
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,320
We have to provide one particular method.

825
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,480
We have to provide one particular.

826
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:01,160
We have to collect one particular
method from soft position.

827
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,000
Right.

828
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,840
Why using this object software.

829
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,120
So we need collective report.

830
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,880
So the last statement,
make sure you remember this point.

831
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,120
The last statement of your estimate that
this is your right, the request method.

832
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:15,640
Right.

833
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,840
This must be
your last statement of your test.

834
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,440
Guess what I'm going to write
if you don't write this statement,

835
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,640
you will not get any report after that.

836
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,440
If you write something again,
it will not work.

837
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,360
So it will collect the report.

838
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,960
The moment you write this particular statement, the statement I'm going to write

839
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,200
solve, assert

840
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,440
Doc, let's start on

841
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:42,800
this.

842
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,000
Assert all is the method I'm going to I'm

843
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,280
going to put the media

844
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,800
to collect

845
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,160
right

846
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,960
next to collect
all the assertions, information

847
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,440
we need to call this assert all method.

848
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,760
One more point.

849
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,560
This should be the last statement.

850
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:27,040
All your tests last.

851
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,360
The statement should be this one
soft assert assert all.

852
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:41,040
Is it clear?

853
00:52:41,040 --> 00:53:01,680
Now let me execute it.

854
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,120
Can you see what the thing is?

855
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,440
We know this assertion failed.

856
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,920
But still I got my message,
my code after first assertion,

857
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,080
my quote of the second assertion
microdot for the third assertion, my code

858
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,080
after the photo session.

859
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,160
It means for every single statement
printed right now,

860
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,240
let me show you the actual magic here.

861
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,360
Click to see the difference.

862
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,520
The following assertion assert failed.

863
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,640
The following asserts Failure means more
multiple assertions like Go below,

864
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:40,480
go below and check which one.

865
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,680
If this batch
then is one of the worst batches,

866
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,480
but all batch
ten is one of the best images.

867
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:48,600
Correct?

868
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,800
Can I guess my first failure

869
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,280
it was expecting true, but we found false.

870
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,400
That was the second failure expected.

871
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,600
False. Right.

872
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,840
And we were getting explicit false,
but we were getting to three assertions

873
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,880
failed it.

874
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:15,320
Give me the information
of this three correct.

875
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:21,400
Guys, are you getting my point?

876
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,720
You'll see it expected
false actually is true.

877
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,120
Expecting true, found false.

878
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,040
This was expected.

879
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,680
We found this part only

880
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,560
right here.

881
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,360
If you'll see here,
it says on line number.

882
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,960
This line number this here
also line number.

883
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,440
This.

884
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,360
If you go to this complete data, go here.

885
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,400
Right.

886
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,000
We will get the complete data
from this off the

887
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,480
like if we close this assert.

888
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,000
Plus this is my soft assertions
we generally use.

889
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,200
So can you show the end of your code
again?

890
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,560
I didn't get that.

891
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,600
Yes, sure.

892
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,600
There you go.

893
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,640
Simple with the object. Soft assert.

894
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,440
You have to call this assert all method.

895
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:29,240
That's it.

896
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,320
Is it clear to everyone? Students

897
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,040
So what?

898
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,640
Any note, any question

899
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,600
Now let's actually implement

900
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,120
this Let's implement
it actually energy and application.

901
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,640
Right.

902
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,160
So I'm going to write here my second

903
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:01,560
class guy. So

904
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,320
astonishing, right?

905
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:11,600
Someone was asking to put the commands
also with the method.

906
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:16,880
So wherever I think that this one should
be, remember I'm putting the command also.

907
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,800
Okay.

908
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,120
So what it do it does basically

909
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,800
whenever you prefer
this code in the future

910
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:28,680
you will remember that all this code
is associated for this particular company

911
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,840
and we are using this particular
method for this reason.

912
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,280
So it will help in some somewhat.

913
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:44,240
I can see some minute by.

914
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:54,000
So now let's try to implement this code.

915
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,960
Yes. Correct. Correct. It is true.

916
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,320
See it is giving you
that is expected. True.

917
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,320
But following the false expected
best in is the was the batch.

918
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,000
But all this expected.

919
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,120
This is the last session but found
this is last assertion with the gap.

920
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,760
Okay so all the solutions are just giving
you both the expected value

921
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,520
do is but its actual value.

922
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,520
Your concern is more informative
you'll see that.

923
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:23,560
Thank you're.

924
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,200
Most welcome.

925
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,440
Let's go ahead guys then

926
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,960
might start a solution
to I'm going to write

927
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,320
wave driver driver first
because I'm going to use my

928
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,440
it's out in this application.

929
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,600
So instead of writing this complete

930
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:47,280
data, I'm going to copy

931
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,480
some of the information
from my log, in part

932
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,880
from my business.

933
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,480
Yet first,
I'm going to copy this before method by

934
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,360
then I will copy

935
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,840
two point

936
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,160
this part also

937
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,960
and then after method also

938
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:51,080
by now here, here

939
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,080
I want to put a multiple assumption
intentionally.

940
00:58:54,080 --> 00:59:03,480
I'm going to put multiple assertion here.

941
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,480
Yesterday
we had one log in class eight logging test

942
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,760
that I have copied this code from.

943
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,120
Again, somebody please post this code
from log in, test in the break.

944
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,640
Thank you, Jamal.

945
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,640
Thank you.

946
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,920
Now I want to use my soft assertion
right here in my actual validation.

947
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,760
Right.

948
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,320
So couple of validation and verification
checkpoints intentionally

949
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,000
I'm going to make here.
Some of them will fail.

950
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,040
Some of them we will pass. Right.

951
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,440
And then we'll see how it works.

952
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,080
Let's see this.

953
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:42,160
So first thing I'm going to write here
in the validation of

954
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,440
validate log in right before
even writing this username and password,

955
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,680
I'm going to write my validation of title
inside this same test.

956
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,280
Guess I'm breaking

957
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,400
the human resource management system.

958
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:12,800
Right?

959
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,600
You'll see this as the title

960
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,040
for like,

961
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,520
can you see this human management system
right?

962
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,200
Intentionally.

963
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,960
I have written here

964
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,720
the Human Resource Management system.

965
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,920
Now I'm writing

966
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,600
new string

967
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,280
Driver, not dictating

968
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,800
what I'm going to write like this
because I know it will fail, right?

969
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,680
We know it will fail.

970
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,000
So I'm going to write it.

971
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,120
My software start

972
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,080
as let's use thought this time

973
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,520
as equals to new start the start by

974
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,760
soft or dark

975
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,560
assert equals

976
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,200
actual common python

977
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,920
expected write

978
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,280
this code for sure will fail right.

979
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,880
Nice.

980
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,880
I know.

981
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,560
But still before
after verification of title.

982
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,760
What I want
I want to execute my log input.

983
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,040
All right.

984
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,720
So inside my log input,
let me put some more

985
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,960
verification checkpoint right here.

986
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,960
I'm going to write

987
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,120
this.

988
01:01:59,120 --> 01:01:59,640
Welcome.

989
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,840
The good part. Right.

990
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,480
So I'm going to write it.

991
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,720
Let me remove this

992
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,000
soft door.

993
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,880
Assert to

994
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,720
let me write, assert

995
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,800
false

996
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,360
welcome attribute dark is displayed.

997
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,200
I'm expecting false.

998
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,280
If it is returning true from here
it means again my verification thing

999
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,280
right This second assertion

1000
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:41,280
I'm going to put here.

1001
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:42,720
Let's take the third assertion.

1002
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,400
I'm going to write one string

1003
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:47,400
my strings is

1004
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,040
things is wants to

1005
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,800
welcome attribute,
whatever that text is available there.

1006
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,640
I'm going to copy this text. Right.

1007
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,840
And I think the string

1008
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,800
expected fixed.

1009
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,960
So let's say

1010
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,960
welcome attachment should be there.

1011
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,960
Right on. Welcome text.

1012
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,200
Welcome admin should be there.

1013
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,840
I'm writing simply me

1014
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,520
or let me.

1015
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,000
I'm going to write

1016
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,920
welcome item one two, three.

1017
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,040
Again, I'm going to write soft

1018
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,880
Start.

1019
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,240
Start equals

1020
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,800
my text and my

1021
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:42,720
expected text.

1022
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,240
All in all, how many test cases,

1023
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,400
how many assertions

1024
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,320
they three assertions, right.

1025
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,480
But all of them three are going to fail.

1026
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,800
It is for sure.

1027
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:03,280
Correct.

1028
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,240
Okay, fine.

1029
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,200
Now, the last district.

1030
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,280
My I'm going to write here one thing

1031
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,360
in my statement

1032
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,680
of all the assertion,

1033
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:23,440
then what should be
the last statement of this part?

1034
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,160
Which meant that I should consider

1035
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,920
a third point.

1036
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,680
I'm going to call this assert all with it.

1037
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,680
Now, see,

1038
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,880
I'm verifying my title,

1039
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,160
even if my title is there

1040
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,920
or it is something else,
it means my best guess.

1041
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:46,120
This fine is still I want this script
to perform logging operation.

1042
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,400
It is performing logging operation.

1043
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,360
Then it is verifying
it is with defined my text.

1044
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,520
First it will check the display.

1045
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,160
Find if this place did.

1046
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,240
That is fine. Or let me put

1047
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:01,880
this point

1048
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,800
before the assertion part here.

1049
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:11,760
After this two assertions
I'm going to expect

1050
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,560
and then I'm going to take the value,
even if all the verification

1051
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:23,920
and validation check points are fail,
I want my results.

1052
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,840
I got to write.

1053
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,160
You want this one?

1054
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,520
I just wrote it as a text on

1055
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,800
you said this
one should be the actual one.

1056
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,640
The first one.

1057
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:48,360
All right.

1058
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:59,160
Got it.

1059
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,840
You want this, right?

1060
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,680
Correct.

1061
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,000
Okay, fine.

1062
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:07,720
Now, if you see here, I have three, right?

1063
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,320
I have three assertion points.

1064
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,760
This is my precondition

1065
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,840
so I don't need to mention
my precondition will definitely execute

1066
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:19,480
my post condition will also execute
my test gives will also execute.

1067
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,400
But I want this complete test
to be executed.

1068
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,560
Right. So let's execute this fight now

1069
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,160
and you

1070
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:24,720
see performance log in operation.

1071
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,920
This is paid right.

1072
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,080
Notice we intentionally made our test fee,

1073
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,480
but it says my statement
after all the assertion.

1074
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,600
So it is my statement.
This is my statement.

1075
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,120
It means my entire code got executed

1076
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,720
right now here, if you see it says

1077
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,920
Click to see difference, click here.

1078
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,440
The first one is Human
Resource Management System,

1079
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,000
but phone human management system

1080
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:57,960
guys.

1081
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,920
Second thing, welcome admin expected.

1082
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,440
But what we got
we got welcome coming to me.

1083
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,480
Yes, yes, yes. Correct. Correct.

1084
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,600
We use this and didn't
unless the checkpoint verification

1085
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:16,160
and validation check is a strict
we will use this one

1086
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:20,040
then the expected was false
but found true. Why?

1087
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,640
Because I was expecting this message,
this welcome attribute.

1088
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,760
It should not be displayed,
but actually it was displayed.

1089
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,600
That's why condition was false.

1090
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,520
So my assertion got to clear

1091
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,280
three assertions.

1092
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:38,400
I put all three things, but still my code
word executed and I got consolidated

1093
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,520
report because of this solve for dot
assert all method

1094
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,520
right days

1095
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:53,720
so far

1096
01:08:53,720 --> 01:09:07,920
in this session,
do you guys have any question?

1097
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,160
I hope you are understanding
the things slowly gradually

1098
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,360
we're increasing rate
we are increasing over other topics.

1099
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:33,720
We are increasing over
the advanced features of testing.

1100
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,200
All right.

1101
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,440
Shall we proceed further now
or you guys are still writing the code

1102
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,000
up to 15 minutes.

1103
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,600
Maybe. All right.

1104
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,280
And please
write this right after 15 minutes.

1105
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,680
There definitely is definitely

1106
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,360
show.

1107
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:05,960
Go ahead, just click
or there is a link, right?

1108
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:11,000
It says, I don't totally understand on it,

1109
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,160
but just one more topic, please.

1110
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,440
One more topic and then break.

1111
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,320
Would that be okay?

1112
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,880
I know, I know.

1113
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:24,320
Recharge is needed.

1114
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,720
I'll give you a special access
from my side for sure

1115
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,640
whenever I come to you, as
I'll give you that.

1116
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,360
Great.

1117
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:51,360
You didn't put that code here.

1118
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,960
Give me if there is no option. Right.
You'll see.

1119
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,120
You'll find these differences
in blue and be great in.

1120
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,120
The console itself,
you'll find that difference

1121
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:02,640
great.

1122
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,400
It's a deal being done.

1123
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,680
You can have my words
even on a blank paper

1124
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,040
along with my signature. Correct.

1125
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,680
That's what index four saying.

1126
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,520
That's what I'm saying.
It's in the console.

1127
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,600
If there is no facility to see, click
the difference.

1128
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,760
Right, You will, you will find it.

1129
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,280
Then it said the same happened with bird
you the same happened.

1130
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,400
Just saw me as well. Right.

1131
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,120
So you you will find this information
in your console itself.

1132
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,640
You don't need to click or to see the

1133
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:34,880
maybe the different but just something to
I'm not sure but he is

1134
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,200
that's what I'm saying.

1135
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,840
Mike might be there
different convergence of data idea

1136
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,720
but at least we are able
to get the information.

1137
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,120
Everyone is able to get
the same information right.

1138
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,400
You are able to kill
and see the differences.

1139
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:51,000
Doesn't matter whether it is in console
or your extending your console

1140
01:11:51,000 --> 01:12:09,800
well clicking on the link.

1141
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:13,200
Got it.
So this is the one I'm talking about

1142
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,280
quite. Now.

1143
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,520
Let's
proceed further towards the next topic

1144
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:28,800
right after soft session.

1145
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,440
Let me let me ask 11.

1146
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,160
here before proceed further.
Let me ask one point to get advice.

1147
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:34,800
Tell me

1148
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,960
let's see.

1149
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,360
Yeah, definitely.

1150
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,880
We are a family,

1151
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:44,640
Mike.

1152
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:49,920
So your one best guess for example,
your village log.

1153
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,280
In your village log, it is depending

1154
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,400
on another test guess rate.

1155
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,720
For example,
you have to enter username and password

1156
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,840
you have to introduce and or for example,
let me give you one very basic example.

1157
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,760
You want to verify the dashboard, right?

1158
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:15,000
So to verify that dashboard
in this human resource or each application

1159
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,680
you need log in or not

1160
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,360
of this the unit log in.

1161
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,080
Correct.

1162
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:27,480
Without log in, can someone verify this?

1163
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,720
Our dashboard page?

1164
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:37,680
No, it means we can see that my dashboard

1165
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:42,280
verification page test case
is highly depending on my log in.

1166
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,720
Correct.

1167
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:52,520
Or it is completely depending
on my log in gaskets.

1168
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:52,840
Right.

1169
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,320
So now what testing do you see is here

1170
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,920
is the indices.

1171
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,320
Students I know your requirements.

1172
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:06,040
If you have any requirement like this,
when you have two test cases

1173
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:09,040
and your one best guess
is rely on any other test.

1174
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:13,680
Guess what I do is I will execute
the dependent test gets later,

1175
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,960
but first I will execute the test.

1176
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,320
Guess you are depending
on which test this.

1177
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,240
It means your dependent test
case will execute later.

1178
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,520
But the test
guess you're relying on will execute

1179
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,640
first work test and you

1180
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:32,880
getting my point.

1181
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,640
I'll give you one example here.

1182
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,320
Let me right

1183
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,560
on let me this

1184
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,800
writing depends on active group.

1185
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,560
Right.

1186
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,000
I have written two methods I'm going
to write to maturity and public void.

1187
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:08,880
Let's say mine

1188
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:11,640
log in method.

1189
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,840
So I'm going to write

1190
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,560
This is my

1191
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,120
log in my

1192
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,400
the another one
I'm going to write that exist

1193
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,200
public void

1194
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:30,560
verify

1195
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:47,360
dashboard page.

1196
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:52,800
This is my dashboard page
before you know default

1197
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,560
not not on any default here

1198
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,000
to see what I'm going to do

1199
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,240
my this particular verified dashboard page

1200
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,440
method is depending on my log
in or not pay me.

1201
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:14,000
Is this correct?

1202
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,720
Now, let me do one thing

1203
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,560
here.

1204
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,200
I'm going to write.

1205
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,280
Depends on methods

1206
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,880
it is asking depends on methods.

1207
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,240
The moment
it asks the difference on method.

1208
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,880
What I will write, I will write here.

1209
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:38,040
No, what I will do,

1210
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:40,320
I will write.

1211
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,320
Log in now.

1212
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:46,800
Now, when I try to execute this particular
method, what it will do,

1213
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,520
it will first execute the previous method
that is the log in method very,

1214
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,560
very light and then it will execute.

1215
01:16:52,560 --> 01:17:20,680
Depends on method.

1216
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,280
Correct? Correct.

1217
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,440
Right. Yes.

1218
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:28,160
So when I'm writing here, log in.

1219
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,680
This log in is nothing
but the name of my method

1220
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:35,040
or the method where I am,
which I am relying on.

1221
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:35,680
Right.

1222
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:38,760
So my verify days
work pages relying on log in method.

1223
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,360
So I wrote depends on methods

1224
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,320
which method log in method fine
and I simply execute this particular one.

1225
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,280
Now let me write one more thing.

1226
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,800
I'm writing a static test public void

1227
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:58,920
verify log out.

1228
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:01,320
I am writing this out

1229
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,200
and then this is my out

1230
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,720
page.

1231
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:12,240
Find my log in now my verified log pages.

1232
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,920
Also, depending on what method,
which method it is, depending on it

1233
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,760
is depending on

1234
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,480
a verified dashboard page right now.

1235
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,200
See what happens now.

1236
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,880
See what happened.

1237
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,360
See, I'm going to execute very fine.

1238
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,200
I'll go

1239
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:05,680
there.

1240
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:22,760
What I'm thinking, what happens? I'm

1241
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,080
depending on method public one

1242
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:34,120
depends on attribute

1243
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,280
fine log in method
which is associated with this

1244
01:19:39,040 --> 01:20:07,280
are not included.

1245
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,280
Maybe some a spelling mistake or what.

1246
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:15,880
I'm not getting it now.

1247
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:32,320
This should work.

1248
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,640
Yeah, this should work.

1249
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:45,880
That's what I'm saying.

1250
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:59,320
Or even I'm not getting this.

1251
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,920
This is the method name
I copied and pasted here.

1252
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,800
Right?

1253
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,280
This kind of thinking is fine.

1254
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:16,920
Difference on method is also fine,
but the point is also point.

1255
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:28,960
This one is perfect on this one.

1256
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,880
One Line 18. What happened online dating

1257
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,680
my very excited of

1258
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,080
this one.

1259
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,480
You are seeing great

1260
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,520
in this case right?

1261
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,560
This one you're talking about.

1262
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:03,360
Got it.

1263
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,840
Got it worked fine.

1264
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,640
Let me run this very fine.

1265
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:09,800
I'll go. Okay. Right.

1266
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,120
Let's check there

1267
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,360
yet. This should work without that also.

1268
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,440
But I'm just trying to check why
it is not working.

1269
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,640
I don't think it will.

1270
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,320
I don't see it will work. Right?

1271
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,600
It says test password again.

1272
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,400
It is giving me this option.

1273
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:29,960
I'm not sure.

1274
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,080
Why is it working in your working one

1275
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:41,800
the same code?

1276
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,480
Right. Because they should work.

1277
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,720
I'm not sure why it is not working. Fine.

1278
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,800
Let me show you this also from here,

1279
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,800
because what happens basically

1280
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:57,400
not that is fine.

1281
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,480
That is fine when we use this,
when we have multiple operations

1282
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:05,760
to pass, for example, here
I'm using this part and this part.

1283
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,040
And then with comma, I'm going to use

1284
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:11,520
verified dashboard.

1285
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,640
It means on all methods. It is depending

1286
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:18,040
if I'm writing this one like this,
then got to liberate this.

1287
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:22,160
I need if I'm writing just a single one,
then I don't need to leave this. This

1288
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:34,880
now see?

1289
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:35,880
Right, exactly.

1290
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,560
Exactly. Now,
if you'll see here it is working fine.

1291
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:41,160
Right? My this method verified. Fine.

1292
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:45,360
Now go to method is depending on log in
and verified dashboard.

1293
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,800
So I don't need to execute all these
three methods or this entire class.

1294
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:54,240
What I need to do is basically
I need to simply call this particular

1295
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:57,400
method and it will execute my remaining
two method as well.

1296
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,600
Right.

1297
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:04,320
So if you see here what I executed,
I executed this defined logos method,

1298
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:09,200
but then it executed first login,
then it executed my dashboard.

1299
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,720
Know if you'll see here

1300
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,600
I just run if I logo

1301
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,760
see the same method.

1302
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,400
Right.

1303
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,400
It is working correctly. Fine.

1304
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,840
Yeah, kind of.

1305
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:35,720
But here what you're seeing my complete
my this verify log out

1306
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,360
method is depending on the print
on verified dashboard.

1307
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,640
That one is depending on my login.

1308
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:45,680
So when I execute my verify
it now go to method first it should log,

1309
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,600
it should perform and execute my login.

1310
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,480
Then it should execute
my verified dashboard

1311
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,840
and then it should execute my verified
No go to method.

1312
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,280
Write more test.

1313
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,720
And this is here when I'm writing.

1314
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,240
This depends on methods.

1315
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,240
Execute in verify logo.

1316
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:07,320
So this verified now go to
method will be executed in the last days.

1317
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:11,040
Verify no go to
method is relying on some else method

1318
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,880
and those some else's methods will execute
first in my first and you clear now

1319
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,360
right.

1320
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,160
Is it clear?

1321
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:26,120
It is working fine when I execute
some on verified logo portion.

1322
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:31,520
Can you see this?

1323
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,480
This is not inheritance because we are not
inheriting the property right.

1324
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,800
We are just saying
that we are relying on that method.

1325
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,480
So just go ahead and execute
that method First.

1326
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,360
Inheritance means inheriting the property
right of the class.

1327
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,320
Yeah. And then I know that.

1328
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,440
So now, guys,
we are done with all the attributes.

1329
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,280
Write something very interesting.

1330
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,480
We are going to learn after the break.

1331
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,280
I know you guys need to break it all.

1332
01:25:58,280 --> 01:25:59,640
So guys, how much time you need?

1333
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,720
It's 9293 almost year.

1334
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,840
How much time you.

1335
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:09,160
Fine.

1336
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,360
All right, so I'm putting it here.

1337
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:17,040
Break for 20 minutes, three days.

1338
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,800
You can have a break for 20 minutes.

1339
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,160
Now I'm going to

1340
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,040
write.

1341
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,600
So now, so far

1342
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,560
we have these two different packages,
three

1343
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,520
package, one package two

1344
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,880
while good deal.

1345
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,880
Seriously, if you look at this package,

1346
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,960
these two packages
having different classes, getting

1347
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,080
in this two different classes,

1348
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,360
if I want to execute
this particular class,

1349
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:56,800
I'm not talking about priority enable
disable

1350
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:01,280
all these things that we are doing
inside the class, inside the class.

1351
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:06,400
But still, if I want to execute any class,
what I have to do,

1352
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:10,120
I have to go in that class
and then I have to execute

1353
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,920
the segregation level.

1354
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:16,080
BE every should tell is only the level

1355
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,520
we are writing precondition
post condition inside the class.

1356
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:24,360
We are writing before test
after test inside the class

1357
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:28,280
we are writing multiple test
which is also inside the class.

1358
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:34,040
But still, if I want to execute something,
I have to execute my entire class first

1359
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,960
or not. Again,
right click and execute to my class.

1360
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,040
This is what we are doing.

1361
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:44,000
Correct.

1362
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,120
Now, if
I want to execute all these three classes

1363
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:51,120
depends on attribute stock decision
one associate to.

1364
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,840
If I want to execute
all these three classes, what I should do,

1365
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,920
I should click on depends on attribute.

1366
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,400
First I will execute it.

1367
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:04,240
Forget about those configurations
which we have inside the class.

1368
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,440
I'm not talking about those right now.

1369
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:10,640
If I want to execute soft assertion one,
what I will do, I will right

1370
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,520
click here and I will execute similarly
for self decision two as well.

1371
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:19,160
I have to right click and execute
whether it is method or it is all the test

1372
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:23,320
or it is a simple class,
then what is the point of using test?

1373
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,320
And earlier we had committed it.

1374
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:29,240
Now we will not execute anything from one
class, right?

1375
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,720
We can execute all these classes
from one place.

1376
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,720
What is that place?

1377
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:36,240
That's what we need to understand now.

1378
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,240
Okay, I need one point.

1379
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,000
I need one execution point.

1380
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,600
Make me open my sketch

1381
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,000
point.

1382
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,800
What I need here.

1383
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:54,160
I need one execution point.

1384
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:55,360
Right

1385
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,640
Now, when I see the execution point,
what it means,

1386
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:04,240
it simply means
I want to execute all of my classes,

1387
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:08,800
all of my test from one place
so that I can execute

1388
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,280
all of this things
in a single click, correct.

1389
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:14,200
That's what I need to do.

1390
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,600
So I looking forward
to get that particular part.

1391
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,800
Okay, Now let me go

1392
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,320
on this execution point

1393
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:36,640
by here.

1394
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:37,840
I need

1395
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:42,040
one point where I can

1396
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,840
I can execute

1397
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,600
all of my

1398
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:52,920
classes,

1399
01:29:52,920 --> 01:30:00,000
methods, everything I can do
from one execution point.

1400
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,120
That's what I'm looking for, Right?

1401
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,960
So to do this point,
see the classes, methods, etc., right.

1402
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:10,200
I can execute all my classes.

1403
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,400
I'm not writing class all the classes.

1404
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:15,520
It means A, B, C from multiple packages.

1405
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:15,960
I have

1406
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:18,600
depend on group maybe.

1407
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,680
No SRI no no. Depend on group.

1408
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:24,640
All the methods also available again
depends on group

1409
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:28,760
is what I can segregate
all those methods depending on group.

1410
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:29,880
Right.

1411
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:33,080
But again, when it comes to classes,
I have my classes.

1412
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:34,320
I don't want to do it.

1413
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,280
I want to execute all of my classes,
which is aiming

1414
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:42,720
all of these methods and other stuff
right from one point that is execution

1415
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:45,720
point 94, that For that

1416
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,280
we need one fight which file we need.

1417
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,720
Let me right here.

1418
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:51,960
We need

1419
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:03,720
test and jee dart exam will fight.

1420
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,240
Let me go ahead and open my notes first

1421
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,120
sessions we are done part of sessions.

1422
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:17,280
Talk also fight

1423
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,360
after the session.

1424
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,240
This is the test
case. Right? I will give you as our task

1425
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,720
now depends on done.

1426

01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,720
you need to reload your project

1605
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,000
note as I am.

1606
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:52,000
It is different for
if this testing do not simplify it.

1607
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,040
You'll see here this is just do not.

1608
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:58,240
Yes, I'm writing here. I'm writing this.

1609
01:42:59,080 --> 01:42:59,520
Come on

1610
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:05,920
in the check I am putting this

1611
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,560
control plus

1612
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,160
I plus.

1613
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:15,040
And this is for windows.

1614
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,080
Yes, that's right.

1615
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,520
Yes, they will read it. Don't worry.

1616
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:19,840
They will see.

1617
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:24,680
Now what I would say
similarity from the quote.

1618
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,320
Don't worry about it. First,

1619
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:34,800
let's take everyone on this page.

1620
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:56,640
There is all the this.

1621
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:59,840
But what is the issue?

1622
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,560
Did you install the plugin? Sure, sure.

1623
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:06,120
Right click on the project.

1624
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,240
Go onto the bottom side.

1625
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:14,200
You will get this option
create test in the exhibit.

1626
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:34,560
Are you getting this option?

1627
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,760
Yes. Corexit.

1628
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:43,600
Corexit. Why?

1629
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,840
It is not showing for this
reloaded the project, not getting the test

1630
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,080
and do not exhibit.

1631
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,760
There must be some issue then

1632
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:54,480
with your installation part
you need to check on the installation part

1633
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,320
because remaining all of you guys
got a great idea.

1634
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,640
But it now your issues also resolve

1635
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,760
this post your query in the tech support
rate.

1636
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:11,000
I think more some is there
and he must be able to help with there

1637
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:16,720
work on say I did all the steps
but I don't see it simplified

1638
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:19,680
okay for me

1639
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:24,600
as I also got a great knowledge
also got it and now it's about ignored

1640
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,560
also.

1641
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,280
So just stop

1642
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:34,640
or make this correct.

1643
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:34,960
Fine.

1644
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,240
You just need to check
in the same support.

1645
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:37,800
Right?

1646
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:45,960
Then you can get this quick.

1647
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,040
Now let me give you

1648
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,320
just double set here.

1649
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,120
One funny part.

1650
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:54,200
What is that See,

1651
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:58,400
everyone is using in the industry
this testing great,

1652
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:01,920
very famous tool, widely accepted

1653
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:05,640
unknown tool, right.

1654
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:09,080
Still
if you'll see they have haven't added you

1655
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,800
can you see one bug
this filling of create is not correct

1656
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,360
this right and I've been

1657
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:25,160
seeing this from last two two
and a half years.

1658
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,560
Last two and a half years
I've been seeing this.

1659
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,840
They're not they're
not ready to accept their this is the bug

1660
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,000
static.

1661
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,040
They are not accepting this bug.

1662
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:45,720
They keep sending as the new build,
but still they are not making it fixed.

1663
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:51,760
They're not fixing it.

1664
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,360
Well, one of my colleagues,
the same thing emailed to them.

1665
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,640
They never replied back.

1666
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,280
He took that initiative

1667
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:07,040
and even if they reply,

1668
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,480
they will reply in Chinese,
which we won't be able to understand.

1669
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,080
Right?

1670
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:14,880
So there is no point
of explanation of that.

1671
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:24,840
All right, let's get active.

1672
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:27,240
Like getting

1673
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:30,240
game, shall we?

1674
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:32,840
Proceed for that.
Everyone got this by now.

1675
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:38,640
Everyone is having this file.

1676
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,320
Wait, let's do it

1677
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,000
first.

1678
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:48,960
Let me to do this to a shorter part

1679
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:54,080
by now, you'll see.

1680
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:58,560
My one class I'm taking
there is depends on attribute.

1681
01:47:58,840 --> 01:47:59,560
Right.

1682
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:03,120
Let me open it.

1683
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:06,080
This is my class.

1684
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:06,920
It depends on.

1685
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,000
I think you

1686
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:12,680
all let me take any another class

1687
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:15,680
of I'm taking my session class.

1688
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:29,640
This class Lucy talk assertion one year

1689
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:33,880
I'm going to write.

1690
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,360
No, you don't need to do anything.

1691
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:37,320
They right now just look at this.

1692
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:38,640
Just look at this here. Right?

1693
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,880
You don't need to write anything, okay?

1694
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,720
I'm doing it for you.

1695
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,160
I'm just trying to explain.

1696
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,920
Couple of points. Yes, right.
So just don't do anything.

1697
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,600
You will understand everything.

1698
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:50,600
You will get this code in your repository.

1699
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:53,040
Don't. Guys, don't do anything.

1700
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,680
Yeah, No, no, I know.

1701
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:57,000
What is the meaning of this?
I will reply in Japanese.

1702
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:10,640
No, see,

1703
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,440
I have written one more test
inside this right

1704
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,560
in soft assertion class.

1705
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:22,040
Now I'm going here and I'm writing
my thought solution.

1706
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:23,040
One is taking

1707
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,720
which method I want.

1708
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:26,560
So let's see.

1709
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:29,120
I am going to write my first method
that is

1710
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:33,640
another method.

1711
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:36,120
And the second method is

1712
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:43,760
soft assertion validation.

1713
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,240
Now look at this structure days.

1714
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,920
Look at this structure.

1715
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:52,320
We are having tests which are opening

1716
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,520
and closing, opening and closing.

1717
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,960
Let me to my website,

1718
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:00,000
my application, right click

1719
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:10,200
going to the inspect.

1720
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:14,160
This is the code
you see here right in this record.

1721
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:17,360
It starts with this head, then body,

1722
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:21,800
and then they put every single tag
which we are opening here.

1723
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:27,120
If you go below side, you'll see we are
closing with this statement slash body.

1724
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,840
We started with head and body

1725
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:33,000
extremely will it,
but we don't have slash yet.

1726
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,120
Why we use Slash to close this bag. Right.

1727
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:38,280
This is my demon code that

1728
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,160
now go

1729
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:44,120
into my test and do not assemble fight
You'll see when I'm writing this.

1730
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,560
So opening this.

1731
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:50,200
I am closing it inside this I have test,
I am closing this, inside this.

1732
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,840
I have classes.
I am closing this. Inside this.

1733
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:53,520
I have class.

1734
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:56,000
I'm closing this inside this.
I have methods.

1735
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,360
I am closing it.

1736
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,920
Fine. What it says.

1737
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,360
What does it mean?

1738
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:05,200
It simply means
you don't have to do anything.

1739
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:09,120
No priority, No, no.

1740
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:11,000
Enable, disable nothing.

1741
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,080
You don't have to do anything
in your classes.

1742
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:19,560
Every single customization,
every single customization

1743
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:23,040
you can perform from test
and do not exhibit fight.

1744
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:26,400
For example,

1745
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:30,680
you want to execute just one class,
which class soft associate

1746
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:34,200
class claim you can execute from test
and do not accessible.

1747
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:39,120
Now you say don't want to execute
soft assertion validation method.

1748
01:51:39,120 --> 01:51:43,000
I want to execute
just another method inside one class.

1749
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:45,840
I have all methods to test cases.

1750
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,440
I want to execute one.

1751
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,880
I don't want to execute another one.

1752
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:53,800
To do that, you have one flexibility,
one feature in your class itself.

1753
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:57,160
Which feature is there
enable is equal to true.

1754
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,280
Enable is equal to false.

1755
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:03,480
What I say
we don't have to do anything in our class.

1756
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:07,760
Whatever the things,
whatever the customization we need to do,

1757
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,920
we need to do that
customization in our test

1758
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:15,040
to do fight
so it can be included, exclude methods.

1759
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,960
It says, Yes,
you can do that. How we can do that?

1760
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,400
Let me show you.

1761
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:23,760
You just put in name one
and then exclude another one.

1762
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:26,560
Now It will execute only one method

1763
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,000
for this class.

1764
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:29,520
Right?

1765
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:45,880
Let me run my test and do not see.

1766
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:50,120
I have run my test
and do not take symbol file exist estimate

1767
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:53,680
because my another method
has this method message.

1768
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:57,960
Estimate how many tests it has executed
just one

1769
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:03,640
by just the one because I include one
and I exclude one here.

1770
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:06,800
I don't have any dependency.

1771
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,120
I have nothing to do with my class.

1772
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:11,760
I implemented myself. The session class.

1773
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,400
I'm not going to use that class
for customization.

1774
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:16,680
I am using my big bonus.

1775
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:18,160
This thing I'm using.

1776
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:19,920
This is the engine of your test engine.

1777
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:21,440
Remember? Right.

1778
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:23,600
You can do in number of customization.

1779
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:24,840
Trump You

1780
01:53:25,600 --> 01:53:26,280
getting my point?

1781
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:27,080
Everyone

1782
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:39,480
so far?

1783
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:44,560
Is it clear?

1784
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:57,200
Is it difficult to understand? Yes.

1785
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,840
You don't need to write anything here.

1786
01:53:58,840 --> 01:54:00,240
You don't need to write anything.

1787
01:54:00,240 --> 01:54:02,000
See, let's do it.

1788
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,520
You want to execute all the methods
of your software solution class, right?

1789
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:08,520
Definitely.

1790
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:09,280
Definitely.

1791
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:13,920
Let's say you have this class, the
the dart syntax.

1792
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:14,920
Dart Class two.

1793
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:18,560
This is your foxy dart
syntax dart class to

1794
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,920
inside this package
you have solved a solution.

1795
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:24,720
One This is after solution
one your class name.

1796
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,880
That's why I put class
name is equal to this

1797
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:39,000
right?

1798
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,840
That's what I'm saying, Mark. Right.

1799
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:42,000
That's what I am saying.

1800
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,280
We need to write it.

1801
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,440
We need to write the name of the class.

1802
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:48,000
Fine.

1803
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,440
We need to shorten it.
We need to reduce it.

1804
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:53,400
We need to customize it
according to our requirements.

1805
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:54,720
We can do that, right?

1806
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:57,640
We can delete all of that, guys.

1807
01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:01,560
We can delete all of the class name
and whatever the class name

1808
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:04,640
I want to keep,
I can keep only those class name.

1809
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,440
That's what I'm saying.

1810
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:09,000
Okay,

1811
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,040
earlier on, if you remember,
I had the same I had the same

1812
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:16,920
kind of structure right of this
to do not simplified what I did.

1813
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:20,080
I deleted all those class
names and I put this one

1814
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,360
self isolation one

1815
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:27,440
right this one from here.

1816
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:31,200
So definitely what you need to do
basically is let's say

1817
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:33,360
you must be having class name like this.

1818
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:36,400
See this tab class name right.

1819
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,880
You must be having these days
this and this.

1820
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,480
Right.

1821
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:42,440
Like this you will be having all of this
class name like this, right?

1822
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:43,600
Correct.

1823
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:48,560
Everyone.

1824
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:51,840
So what you do
just keep one class name for now.

1825
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,920
Class two class guys. See?

1826
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:57,120
Make sure this takes
what must be working after classes.

1827
01:55:57,400 --> 01:55:58,720
There will be class.

1828
01:55:58,720 --> 01:56:01,160
So class is start and class closing take.

1829
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:05,400
Right after that, all the class is
starting, class closing text

1830
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:08,160
In this last class
just remove them form Now

1831
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:13,880
just keep one class because I'm
taking the example of one class.

1832
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:17,080
Right. Okay. So that Mark Elizabeth

1833
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:24,360
it now everyone is on same page,
I believe.

1834
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:30,000
Right with me.

1835
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,520
Right. I again, I'm repeating again.

1836
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:34,720
I'm repeating only not Elizabeth Marx,

1837
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:38,920
but everyone, please
focus on the explanation.

1838
01:56:39,160 --> 01:56:41,800
I will commit this code in the repository
you will get.

1839
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:46,960
They demand every single line of code
will be available in the depository.

1840
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,840
Don't worry about it. Okay?

1841
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:50,280
Just focus on the concept.

1842
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,400
If you learn the concept,
you can play with this fight.

1843
01:56:53,640 --> 01:56:56,680
I'm teaching you
how to play with this configuration.

1844
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:58,640
Right? This is configuration file.

1845
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:03,640
We need to learn
how we can configure the things.

1846
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:05,800
Let's proceed for this.

1847
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:07,800
One more thing, guys. Let's see.

1848
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:13,440
In this particular class session, one
class, I want to execute my board methods.

1849
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:16,800
I want to execute all of my methods
and methods.

1850
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:20,000
Then I don't need
to parse this method. You

1851
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:22,920
simply I will write to my class.

1852
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,600
And that's it.

1853
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:25,560
That's it.

1854
01:57:25,640 --> 01:57:27,440
The moment I write my class name.

1855
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,960
Here it is more than okay.

1856
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,360
I don't need to do anything in that case.

1857
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:36,720
I don't need to do anything in that case,
because it will,

1858
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:40,800
by default, execute all of my methods
of this particular class.

1859
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,840
So now if I execute my test
and do not take symbol file,

1860
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:46,080
tell me how many tests it will execute

1861
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:51,040
to test this.

1862
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:52,320
It will execute. Right?

1863
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,840
Because I'm not excluding any method.

1864
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:59,000
I'm not including any methods by default
it is giving me right C

1865
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:04,520
one and one to select
one field one plus why it is failed

1866
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:08,400
because we were using softer solution
and there we had some fail associates.

1867
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,840
Right? Intentional.

1868
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,760
But you'll see the numbers two
if you go below

1869
01:58:13,080 --> 01:58:15,800
you will see totally test run this time.

1870
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:16,440
Correct

1871
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,360
either correctness

1872
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:33,560
right now let's proceed further.

1873
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:37,440
Whatever the things we committed
now we are going to know,

1874
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,920
don't every single thing First thing

1875
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:43,440
I was telling you

1876
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:46,280
know of,

1877
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:50,400
we have to test this
right in the assertion C one is this test

1878
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,760
another method and one is

1879
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:56,240
this test
to solve the solution validation.

1880
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:01,680
So so when I'm trying to execute

1881
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:05,080
both this right, I'm simply my class name.

1882
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:10,640
I, I'm not mentioning to include this
method or to exclude this method.

1883
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:14,120
I'm not doing anything like that. It

1884
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:21,000
all right now,

1885
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,360
whatever the things we are doing here,
we are doing

1886
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:26,840
only on one class, right?

1887
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:37,160
It's still the combination
of multiple classes.

1888
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:44,640
We thought we should see them in similar
file as, but you're talking about methods.

1889
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:47,040
So methods we we can see, right?

1890
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:50,880
We can see the methods.

1891
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:55,000
If we need to include some methods,
we need to exclude some methods.

1892
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:56,760
I just give you an example

1893
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,240
guys doing I give you that example

1894
02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:09,720
where we have included
some method excluded some method.

1895
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:20,360
Do you want me to repeat that part
once again, guys?

1896
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:22,560
Do you want me to repeat that part
once again?

1897
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:34,520
So including exclude part of methods?

1898
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:35,120
Sure.

1899
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:35,960
Why not

1900
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,760
see inside this class?

1901
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:42,360
Inside this class. Right.

1902
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:44,160
I'm going to write my method.

1903
02:00:44,160 --> 02:00:47,240
So here you'll see.

1904
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:48,920
These are my methods.

1905
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:49,840
I'm writing here.

1906
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:52,160
Methods I'm going to write.

1907
02:00:52,160 --> 02:00:54,320
Let's say I want to

1908
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:56,680
execute both these methods.

1909
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:58,880
These are the two methods.

1910
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:01,760
So if we want to customize our classes
based on our test,

1911
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:04,000
then we have the option
include including got.

1912
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:06,480
So inside my class.

1913
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:10,040
You need to understand
one thing here before understanding this,

1914
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:16,840
you need to understand
one thing like this for you.

1915
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:27,520
Remember in one project.

1916
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:29,160
In one project, right?

1917
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,440
You have

1918
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:36,680
multiple packages, right?

1919
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:43,720
This in one package.

1920
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:48,560
In one package we have multiple classes,

1921
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:52,520
correct.

1922
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,920
In one class,

1923
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:57,560
we have multiple methods.

1924
02:01:58,480 --> 02:01:59,360
Is it correct or not?

1925
02:01:59,360 --> 02:02:00,200
They said

1926
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:04,720
so now.

1927
02:02:04,720 --> 02:02:07,120
Now, while understanding this part

1928
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:11,840
does the implementation we will be having,
in our case candidate X symbol file

1929
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:15,080
how you will be having complete

1930
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:19,280
thought
and you can consider it as a project.

1931
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,280
Inside this you are having test.

1932
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:22,560
Just forget about testing.

1933
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,640
So I will explain this later.

1934
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:30,440
Inside this you will be having package
or multiple inside

1935
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:34,760
this you will be having classes inside
this, you will be having methods.

1936
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:35,800
Correct.

1937
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:41,120
So one class can in multiple metrics,
one package can in multiple classes,

1938
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:45,160
one based can in multiple packages,
one sort can have multiple test.

1939
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:47,800
Is it clear now

1940
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:51,120
if you come here, you'll see

1941
02:02:51,120 --> 02:02:53,480
inside classes there is a class

1942
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,520
that you can use inside of.

1943
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:58,480
So there is a test.

1944
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:00,480
Let me show you
this complete hierarchy. Here

1945
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:03,040
it is

1946
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,040
inside.

1947
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:07,360
So that is our test.

1948
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:08,320
Inside test.

1949
02:03:08,320 --> 02:03:11,160
There are multiple classes
inside the classes.

1950
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:12,880
There are class inside.

1951
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:15,040
The class, they're automatic, correct?

1952
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,840
They are meaning they are linked.

1953
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:23,000
These methods belong to this class, right?

1954
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:23,760
Right. Based.

1955
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:26,160
So I'm dealing with just one class
right now.

1956
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:29,120
Obviously,
so many things are coming forward.

1957
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:33,240
Currently, we are discussing how to play
with one class in multiple methods

1958
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:34,920
available inside that class.

1959
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:36,480
That's what we are learning.

1960
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:41,280
So if I want to include all the methods
which I'm having inside one class

1961
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:44,520
for execution
by default, identical mentioned

1962
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:48,960
because if I'm just mentioning the class
name, it will execute all of my methods.

1963
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,760
If I need to include some of the methods
that need to include,

1964
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:57,840
exclude some of the methods, then
I have to use this pragmatics inside this.

1965
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:00,200
Let's say
I want to include another method.

1966
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,360
So this is include.

1967
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:04,840
I to exclude this method
so I can right exclude this method.

1968
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:06,720
Simple correct

1969
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:08,960
categories.

1970
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,560
So now this time.

1971
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,920
This time
it will execute my sort of session

1972
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:17,280
one class and then it will execute
to my another method

1973
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:22,040
and it will not execute my soft assertion
validation method.

1974
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:30,000
Now clear to everyone.

1975
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:38,160
Great.

1976
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:40,040
So should I do this right?

1977
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:43,560
Let's say
I want to execute my one complete class.

1978
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:44,400
Right?

1979
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:48,440
But I'm thinking one thing here
I am thinking you're most welcome.

1980
02:04:48,680 --> 02:04:51,400
I'm thinking one thing

1981
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,720
up. You're using windows

1982
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:04,320
or you're using this Mac machine.

1983
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:07,560
Oxana
If you're using windows, then control Z.

1984
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:13,360
If you're after deleting Windows,

1985
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:17,520
after deleting or control
Z, simple controls the control Z,

1986
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:23,520
you will get that.

1987
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,240
Fine.

1988
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:26,680
Now I can see one thing.

1989
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:30,200
I want to execute multiple classes.

1990
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:32,200
I don't want to think of just one class.

1991
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:34,040
Okay, so let's try that.

1992
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:39,040
Also, what I'm going to do is right,
I'm going to execute another class.

1993
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:41,280
So let me take one more class.

1994
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:43,560
I'm going to create one more class.

1995
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,840
This class would be my

1996
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:47,640
first class, right?

1997
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:48,360
Simple name.

1998
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:52,160
I'm giving my best class yet
in my package, the beach package.

1999
02:05:52,200 --> 02:05:55,800
And talking about right
now, see Dawson text Art Class two.

2000
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:56,880
Right.

2001
02:05:58,040 --> 02:05:59,040
This is my package.

2002
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:01,480
So I'm going write, enter
a dist annotation.

2003
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:04,680
Then my normal method.

2004
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:06,120
I'm going to write

2005
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,680
this method here.

2006
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:12,160
Fine.

2007
02:06:12,160 --> 02:06:14,880
This is my method.

2008
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:15,600
Fine.

2009
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:19,000
And then again
I'm going to write another method

2010
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:21,880
as it is

2011
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:27,800
public void,

2012
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:39,160
another test method.

2013
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:40,640
This is my another test.

2014
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:44,600
Correct.

2015
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:46,120
This is my class.

2016
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:49,960
Now I want to execute my soft assertion.

2017
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:53,000
One class and my test class.

2018
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,800
Guys, these two classes
I want to execute together.

2019
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:57,760
Omnia.

2020
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:01,560
We didn't have any option
to execute two classes together.

2021
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:03,720
Now what test and acceptances?

2022
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:05,760
Go ahead,

2023
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:07,640
write this name

2024
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:11,280
here, Change the class name.

2025
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,440
So what is the class name?

2026
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:13,840
It says test class.

2027
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:16,240
For this fixed class you need to write

2028
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:21,120
correct. And

2029
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:28,240
now? Now C

2030
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:30,480
by default, by default.

2031
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,640
Here if you open. I have no method here.

2032
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:37,560
If I open this, I have to test here
to test and to test how many tests

2033
02:07:37,560 --> 02:07:38,440
in total

2034
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:43,600
correctly,
how many testing total for test,

2035
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:47,160
How many classes in total

2036
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:48,720
two classes.

2037
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:49,360
Correct.

2038
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:52,880
Let me go ahead and Nancy
and test in your text.

2039
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:55,960
Well, I will right click here
and I'm just see,

2040
02:07:55,960 --> 02:07:56,920
there's no

2041
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:03,360
I'm not changing anything in my
this class is in sort of section

2042
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,160
one and this class. Right.

2043
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:09,720
I'm not doing anything
inside of my classes.

2044
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:13,640
How many test cases executed
today's test fail the one positively.

2045
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:16,600
The total test.

2046
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:16,960
How much?

2047
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:20,160
Run for it?

2048
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:25,760
Is it correct?

2049
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:33,240
I hope you are understanding
what I'm doing here.

2050
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:35,480
Now let's do another customization.

2051
02:08:36,240 --> 02:08:38,160
I said inside of my class.

2052
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:40,680
I'm going to write metrics.

2053
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,600
Fine.

2054
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:46,440
This is the method thing
I'm going to write.

2055
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:48,240
So I'm going to write

2056
02:08:49,240 --> 02:08:50,520
include

2057
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:54,240
when a name is equals to

2058
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:55,160
inside myself.

2059
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:55,600
The solution.

2060
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:57,480
My method name is

2061
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:04,360
another method, correct?

2062
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:09,960
So I'm seeing

2063
02:09:10,160 --> 02:09:13,800
in my two classes I have four methods.

2064
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:16,720
In my two classes
I have how many methods for method.

2065
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:18,760
It means total for test.

2066
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:21,320
I don't want to execute all four.

2067
02:09:21,320 --> 02:09:24,680
I to execute just two one

2068
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:27,800
from test
class, one from the solution, one class.

2069
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:28,720
Right.

2070
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:32,640
In my two classes I have four out of this.

2071
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:36,000
Four I want to exclude two,
I want to include two.

2072
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:39,600
So for exclusion,
I don't need to mention for inclusion.

2073
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:42,840
I need to mention it means the ones

2074
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:46,280
who are not in inclusion by default
they are in exclusion.

2075
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:53,040
Correct.

2076
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:56,240
Now, if I,
if I execute this particular test

2077
02:09:56,280 --> 02:10:23,800
and you don't take someone by now,
see what happens, fine.

2078
02:10:24,080 --> 02:10:26,400
Can you see that just to test executed.

2079
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:34,560
Correct.

2080
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:35,040
This is the

2081
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:41,400
we can do.

2082
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:42,360
All right.

2083
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:43,880
When do you have to create a new symbol?

2084
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:45,120
Fine. Up for the customization order.

2085
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:48,680
For each customization,
you don't need to basically write

2086
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,400
as long as you are
done with one file. Right?

2087
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:52,680
It should be okay.

2088
02:10:52,680 --> 02:10:53,720
It should be okay.

2089
02:10:53,720 --> 02:10:56,880
In my opinion.

2090
02:10:56,880 --> 02:10:57,520
Correct.

2091
02:10:58,480 --> 02:11:00,000
Now let's proceed further.

2092
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,720
Let's try to learn
so many new things in this set.

2093
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:07,200
In this test entered our next middle class
is still we are not done this one class.

2094
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:08,080
All right?

2095
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:11,400
We have to do so many things here

2096
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:27,040
right now after this.

2097
02:11:27,040 --> 02:11:29,400
After this.
The most important part, right?

2098
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:33,600
The one you asked right now.

2099
02:11:33,600 --> 02:11:36,040
Yeah, right. 2 hours will be gone.

2100
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:38,760
Don't worry about 2 hours will be gone,
believe me

2101
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:40,320
again.

2102
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,480
Let's try to do the same activity, guys.

2103
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:44,240
Let's try to do the same activities,

2104
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:46,560
which I do it

2105
02:11:47,240 --> 02:11:47,640
right.

2106
02:11:47,640 --> 02:11:51,000
Click on your project.

2107
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,800
Do it with me if you wish to.

2108
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:56,600
Otherwise, just look at how you create
standard or take symbol,

2109
02:11:58,400 --> 02:12:01,920
click okay.

2110
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,720
Right click on your project.

2111
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:04,840
Click on Create Distance.

2112
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:07,520
You click okay

2113
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:09,760
and then again, reload your project from

2114
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:15,760
now, again, right control point.

2115
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:19,040
And can you see my previous

2116
02:12:19,440 --> 02:12:22,240
my previous part was gone.

2117
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:26,640
It was gone.

2118
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:28,920
It's not here anymore. Right?

2119
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:30,000
New configuration.

2120
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:38,400
I got my point.

2121
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:42,640
That is, did you get what I did here?

2122
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:45,560
It created a new test and do not simplify

2123
02:12:46,240 --> 02:12:52,800
what happened.

2124
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:58,200
So got to correct the new test
and you take similar file over

2125
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:03,680
then the previous one by
because the name is seen,

2126
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:09,600
the name you see right now what
we have to do in in this case, basically

2127
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,200
point blank,

2128
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:16,800
this is my previous file, correct.

2129
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:19,240
If I want to create a new file,

2130
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:23,800
I have to make sure that this symbol
should be the unique name.

2131
02:13:23,800 --> 02:13:27,720
So before doing that, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to rename this

2132
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:29,280
standard or symbol file.

2133
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:31,800
So I'm saying, here is

2134
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:36,480
this in one dot, right?

2135
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:37,800
I'm going to do a factory test.

2136
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,960
And you are correct.

2137
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:41,800
I just rename it.

2138
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:43,440
Now let's do one thing.

2139
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:49,360
I'm going to create another test
and do not file Trump Yet, despite.

2140
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:53,800
Okay, right click the note from this

2141
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:56,760
find.

2142
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:59,760
If you see this,
then do not accept any new file over here.

2143
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:03,800
This is my new test
and you detect something

2144
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:12,480
correct.

2145
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:20,040
Just go to the issue of ordered.

2146
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:46,400
So now we'll be having to test
and you will find here, correct?

2147
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:47,760
Correct.

2148
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:55,200
Exactly.

2149
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:56,800
Let me do one more thing.

2150
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,680
Let me do one more thing.

2151
02:14:58,680 --> 02:14:59,920
Let me bring in this file.

2152
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:06,280
Also defective rename and I'm writing this
to you to protect similar to this one.

2153
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:09,960
And this time I'm going to create
not from my project

2154
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:13,640
not from my project,

2155
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:17,120
but from my package, right click

2156
02:15:18,680 --> 02:15:19,320
create test.

2157
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:21,160
And you're not assembly click.

2158
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:26,160
Okay, reload.

2159
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,400
From this,

2160
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:30,960
you'll see that third test and you're not

2161
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:35,160
this time.

2162
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:37,280
If you'll see this time.

2163
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:42,280
If you see it comes only with the classes
which are available in this package.

2164
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:47,080
Only there is no other class from package
one, the class one package.

2165
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:50,360
All the classes are from only class
two package.

2166
02:15:50,680 --> 02:15:51,880
Why is it so?

2167
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:56,360
Because this time I have created my test
and do not take well from package

2168
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:04,200
new thing observed or not

2169
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:05,720
correct.

2170
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:10,920
My package name is start class two.

2171
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:16,400
Yes and earlier I was creating the test
engendered excel file from my project.

2172
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:19,000
Right. So. Right. Exactly.

2173
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:22,200
So this time let's say I have 1000 classes

2174
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:25,240
in my one package
and 1000 classes in second package.

2175
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:28,520
If I needed my test
and do not take from project,

2176
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:33,120
I will be having this two classes
inside my one test and do not examine.

2177
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:33,720
Fine.

2178
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:36,680
Then it will be very difficult for me
to identify

2179
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:40,320
those 1000
here, 1000 there and still do what can do.

2180
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:42,280
I can simply go in my project.

2181
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:46,280
I will right click on my project
and create new test in your taxable file.

2182
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:50,040
So in that case, I would be aiming
only those 1000 classes

2183
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:52,440
which are available inside my package.

2184
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:59,640
Correct.

2185
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:00,640
Understanding my point

2186
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:11,160
is they shouldn't go in boring now.

2187
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:12,200
Or is it

2188
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:13,360
okay?

2189
02:17:13,360 --> 02:17:17,360
Okay.

2190
02:17:17,360 --> 02:17:21,680
Mykes as it is going boarding now.

2191
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:22,080
All right.

2192
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:25,920
Because list number of jokes that are to
the decision because their topic is very

2193
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:27,680
their topic is it?

2194
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:31,760
You know what I would say import.

2195
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:35,760
That's why.

2196
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:36,440
Fine.

2197
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,360
Let's proceed for the next for further.

2198
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:41,840
I'm seeing one more problem.

2199
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:55,520
Great.

2200
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:58,840
Getting correct.

2201
02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:02,560
So now see, one more thing.

2202
02:18:02,560 --> 02:18:06,160
Let's say
in my up for method level for class level

2203
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:11,400
and then of multiple classes
inside one to standard or text.

2204
02:18:11,480 --> 02:18:14,000
Well these the things
we are done with correct

2205
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,240
you know how to include it
exclude metrics right

2206
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:21,400
you know how to include in exclude classes
also right

2207
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:24,560
correct or not based on

2208
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:29,320
super.

2209
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:31,360
No. I also one thing

2210
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:33,520
that in my one

2211
02:18:33,520 --> 02:18:36,040
package I'm working on 17 project.

2212
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:41,200
So in my one package, in my single
package, I'm having a lot of classes

2213
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:46,000
5.600, 700 classes.

2214
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,960
I want to execute all of them.

2215
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:50,080
What do you expect?

2216
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:52,880
Should I write
all those 500, 600 classmates

2217
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:56,880
or should it eight include this class?

2218
02:18:56,880 --> 02:19:00,160
Exclude class one and to discuss
not simple.

2219
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:02,360
I want to execute all of those.

2220
02:19:02,360 --> 02:19:05,720
All of those classes right inside
one package.

2221
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:08,640
Let's say I have
how many classes? 500. 600.

2222
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:11,160
I want to execute all of them.

2223
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:13,880
What is the best way to do it?

2224
02:19:13,880 --> 02:19:17,040
Let me show you this.

2225
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:25,200
Correct.

2226
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:27,440
Classes deleted.

2227
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:37,760
I don't want any class.

2228
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:40,680
I'm going to write packages

2229
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:42,640
inside the packages which package

2230
02:19:42,640 --> 02:19:46,200
you need, which package you need.

2231
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:48,880
So I said my package will see a dot

2232
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:51,560
syntax Dark Class two.

2233
02:19:52,480 --> 02:19:54,960
This is my package. Correct.

2234
02:19:56,440 --> 02:19:59,520
You send not only this package,
I need one more package.

2235
02:19:59,520 --> 02:20:01,280
I said, okay, fine. Big package.

2236
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:04,800
So you will see my package would be C dot

2237
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:07,480
syntax. Dot

2238
02:20:14,520 --> 02:20:16,960
block one point

2239
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:19,120
right now, whatever

2240
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:24,800
the classes, whatever the classes
I have inside these two packages,

2241
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:29,080
it will execute all of those classes
inside one class.

2242
02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:34,600
If I have multiple methods, it
will execute all of those metrics correct.

2243
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:40,840
So now this is the whole scope of this
thing inside one package of 500 classes.

2244
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:45,520
No, what is just the one
line will execute all 500 classes

2245
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:48,480
or 2000 methods
you have inside those 500 classes.

2246
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:52,200
These two lines of code
will execute your two packages.

2247
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:55,520
That is having 1000 classes,
having 3000 methods inside them.

2248
02:20:55,920 --> 02:21:00,600
Every single thing will be executed
just by including the package name here.

2249
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:01,440
Clear.

2250
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:04,120
Let me show it right.

2251
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:13,080
Let me try to run
just one package from see, this time

2252
02:21:13,080 --> 02:21:19,040
I'm going to execute this package,
this test and do not single file.

2253
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:21,200
I'm going to execute

2254
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:26,960
method based execution vaccine class phase
execution.

2255
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:28,760
Vaccine package is execution.

2256
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:31,120
Now we see

2257
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:03,880
the good one. Mike

2258
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:06,360
Right, guys.

2259
02:22:06,360 --> 02:22:09,120
See now here, if I go

2260
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:14,160
if I go and I see, I test switch.

2261
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:14,960
Totally test.

2262
02:22:14,960 --> 02:22:16,040
How much?

2263
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:18,440
See, let me close it first.

2264
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:21,280
Let me show you the other. You'll see.

2265
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:24,640
Let me close this also

2266
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:28,480
depends on attribute depends on attribute

2267
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:33,200
soft assertion
one soft assertion one soft assertion

2268
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:36,120
to softer session to best class

2269
02:22:36,640 --> 02:22:41,320
first class
all four classes from package to eight

2270
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:45,080
executed inside these four classes
How many test it?

2271
02:22:45,080 --> 02:22:47,720
What executed c do I have yet

2272
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:52,720
right and then for what I have yet

2273
02:22:54,360 --> 02:22:56,200
to add it

2274
02:22:57,480 --> 02:23:00,120
and how many ideas

2275
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:04,320
right total eight

2276
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:06,120
then.

2277
02:23:07,080 --> 02:23:10,360
All right did this executed just one
that is verified logo.

2278
02:23:10,600 --> 02:23:10,920
Right.

2279
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:14,640
It is equal to two in one three
after three.

2280
02:23:14,640 --> 02:23:16,680
It executed just three

2281
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:20,160
and then it executed this
to how many total eight test cases.

2282
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:22,200
It got executed. The details are here.

2283
02:23:22,600 --> 02:23:23,600
Valid log in.

2284
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:26,760
It executed right.

2285
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:29,160
Another method in soft assertion
validation

2286
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:34,440
it executed and log in verified
based voted executing.

2287
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:37,280
You'll see all of this method name.

2288
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:41,520
Also whatever the things I mentioned,
he had it executed here you'll see.

2289
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:42,360
Right.

2290
02:23:42,440 --> 02:23:45,160
Total test run eight Bostic years two.

2291
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:49,080
This is your consolidated report

2292
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:51,600
you got from here of the one package.

2293
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:53,800
Now tell me one thing.

2294
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:58,520
If I want to execute all of the classes
I have throughout my project.

2295
02:23:58,520 --> 02:23:59,120
What should I do?

2296
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:03,960
All the classes I have inside my project

2297
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:15,120
what should I do in that case?

2298
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:16,120
Simple.

2299
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:20,360
Just to mention all the package name.

2300
02:24:20,360 --> 02:24:22,600
No, not project simple.

2301
02:24:22,600 --> 02:24:23,840
Just write all the package name.

2302
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:27,160
Correct.

2303
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:29,680
You guys are having
very good impression of this 20.

2304
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:31,400
You think that's ten?

2305
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:38,560
He can do anything.

2306
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:41,000
Okay. Getting my point

2307
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:44,760
this here instead of classical,
you can write class one

2308
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:47,640
and then it will execute
all of the classes from package one.

2309
02:24:48,360 --> 02:24:49,000
Right?

2310
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:52,000
If you write for both the package syntax

2311
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:55,520
or class and start, where did you clear
the symbol for package?

2312
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:57,560
Just right click on the package.

2313
02:24:57,560 --> 02:24:58,280
Let's

2314
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:03,920
right
click on the package and create, test

2315
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:06,680
and do not accessible from the package

2316
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:09,000
books. Enter.
You said not really for what?

2317
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:09,680
Not understood

2318
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:34,440
for the entire project.

2319
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:39,240
You mean?

2320
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,960
Yes. Black Correct? Yes.

2321
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:42,720
It is a best practice to change it.

2322
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:43,120
We will.

2323
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:45,160
I will show you that also.
Don't worry about it.

2324
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:46,680
I will show you that

2325
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:53,280
we do that for sure.

2326
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,800
For the project.

2327
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:56,520
No, just one simplified.

2328
02:25:56,520 --> 02:25:58,400
It includes all the packages
name in there.

2329
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:04,240
So we generally execute all right,
so this is the least we can do, right?

2330
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:07,680
But yes, there are some more configuration
which we can make here

2331
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:09,480
in order to make a life easier.

2332
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:10,080
Okay.

2333
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:14,760
So those configurations
we are going to make now.

2334
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:16,320
Okay. So far,

2335
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:17,840
is it clear to everyone?

2336
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:29,960
So for whatever the things we did, getting

2337
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:33,640
let's go back to the slide

2338
02:26:33,640 --> 02:26:44,680
first.

2339
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:49,440
What is the second effort
extended or similar?

2340
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:50,400
It is file there.

2341
02:26:50,400 --> 02:26:54,200
Describe configuration of first
and usually using this change of file

2342
02:26:54,200 --> 02:27:00,480
we can test available in one or more class
by right.

2343
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:04,440
This didn't do not take civil file
use to pass that and we test for the test

2344
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:07,400
methods that I will look into this
after some time.

2345
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:10,920
This Didn't do not examine file provides
different options

2346
02:27:10,920 --> 02:27:13,920
to include packages, classes methods.

2347
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:16,320
In our case,
we are doing all of this things

2348
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:22,400
like it allows us to

2349
02:27:22,400 --> 02:27:26,600
configure my people test in a single test
to switch and run them in multi-threaded.

2350
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:27,680
And this is what?

2351
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:30,800
Because parallel testing might be played,
we will see that.

2352
02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:34,320
Remember one thing
when we were learning this

2353
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:38,080
before the method after method, I skip

2354
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:44,040
the intentionally to part.

2355
02:27:44,040 --> 02:27:45,440
Which part I will

2356
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:50,040
see here is test class based annotations

2357
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:54,520
before class, after class, before method
after method test.

2358
02:27:55,160 --> 02:27:57,760
These are class based annotation, right?

2359
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:01,680
If you go here before this week,
before after.

2360
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:05,520
See these are SML based annotations.

2361
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:06,840
Can you see

2362
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:10,720
the difference test
and do not SML based annotations?

2363
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:14,000
Why? I'm saying these are just
some of the best annotations.

2364
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:15,720
Let me show you

2365
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:20,160
right.

2366
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:22,520
One class.
Okay, so I'm going to write here

2367
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:26,440
classes.

2368
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:28,920
This would be my class,

2369
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:31,080
so I'm going to write here.

2370
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:33,360
I just didn't do it last night.

2371
02:28:33,360 --> 02:28:36,000
I'm going to use one class, Correct.

2372
02:28:37,440 --> 02:28:38,600
This is my class.

2373
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:42,640
Let me open this class.

2374
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:44,680
How many metrics
I have inside of this class based?

2375
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:45,360
Tell me

2376
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:50,120
three methods

2377
02:28:52,360 --> 02:29:25,640
that I'm going to write here.

2378
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:48,640
And then I'm going to write then

2379
02:30:29,560 --> 02:30:31,000
now, before class

2380
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:34,200
executes, before the execution of class,

2381
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:40,080
after class executes, after the execution,
before method after method, done

2382
02:30:40,240 --> 02:30:44,040
right before every test, after every test,
there is

2383
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:47,640
another one called the rate

2384
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:48,960
before

2385
02:30:48,960 --> 02:31:31,600
test.

2386
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:35,880
Now see, I'm writing at the rate
before test, right after this.

2387
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:38,560
I have written
this piece of code. Correct.

2388
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:41,960
Now let's go back to our
test and do not take point

2389
02:31:43,920 --> 02:31:44,440
here.

2390
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:47,040
When you see this test to take guys

2391
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,200
video, see the test today

2392
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:51,160
inside the class.

2393
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:58,440
What I would say to the class,
outside the class

2394
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,760
inside one test,

2395
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:17,520
can I have multiple classes?

2396
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:19,960
Can I have two classes

2397
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:25,080
I can have right

2398
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:27,480
when I write this

2399
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:31,400
before test, read after test,
how many times

2400
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:43,560
it will execute when I have two classes.

2401
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:44,440
All right.

2402
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:47,280
If it executes two times,

2403
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:50,280
then what is the difference
in between before class and before test?

2404
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:55,080
Because class will also execute two times
y Because before class

2405
02:32:55,360 --> 02:32:58,480
always executes
before execution of the class.

2406
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:02,760
Correct.

2407
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:08,360
Getting my point based these two classes
is a part of single test.

2408
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:09,680
Can you see?

2409
02:33:09,960 --> 02:33:13,560
So whatever the condition
you're putting inside before test

2410
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:16,080
it will execute just for one time.

2411
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:18,600
Doesn't matter how many classes you have

2412
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:21,280
after test will

2413
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:24,480
execute just one time
liquidated liquid printing.

2414
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:28,320
First, I'm going to run them

2415
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:56,920
state.

2416
02:33:56,920 --> 02:34:05,280
Then I've written that test class, not

2417
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,960
for the classmate.

2418
02:34:17,960 --> 02:34:20,320
So I have to write here.

2419
02:34:20,400 --> 02:34:25,320
This is mine.

2420
02:34:25,320 --> 02:34:26,160
In package one.

2421
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:28,280
It is fine

2422
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:52,040
for me.

2423
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:56,080
The one thing.

2424
02:34:56,080 --> 02:34:58,720
Yeah, that's fine. That's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm doing.

2425
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:20,640
Don't.

2426
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:22,760
No, I think everything is good.
You got it.

2427
02:35:23,840 --> 02:35:36,760
So now if I go on my test and similar,
this would be my test class right now.

2428
02:35:36,760 --> 02:35:37,520
If I execute.

2429
02:35:37,520 --> 02:35:47,520
See, because we have so many classes,

2430
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:50,040
so even I'm getting confused
where we are writing the code.

2431
02:35:51,480 --> 02:36:00,200
That's funny, right?

2432
02:36:00,480 --> 02:36:03,280
Can you see it executed? I am before test.

2433
02:36:03,440 --> 02:36:06,360
It means this code executed.

2434
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:09,440
Before that I am before test executing.

2435
02:36:09,440 --> 02:36:09,840
Correct.

2436
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:12,560
And then I am before class.

2437
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:14,480
Then I am before method.

2438
02:36:14,480 --> 02:36:15,760
Then this is another matter.

2439
02:36:15,760 --> 02:36:17,880
Latest in the class. Fine.
Then after the method.

2440
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:19,080
Then before my third.

2441
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:19,840
After my third.

2442
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:22,320
Before my third method and after method.

2443
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:25,960
In the end it says estimated right.

2444
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:29,440
I am after class. Why?

2445
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:34,360
I'm after class.

2446
02:36:34,360 --> 02:36:36,560
Guys, this is for after class, right?

2447
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:39,520
And then another class execute it
for estimated right?

2448
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:44,520
In the end you'll get this option
which is in the last call time after test.

2449
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,160
The last statement is after test.

2450
02:36:47,160 --> 02:36:50,760
It means what
your two classes executed together

2451
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:54,600
all methods executed all the classes
executed.

2452
02:36:54,840 --> 02:36:58,600
A statements executed before class,
before method before

2453
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:02,560
test, before method
after class, after method extract test.

2454
02:37:02,560 --> 02:37:03,880
Everything executed.

2455
02:37:03,880 --> 02:37:06,480
But before test executes.

2456
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:09,440
Just before the test
and after test execute.

2457
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:13,760
In the end of the test player,
you'll see this is the last district.

2458
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:14,920
Meantime, after test

2459
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:16,800
and this is the

2460
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:20,400
first statement I am before this
in between this you'll see

2461
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:24,520
these are two classes
executed inside these two classes.

2462
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:27,880
All of this method is executed.

2463
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:35,200
Is it correct?

2464
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:39,160
Now there is a big difference
in between before tested,

2465
02:37:39,160 --> 02:37:42,360
before method,
before the method executes, before

2466
02:37:42,360 --> 02:37:46,040
every test.

2467
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:50,360
Can you see you can't relate two things
together right before method executes.

2468
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:52,480
Let's say you have 100 test cases.

2469
02:37:52,480 --> 02:37:55,560
If you put before test,
then it will execute hundred times.

2470
02:37:56,320 --> 02:37:59,280
But if you write before test,
it will execute just one time

2471
02:37:59,320 --> 02:38:04,280
and then after hundred executions
it will execute after test.

2472
02:38:04,280 --> 02:38:07,480
But before the method executes
hundred time, it after method

2473
02:38:07,560 --> 02:38:09,280
to execute from today.

2474
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:10,400
This is the difference.

2475
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:19,560
Getting my point.

2476
02:38:19,560 --> 02:38:20,200
Great.

2477
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:22,880
Right so far clear everything everyone

2478
02:38:40,280 --> 02:38:40,800
three

2479
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:44,480
okay,

2480
02:38:45,120 --> 02:38:50,400
let's proceed to order.

2481
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:52,440
So far so good. Correct.

2482
02:38:52,440 --> 02:39:01,560
Everyone.

2483
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:05,520
Why do we have one before
test in one class, another before test

2484
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:06,880
in another class?

2485
02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:10,080
We need to verify right that if.

2486
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:13,080
Okay, so this is the it will not work.

2487
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:14,000
Right?

2488
02:39:14,080 --> 02:39:16,200
Because test could be only one grade.

2489
02:39:17,080 --> 02:39:17,520
It should be.

2490
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:20,160
If you have multiple test.

2491
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:23,520
If you have multiple test,
then you will be having before tested

2492
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:28,440
after test examples that we will discuss
but before tested after test.

2493
02:39:28,440 --> 02:39:32,760
If it is just one test, then two values
for one test will not work.

2494
02:39:33,400 --> 02:39:39,960
Okay, Got it.

2495
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:42,080
Let's go ahead.

2496
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:42,840
Today's

2497
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,120
the next one.

2498
02:39:55,240 --> 02:39:57,880
The next one, which I want to show
you here is

2499
02:39:58,480 --> 02:40:00,880
is still one day remaining.

2500
02:40:00,880 --> 02:40:04,080
One thing is still remaining
before sweating after sleep.

2501
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:06,920
Let's go ahead and implement that.

2502
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:10,600
Also now.

2503
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:14,240
Now I'm going to go ahead and write

2504
02:40:14,240 --> 02:40:15,840
again inside my first class.

2505
02:40:15,840 --> 02:41:03,720
I'm going to write here.

2506
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:04,640
All right.

2507
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:08,880
Now, I've done this the first week
after switch in, say the one class, Right.

2508
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:11,960
Tell me in this execution,

2509
02:41:11,960 --> 02:41:15,920
if I execute again,
my test will write my test.

2510
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:18,240
And you taught me how many.

2511
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:21,720
So you can see here this one.

2512
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:25,200
So how many times my suit executes

2513
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:29,280
one time

2514
02:41:29,560 --> 02:41:32,120
it will execute before test on our biggest

2515
02:41:35,880 --> 02:41:36,520
before.

2516
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:37,240
Correct.

2517
02:41:37,440 --> 02:41:39,360
Now, the idiocy, the scope.

2518
02:41:39,360 --> 02:41:41,800
The scope is getting larger.

2519
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:44,960
We discussed with before my method
the scope was just for one test.

2520
02:41:45,440 --> 02:41:47,920
Before class, the scope was multiple, test

2521
02:41:48,360 --> 02:41:52,000
before test scope was multiple,
class before.

2522
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,200
So it is scope of multiple test. Right?

2523
02:41:55,440 --> 02:41:58,120
So the scope is getting larger.

2524
02:41:58,120 --> 02:42:01,400
Let me execute it
first, then I will show you

2525
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:04,960
the overall idea

2526
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:14,120
is it will work.

2527
02:42:14,120 --> 02:42:14,920
It will work.

2528
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:15,680
No issues are done.

2529
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:17,640
I will show you that also subject
right now.

2530
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:20,080
I'm going to show you this
right after that.

2531
02:42:20,080 --> 02:42:23,880
What we see now the first week is

2532
02:42:23,880 --> 02:42:26,600
I am before this week
and I am before test.

2533
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:30,320
You won't find this a statement
throughout your class and in the last

2534
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:33,880
you will see here
I am after test and I'm off this week

2535
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:43,880
and that is correct or not.

2536
02:42:43,880 --> 02:42:49,120
But now if you change
the order of the class, fine position.

2537
02:42:49,120 --> 02:42:49,680
Let's see.

2538
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:51,120
Let's do this

2539
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
and then try to execute.

2540
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,360
Does it make any difference?

2541
02:42:59,360 --> 02:43:00,120
No difference.

2542
02:43:00,120 --> 02:43:02,160
This test class will execute later.

2543
02:43:02,160 --> 02:43:04,600
This class will execute first.

2544
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:07,200
Simple, because it is following the

2545
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:10,960
order, correct? Correct.

2546
02:43:12,080 --> 02:43:13,840
The scope is getting expanded.

2547
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:17,480
No, you'll see.

2548
02:43:17,480 --> 02:43:22,440
Softer section executed for this class
executed second but state before.

2549
02:43:22,440 --> 02:43:25,440
So it executed before. Test executed.

2550
02:43:25,440 --> 02:43:27,240
Then executed.

2551
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:30,680
Then all of your code
and in the and also after test

2552
02:43:30,680 --> 02:43:32,880
and after with executed correct

2553
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:50,240
fine so far

2554
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:51,600
so whatever you want

2555
02:43:59,880 --> 02:44:01,920
but I need to learn something new again

2556
02:44:11,560 --> 02:44:14,560
if need a one more break and this

2557
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:17,040
you guys need break

2558
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:21,120
of this did that

2559
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:24,880
why confused
I mean, is it difficult to understand

2560
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:35,920
what I'm showing right now?

2561
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:37,200
Okay static

2562
02:44:38,040 --> 02:44:40,280
is working fast break

2563
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:46,360
or next topic.

2564
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:47,160
Okay.

2565
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:51,000
So maybe we will see that.

2566
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,800
We will see. Next topic.

2567
02:44:52,800 --> 02:44:57,560
The same what you're asking.

2568
02:44:57,560 --> 02:44:58,080
All right.

2569
02:44:58,080 --> 02:44:58,560
All right.

2570
02:44:58,560 --> 02:45:01,960
We share more. So let's take a break then.

2571
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,080
Okay, guys,

2572
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:05,760
10 minutes.

2573
02:45:05,760 --> 02:45:15,320
Enough.

2574
02:45:15,320 --> 02:45:16,480
All big.

2575
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:20,040
No. Okay, guys, let's take a break.

2576
02:45:21,560 --> 02:45:23,760
All right, Just in due to

2577
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:27,480
this one, just double

2578
02:45:27,480 --> 02:45:37,320
click on it.

2579
02:45:37,320 --> 02:45:38,160
Yes, double click

2580
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:41,920
on an extended or accessible file
and then you'll be able to open next

2581
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:43,040
and you take somebody.

2582
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:49,880
Okay.

2583
02:45:49,880 --> 02:45:51,240
No break is not started here.

2584
02:45:51,240 --> 02:45:53,280
The guys because they have questions.

2585
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:59,160
So I'm just trying to resolve
their queries.

2586
02:45:59,160 --> 02:46:00,280
Correct Word.

2587
02:46:00,280 --> 02:46:11,160
You got it.

2588
02:46:11,160 --> 02:46:16,560
How did you create noticed in G class
two of you just need to rename it right?

2589
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:18,920
First you have to rename it. That's it.

2590
02:46:18,920 --> 02:46:20,400
This just a neurotic symbol.

2591
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:24,160
You have to right
click here, refactor and rename.

2592
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:26,960
And once you do that, create a new test
and you accept and

2593
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:30,880
then you will be able to create
this test indeed to the next level.

2594
02:46:30,880 --> 02:46:33,960
File 1.6 Simplified B have renamed them.

2595
02:46:34,280 --> 02:46:40,560
That's why they are the new one.

2596
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:42,960
Great. All right, guys. Now break starts

2597
02:46:46,440 --> 02:46:48,160
cardigans week.

2598
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:54,960
So before the break, we went to this part.

2599
02:46:54,960 --> 02:46:57,880
We went to this bar for test
and you will buy it right then.

2600
02:46:57,880 --> 02:47:01,880
We have seen
all the different combinations right now

2601
02:47:02,280 --> 02:47:05,320
towards getting more flexibility,

2602
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:08,200
towards getting more flexibility
from this portion.

2603
02:47:08,520 --> 02:47:10,760
We have to learn another topic
here. Right.

2604
02:47:11,040 --> 02:47:14,520
And what the topic is
we are going to study it now. See,

2605
02:47:15,560 --> 02:47:18,040
let's see.

2606
02:47:18,040 --> 02:47:21,360
Let me share my screen with you This

2607
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:30,480
you joined an organization, right?

2608
02:47:30,480 --> 02:47:33,720
So what is the ideal duration
of constraint If you are working

2609
02:47:33,720 --> 02:47:46,160
in district Agile or supported by Agile,
what is the ideal of spring?

2610
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:49,480
No, the ideal duration of the spring
is always two weeks.

2611
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:52,480
Remember, these are always two weeks.

2612
02:47:52,480 --> 02:47:55,360
They are.

2613
02:47:55,360 --> 02:47:58,800
Now let's say you have already joined one
organization, right?

2614
02:47:58,840 --> 02:48:02,360
Which is already stable and they have
the process and every single thing

2615
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:05,800
you have started working right And again

2616
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:12,480
and in the spring, the one next spring,
the one you work on think this gives us

2617
02:48:16,080 --> 02:48:19,520
this is the overall your project duration.

2618
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:23,160
Then in spring to

2619
02:48:23,160 --> 02:48:26,480
spring your work done it is to get this

2620
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:29,680
in the spring three.

2621
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:32,120
Let's say you are working
on some critical user studies.

2622
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:35,920
Are you logged on
just to fight this disease

2623
02:48:35,960 --> 02:48:38,520
and it is trained for

2624
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:39,720
you logged on.

2625
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:42,120
Lesson 11 This gets this.

2626
02:48:42,120 --> 02:48:45,600
I'm just giving you random numbers
right on and on.

2627
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:49,080
Eight, 513, 13, 11 2424 compatible

2628
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:52,440
you worked on 34 test cases in your

2629
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:54,600
for is correct

2630
02:48:56,480 --> 02:48:59,200
that you have done 34

2631
02:48:59,200 --> 02:49:01,800
test cases
in your four different settings.

2632
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:10,560
Now you entered into Sprint five

2633
02:49:12,120 --> 02:49:15,520
and you are planning to take
some more courses to execute.

2634
02:49:16,240 --> 02:49:20,560
But if you're entering into this doesn't
mean whatever the test

2635
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:24,880
because as you have written in the last
for the spring, you will not execute them.

2636
02:49:24,880 --> 02:49:26,400
You have to execute them or not.

2637
02:49:27,960 --> 02:49:29,400
This is strengths.

2638
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:32,040
Just to get this,
you have to execute all these 34 right

2639
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:37,000
along with the new test cases
you will be writing in this big five

2640
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:38,680
you have to correct.

2641
02:49:38,680 --> 02:49:41,280
You have to execute the remaining test.

2642
02:49:41,480 --> 02:49:43,680
This of all the four sprints,
you have to execute

2643
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,280
for the spring, 5% is fine.

2644
02:49:47,280 --> 02:49:49,040
You are working later in 51.

2645
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:51,200
This thing is sprint 51.

2646
02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:55,440
Should I consider that
almost 300 discourses?

2647
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:59,360
You have executed 300 because as you have
written in, you want to sprint in

2648
02:49:59,360 --> 02:50:03,480
just 40 sprint
when you have, let's say 34 test cases.

2649
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:07,400
So in 50 sprint you can have 300 test
because is also possible.

2650
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:13,160
Now here maintaining this three
and because this would be difficult of not

2651
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:16,960
can in this three and take this
because this makes it

2652
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:20,200
you have 29
test cases belong to smoke testing

2653
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:25,840
and 301 test because this belongs to your

2654
02:50:28,360 --> 02:50:29,800
integration test unless it

2655
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:33,800
complete 330 300 complete test cases

2656
02:50:33,800 --> 02:50:37,800
but be a integration out of this
29 belong to smoke.

2657
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:40,360
Is it possible or not possible?

2658
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,680
But when you have 300 test cases,

2659
02:50:45,040 --> 02:50:48,480
when you have three and it says
don't think it would be very difficult

2660
02:50:48,480 --> 02:50:51,600
for you to execute
only a small switch from there.

2661
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:54,920
Isn't it difficult

2662
02:50:55,760 --> 02:50:58,080
only in that you 29 test get this

2663
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:00,360
What do you have to do
from our existing setup?

2664
02:51:00,360 --> 02:51:03,120
You have to include those test
cases, those 29

2665
02:51:03,400 --> 02:51:05,480
and then you have to exclude
remaining 300.

2666
02:51:06,280 --> 02:51:11,160
But to include this, remain at this 29
smoke test because this in your framework,

2667
02:51:11,440 --> 02:51:14,960
in your code, in your testing,
it is also a

2668
02:51:14,960 --> 02:51:19,240
bit test, correct?

2669
02:51:19,240 --> 02:51:19,600
Because

2670
02:51:20,560 --> 02:51:22,160
it is a big test.

2671
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:24,880
So this
then just says you don't have to mention

2672
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:28,200
not do don't mention this include
or exclude the test

2673
02:51:28,200 --> 02:51:34,080
because this institute you can segregate
you can separate all of your test cases

2674
02:51:34,080 --> 02:51:37,360
according to your requirements
in multiple groups.

2675
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:41,360
What we can do is we can separate

2676
02:51:41,640 --> 02:51:45,240
all of our test cases
in multiple groups, right?

2677
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:49,320
So when I in multiple groups
let me go inside of my any class,

2678
02:51:49,320 --> 02:51:54,040
like let's say this is my first class,
I'm going inside now.

2679
02:51:54,040 --> 02:51:56,920
See how many kids to get this.

2680
02:51:56,920 --> 02:51:58,080
I have you

2681
02:52:00,480 --> 02:52:02,920
retest to get this correct.

2682
02:52:02,920 --> 02:52:05,760
Now let me remove this before
switching off this week.

2683
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:10,360
I don't need before test after the first
week of this week, otherwise unnecessary.

2684
02:52:10,360 --> 02:52:13,080
I would be having so much more before
class after class. Also,

2685
02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:16,440
I'm ending before my third day
after method

2686
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:22,200
and three test simple one correct?

2687
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:45,800
Sure.

2688
02:52:45,800 --> 02:52:50,280
So I have written this code right in
say new class

2689
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:53,520
just before my third after my third
and three test

2690
02:52:56,400 --> 02:52:57,120
before my third.

2691
02:52:57,120 --> 02:53:03,120
After my third entry test, I'm going to
define them based on the groupings.

2692
02:53:03,840 --> 02:53:04,760
How can we do this?

2693
02:53:04,760 --> 02:53:07,960
Groupings Me Show you here.

2694
02:53:07,960 --> 02:53:08,520
I'm writing.

2695
02:53:08,520 --> 02:53:11,520
Let's see, this is my fourth test, right?

2696
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:13,040
So this is my first test.

2697
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:14,840
This belongs to

2698
02:53:16,320 --> 02:53:16,920
group.

2699
02:53:17,320 --> 02:53:18,960
Which group it belongs to.

2700
02:53:18,960 --> 02:53:22,400
Let's say it is a part of my smoke.

2701
02:53:23,400 --> 02:53:25,480
And also it is a part fine.

2702
02:53:25,960 --> 02:53:28,040
Let's say
it is a part of my smoke right now.

2703
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:35,160
This one groups.

2704
02:53:35,160 --> 02:53:41,120
It is also a part of my smoke.

2705
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:42,240
This one again, groups.

2706
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:46,080
It is a part of my integration.

2707
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:49,120
For example, my one best
guess they connect.

2708
02:53:50,320 --> 02:53:54,760
Now I will vote in this one
in soft assumption.

2709
02:53:54,960 --> 02:53:56,680
Right. Another class.

2710
02:53:56,680 --> 02:53:59,360
And here I would say this one.

2711
02:54:00,520 --> 02:54:02,920
I'm writing groups

2712
02:54:02,920 --> 02:54:05,040
and it is a part

2713
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:07,200
of my

2714
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:11,800
small fine.

2715
02:54:11,800 --> 02:54:13,680
Let me open this one right now.

2716
02:54:13,680 --> 02:54:15,440
That is class.

2717
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,560
I will go inside of my fist
and do not take symbol, fight it.

2718
02:54:18,560 --> 02:54:21,680
And I said, All right, just class.

2719
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:26,400
I have, for example, right now,
I want to execute my test cases.

2720
02:54:26,400 --> 02:54:29,440
I want my test
because it's based on groups.

2721
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:31,320
Okay?

2722
02:54:31,320 --> 02:54:34,880
Now, it is not restricted in
limited to just one class.

2723
02:54:34,880 --> 02:54:37,520
I can write here inside one test

2724
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:40,800
I can write with, say to my test.

2725
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:41,400
Right.

2726
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:44,880
So inside of my test,
what I can write, see if I can write

2727
02:54:46,200 --> 02:54:46,880
group

2728
02:54:58,120 --> 02:55:01,440
an inside the group I have to write, run

2729
02:55:09,720 --> 02:55:10,960
getting this

2730
02:55:11,040 --> 02:55:13,120
it says that I'm so what I have to run

2731
02:55:13,520 --> 02:55:17,880
it is asking for include
so I'm going to write here

2732
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:22,440
include name.

2733
02:55:22,440 --> 02:55:25,800
Let's say I want to execute
only my smoke test cases.

2734
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:31,800
So now if you see when I write this group
inside this class

2735
02:55:32,520 --> 02:55:35,400
or let me take another class yet
so my next class

2736
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:38,120
would be my

2737
02:55:39,240 --> 02:55:40,000
soft associate

2738
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,680
class in my these two classes,

2739
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:46,760
whatever their test gives us,
I have written if those test because

2740
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:51,720
this block, this particular group only
then those test because this will execute.

2741
02:55:52,480 --> 02:55:53,080
Right.

2742
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:57,480
So now let me execute
just one class first.

2743
02:55:57,480 --> 02:55:59,400
It will give us one error.

2744
02:55:59,400 --> 02:56:20,800
Let me show you running.

2745
02:56:20,800 --> 02:56:23,720
No, no methods executed in the test class.

2746
02:56:23,720 --> 02:56:30,600
This one let me open it.

2747
02:56:30,600 --> 02:56:38,440
Why? Oh, okay.

2748
02:56:38,480 --> 02:56:40,040
Okay. Got it. Got it, Got it.

2749
02:56:40,040 --> 02:56:42,440
I have written the things in grouping
right.

2750
02:56:42,440 --> 02:56:44,320
So this is my groupings. One point.

2751
02:56:45,880 --> 02:56:49,120
Let me go here and change it to groupings.

2752
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:49,800
Fine.

2753
02:56:50,120 --> 02:56:54,720
Now let me execute this part.

2754
02:56:54,720 --> 02:57:00,480
I'm going to execute my groupings class.

2755
02:57:00,480 --> 02:57:02,760
It got executed. Right?

2756
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:04,760
This is another method. Interesting.

2757
02:57:04,760 --> 02:57:06,840
And this is my first method. Correct.

2758
02:57:07,080 --> 02:57:09,880
So things now you'll see here

2759
02:57:10,440 --> 02:57:14,480
I am going inside this.

2760
02:57:14,480 --> 02:57:16,080
I'm going inside this.

2761
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:19,080
Tell me how many test I have

2762
02:57:21,960 --> 02:57:24,320
three and how many I've executed.

2763
02:57:25,280 --> 02:57:29,160
Test and executed how much

2764
02:57:29,960 --> 02:57:34,920
just to Why is it so?

2765
02:57:34,920 --> 02:57:39,440
Because my test is this test method
and another method

2766
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:44,160
this to execute
it based on my small group.

2767
02:57:44,160 --> 02:57:44,840
Right.

2768
02:57:45,520 --> 02:57:47,240
Based on my small group.

2769
02:57:47,240 --> 02:57:54,640
This to execute this correct.

2770
02:57:54,640 --> 02:57:58,120
But let me open my a soft assertion

2771
02:57:58,800 --> 02:58:02,200
to class soft associate to

2772
02:58:02,720 --> 02:58:03,440
soft position.

2773
02:58:03,440 --> 02:58:06,280
So can you see a soft position right

2774
02:58:07,680 --> 02:58:07,920
here?

2775
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:10,560
I'm going to define my groups is equal to

2776
02:58:11,120 --> 02:58:13,520
let's it is small

2777
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,920
if you do two regression
one is multiple execute two again right

2778
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:30,960
No it will execute then one
because it taking from here.

2779
02:58:31,080 --> 02:58:34,200
See it is taking only the small one,
not the regression one.

2780
02:58:34,440 --> 02:58:35,200
Correct.

2781
02:58:36,680 --> 02:58:39,720
This segregation is done from
this ten do not exit.

2782
02:58:39,720 --> 02:58:42,720
So how many test cases
you have the smoked egg

2783
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:45,920
It will execute
only this one getting my point

2784
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:48,240
right.

2785
02:58:48,320 --> 02:58:50,960
So now this time
I'm going to take another class.

2786
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:53,320
My soft assumption to

2787
02:58:53,320 --> 02:58:57,360
this is minus after session two
and here I have one my third log in.

2788
02:58:57,400 --> 02:58:58,000
Right.

2789
02:58:58,400 --> 02:59:01,920
I'm going write another method which I'm
writing yet this is what we call,

2790
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:09,120
let's see,
invalid log book, invalid log in.

2791
02:59:09,640 --> 02:59:12,120
And this part I'm going to write as my

2792
02:59:18,120 --> 02:59:21,880
fixes integration

2793
02:59:30,800 --> 02:59:33,680
that I

2794
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:37,000
So one set is smoke.

2795
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:38,120
Once this integration.

2796
02:59:38,120 --> 02:59:39,680
What happened here

2797
02:59:42,320 --> 02:59:44,760
right now?

2798
02:59:46,360 --> 02:59:49,400
Yep I did it

2799
02:59:49,400 --> 02:59:51,600
now in testing do not act symbol

2800
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:54,360
I'm using this after session to class
right

2801
02:59:54,840 --> 02:59:58,680
one test because belong to smoke one test
because belong to integration.

2802
02:59:58,680 --> 02:59:59,480
Correct.

2803
02:59:59,480 --> 03:00:00,240
Let me

2804
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:16,880
it is giving me one error.

2805
03:00:16,880 --> 03:00:20,600
It is thing null pointer exception

2806
03:00:21,440 --> 03:00:24,000
on start assertion to java line number 31.

2807
03:00:24,960 --> 03:00:27,600
Here it is
giving me one error driver target title.

2808
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:33,520
It means the moment I enter here,
the moment I enter into this method right

2809
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:37,360
on this line when I'm using this driver,
it is giving me the error.

2810
03:00:38,040 --> 03:00:48,720
Can you see why it is giving me the error?

2811
03:00:48,720 --> 03:01:07,080
Any idea?

2812
03:01:07,080 --> 03:01:09,960
Because we are not opening the browser
before my third.

2813
03:01:09,960 --> 03:01:11,320
Not in the smoke that

2814
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:14,760
these are preconditions?

2815
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:19,000
Are those conditions available,
but they are not a part of my group.

2816
03:01:19,680 --> 03:01:23,760
My group is depending on precondition
and post correct.

2817
03:01:24,200 --> 03:01:27,960
So when I say my group is depending
on precondition and condition,

2818
03:01:27,960 --> 03:01:31,680
I have to come up with the setup
when it comes to grouping that

2819
03:01:31,800 --> 03:01:36,320
my precondition and condition will always
execute,

2820
03:01:36,600 --> 03:01:40,120
will always execute
irrespective of any group.

2821
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:42,880
If I am making it for integration, fine.

2822
03:01:42,880 --> 03:01:44,120
It should work.

2823
03:01:44,120 --> 03:01:46,320
If I'm making it for smoke, fine.

2824
03:01:46,320 --> 03:01:47,280
It should work.

2825
03:01:47,280 --> 03:01:50,080
So to do that, to do that,
what I have to do,

2826
03:01:50,520 --> 03:01:52,560
I have to write it

2827
03:01:53,080 --> 03:01:56,840
always run is equals to

2828
03:01:58,560 --> 03:01:59,280
after my third.

2829
03:01:59,280 --> 03:02:02,520
Also I have to write
always is equals to two.

2830
03:02:03,840 --> 03:02:07,200
Now if I go in my test and do not exceed
will file and if I try to run

2831
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:23,160
working fine

2832
03:02:23,160 --> 03:02:27,200
or not.

2833
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:29,400
So with grouping this is that issue.

2834
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:32,480
If you are not voting, always run is equal

2835
03:02:32,520 --> 03:02:36,200
to true in your precondition
as well as your post condition.

2836
03:02:36,360 --> 03:02:38,440
It will not work right?

2837
03:02:38,760 --> 03:02:42,760
So your precondition in post condition
must be always run is equal to two,

2838
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:51,240
but it is voted on.

2839
03:02:51,240 --> 03:03:00,840
Not everyone.

2840
03:03:00,840 --> 03:03:04,920
Now let's see.

2841
03:03:04,920 --> 03:03:06,480
I think should was asking right?

2842
03:03:06,480 --> 03:03:08,640
What? Is there a difference in this test?

2843
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:17,400
Correct?

2844
03:03:17,400 --> 03:03:18,240
Correct.

2845
03:03:18,920 --> 03:03:21,600
The Sure Is it you also me

2846
03:03:21,760 --> 03:03:25,080
who was that was asking the question.

2847
03:03:25,080 --> 03:03:25,800
Okay.

2848
03:03:26,200 --> 03:03:26,760
I think so.

2849
03:03:26,760 --> 03:03:30,680
Me she is not here, but fine.

2850
03:03:30,680 --> 03:03:33,880
Let me explain. You see guys

2851
03:03:33,880 --> 03:03:36,560
here, I'm saying this is my

2852
03:03:37,960 --> 03:03:38,400
support.

2853
03:03:38,400 --> 03:03:40,760
So suit my indexing text HRT,

2854
03:03:42,120 --> 03:03:43,800
this is my suit.

2855
03:03:44,160 --> 03:03:45,480
And here I am saying

2856
03:03:50,520 --> 03:03:54,440
this is my smoke test.

2857
03:03:54,440 --> 03:03:55,920
I can do one more thing.

2858
03:03:55,920 --> 03:03:58,400
I can simply copy

2859
03:03:58,400 --> 03:04:00,920
and I can write another test.

2860
03:04:00,920 --> 03:04:02,640
This is my

2861
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:05,520
integration test

2862
03:04:05,560 --> 03:04:08,520
inside one so I can have my separate test.

2863
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:13,000
Let's say
you have a couple of test cases in smoke.

2864
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:16,880
This gives this integration some test
because this belongs to both categories.

2865
03:04:16,880 --> 03:04:21,440
Is more integration in this solve
the solution to if you see I have

2866
03:04:21,440 --> 03:04:22,800
this gives this integration

2867
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:25,360
as well as I have
discussed this in the smoke to correct

2868
03:04:26,960 --> 03:04:29,240
that it don't always tell me

2869
03:04:30,360 --> 03:04:31,800
let me show you

2870
03:04:33,720 --> 03:04:35,960
here one belong to the creation.

2871
03:04:37,080 --> 03:04:41,040
One belong to smoke.

2872
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:43,440
Right, right, right, exactly.

2873
03:04:43,440 --> 03:04:45,160
So now you have to test.

2874
03:04:45,160 --> 03:04:47,600
One is for the creation, one is for smoke.

2875
03:04:47,880 --> 03:04:48,480
Nobody is.

2876
03:04:48,480 --> 03:04:51,080
Go ahead and run this test
and do not estimate by this time.

2877
03:04:51,480 --> 03:04:55,880
If you run this test and you detect
single file, you will be able to execute

2878
03:04:55,880 --> 03:05:02,040
not only your smoke
but also your integration.

2879
03:05:02,040 --> 03:05:02,840
Getting my point.

2880
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:06,720
Just one click, just one click
you need to do and then you will be able

2881
03:05:06,720 --> 03:05:15,200
to execute not only your smoke
but also integration for clear.

2882
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:17,120
See, that's what is executing

2883
03:05:22,320 --> 03:05:25,160
no integration test to start

2884
03:05:28,880 --> 03:05:31,960
the second smoke
I changed already date I change already.

2885
03:05:31,960 --> 03:05:33,480
I show you that

2886
03:05:39,360 --> 03:05:43,080
you see this is my integration right?

2887
03:05:43,080 --> 03:05:44,840
And this is my.

2888
03:05:45,760 --> 03:05:46,920
Oh, okay.

2889
03:05:46,920 --> 03:05:47,480
Okay.

2890
03:05:47,880 --> 03:05:48,280
Got it.

2891
03:05:48,280 --> 03:05:51,200
Fine.

2892
03:05:51,200 --> 03:05:52,280
This is my

2893
03:05:53,960 --> 03:05:59,160
now, now again, let me execute.

2894
03:05:59,160 --> 03:06:00,680
Yes, it is

2895
03:06:01,040 --> 03:06:09,080
my mistake.

2896
03:06:09,080 --> 03:06:15,120
Now you see, your precondition
is working for smoke right now.

2897
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:16,960
Those conditions will also work for you.

2898
03:06:16,960 --> 03:06:25,320
Smoke right now, right

2899
03:06:26,600 --> 03:06:28,360
then your precondition is working for

2900
03:06:28,360 --> 03:06:39,320
regression. No.

2901
03:06:39,320 --> 03:06:43,840
Any opposed condition
is working for your Scorpion King.

2902
03:06:44,840 --> 03:06:45,880
Scorpion.

2903
03:06:46,160 --> 03:06:48,120
Your post works for the condition.

2904
03:06:48,120 --> 03:06:52,800
Also see if I open this.

2905
03:06:52,800 --> 03:06:55,120
If I close this, See, this is my suit.

2906
03:06:55,200 --> 03:06:57,360
So in H&M is my complete sleep.

2907
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:01,800
Here is smoke test

2908
03:07:01,960 --> 03:07:03,880
here. Regression test.

2909
03:07:03,880 --> 03:07:07,320
Correct?

2910
03:07:07,320 --> 03:07:09,880
Yeah, I'm
all right. It was a smoke. I forgot

2911
03:07:12,560 --> 03:07:13,920
some zero

2912
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:17,640
Scorpion King.

2913
03:07:17,640 --> 03:07:20,240
No disabled and smoke.

2914
03:07:20,640 --> 03:07:21,440
These four names.

2915
03:07:21,440 --> 03:07:22,560
I remember one more.

2916
03:07:22,560 --> 03:07:24,600
It was Molina, I think.

2917
03:07:25,240 --> 03:07:28,640
Okay, Reptile kind of

2918
03:07:32,560 --> 03:07:34,640
fight.

2919
03:07:34,640 --> 03:07:35,040
Got it.

2920
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:37,080
So that is if you see here,
this is my suit.

2921
03:07:37,200 --> 03:07:41,280
Inside one suit I can have multiple test,
direct integration

2922
03:07:41,280 --> 03:07:42,920
test a smoke test inside one.

2923
03:07:42,920 --> 03:07:44,760
So so this is the difference.

2924
03:07:44,760 --> 03:07:49,000
One suit you get in multiple test,
in one test, you can in multiple packages

2925
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:52,680
in one package,
do multiple classes in one class.

2926
03:07:52,680 --> 03:07:56,480
You have multiple methods, correct,
which you can include and exclude

2927
03:07:56,480 --> 03:07:58,520
according to your requirement here.

2928
03:07:59,960 --> 03:08:04,800
Now, if you want, If you want,
you just need one single file.

2929
03:08:04,800 --> 03:08:05,720
So fine.

2930
03:08:05,720 --> 03:08:09,320
You can pick the name,
you can rename it to smoke, not symbol.

2931
03:08:09,320 --> 03:08:14,920
If I write a smaller text symbol,
the another one you need to just execute

2932
03:08:14,920 --> 03:08:16,880
if you want to execute,
just regression test

2933
03:08:16,880 --> 03:08:19,920
because this you can rename the file
to litigation vertex symbol fight.

2934
03:08:20,280 --> 03:08:21,520
Correct. So there.

2935
03:08:21,520 --> 03:08:24,480
So it would be very easy for you
to configure your test cases

2936
03:08:24,680 --> 03:08:28,920
and execute your test cases
according to your requirements.

2937
03:08:28,920 --> 03:08:33,880
Got it.

2938
03:08:33,880 --> 03:08:52,920
Got it or not?

2939
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:55,760
Got it.

2940
03:08:55,760 --> 03:08:56,760
Let's pass it for the

2941
03:09:41,720 --> 03:09:49,920
fine.

2942
03:09:49,920 --> 03:09:51,480
That's the new symbol part.

2943
03:09:51,480 --> 03:09:52,800
We are done

2944
03:09:53,880 --> 03:09:55,920
with internal reading to the class three.

2945
03:09:55,920 --> 03:09:56,400
Fine.

2946
03:09:56,400 --> 03:09:59,960
So to top
it test parameterization into stingy.

2947
03:10:00,240 --> 03:10:01,240
Right? Always run.

2948
03:10:01,240 --> 03:10:06,160
We are done test cases grouping
we are done. Yes.

2949
03:10:06,160 --> 03:10:10,640
This is the part how to specify groups
include exclude groups client

2950
03:10:12,120 --> 03:10:13,680
test parameterization.

2951
03:10:13,680 --> 03:10:14,400
Right.

2952
03:10:14,520 --> 03:10:16,600
We will see that part

2953
03:10:18,680 --> 03:10:19,640
before this.

2954
03:10:19,640 --> 03:10:21,760
Before this build this point late

2955
03:10:22,800 --> 03:10:23,400
knows us.

2956
03:10:23,400 --> 03:10:27,320
This point is
we are almost done with this laser scheme.

2957
03:10:27,320 --> 03:10:28,800
Yes, yes, yes.

2958
03:10:28,800 --> 03:10:31,120
Very nice things remaining.

2959
03:10:31,120 --> 03:10:33,920
Now, there is one thing

2960
03:10:33,920 --> 03:10:35,240
in the starting point.

2961
03:10:35,240 --> 03:10:39,440
When we started,
I told you the biggest downside

2962
03:10:39,440 --> 03:10:42,080
of selenium is they do not have

2963
03:10:43,440 --> 03:10:45,600
any reporting structure, any effect.

2964
03:10:45,640 --> 03:10:49,560
If you're executing thousand test
because there is nothing that can express

2965
03:10:49,720 --> 03:10:53,280
that can show that can prove
that you have executed 1000 test cases.

2966
03:10:55,080 --> 03:10:57,440
We were looking for report.

2967
03:10:57,440 --> 03:11:00,440
This is basic explanation,
but I don't want this report.

2968
03:11:00,440 --> 03:11:02,880
This is not my report. Right.

2969
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:04,200
This is not my report at all.

2970
03:11:04,200 --> 03:11:07,720
To take this string, to pass
this one failure information is fine.

2971
03:11:08,360 --> 03:11:11,280
Yesterday we were talking about you
not taking the console output.

2972
03:11:11,560 --> 03:11:16,080
So this is the console
only This is not the report I need report.

2973
03:11:16,600 --> 03:11:19,520
Okay, let's go ahead.

2974
03:11:19,520 --> 03:11:22,040
Let's see how we can get the report.

2975
03:11:22,040 --> 03:11:22,880
All right.

2976
03:11:24,200 --> 03:11:24,880
Ready, guys?

2977
03:11:24,880 --> 03:11:26,760
One More thing.

2978
03:11:27,800 --> 03:11:43,200
One more new concept.

2979
03:11:43,200 --> 03:11:45,240
That is the question which I have time.

2980
03:11:45,240 --> 03:11:48,080
We are almost done with this. Like, So

2981
03:11:48,080 --> 03:11:50,600
which question you are seeing? Should you?

2982
03:11:50,600 --> 03:11:51,560
I didn't get your question.

2983
03:11:51,560 --> 03:12:00,480
So do you find this something?

2984
03:12:00,480 --> 03:12:02,840
Oh, okay. All right. Let's go ahead.

2985
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:04,880
So let's click on

2986
03:12:06,400 --> 03:12:09,120
Run edit

2987
03:12:09,160 --> 03:12:15,480
configuration, Click on Run and edit
configuration.

2988
03:12:15,680 --> 03:12:18,400
Let me know once you are able to see this,
the screen must

2989
03:12:31,560 --> 03:12:33,520
find this.

2990
03:12:33,520 --> 03:12:35,200
Is there an option?

2991
03:12:35,560 --> 03:12:37,000
Click on

2992
03:12:38,720 --> 03:12:39,800
our currently control.

2993
03:12:39,800 --> 03:12:47,520
Click on edit configurations.

2994
03:12:47,520 --> 03:12:48,920
Everyone is on this screen.

2995
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:50,040
Everyone now

2996
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:54,520
great

2997
03:12:55,480 --> 03:12:57,880
click on listeners.

2998
03:12:57,880 --> 03:12:59,400
You'll see this must be blank.

2999
03:12:59,400 --> 03:13:00,520
Nothing to show.

3000
03:13:00,520 --> 03:13:01,560
Click on

3001
03:13:05,040 --> 03:13:05,400

Please update your status.
Everyone, please.

3003
03:13:07,440 --> 03:13:10,000
Whoever is working on this

3004
03:13:14,360 --> 03:13:18,200
great. Now,

3005
03:13:19,400 --> 03:13:21,720
is everyone on this list? Correct?

3006
03:13:21,720 --> 03:13:22,680
Everyone is here.

3007
03:13:22,680 --> 03:13:27,600
You all can see there's nothing to show in
this plus sign, right Click on this.

3008
03:13:27,600 --> 03:13:28,600
Plus fine

3009
03:13:31,080 --> 03:13:36,880

Reporter one email multiple.

3012
03:13:41,080 --> 03:13:46,360
Do you have to select the first one
email reporter Selected first one

3013
03:13:49,800 --> 03:13:53,160
selected everyone email able Reporter

3014
03:13:58,880 --> 03:13:59,200
Click.

3015
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:22,520
Okay.

3016
03:14:22,520 --> 03:14:29,320
All right.

3017
03:14:29,320 --> 03:14:31,920
Applying here just to find both things up.

3018
03:14:32,760 --> 03:14:35,880
So guys, remember
if I am creating a new class

3019
03:14:36,880 --> 03:14:39,600
and if I am copying a code
from another class,

3020
03:14:40,120 --> 03:14:44,360
it is just because
I want to save your time.

3021
03:14:44,360 --> 03:14:47,800
If I keep writing the code again
and again, the same piece of code,

3022
03:14:47,800 --> 03:14:50,200
it will be a problem for you
always on the right.

3023
03:14:51,720 --> 03:14:53,280
Why I'm copying the code

3024
03:14:53,280 --> 03:14:56,560
because want to save your time

3025
03:14:56,560 --> 03:14:58,320
and the code which I'm writing here.

3026
03:14:58,320 --> 03:14:59,760
This is not rocket science.

3027
03:14:59,760 --> 03:15:04,680
If you already have this code
in your classes. Yes.

3028
03:15:04,720 --> 03:15:07,560
Yes. Correct.

3029
03:15:07,560 --> 03:15:09,840
So the code is already available, right?

3030
03:15:09,840 --> 03:15:11,120
I'm just copying this code.

3031
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:13,880
And whatever the changes I'm doing,
I'm also showing that

3032
03:15:13,920 --> 03:15:16,200
these are the minor changes
I'm doing in the code.

3033
03:15:16,560 --> 03:15:20,240
If you want me to write every single code
from scratch, I can do that also.

3034
03:15:20,240 --> 03:15:22,600
But again, it will be a burden for you.

3035
03:15:22,600 --> 03:15:24,760
Yesterday
I having the problem right there.

3036
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:26,560
Yesterday I was having a complaint. What?

3037
03:15:26,560 --> 03:15:29,920
Complain that I'm spending too much time
on doing the same thing.

3038
03:15:29,920 --> 03:15:32,880
Why not on this thing
now when I'm copying the

3039
03:15:33,080 --> 03:15:35,840
from one place to another class, right.

3040
03:15:36,760 --> 03:15:39,200
That code is nothing
which I'm writing new.

3041
03:15:39,200 --> 03:15:41,040
This is a previous code.

3042
03:15:41,040 --> 03:15:47,400
Anything which I'm writing new and,
rewriting it from scratch.

3043
03:15:47,400 --> 03:15:50,360
So please try to understand
this is for your goodness, right?

3044
03:15:50,400 --> 03:15:51,480
Not for me.

3045
03:15:51,480 --> 03:15:59,800
If you want me to write the code
from scratch, I can write anything.

3046
03:15:59,800 --> 03:16:05,520
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

3047
03:16:05,520 --> 03:16:07,200
So, guys, here, click on Run,

3048
03:16:09,080 --> 03:16:12,880
click on edit Configurations,

3049
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:15,400
click on Listener's

3050
03:16:18,040 --> 03:16:18,840
Right

3051
03:16:20,160 --> 03:16:22,480
click on Plus sign

3052
03:16:23,560 --> 03:16:26,280
Search for email Reporter.

3053
03:16:26,280 --> 03:16:27,480
Click on this email label.

3054
03:16:27,480 --> 03:16:28,400
Reporter Click.

3055
03:16:28,400 --> 03:16:29,840
Okay here.

3056
03:16:29,840 --> 03:16:50,520
Also click okay.

3057
03:16:50,520 --> 03:16:52,920
No, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

3058
03:16:53,320 --> 03:16:56,160
You can do that and it will be applicable
for the entire project.

3059
03:16:56,160 --> 03:16:56,960
Don't worry about it.

3060
03:16:56,960 --> 03:17:03,960
Okay.

3061
03:17:03,960 --> 03:17:04,320
All right.

3062
03:17:04,320 --> 03:17:05,080
So simply click.

3063
03:17:05,080 --> 03:17:09,720
Okay.

3064
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:10,440
Right

3065
03:17:18,200 --> 03:17:20,520
now, let me go in my this part, right?

3066
03:17:21,680 --> 03:17:24,160
I'm going to create another test
and your text will

3067
03:17:25,440 --> 03:17:27,480
do you want me to create another one?

3068
03:17:27,480 --> 03:17:30,640
Or we can use the existing one too.

3069
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:33,160
What you can say is a

3070
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:42,000
new one.

3071
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:43,600
So right click

3072
03:17:44,200 --> 03:17:45,960
again, go back to create a standard

3073
03:17:45,960 --> 03:17:55,760
or text symbol.

3074
03:17:55,760 --> 03:17:57,960
Reload from there. This

3075
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:02,760
very new file,

3076
03:18:02,760 --> 03:18:04,800
we can repurpose those. Right?

3077
03:18:04,800 --> 03:18:07,960
But if I repurpose those once again,
people will complain, right?

3078
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:12,320
That You are using the same one and your
copying the code from here and there.

3079
03:18:12,320 --> 03:18:13,720
I'm not copying the code, actually.

3080
03:18:13,720 --> 03:18:22,920
I'm writing every single new code
right here.

3081
03:18:22,920 --> 03:18:23,440
Fine.

3082
03:18:23,880 --> 03:18:27,840
So now I'm simply just giving it
to new name.

3083
03:18:27,840 --> 03:18:31,200
Let's just find
my first name is just Okay.

3084
03:18:31,800 --> 03:18:35,080
And instead of having so many classes
and so many methods,

3085
03:18:35,880 --> 03:18:37,320
I'm going to remove all of them

3086
03:18:38,920 --> 03:18:45,120
from here.

3087
03:18:45,120 --> 03:18:47,920
I'm going to take just one class normal.

3088
03:18:48,040 --> 03:19:01,160
Last year.

3089
03:19:01,160 --> 03:19:05,400
Let's see.

3090
03:19:05,400 --> 03:19:06,840
Soft attrition, one class.

3091
03:19:06,840 --> 03:19:12,240
I'm going to take that, guys,

3092
03:19:12,360 --> 03:19:20,960
Is this okay?

3093
03:19:20,960 --> 03:19:23,400
Let me open myself
to social class from here.

3094
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:25,800
This is my soft position.

3095
03:19:25,800 --> 03:19:28,440
Last night.

3096
03:19:28,440 --> 03:19:31,560
I'm not using any group as of now,
so just remove

3097
03:19:31,560 --> 03:19:34,600
this grouping part from this class.

3098
03:19:34,600 --> 03:19:36,920
One method and two methods

3099
03:19:38,880 --> 03:19:39,640
in my testing.

3100
03:19:39,640 --> 03:19:41,600
Do not simplify.

3101
03:19:41,600 --> 03:19:45,520
What I want to do is simply alternate
the grouping also.

3102
03:19:45,520 --> 03:19:51,480
Otherwise again, people will get.

3103
03:19:51,480 --> 03:19:53,400
I looked at groups here.

3104
03:19:53,400 --> 03:19:55,200
Nobody at told

3105
03:20:27,120 --> 03:20:27,680
little bit.

3106
03:20:27,680 --> 03:20:29,920
I'm taking the smoke right?

3107
03:20:29,920 --> 03:20:34,680
And if I go inside of my
this class I'm going to right here.

3108
03:20:34,920 --> 03:20:39,400
This one should belong to my one groups.

3109
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:41,520
The group name means a smoke

3110
03:20:44,920 --> 03:20:47,200
and this one also belongs to my group

3111
03:20:53,400 --> 03:20:55,200
group name system operator.

3112
03:20:55,200 --> 03:20:56,880
Obviously it will execute both this.

3113
03:20:56,880 --> 03:20:59,920
Just get this correct
in my soft assertion.

3114
03:20:59,920 --> 03:21:02,360
One this and did not extend well part.

3115
03:21:03,160 --> 03:21:06,720
So this time if I execute this time
if I execute,

3116
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:40,440
you will see one thing.

3117
03:21:40,440 --> 03:21:41,160
Fine.

3118
03:21:41,440 --> 03:21:43,920
So now now I see one thing here.

3119
03:21:45,440 --> 03:21:49,400
Just I'm creating here
and I'm going to reload my project

3120
03:21:49,400 --> 03:21:54,400
and it why?

3121
03:21:54,400 --> 03:21:59,400
Let me show you that part.

3122
03:21:59,400 --> 03:22:02,880
I'm not getting this.

3123
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:17,960
If we go ahead again, run it
configurations.

3124
03:22:17,960 --> 03:22:18,520
Just a moment.

3125
03:22:18,520 --> 03:23:23,040
That's why it was not working.

3126
03:23:23,040 --> 03:23:34,320
Reload this project from here.

3127
03:23:34,320 --> 03:23:36,680
It does give me a more case

3128
03:24:27,480 --> 03:24:29,800
to click here.

3129
03:24:30,680 --> 03:24:32,960
I did configuration part when I go

3130
03:24:36,120 --> 03:24:38,480
this should be mine

3131
03:24:38,480 --> 03:24:40,720
inside of see part. Correct.

3132
03:24:40,720 --> 03:24:42,440
Okay, fine.

3133
03:24:42,440 --> 03:24:45,280
Now if I apply and okay. Right,

3134
03:24:46,640 --> 03:24:47,520
let me execute

3135
03:24:47,520 --> 03:24:51,400
this time because my output directly
part was empty

3136
03:24:51,400 --> 03:24:54,640
so it was not generating the report
at any place.

3137
03:24:54,640 --> 03:25:05,320
Now, this time, if I run, sure city sure

3138
03:25:05,600 --> 03:25:10,240
mistake you.

3139
03:25:10,240 --> 03:25:14,320
So now, if I executed here,
you'll see inside

3140
03:25:14,320 --> 03:25:18,320
my SIRC
there is one file generated automatic.

3141
03:25:18,320 --> 03:25:21,680
Can you see this file is email report dot

3142
03:25:22,160 --> 03:25:25,160
and it got generated automatically correct

3143
03:25:26,640 --> 03:25:30,360
can you see this is this is the reporting
structure we were talking about.

3144
03:25:30,480 --> 03:25:34,000
So now the next thing
the next thing which we need to do is

3145
03:25:34,160 --> 03:25:38,200
we need to look into this proper
report in the browser.

3146
03:25:38,400 --> 03:25:41,240
Since this is the HTML report,
we can simply open it

3147
03:25:41,240 --> 03:25:43,840
into the browser
and how we can open this report.

3148
03:25:44,240 --> 03:25:45,160
Right click here.

3149
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:49,640
I'm going to open browser
and the moment you click on Chrome

3150
03:25:51,320 --> 03:25:52,240
you will see this

3151
03:25:52,240 --> 03:25:57,240
colorful report available on the composer.

3152
03:25:57,240 --> 03:26:05,200
And you see this report Everyone. Yep.

3153
03:26:05,840 --> 03:26:10,680
Correct.

3154
03:26:10,680 --> 03:26:11,320
Right.

3155
03:26:11,760 --> 03:26:13,040
So what are we doing here?

3156
03:26:13,040 --> 03:26:17,920
Basically, no, there is no is.

3157
03:26:17,920 --> 03:26:20,280
You don't need to add this for each
single file.

3158
03:26:20,280 --> 03:26:21,680
See any list?

3159
03:26:21,680 --> 03:26:24,280
No to any accessible file. Right

3160
03:26:24,280 --> 03:26:25,440
within that. Any list.

3161
03:26:25,440 --> 03:26:26,600
No to any accessible file.

3162
03:26:26,600 --> 03:26:29,520
This is the list
we have added on the project level.

3163
03:26:30,800 --> 03:26:34,760
Let me do it once again
to see what we have to do is first

3164
03:26:35,640 --> 03:26:38,160
we have to click on Run

3165
03:26:38,160 --> 03:26:38,800
after Run.

3166
03:26:38,800 --> 03:26:41,120
We have to go into edit
configuration part.

3167
03:26:42,200 --> 03:26:44,520
When we go in edit configuration

3168
03:26:44,520 --> 03:26:49,200
here in the listeners,
we have to select this option, right?

3169
03:26:49,760 --> 03:26:53,560
We have to select this option
and then we have to write for email.

3170
03:26:53,560 --> 03:26:57,080
If multiple of.

3171
03:26:57,080 --> 03:26:59,280
Yeah, like that's
what I'm repeating once again.

3172
03:26:59,280 --> 03:27:00,120
Click on Run.

3173
03:27:01,160 --> 03:27:02,280
After running you

3174
03:27:02,280 --> 03:27:06,400
will get edit configuration part
the moment you click on edit

3175
03:27:06,400 --> 03:27:11,640
configuration, you are coming on this
particular page, click on listener Stat.

3176
03:27:11,840 --> 03:27:15,840
Once you go inside the listener step,
you will get this plus option.

3177
03:27:15,840 --> 03:27:18,120
Click on this option and search for email.

3178
03:27:18,240 --> 03:27:22,560
Reporter On this email reporter
you will get two options.

3179
03:27:22,560 --> 03:27:26,600
Email a reporter and email reporter
to What you need to do

3180
03:27:26,600 --> 03:27:29,400
is you need to select the first one
that is email a reporter

3181
03:27:30,240 --> 03:27:32,640
simply selected, Click, apply, click.

3182
03:27:32,640 --> 03:27:33,480
Okay.

3183
03:27:33,840 --> 03:27:36,960
Once you're done with this,
go into your next email file.

3184
03:27:37,000 --> 03:27:40,560
You don't need to add any dependency,
you don't need to add any other thing.

3185
03:27:40,800 --> 03:27:42,880
What you need to do is simply just right.

3186
03:27:42,880 --> 03:27:44,920
Click it and execute your test.

3187
03:27:44,920 --> 03:27:46,640
Do not simplify.

3188
03:27:46,640 --> 03:27:50,040
So I'm executing my test
in simple configuration file

3189
03:27:50,480 --> 03:27:54,840
when I have this a small group,
Whatever the test cases I have written,

3190
03:27:55,200 --> 03:28:00,200
which is having this textbook
and there I'm going to execute my class.

3191
03:28:01,040 --> 03:28:04,200
The moment I execute my class,
you'll see it updates.

3192
03:28:04,200 --> 03:28:05,840
My report.

3193
03:28:05,840 --> 03:28:13,040
So this is the report
we were talking about.

3194
03:28:13,040 --> 03:28:16,800
I did it.

3195
03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:21,480
Okay.

3196
03:28:21,480 --> 03:28:24,400
Yeah, that's fine. See,
you have to select first time, right?

3197
03:28:24,400 --> 03:28:26,280
What one will find, why it is so?

3198
03:28:26,280 --> 03:28:29,400
Because it is asking for the execution
part, Right?

3199
03:28:29,600 --> 03:28:31,640
So the execution part is available.

3200
03:28:31,640 --> 03:28:33,960
Let me show you where it is. Asking Demo.

3201
03:28:33,960 --> 03:28:37,800
Maybe you're going here
and when you click on this listener part

3202
03:28:37,840 --> 03:28:40,520
right before one listener part,
there are files.

3203
03:28:40,840 --> 03:28:42,600
These are the files you're talking about

3204
03:28:45,400 --> 03:28:46,800
in Excel groups.

3205
03:28:46,800 --> 03:28:48,480
It gives us an edit. Fine.

3206
03:28:48,480 --> 03:28:51,480
So in the Excel group,
we don't find anything yet.

3207
03:28:51,480 --> 03:28:56,160
If you'll see if I go in this,
let me just open it.

3208
03:28:56,880 --> 03:29:07,680
Come on.

3209
03:29:07,680 --> 03:29:08,320
Fine.

3210
03:29:09,440 --> 03:29:11,680
Works for a specific axiom.

3211
03:29:11,680 --> 03:29:15,280
Okay.

3212
03:29:15,280 --> 03:29:15,840
All right.

3213
03:29:15,840 --> 03:29:16,680
You have to reload.

3214
03:29:16,680 --> 03:29:17,760
Your project

3215
03:29:18,560 --> 03:29:21,440
is still if you're not still
if you are not getting file

3216
03:29:21,840 --> 03:29:23,960
right is still
if you're not getting this file.

3217
03:29:24,480 --> 03:29:27,120
Remember one thing going to run

3218
03:29:27,240 --> 03:29:29,880
edit configurations right here.

3219
03:29:30,360 --> 03:29:32,520
Check this part the output directly.

3220
03:29:32,520 --> 03:29:35,600
Can you see this output is

3221
03:29:36,840 --> 03:29:38,600
inside this output directly.

3222
03:29:38,600 --> 03:29:41,000
Just select
the part that you want to store.

3223
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:41,520
So let's see.

3224
03:29:41,520 --> 03:29:45,680
I've selected this RC.

3225
03:29:45,680 --> 03:29:48,200
I have selected this is RC here.

3226
03:29:48,200 --> 03:29:51,040
So simply click okay
and then it will be generated.

3227
03:29:51,200 --> 03:29:55,320
The output report will be generated inside
the folder you're providing.

3228
03:29:55,320 --> 03:29:59,400
So I have provided
it's image generated under is clear.

3229
03:30:00,560 --> 03:30:01,040
Yeah.

3230
03:30:01,040 --> 03:30:05,480
If your yours is empty,
you have to provide this output directly.

3231
03:30:05,480 --> 03:30:08,560
First thing.

3232
03:30:08,560 --> 03:30:09,320
Okay.

3233
03:30:10,240 --> 03:30:13,080
Before list,
not before the list of just above the list

3234
03:30:13,320 --> 03:30:15,680
you will find this output
directly party it

3235
03:30:23,480 --> 03:30:25,400
right on this box.

3236
03:30:25,400 --> 03:30:28,760
You have to provide the part
where you want this report.

3237
03:30:29,120 --> 03:30:29,840
So let's see.

3238
03:30:29,840 --> 03:30:33,480
I have provided this part
for my project inside SIRC.

3239
03:30:33,720 --> 03:30:34,560
So that is.

3240
03:30:34,560 --> 03:30:37,400
See, I'm getting this report here
in billable reports.

3241
03:30:38,000 --> 03:30:41,720
In this case, I'm
getting this image label report

3242
03:30:42,840 --> 03:30:51,240
correct.

3243
03:30:51,240 --> 03:30:54,680
Now click okay and then execute your test

3244
03:30:54,720 --> 03:30:58,920
and you take some.

3245
03:30:58,920 --> 03:30:59,880
Yeah, that's fine.

3246
03:30:59,880 --> 03:31:02,280
You must be getting one best output folder

3247
03:31:05,400 --> 03:31:06,000

3248
03:31:06,000 --> 03:31:07,640
Just select its RC and click.

3249
03:31:07,640 --> 03:31:11,280
Okay.

3250
03:31:11,280 --> 03:31:14,440
And even if it is not SIRC,

3251
03:31:14,440 --> 03:31:16,800
any other folder,
if you want to take user drivers

3252
03:31:17,120 --> 03:31:20,880
right inside, it's obvious if you want to
take drivers can select driver. Also

3253
03:31:25,440 --> 03:31:26,000
select any

3254
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:59,280

Let's create inside, download another
folder, Create another folder download.

03:37:59,400 --> 03:38:02,240
And then try to provide the port
and when you execute

3337
03:38:02,360 --> 03:38:06,240
you will find this report in the why.

3338

3353
03:39:42,960 --> 03:39:44,840
Yes. Was must be there.

3354
03:39:44,840 --> 03:39:45,680
What is the issue?

3355
03:39:45,680 --> 03:39:48,560
The net. Can you please post your

3356
03:39:48,560 --> 03:39:51,360
Can you please post your problem? Get

3357
03:39:57,480 --> 03:40:01,360
we can refactor we can do better

3358
03:40:01,560 --> 03:40:02,640
you posted here.

3359
03:40:02,640 --> 03:40:06,120
Let me check which one

3360
03:40:06,280 --> 03:40:06,800
are all in.

3361
03:40:06,800 --> 03:40:08,000
I didn't see

3362
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:12,240
cannabis posted here Inside life question
so they or I can check there.

3363
03:40:12,240 --> 03:40:15,120
Also it says

3364
03:40:18,480 --> 03:40:18,960
Ma'am,

3365
03:40:18,960 --> 03:40:22,080
your providing the class name
but package name is missing.

3366
03:40:23,040 --> 03:40:25,640
You are simply writing
software solution to our Java.

3367
03:40:25,960 --> 03:40:27,960
We are not writing any class
name like this.

3368
03:40:27,960 --> 03:40:28,840
See here

3369
03:40:29,520 --> 03:40:31,480
that we just detected

3370
03:40:31,920 --> 03:40:32,840
among

3371
03:40:40,320 --> 03:40:42,600
If you'll see my test in
do not take similar file.

3372
03:40:42,880 --> 03:40:44,960
I'm writing class like this.

3373
03:40:44,960 --> 03:40:46,200
Great. Nor java.

3374
03:40:46,200 --> 03:40:47,360
So what you have to do?

3375
03:40:47,360 --> 03:40:50,480
Your package name is class zero too,
so it should be class

3376
03:40:50,480 --> 03:40:53,800
zero to solve the solution to
and not our Java

3377
03:40:53,800 --> 03:41:08,800
Java.

3378
03:41:08,800 --> 03:41:11,280
You only know That's what I'm saying.
Can you see?

3379
03:41:11,360 --> 03:41:13,560
That's all you need to write your part.

3380
03:41:13,560 --> 03:41:16,920
If you want, I can type your path here.

3381
03:41:16,920 --> 03:41:18,120
No, I'm not holding the class.

3382
03:41:18,120 --> 03:41:31,440
I'm just resolving all of your queries.

3383
03:41:31,440 --> 03:41:34,280
Go to place, check the comments
on Sundays. They're already free.

3384
03:41:34,320 --> 03:41:37,640
Please check the comments of your query
there and.

3385
03:41:37,640 --> 03:41:38,600
The support.

3386
03:41:38,600 --> 03:41:45,680
You will find the answer there.

3387
03:41:45,680 --> 03:41:47,680
Why your writing on the syntax?

3388
03:41:47,680 --> 03:41:49,680
Because it is already just class zero to

3389
03:41:51,640 --> 03:41:52,240
because the

3390
03:41:52,240 --> 03:42:02,120
class zero to write.

3391
03:42:02,120 --> 03:42:02,600
Okay.

3392
03:42:03,640 --> 03:42:05,880
All right, guys.

3393
03:42:05,880 --> 03:42:11,760
So this is the image label report.

3394
03:42:11,880 --> 03:42:14,760
This is the image level
against the ability for trait.

3395
03:42:15,280 --> 03:42:18,040
This is your SDM report. We can see here.

3396
03:42:18,040 --> 03:42:21,640
Now let's go back to our slides

3397
03:42:23,040 --> 03:42:26,320
the next thing after
this is parameterization, right?

3398
03:42:26,640 --> 03:42:32,600
Since it is a time taking activity
and we cannot complete this parameter part

3399
03:42:32,640 --> 03:42:36,720
in just 15 or 20 minutes,
I will keep it for our next class.

3400
03:42:37,080 --> 03:42:38,400
Would they be okay?

3401
03:42:38,400 --> 03:42:41,280
Because already
you guys have learned so many things today

3402
03:42:41,400 --> 03:42:46,920
and I see the confusion in between right?

3403
03:42:46,920 --> 03:42:49,120
Yeah,
because I can see the clear confusion.

3404
03:42:49,120 --> 03:42:50,840
You guys have got so many things.

3405
03:42:50,840 --> 03:42:53,200
This looks almost
we have done in two classes

3406
03:42:53,720 --> 03:42:56,480
and I don't want to create more confusion.

3407
03:42:56,480 --> 03:42:58,600
I want to give you time. Right.

3408
03:42:58,840 --> 03:43:01,520
So that you guys can practice. Yes. Yes.

3409
03:43:01,560 --> 03:43:13,400
It was intense, correct.

3410
03:43:13,400 --> 03:43:13,880
But it is.

3411
03:43:13,880 --> 03:43:14,840
Tell me one thing

3412
03:43:14,840 --> 03:43:19,440
before before we wrap up this session,
before we do anything, are you any

3413
03:43:19,680 --> 03:43:23,560
is anyone who is still having the problem
with understanding the concept?

3414
03:43:24,120 --> 03:43:25,440
Forget about writing the code.

3415
03:43:25,440 --> 03:43:30,640
I'm going to commit this code and I'm
going to comment this code right now here.

3416
03:43:30,640 --> 03:43:34,160
So the code will be in your repository,
right?

3417
03:43:34,880 --> 03:43:58,200
That's true.

3418
03:43:58,200 --> 03:44:00,080
Yes. That is code is concerned.

3419
03:44:00,080 --> 03:44:02,560
I remember whatever the code I am writing,

3420
03:44:02,880 --> 03:44:06,160
I'm going to commit this code
in the repository right.

3421
03:44:06,440 --> 03:44:11,160
You will get entire piece of code, every
single class, every single line of code.

3422
03:44:11,160 --> 03:44:12,360
You will get this.

3423
03:44:12,360 --> 03:44:17,160
That's why I always say right whenever it
to practice, you can refer to this code.

3424
03:44:17,320 --> 03:44:21,000
But before that you need to understand
what are the code we are writing.

3425
03:44:21,760 --> 03:44:22,520
So let me come

3426
03:44:23,520 --> 03:44:24,760
and push

3427
03:45:07,200 --> 03:45:09,480
because it is the issue with the Mac.

3428
03:45:09,480 --> 03:45:13,000
That's why. Fine.

3429
03:45:13,040 --> 03:45:15,040
So I have committed the coordinates,
right?

3430
03:45:15,200 --> 03:45:16,320
Code is there.

3431
03:45:16,320 --> 03:45:18,240
I have already uploaded the files.

3432
03:45:18,240 --> 03:45:18,880
This just in.

3433
03:45:18,880 --> 03:45:20,560
Just like in your canvas.

3434
03:45:20,560 --> 03:45:21,960
Everything is there.

3435
03:45:21,960 --> 03:45:24,640
You have the whole weekend,

3436
03:45:24,680 --> 03:45:25,320
right?

3437
03:45:25,760 --> 03:45:28,080
Please post your query in the syntax
upload.

3438
03:45:28,080 --> 03:45:28,600
Right.

3439
03:45:29,760 --> 03:45:31,440
We will be there to support you.

3440
03:45:31,440 --> 03:45:32,280
Don't worry about it.

3441
03:45:32,280 --> 03:45:36,000
Just posted right after the classic
possible will will give you the support.

3442
03:45:36,000 --> 03:45:50,160
There.

3443
03:45:50,160 --> 03:45:52,960
Nor every single code is available. Right.

3444
03:45:52,960 --> 03:45:56,840
Like I said,
I gave you the installation details also

3445
03:45:57,000 --> 03:46:00,360
right as assistant every one of you
for the installation part.

3446
03:46:00,640 --> 03:46:02,760
So your environment is ready, right?

3447
03:46:02,920 --> 03:46:06,680
You just need to take the code,
all the code of the repository,

3448
03:46:06,680 --> 03:46:10,800
the updated code, and the same code
will work on your machine

3449
03:46:10,800 --> 03:46:20,080
as we.

3450
03:46:20,080 --> 03:46:21,720
Yeah, the link is here

3451
03:46:29,720 --> 03:46:30,800
just 3 minutes ago.

3452
03:46:30,800 --> 03:46:46,600
We have committed this code.

3453
03:46:46,600 --> 03:46:51,880
I just frustrated by.

3454
03:46:51,880 --> 03:46:57,640
All right, guys.

3455
03:46:57,640 --> 03:47:00,440
Yes it does connect correctly.

3456
03:47:01,120 --> 03:47:02,800
It's working fine.

3457
03:47:03,120 --> 03:47:05,240
Mike. I shared link in a check.

3458
03:47:05,320 --> 03:47:08,560
If you'll see that, please confirm

3459
03:47:22,800 --> 03:47:24,920
here in the check.

3460
03:47:24,920 --> 03:47:26,880
Only if you didn't get it.

3461
03:47:26,880 --> 03:47:28,920
Let me just mistake in the announcement.

3462
03:47:28,920 --> 03:47:44,520
Also, I gave it already in the course
announcement.

3463
03:47:44,880 --> 03:47:46,040
Great.

3464
03:47:46,040 --> 03:47:48,720
All right, guys, is there anyone
who has any other question,

3465
03:47:50,280 --> 03:47:52,000
any query, any confusion?

3466
03:47:52,000 --> 03:47:58,960
Please ask.

3467
03:47:58,960 --> 03:47:59,560
Sure, Mike.

3468
03:47:59,560 --> 03:48:03,040
Definitely.

3469
03:48:03,040 --> 03:48:06,120
Again, I'm repeating, guys,
if code is an issue

3470
03:48:06,360 --> 03:48:10,520
you think too much of code then wouldn't
available in the repository, right?

3471
03:48:10,800 --> 03:48:14,400
Just try to take the concepts
which we have known the topics

3472
03:48:14,400 --> 03:48:17,600
you will find every single class
for existing topic.

3473
03:48:17,920 --> 03:48:20,160
All will be available inside the class.

3474
03:48:20,160 --> 03:48:24,240
Go ahead and check the updated
or take the pull of this repository.

3475
03:48:24,240 --> 03:48:26,120
You will be having all the code with you.

3476
03:48:26,120 --> 03:48:41,600
Okay, everyone.

3477
03:48:41,600 --> 03:48:45,120
All right, guys, then I think
I'm done from my say for today.

3478
03:48:45,880 --> 03:48:47,040
See us next week

3479
03:48:48,160 --> 03:48:48,840
by the time.

3480
03:48:48,840 --> 03:48:50,760
Please practice. Please practice.

3481
03:48:50,760 --> 03:48:51,120
Okay.

3482
03:48:51,120 --> 03:48:55,120
It is very important.

3483
03:48:55,120 --> 03:48:56,760
If you practice, you will get perfection.
