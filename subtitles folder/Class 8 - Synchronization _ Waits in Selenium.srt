1
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,680
Hey, guys, Can everyone see me?

2
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,120
Can everyone hear me?

3
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,160
Okay.

4
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,600
Okay,

5
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,720
good.

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,320
All right, guys, let's get started.

7
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,200
I hope everyone is doing great

8
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,240
and everyone can see me
and everyone can hear me fine.

9
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,040
All right.

10
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,880
Let's see.

11
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,280
We have a good amount of people.

12
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,240
So how is everybody doing, guys,
What's going on?

13
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,680
I hope

14
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,520
everyone was having fun with the

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,320
with the homework.

16
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,080
I'm good. Thank you.

17
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,680
Tired.

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,560
Okay.

19
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,000
We're.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,080
We're halfway done. Right, guys?

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,560
So when do you guys start?

22
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,360
You know, starting June.

23
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,400
July. Okay.

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Yeah, Almost halfway, right?

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,600
Almost halfway.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,440
Done.

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,880
There's three more months left, so

28
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,760
let's push it.

29
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,240
Guys.

30
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,240
Don't get tired.

31
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,280
I know a lot of people will get
a little bit

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,960
overwhelmed

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,560
towards the end,

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,920
but don't give up, guys, because that's
going to be a lot of information. So

35
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,920
no social life with syntax?

36
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,360
Well, yeah, I'm in six months, guys.

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Okay, so only six month of commitment.

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,240
And after that you find a job and then
your social life will get back to you.

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,400
Okay, So just keep trying.

40
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,760
Let's not give up.

41
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:45,840
Okay, guys, we're almost there.

42
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,320
And the window windows.

43
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:58,200
Okay.

44
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,280
Only with Firefox works.

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,040
I think you're talking Andre.

46
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,280
You're talking about the last tab, right?

47
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,400
When you open the last tab,
is it where the issue is?

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,160
Okay. Yeah.

49
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,240
So if you open the last tab, it's.

50
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,560
It's how it is configured.

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,920
So I want to I wanted to to see

52
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,880
if you can handle this kind of

53
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,040
issues.

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,640
So that's why I gave it to you
that, that homework.

55
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,800
So let's go ahead here.

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,040
If you if you open up this
there is an h html in here

57
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,880
but it's a bit different
than than the other windows.

58
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,200
But if you open up this window,
you can see there's an actual

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,800
what's
called there's an actual view around here.

60
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,560
Okay.

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,800
So if you see in here, there's
no you around.

62
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,720
So it's just an h HTML document in here

63
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,040
over the homework.

64
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,640
I think you guys are going
to be going over over that tomorrow.

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,600
If I'm not mistaken.

66
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,680
Okay.

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,360
So this the this one,

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,880
this works in Firefox.

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,440
I'm not sure why,
but I'm assuming this is how the

70
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,160
how the tab is configured itself.

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
But developers.

72
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,200
Okay. And also,

73
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,960
whenever you're dealing with with Windows,

74
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,360
you won't be handling this kind of windows
unless you're opening a document.

75
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,120
Okay.

76
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,960
And if you open a document, a new tab

77
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:46,480
during the automation,
you should be doing that manually.

78
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,200
Describe the difference.
So you could take a look at the

79
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,720
what's
called we could take a look at the URL.

80
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,600
So there is an actual euro here
which navigates to this page.

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,280
Okay.

82
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,880
But here it's it's nothing in here.

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
Okay,

84
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,040
So it's there's nothing in here.

85
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,720
So that means
this is not a link or anything.

86
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,560
Okay.

87
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,800
So it doesn't

88
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,880
you don't I don't think you even need
an Internet to open this.

89
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,680
Okay, So this is how it is.

90
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,160
So this is just an H HTML file.

91
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,200
This is this is an email file as well,
but it's connected to a link.

92
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:56,120
Okay.

93
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,800
Any suggestion to your question?

94
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,680
Oh, let me see.

95
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,920
Where is your question? File

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,280
the main page title.

97
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:14,640
Okay.

98
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,280
Is there anyone else having issues
with title sites?

99
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,400
I mean, not

100
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:32,040
including the last tab guys.

101
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,480
Okay, so there are people who completed
the homework, not including the last tab.

102
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,720
Guys.

103
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,560
You should be able to get the text
and the title.

104
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay. So please take a look at this.

105
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,840
I think people share the homeworks
and the syntax.

106
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,920
Students okay,

107
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,440
So please take a look
at that and communicate with each other.

108
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,480
Okay, guys.

109
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,360
But as I said, guys, the last the last one

110
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,120
here, the last tab.

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,040
If this is not working in Chrome,
you don't have to worry about it.

112
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,720
Okay?

113
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,840
I knew it's not going to be working

114
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:24,280
anyways.

115
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:34,320
Any other questions, guys?

116
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,040
Okay, so seems like no other questions.

117
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,400
So let's do a quick recap, guys.

118
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,840
What we've done so far yesterday.

119
00:08:45,840 --> 00:09:01,400
What did we cover yesterday, guys,
we know handles, right?

120
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,760
So what we did is we will learn
how to manipulate the windows, right?

121
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,480
Switch to them
and then perform some actions.

122
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,600
Right. So

123
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,200
so we use
we said we use two different methods,

124
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,800
which is we get window
handle and get window handles.

125
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,480
Right.

126
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,520
So before we dive in there,
what is the window handle

127
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:34,600
itself, guys?

128
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,760
It's a unique idea.

129
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,040
Okay, For what?

130
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,560
Unique idea for what guys?

131
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Unique idea.

132
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,320
Which holds the address of the tab. Right.

133
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,600
So how many how many characters

134
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,400
are in there?

135
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,720
It's approximately 40. Right? Almost 40.

136
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,240
Like alphanumeric

137
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,800
character idea.

138
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,120
Right.

139
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,680
Okay, good.

140
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,720
So where do we store the

141
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,040
if I get if I get all the window
handles, guys,

142
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,280
where do we store

143
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,120
in a set?

144
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,880
Right.

145
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,000
So what do we know about sets, guys?

146
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,040
Why do we stored in this set?

147
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,280
Because you want to keep unique,

148
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,320
unique elements
only inside that container, right?

149
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,520
There is no duplicates in there.

150
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,040
But there is one more thing in set, guys.

151
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,200
So what's the order in the hash set?

152
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:51,360
You guys, It's random, right?

153
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,120
But yesterday when we when we were trying
to do four different, when we were trying

154
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,240
to manipulate for different windows,
how do we know

155
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,600
which one is what

156
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,400
if it's jumping on on the random

157
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,960
order? How do we know that

158
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,640
by the handle name.

159
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,840
Okay,

160
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,520
okay.

161
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,920
We use iterator. Okay.

162
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,920
But what if it doesn't
get stored in in insertion order?

163
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:32,160
Guys, how come that it's.

164
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,560
It's going from the first
to the second from the second and third,

165
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:44,760
and then from the third to the fourth?

166
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:56,120
Any guesses on that?

167
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,440
Because of alphanumeric IDs? Not really.

168
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,160
What do we have inside the set interface?

169
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,640
Guys?

170
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,800
What is

171
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,520
what classes do we have under the set

172
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:27,200
interface?

173
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,080
Okay,

174
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,880
so hash set linked, hash
set and a tree set.

175
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,440
Right.

176
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,360
Which one supports
the insertion order guys

177
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,560
linked hash set.

178
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,280
Right.

179
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,640
So let's go ahead here.

180
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,160
So whenever you store all the window
handles inside the set, guys,

181
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,600
it automatically converted to linked
hash set.

182
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,480
Okay.

183
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,040
So just in case
you get these kind of questions

184
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,600
in the interview.

185
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,880
So if you get this kind of question
saying that, hey, it's a set,

186
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,640
it doesn't support any insertion order
or it's random,

187
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,120
so you can just tell them, Hey, whenever
I store all the window

188
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,560
handles inside the set, it automatically
returns me a linked hash set.

189
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,920
Okay. By default. Exactly.

190
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
All right, cool.

191
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:32,200
What else did we cover, guys?

192
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,160
Synchronization. Right.

193
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,920
So what are we trying to
synchronize in here?

194
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,360
Guys,
when we run, when we execute our code,

195
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,280
when we execute our selenium code,
when we're performing

196
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,400
something on the website,
what are we trying to synchronize

197
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,160
the speed,

198
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,960
the speed of what

199
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,040
components?

200
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,040
What are those components,

201
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,600
what it would trying to level.

202
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:15,960
Okay.

203
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,320
Web page and what

204
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,880
exactly.

205
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,240
So the speed of our code
and the page load right.

206
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,200
Because our our code doesn't wait
for something to appear on the web page.

207
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,800
Right.

208
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,600
So when you start your execution,
no matter

209
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,840
what's going to happen,
it's going to run until the end.

210
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,960
Or if it fails, it's
going to just terminate everything.

211
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,320
But it's not going to wait for your page
load,

212
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,200
for your elements to load
until you specify.

213
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,400
So, okay,
so we are synchronizing the execution

214
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,120
of our script and the page load.

215
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:02,960
Okay.

216
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
And what kind of wait

217
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,240
did we go over last class

218
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,960
implicit way?

219
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,080
Right. Okay.
So what do we know about implicit.

220
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:27,840
Wait, guys.

221
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,400
Okay,

222
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,360
It's usually set to 20 seconds, right?

223
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,840
It's a global wait, right?

224
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,000
What else

225
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,200
is the web driver to wait for?

226
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,160
Send amount of time.

227
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:48,240
Okay,
So what is it going to look for, guys?

228
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,600
So you set your implicit wait, right?

229
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,120
How many times can we set it exactly?

230
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,200
It's only written once.

231
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Right.

232
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
So what is he going to get?

233
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,960
What is it going to look for? Guys?

234
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,560
So we set an implicit rate

235
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,640
right?

236
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,400
This program runs faster.

237
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,480
Okay.

238
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,560
No, but what is he going to wait for?

239
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,320
For 20 seconds, guys?

240
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,040
So I said my implicit way for 20 seconds.

241
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,160
What is it for exactly?

242
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,920
It's for finding the elements, right?

243
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,280
The elements where we're looking for.

244
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,400
Exactly.

245
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,600
So whenever we set it for 20 seconds,

246
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,280
we try to find something, right?

247
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,120
It our implicit way comes there.

248
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,840
Okay?

249
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,880
So if it finds that element in 5 seconds,
the rest of the time is getting ignored

250
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,240
and we're moving on to the next action
or to the next line of the code.

251
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,800
Okay.

252
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,920
All right, good.

253
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,720
Any questions, guys?

254
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Yep. If it didn't find that element in 20
seconds, then we're getting exception.

255
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,400
Right?

256
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,320
So we're getting
in no such element exception.

257
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,920
Okay, guys,

258
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:30,640
any questions?

259
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,200
All right,
So today, what we're going to be doing,

260
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,360
we will be covering explicitly
where we'll be covering Sloane weight

261
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,560
and we will be covering
how to handle the web tables.

262
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,800
Okay. So

263
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,360
all right, So let's start
with the implicit weight here.

264
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,200
Implicit weight, right.

265
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,720
And we set that it will be

266
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,280
applied for

267
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,800
finite element methods, right?

268
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,440
Because we're trying to find something.

269
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,880
It's it's going to be waiting
for some elements to locate.

270
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,320
Right? Yep.

271
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
We just started now.

272
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,640
We're already in class eight,
and I think we already we all only have

273
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,040
like I think 11 processes
and in me mistake.

274
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,320
Okay so for more

275
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,360
with today's class. Okay

276
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,000
All right so explicit weight

277
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,000
or in other words, it's

278
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,760
called web driver weight.

279
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,120
Okay.

280
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,400
What do we know about explicit
weight, guys?

281
00:18:44,400 --> 00:19:05,640
Anyone did research on this?

282
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,320
It's smarter
than its implicit weight. Okay.

283
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,040
In what way?

284
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,840
So it waits for a certain amount of time

285
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,960
and certain condition, Right.

286
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,760
So basically, for explicit weight,
you explicitly set a weight that needs

287
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,200
to wait for a certain amount of time
and a certain condition.

288
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,960
Okay.

289
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,760
And it can be applied
only for a specified element.

290
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,080
Absolutely right.

291
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,360
That's very good.

292
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,200
Okay.

293
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,960
So let's put it in here.

294
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:53,560
Web driver weight
is used to tell the web driver to wait

295
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,600
for a certain

296
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,640
condition.

297
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,280
Okay.

298
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Before

299
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,600
throwing

300
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,960
a specified

301
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,320
conditions exception

302
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,200
for throwing an exception.

303
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,840
Exception for a specified condition.

304
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,040
Okay.

305
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,720
So we set that we are

306
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,160
explicitly right.

307
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,560
We're explicitly

308
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,560
said a wait for certain condition
and for a certain amount of time.

309
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,800
Okay.

310
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,640
So explicit weight, guys.

311
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,760
It works with expected conditions, class.

312
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,080
And as we set and waits until

313
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,000
the sun conditions are met
or the given time is achieved.

314
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,720
Okay.

315
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,400
So if the given time is achieved already
and the expectations

316
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,120
or the conditions are not met,
then you will be getting an exception.

317
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,000
Okay.

318
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,240
Most of the time you will be
getting element, not visible exception.

319
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
Okay.

320
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,280
So explicit

321
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,520
weight works with

322
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,640
the conditions class.

323
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,680
Okay.

324
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,400
And waits

325
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,920
until certain

326
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,920
conditions are met

327
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,320
or the given time is achieved.

328
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,520
Okay.

329
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:03,000
So any questions in here, guys?

330
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,240
No questions.

331
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,000
All right.

332
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,440
So let me go ahead and create
another package.

333
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
And here

334
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,480
and I will create a new

335
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:40,840
Java class.

336
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:50,240
So. Okay,

337
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,520
So let me see

338
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:03,720
this.

339
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,120
Okay.

340
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,560
So what we are going to be doing,
we will be navigating here

341
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,240
and what we're going to do,
we will click on the get new user.

342
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,000
Okay.

343
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,600
So when I click on this,
you see it's loading

344
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,640
and there is someone popping up in here

345
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,320
with a first name and the last name.

346
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,560
Okay, So let me sent the

347
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,560
link to you.

348
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:28,920
Okay.

349
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,120
So what we're going to
do, we're going to wait for those elements

350
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,160
in here and we're going to verify
that those elements are present in here.

351
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,040
Okay.

352
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:50,400
Any questions, guys?

353
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,840
I'm assuming there's no questions,
right, guys?

354
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,040
Okay, good.

355
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,640
All right.

356
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,280
So let's continue in here. Okay.

357
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,240
So let's go

358
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,880
have a

359
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:15,720
copy this here.

360
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,040
And let me actually update

361
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:27,720
the overall.

362
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,880
All right.

363
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,960
So we're navigating there.

364
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,120
So what is our next step, guys, in here?

365
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,160
What I need to do

366
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,240
explicitly right away

367
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
so we navigate it here, guys,

368
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,680
what do we need to do first?

369
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,600
We need to find the element, right,
that we're going to need to click on

370
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,120
first, right?

371
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,800
So let's inspect this page

372
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,440
and click on this.

373
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,000
All right.

374
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,280
So there is an ID for this, right?

375
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,360
So let's use
this ID, I'm going to copy this.

376
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,960
Go back and create a web element in here.

377
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,720
That user button

378
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,000
driver's find element

379
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
by ID.

380
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,080
Is this here

381
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:36,720
right.

382
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,640
And what we need to do,
we need to simply click on this at that.

383
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,080
So now what I want to do,

384
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,520
I want to get this first name in here

385
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,280
and then print it out in my console.

386
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,800
Okay, So how do we want to do this?

387
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:08,880
We need to put the implicit word
before performing the action.

388
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,680
Yes, it will work.

389
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,640
It's going to work the same because we're
just trying to find this element in here.

390
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,480
Right.

391
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,080
But I'm going to explain the difference
between implicit and explicit word

392
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,760
right after this.

393
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,120
What's called example. Okay.

394
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,720
So here we won't be using

395
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,160
we won't be using an implicit
wait for now.

396
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,960
And then I'll go over the differences
between implicit and explicit

397
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,360
and then it's going to be more
clear for you.

398
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,520
Okay.

399
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,360
All right.

400
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,840
So I clicked on this
get new user button in here.

401
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,000
So what happened with
I want to get this first name

402
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,600
and then print out inside my console.

403
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,440
Okay. So let's actually first

404
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,200
identify this
element and create an X path for this.

405
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,400
Okay.

406
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,520
So what I'm going to do here

407
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,640
is, okay, okay.

408
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,560
So let's go ahead and see where it is.

409
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,920
Okay?

410
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,120
So it's inside the okay, that's fine.

411
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,000
So what if I want to use this P only guys,

412
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,600
what was that P standing for? Guys

413
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,080
paragraph.

414
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,760
Right. Okay, good.

415
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,840
So what I want to do guys,
there is an idea in here

416
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,240
we can probably use this, but I want to
use this P and create an X path for this.

417
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,280
How do we want to come up
with an X path for us? So

418
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,880
okay, so following siblings.

419
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,360
Okay, what else?

420
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,040
Why do we want to use the following
sibling guys in here?

421
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,640
We could just use text. Right?

422
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
This is a simple text right?

423
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,600
Guys?

424
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,840
So what I'm going
to do and do double slash

425
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,680
P, right?

426
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,160
And then there's a text in here

427
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,080
is equal to

428
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,480
first name

429
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,760
or right.

430
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:42,040
What happened
is in a unique enough case, right? Yep.

431
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,720
So it is unique.

432
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,600
So if I click on the get user again, guess

433
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,240
what happened?

434
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,720
It changes the user every time, right?

435
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,360
So what can we use in here
in order to keep our x

436
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,320
path dynamic? Guys

437
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,520
we can use contains
and what's the part that we taken in

438
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,600
our X path
guys only that first name, right?

439
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,160
Absolutely right.

440
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,920
So what I will do in here,

441
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,960
I'll go ahead and do contains

442
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,960
open the parentheses,

443
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,920
close it here
and what I can do I can remove this.

444
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,240
What's wrong in here, guys?

445
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,840
Why is this not detecting it

446
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,320
using contains using the first name.

447
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,480
Why is this

448
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,840
not working?

449
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,760
Exactly. There's no equal sign.

450
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,080
We need to put a comma in here.

451
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,280
Right. So. Okay.

452
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,600
So now

453
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,000
we use contain. So

454
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,840
I'm getting a new user here.

455
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,360
It's still one of one, right?

456
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,800
Because we don't really care
what name actually popping up.

457
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,920
We care about this element
which we identified by using contents.

458
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,280
Okay, So this is the beauty
of keeping the x dynamic

459
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,600
or identifying your elements as dynamic
because you get the constant part of it

460
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,200
and you don't really care
what the dynamic part

461
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,120
because you can still identify it
with one single X path.

462
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,240
Okay.

463
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,680
All right.

464
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,040
So let me copy this. Right.

465
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,040
But this element doesn't pop up right
away.

466
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,480
Right?

467
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,800
So what we can do, let's actually before
we wait for that element, what I want to

468
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,520
do, I want to identify this element
and I want to print that text.

469
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,520
Okay.

470
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,920
So let's the web element.

471
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,560
First name, right, is equal to driver

472
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,600
find element by

473
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,840
export.

474
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,080
Right?

475
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,400
And then what I want to do, I want to just

476
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,320
print out the text.

477
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,280
Right.

478
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,880
So if I run this, this is going to fail
because it's waiting

479
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,760
for one or 2 seconds
to in order to pop up that element.

480
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,440
Right.

481
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,960
So what I'm going to do here,

482
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,920
I will set a weight,

483
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,880
but I will set a weight specifically

484
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,960
for this element, which is first name.

485
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,120
Okay.

486
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,640
So what I'm going to do in order for us

487
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,160
to use an explicitly what we need to do,

488
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,280
we need to create an object of the web
driver weight.

489
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,800
Okay, So what I will do here,
I'll create an object.

490
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,680
What type of weight?

491
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,040
Weight is equal to new

492
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,160
web driver weight?

493
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,240
Okay,
so I'm going to close this statement.

494
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,640
So it's throwing out some errors.

495
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,320
It's not compiling because it's X,

496
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,840
It's right now, it's waiting for us

497
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,600
to pass some arguments in there.

498
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,360
Okay.

499
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,680
So it's it's waiting for us to pass
two different arguments in here.

500
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,720
So one of them is going to be
that object of our web driver.

501
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,920
So we need to let this guy know in here
saying that, say selenium,

502
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,960
that we using a web driver
and this is our object.

503
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,200
In this case,
the object that we're using is driver.

504
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,840
Okay.

505
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,480
And then the second thing that we need
to pass in here, the waiting time.

506
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,360
Okay, So the waiting time is going
to be in seconds right away.

507
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,880
Okay. So I would set it for 20 seconds

508
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,240
and you can see that
it's time out in 20 seconds.

509
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,040
Okay. E,

510
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,120
this gets

511
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,040
okay, guys, I

512
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,160
need you to be more active, okay?

513
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,240
Because I don't really know
what is going on.

514
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,760
If you guys are typing.

515
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,160
So let's stop typing.

516
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,600
Okay?

517
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,040
Okay, cool.

518
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,320
All right,
So we created an object of the web driver.

519
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,200
Wait here.

520
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,760
We saying that, hey, this is a driver
that I'm running everything with,

521
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,680
and this is the amount of weight
that I will be waiting for.

522
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,800
So now we created a weight,
but we don't know

523
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,920
what is the condition
that we need to wait for.

524
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,120
Okay, So right now
I'm going to use this weight object

525
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,120
that I created and do wait until.

526
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,160
Okay, so I'm

527
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,800
waiting until all some conditions. Right.

528
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,880
And as I said before, weight.

529
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,200
What type of weight is using
the expected conditions?

530
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,120
Class?

531
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,120
Okay, so inside the parentheses,
what I need to do, I need to pass

532
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,840
the expected conditions that we want to
wait for.

533
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,680
Okay. So what I will do,

534
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,440
I will pass here.

535
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,720
As you can see, expected
conditions, class.

536
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,360
And when I press that in here,
you can see there's

537
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,960
different
different different conditions in here.

538
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,560
So visibility of element alert is present.

539
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,440
There's title right
elements selection, state

540
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,040
element
to be clickable, element to be selected.

541
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,520
So there's a lot of different
different methods that we want to use.

542
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,120
There's different conditions
that we need to use. Okay.

543
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,160
So in this case,
what are we trying to wait for guys?

544
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,440
So I'm trying to wait for that element.

545
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,560
But what is the actual condition
that I'm waiting for?

546
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,280
Guess

547
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,280
to be found or what else, guys?

548
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,160
So if we if we are.

549
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,240
Exactly.

550
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,200
We're talking about the visibility, right?

551
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,760
So we want that element to be visible
on the page first.

552
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,360
Right? So what we can do here,

553
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,640
so we can use

554
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,720
visibility of element locator.

555
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,000
Okay.

556
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,560
So I'm going to choose this method. Okay.

557
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,160
So now inside this parentheses,

558
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,120
I need to specify the locator that I am

559
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,960
finding this element.

560
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,720
Okay.

561
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,760
So you can do by or we can do by X path

562
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,840
as we already did in here.

563
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,640
Okay, so I'm going to copy this X path
we already found in here

564
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,080
and I will place it in here.

565
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,400
Okay? Is that clear, guys?

566
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Any questions in here?

567
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,400
So it's okay. That's fine.

568
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,720
All right, so here again,

569
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,000
guys, on line 21,
I am creating an object of web drive.

570
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,760
Await. Okay.

571
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,080
Telling that, hey, this is my driver,
that I'm running everything

572
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,600
and I'm setting the weight for 20 seconds.

573
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,680
Okay?

574
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:49,520
And then what I'm doing here, I'm waiting
until I meet the expected conditions.

575
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,320
Okay?

576
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,680
Once these conditions
are met, I will go ahead

577
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,400
to the next line and perform my action.

578
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,040
Okay.

579
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:09,040
Is that clear, guys?

580
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,680
All right, so now let me run this

581
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,840
with work until.

582
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,040
Yes, we will be using expected conditions.

583
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,440
Yes, I'm running this.

584
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,760
So let's see.

585
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,680
Okay.

586
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,080
Waiting for this.

587
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,840
Okay.

588
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,240
And then you can see in here,
it's printed out.

589
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,200
First name is Hector.

590
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,880
Okay.

591
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,000
So headed here.

592
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,880
This guy is printed out
inside our console.

593
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,680
Right.

594
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,160
So now, guys, the difference
between implicit and explicit.

595
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,640
Okay, so when you set an implicit weight,

596
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,520
it's only working
with find element, right?

597
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,720
So whenever your

598
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,560
your element is not found, it's
going to throw you an exception.

599
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,200
Right.

600
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,480
And here as well, you can use the implicit
way it's going to wait for 20 seconds

601
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,240
until it finds that element
and print out the text in here as well.

602
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,200
But the difference between implicit
and explicit weight is

603
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,080
in the conditions.

604
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:36,440
Okay, So in implicit, what you're
only waiting for the element to be found.

605
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:37,880
Okay.

606
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,680
But in the explicit way you're

607
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,400
setting different conditions,
you waiting for different conditions

608
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,200
specifically for that, for this
or that element.

609
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,400
Okay.

610
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,560
So sometimes
when you set an implicit weight

611
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,960
and you don't set the explicit weight

612
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,160
so you can find an element,
but it might not be visible.

613
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,400
Okay.

614
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,240
Or you can find an element, but
it might not be enabled to click on it.

615
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,960
Okay, So implicit weight
will only help you to find the element.

616
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,640
It's not going to tell you, okay,
I found the element, but it's enabled

617
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,320
or disabled.

618
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay, so this is the difference
between implicit and explicit weight.

619
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,120
Okay.

620
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:47,600
Any questions on this this? Yes.

621
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:53,160
With explicit weight
you use and a specific element, right.

622
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,200
A specific element to perform action
or to wait for certain conditions.

623
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,480
Okay.

624
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,760
Not very clear.

625
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,000
What's the confusion?

626
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,560
If you have any questions, guys,

627
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,480
type it in.

628
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,520
Seems like you guys are so passive today.

629
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,560
I don't know what's going on.

630
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,680
It's either you guys are tired
or you don't understand anything

631
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,400
or you understood everything.

632
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:35,160
All right, It's all okay.

633
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,200
All right, let me see.

634
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,360
I had another task.

635
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:51,480
And here.

636
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,920
It's all right.

637
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:05,160
So let me see.

638
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,200
Okay, guys, here's the task for you.

639
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,320
Okay?
Give 5 minutes to complete this task.

640
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,760
Okay, So I want you to navigate
here, wants to click start.

641
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,600
Okay.

642
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,160
So it's going to load in here,
and I want you to verify

643
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,240
that this text is appeared in here.

644
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,080
Okay.

645
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,480
Explicit word.

646
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,680
You can be more specific
on what exactly. Yes.

647
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,400
So you are more specific.

648
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,240
You are explicitly setting a condition.

649
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,600
All right.

650
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,360
Is the task clear, guys,

651
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,280
I'm going to copy this length for you.

652
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,760
I'm going to send it to me.

653
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,240
Okay.

654
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,280
There you go. So you have it in
live chats.

655
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,560
Okay.

656
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,000
5 minutes to complete that task

657
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,160
and we'll do it

658
00:42:02,160 --> 00:45:38,840
together.

659
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,920
And no one else done except exceptional.

660
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,840
Then I think this is the only one done now

661
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:52,120
you've probably copied
and pasted in right?

662
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:52,600
Yeah.

663
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,200
Yeah.

664
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:01,240
It's done.

665
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,240
Good.

666
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,360
It hasn't.

667
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,280
It's not 5 minutes.

668
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:34,480
Yes. Yes.

669
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,920
We've done

670
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:57,440
all. All right, that's good.

671
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,560
Okay, guys.

672
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,840
So let's do it together now.

673
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,000
Okay, So let me actually grab this

674
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,640
here.

675
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:23,640
And I think we need to take this.

676
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,080
Okay, So I have the URL.

677
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,760
What is my next step, guys?

678
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,080
Okay.

679
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:33,960
Help me out to finish this task, guys.

680
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,960
So I'm navigating to this URL.

681
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,480
What am I doing next?

682
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,920
Okay, we need to locate the button, right?

683
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,480
So we need to locate this start button.

684
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,520
All right, so let's inspect and see here
what we have.

685
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,160
Okay, I have an idea.

686
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,160
Okay, so let's use a CSS selector.

687
00:47:56,520 --> 00:48:00,160
Let's use a CSF selector
with the shortcut.

688
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:10,520
What was the shortcut for idea
in CSS selector guys?

689
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,280
Hashtag or a pound key. Right. Okay. Good.

690
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,320
Nice. Okay.

691
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,600
Okay. That was probably

692
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,360
autocomplete.

693
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:19,960
Right.

694
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,280
Okay.

695
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,800
All right, guys.

696
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:28,360
So double slash, right with CSV selectors,

697
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,720
and then I have a tag.

698
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,640
What's my tag, guys?

699
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,880
Button. Okay, button.

700
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,440
And then

701
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,600
the pound key in here.

702
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,040
I'm copying and pasting the idea here.

703
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,440
Why is it why it didn't work?

704
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,320
What's going on?

705
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,560
No, double slash. Exactly. There we go.

706
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,960
So in CSV,
we don't start with double slash, right?

707
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,360
Okay, so we found this.

708
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,000
Let's go back to our script and start

709
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,080
storing this inside the variable.

710
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,120
All right, well, element start button

711
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,000
is equal to driver dot find element

712
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,840
by csv selector and let's face it in here

713
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,720
and then start button that click.

714
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,560
Okay. All right.

715
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:39,720
So we know there is some some time
that we need to wait for, right?

716
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,200
So let me click on this.

717
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,160
It's loading.

718
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,480
All right.

719
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,560
A couple seconds in here
and what it does, and then we can see this

720
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:51,880
text.

721
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,280
So let's

722
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,280
identify this text as well.

723
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,080
So let me

724
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,160
leave this

725
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,960
identify this again.

726
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,840
Okay.

727
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,520
So what can we identify this by, guys?

728
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,480
How do we identify these elements?

729
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,280
I mean, this element

730
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,720
by text.

731
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,680
Okay.

732
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,640
Do you want
is it possible to identify by latex?

733
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:44,520
Good.

734
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:49,240
Yes. Now, there is no length, right?

735
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,120
There's no. And a tag, guys.

736
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,160
So that's why we won't be able
to identify this by link text.

737
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,840
Please pay attention.

738
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,560
Right.

739
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,080
So there is a different tag in here.

740
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,440
Okay, So what we can do,
we can use the text, right?

741
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,560
We can use the contains
because our tax is too long in here.

742
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,880
Right.

743
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,160
And there's one more thing
that I want to show you.

744
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,520
So let's identify this by.

745
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,600
Our tag is age four.

746
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:27,800
What does this age stand for, guys?

747
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,800
Head right okay
so I'm going to be using contains in

748
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,640
here contains the text right

749
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,040
And our text is

750
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,600
welcome.

751
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,720
Right. Okay.

752
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:45,960
All right, guys.

753
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,600
So there's one more thing
that I want to show you.

754
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,760
So most of the time on the on the Web
pages, guys, on the Web

755
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,960
page is what happens
whenever you see this H1, H2, H3,

756
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:03,240
They may get changed
during the development of the application.

757
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,320
Okay.

758
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,520
So headers
I usually get changed to like if

759
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,440
if this header is edge for right now,

760
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,600
it might get changed to age
three or age five.

761
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,120
It's up to the development team.

762
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,800
Okay,
so most of the time they get changed.

763
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,320
Okay,
so you don't want to use this edge for H2

764
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,120
or header tab in general.

765
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,640
Okay.

766
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,920
So what you can do instead,
you can put a wild card in here

767
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,360
which identifies
any tags inside the edge, HTML.

768
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:40,960
Okay.

769
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,160
What you can do, you can simply put an

770
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,920
asterisk in here

771
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,680
and you can see that it is a wild card
it identifies any

772
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,280
what's called any tag name.

773
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,160
It can be replaced with any tag.

774
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,760
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

775
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,400
This star or asterisk is a wild card.

776
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,880
Okay, so let's use this.

777
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,000
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to copy this

778
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,000
and I'm going to go back here.

779
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,880
No, not for CSS selectors, guys.

780
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:26,400
It's only applicable to Xbox.

781
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,280
I'll put it in the note.

782
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,800
Okay,
so let's identify this element first.

783
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,600
Okay.

784
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,640
So where element

785
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,600
welcome is equal to driver

786
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,800
find element

787
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,440
by x pass and let's start in here

788
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,720
and then what we're going to do

789
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:56,560
just in driver

790
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,920
click.

791
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,600
Okay, so let's go to our notes and

792
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,160
X Path is a

793
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,200
wild card which

794
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,520
can identify

795
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,400
any tag name

796
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,040
and we can just put this example in here.

797
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,360
Okay.

798
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,400
By I.D.

799
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,400
the correct to use the ID.

800
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,440
So let's check.

801
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,480
You can use the ID,

802
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,160
but if you get the text,
it might not return to the text.

803
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,200
Okay. So

804
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,560
you got the text.

805
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,360
Okay, then that's fine.

806
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,680
Then. It's fine.

807
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:55,720
Okay.

808
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,680
So let's go back

809
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,800
to the text.

810
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,440
Okay, guys.

811
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,320
So now what we need to do,
we found that element.

812
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,400
We're trying to get that text,
but before we do that,

813
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,200
what we need to do,
we need to wait, right?

814
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:18,440
We need to wait because it takes some
some seconds to load that element.

815
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,800
Okay.

816
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,640
So what I'm going to do here, I will be

817
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:31,680
creating a web type of weight
object right?

818
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,840
Grab. Wait, wait is equal to a new

819
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
web drive weight.

820
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,760
And now here what we need to do,
we need to specify what our Web driver is

821
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,400
and how many seconds we want to wait for.

822
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,040
Right.

823
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,320
So the first one is driver object in here

824
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,040
and we want to wait for 20 seconds.

825
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,200
Okay.

826
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,120
So now in here, what we can do,
we can wait

827
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:07,560
until our expected conditions are met,
Right?

828
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:13,400
Expected conditions
for visibility of the element located.

829
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,040
Right.

830
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,640
So and then

831
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:24,480
located or locating this by X path.

832
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,240
And we'll store this in here.

833
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,760
Right. Okay.

834
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,920
If you didn't get the text,
send us the code.

835
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:38,280
Let's see what what did you have?

836
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,920
Is it the CSeries or Express?

837
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,000
What did we identify our
this element guys with.

838
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,800
What's the locator?

839
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,680
We're waiting for this text. Right?

840
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,440
We're not waiting for the button to appear
or to be visible.

841
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,040
Right.

842
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,440
So that's why
we need to put an X passing here.

843
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,360
All right, So let's run this

844
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,920
and see what's going to happen

845
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,680
or be clicked.

846
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,600
There we go.

847
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,640
So it printed the text
and it quit the browser.

848
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:40,600
Any questions, guys?

849
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,040
Okay.

850
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,600
So, Masood, you said you created
a web type of wait, but you didn't

851
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,440
you didn't set the expected conditions
like I have on line 22.

852
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,520
You only have this web drive.

853
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,760
Wait.

854
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,560
Okay,

855
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,080
So set a condition after this

856
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:10,160
and then you will get the text.

857
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,120
All right.

858
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,840
So no question, it seems

859
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,960
everything is good, right?

860
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:26,880
So let's see.

861
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,120
So that's about it for explicit
waits, guys.

862
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,920
So I'll give you some homework later on
and you will be

863
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,960
doing a lot of weight in there.

864
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,240
Okay.

865
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,880
But let me actually

866
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,160
that's

867
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,720
okay.

868
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,880
A lot of waiting. Yes.

869
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,400
Okay.

870
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,920
So now let's go
over the fluent weight, guys.

871
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,880
Okay. So

872
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,840
slow and
wait, guys, what do we know about Sloane?

873
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,680
Anyone did a research on Sloane
Wade's guys

874
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,520
is romantic.

875
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,720
Yes, it's.

876
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,760
It's slightly waiting.

877
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,480
Right.

878
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:29,640
You didn't.

879
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,880
Okay, that's fine.

880
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,520
All right, guys.

881
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,920
So the fluid weight, right?

882
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,520
So the fluid weight is considered

883
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,880
as a global weight
as well as the implicit weight.

884
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:42,920
Okay.

885
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,240
So but it's used a little bit differently.

886
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,120
So Sloane Way
is used to tell the web driver

887
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,720
for certain condition
as well as its frequency.

888
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:55,960
Okay.

889
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,360
Before throwing any exceptions.

890
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,400
Okay.

891
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,360
So I'll explain to you

892
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:04,800
what kind of frequencies we have
and we'll see what that means.

893
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:05,520
Okay.

894
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,360
So let's put in here.

895
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:15,200
Let's actually put it
is global weight as well.

896
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,080
And it is used to tell

897
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,880
Web driver to

898
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,960
wait for

899
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,880
certain

900
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,000
condition

901
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,400
as well as

902
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,520
its frequency

903
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,600
before

904
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,920
following and accepting.

905
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,360
Okay.

906
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:46,880
All right.

907
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,760
So let's go ahead
and see how it actually looks like.

908
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,200
Okay.

909
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,200
So I'm going to create a new class here

910
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,360
and say fluent

911
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:11,400
Demo.

912
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,120
All right.

913
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,640
So for the main method in here,

914
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,240
so the fluid weight before we get into it.

915
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,280
Okay, so the fluent weight is a little bit
outdated, guys.

916
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:27,720
Okay, So the fluid weight is not
that used in a real world right now.

917
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:28,480
Okay.

918
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,800
So in my project and the previous project
that I've worked on,

919
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,160
we don't really have the font weights
in our framework.

920
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:36,160
Okay.

921
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,000
So fluid weight is has a little bit

922
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,360
of different syntax and usual weights.

923
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:43,000
Okay.

924
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,280
So implicit weight and you just set it
once inside your execution and that's it.

925
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,400
And then explicit weights. What you do is

926
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,520
you explicitly

927
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:56,600
waiting for some elements to appear
or to be visible

928
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:01,440
to be this display to enable or disable
it doesn't really matter.

929
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,040
Right?

930
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,680
So here what happens is

931
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,520
we're looking for some frequencies
you can do,

932
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:14,240
you can set some timeouts,
you can set some polling time,

933
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,520
and you can ignore some exceptions
with fluent weights.

934
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,760
Okay, So this is how it looks like
we won't be doing any tasks with it

935
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,480
because

936
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,160
it's not really used in the real world.

937
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,760
Okay, So what I'm going to do here,
I'm going to create

938
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,840
an object of the web driver, okay?

939
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,840
Travel driver is equal to new prime
driver.

940
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:46,400
Okay, So and then I'll start
creating my float weight.

941
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,560
Okay.

942
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:52,200
So this is how this looks like.

943
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:57,120
Okay, wait in here.

944
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,320
So this is a web driver weight as well.

945
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,360
And I'm creating a new object in here.

946
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,280
Okay. New

947
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,760
flowing weight.

948
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,280
Okay, So inside the fluent weight,

949
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,160
we should be

950
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,920
mentioning the work driver in here.

951
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:17,880
Okay.

952
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:23,800
And now what we can do,
we can start performing our actions.

953
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,320
We can start

954
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,120
there's no set property
because we won't be running anything.

955
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,080
Okay?

956
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,640
I just want you to see
how the fluent weight looks like.

957
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,400
Okay?

958
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,720
And what kind of actions
you can perform with this.

959
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,720
Okay.

960
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,800
First of all, you can do with

961
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,360
with the float weights.

962
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:49,560
Okay, before we get into that,
you need to set the driver in here.

963
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,720
Okay.

964
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:55,480
So now what you can do,
you can set a timeout.

965
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,400
Okay.

966
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,120
So usually when you set an implicit

967
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,320
weight, how many how many
seconds you get a timeout

968
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,520
with 20 seconds.

969
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,160
Right.

970
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,400
So what you can do in here,
you can set your own

971
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,560
timeout.

972
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,280
Okay.

973
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:19,960
And you need to specify your time
units as well.

974
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:23,280
Okay. You can say duration

975
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:26,160
that of seconds.

976
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,280
Okay.

977
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,880
And you can do 20 seconds in here.

978
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,080
Okay.

979
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,240
So now this is how you set your timeout.

980
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:37,640
Okay.

981
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:42,560
And then what you can do after that,
you can set the calling time.

982
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,120
Okay.

983
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:51,840
Calling time in here, calling
every let's say you pull every 5 seconds.

984
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,560
Okay.

985
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:58,120
Again, duration.

986
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,200
Duration of seconds, five. Okay.

987
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,960
So does anyone know what polling

988
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:13,080
means in here, guys?

989
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,000
Kind of looping.

990
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,680
Yeah, that's that's a very good idea.

991
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:19,400
So calling every 5 seconds

992
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,640
means that whenever you start
finding your elements.

993
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,400
Okay, so let's go back to this example.

994
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,000
So not this one to the implicit weights.

995
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,880
Okay. So when you set an implicit rate

996
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,240
and you

997
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,800
set it for 20 seconds
and you try to find that element, okay,

998
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,840
So your web driver will start looking

999
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,840
for that element every 0.5 seconds.

1000
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,160
Okay.

1001
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:54,440
So every half second
it will go ahead and start looking again.

1002
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,760
Okay.

1003
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,160
But here, when you set your polling
for 5 seconds,

1004
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,280
your web driver will skip that 00.

1005
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,720
5 seconds and it will start looking
for your elements

1006
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,040
after each 5 seconds.

1007
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:16,160
Is that clear, guys?

1008
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,840
So this is what polling means in here.

1009
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,600
So you basically look for your element
every 5 seconds.

1010
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,840
Okay.

1011
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,400
And here
and then what you can also do with

1012
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,120
I'll repeat, polling.

1013
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:34,840
Okay.

1014
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,520
So let me finish this one in here.

1015
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:43,080
And what you can also do,
you can also ignore some exceptions.

1016
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,520
Okay.

1017
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,280
Which is no, let's say
we have no such element exception.

1018
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,960
Okay.

1019
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,520
The class.

1020
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:59,360
Then you can close your statement.

1021
01:06:59,360 --> 01:06:59,880
Okay.

1022
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,360
Calling guys. So

1023
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,520
in general, when you

1024
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,200
set an implicit way,
it waits for 20 seconds.

1025
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,200
So it will be looking for the element

1026
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,480
you trying to find each half seconds.

1027
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,360
Okay, So it will be looking.

1028
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:24,880
So it looks for the element it did find
and it's looking again in 0.5 seconds.

1029
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,800
Okay.

1030
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,960
So but if you set your fluent weight

1031
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:32,480
and you set your polling to 5 seconds,

1032
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,320
it will start looking for your elements
every 5 seconds.

1033
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,040
Not 0.5, but 5 seconds.

1034
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,000
Okay.

1035
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,600
Is that clear?

1036
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,760
Does it mean it's slower?

1037
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,360
It is a little bit slower because if it

1038
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,800
if your element is available inside

1039
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,000
2 seconds, then it will have to wait in

1040
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,680
for 5 seconds for the next iteration.

1041
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:12,840
Okay.

1042
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:22,520
Any questions, guys,
when you will use this?

1043
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:26,080
This is used
most of the time in frameworks.

1044
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,200
Okay, So slow and wait is, as I said, it's
a global weight, right?

1045
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,480
So fluid weight will be written
only once is implicit.

1046
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:36,960
Wait. Okay.

1047
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,560
So you can write it once in your execution
and it will behave

1048
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:47,400
as how you set your timeouts,
how you set if falling or what.

1049
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,960
Whenever you ignore something,
this is going to be your fluent way.

1050
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,880
Okay, so you don't have to specify
this multiple times

1051
01:08:55,080 --> 01:09:04,080
in multiple places.

1052
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,680
It can be the same value in here
if you want to do it.

1053
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,040
Five and this is five.

1054
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,960
But that doesn't
that won't make sense, right?

1055
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,520
So why would you wait?

1056
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:16,960
Why would you time out in 5 seconds and

1057
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,040
you pull every 5 seconds?

1058
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,200
That wouldn't make sense.

1059
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,760
So it's better not to set it this way

1060
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,880
Logically, it wouldn't be correct.

1061
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:41,000
Right? Yes.

1062
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,120
We're not interacting
with any web elements here

1063
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,840
as we don't interact
with implicit weights.

1064
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,160
Right.

1065
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,640
You set it
so it's going to run in the background.

1066
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,000
Okay.

1067
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,600
But in explicit way,
what you do, you interact with the

1068
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,680
with the specific elements
that you want to set

1069
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:07,400
conditions for.

1070
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:12,400
That's why we set that implicit
and fluent weights are global weights

1071
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,520
because you just set only once
and it'll perform

1072
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:30,440
for the whole execution.

1073
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,080
Okay.

1074
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:50,880
Any other questions, guys?

1075
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:51,840
You can do an example.

1076
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,080
Yeah, just use this the same.

1077
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:59,520
Whereas a phone
we just use the same way in here that

1078
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,000
this use this in any of these examples.

1079
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:03,720
Okay.

1080
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:17,360
And it should work us.

1081
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:17,680
All right.

1082
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:17,880
Yeah.

1083
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,280
So let's take a break.

1084
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,320
815 right.

1085
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,600
And then,

1086
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,000
and then we'll continue with the

1087
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,720
with the web tables. Okay.

1088
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,000
So let's get 16 minutes break

1089
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,000
and then we'll continue

1090
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,840
the second half.

1091
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,080
Okay?

1092
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,200
I'll see you guys at 830

1093
01:11:46,320 --> 01:29:38,400
here.

1094
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,920
All right, guys.

1095
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,640
Okay.

1096
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,560
Gave you three more minutes.

1097
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:46,680
Give you three more minutes.

1098
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,160
Let's see.

1099
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:50,040
I hope everyone is back, guys.

1100
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,200
Exactly.

1101
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,800
There you go.

1102
01:29:54,360 --> 01:30:05,920
Okay So let's continue.

1103
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:06,360
Okay.

1104
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:10,840
So I see some people asking for
for an example for fluent weight.

1105
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:11,480
Okay.

1106
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:16,440
So what we're going to do
is I just pinged Moazzam

1107
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,400
so that he can go over the review.

1108
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,560
Okay. If he can find any

1109
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,520
any examples of fluent weight

1110
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,400
is going to show you and then you're going
to get more clarity on that.

1111
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,280
Okay, guys, because we have to right now
we have to move on to the

1112
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,560
to handling the web tables.

1113
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:39,160
Okay.

1114
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:39,600
All right.

1115
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,680
But as I said before, guys, fluid weight

1116
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:44,880
do not really

1117
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,840
dive deep into this topic

1118
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,480
because you won't be really using
any fluid weight at work.

1119
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:54,000
As I said, it's a little bit outdated.

1120
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,040
It's it's rarely used now.

1121
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,040
Okay.

1122
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:00,840
All right.

1123
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:06,480
So let's see

1124
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,160
the notes.

1125
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:11,920
Okay.

1126
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:16,160
So now, guys, let's go over the work
tables.

1127
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,240
Okay.

1128
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:26,400
So let's see if I have your table.

1129
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,080
Okay.

1130
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:33,720
There we go.

1131
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,840
Okay, before we dive into the web tables,
okay,

1132
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:40,200
what are the web tables on the Web page?

1133
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:40,560
There's

1134
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,000
anyone doing research on the web
tables? Yes.

1135
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,920
Let's see

1136
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,400
a little bit just now.

1137
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:14,480
Okay, That's fine.

1138
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:15,920
Next week's topic.

1139
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:20,200
No, it's probably
if you look at the slides, they are.

1140
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:24,040
No, it should be this week's topic
now, Class eight, guys.

1141
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:24,680
Okay.

1142
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:27,960
Okay.

1143
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:31,840
So anything which has rows and columns.

1144
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,120
Okay, there can be static and dynamic.

1145
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,320
Very good.

1146
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:39,480
Okay, so web tables,
first of all, are what, on the web

1147
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:42,760
page, guys,
what are we always looking for on the web

1148
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:47,800
page?

1149
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,400
Okay. It is a web element, right?

1150
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,000
So web tables are

1151
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:57,040
on the Web page, which is constructed

1152
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,880
by having rows and columns.

1153
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:00,960
Okay.

1154
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,240
And as Mark

1155
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:10,160
noticed,
that it can be static and dynamic.

1156
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:11,120
Right.

1157
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:14,400
So and we will go over
both of those today.

1158
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,160
Okay. So web tables

1159
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,000
are our elements

1160
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,120
on the Web page,

1161
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:30,000
right.

1162
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,080
Which are constructed

1163
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,000
by having

1164
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,800
rows and columns.

1165
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,320
Okay.

1166
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:44,760
And types of web

1167
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:50,400
tables.

1168
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:55,800
First of all, it can be static web tables.

1169
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,800
The second one is dynamic

1170
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:01,560
Web tables.

1171
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,120
Right. Okay.

1172
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,240
So obviously static table guys,

1173
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:12,240
what can it be?

1174
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:15,320
Rows and columns are fixed, right?

1175
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,440
So dynamic would not be fixed

1176
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:24,240
dynamic will be the information
inside the web table will be changing some

1177
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,680
some rows will be deleting or more rows

1178
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,960
will be adding inside that table.

1179
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,520
Okay.

1180
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,080
So let's go ahead

1181
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,280
and take a look how the web table is.

1182
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,360
Can inside our HTML.

1183
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:47,280
Okay, So let me do this.

1184
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:48,440
Okay.

1185
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:51,520
So this is our table, right?

1186
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,880
So let me put this bigger in here.

1187
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,360
Okay.

1188
01:34:55,680 --> 01:35:00,360
So if you look in here,
what kind of tag we have

1189
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:07,800
for tables, guys?

1190
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,840
Pretty straightforward, right?

1191
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,400
It's a taped table tag.

1192
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,200
So now

1193
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:18,560
our table is consist is consisted
of two different parts.

1194
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:19,640
Okay.

1195
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:25,480
So this is the first part,
which is a table head.

1196
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:30,520
And then the second part
is the table body.

1197
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:35,240
Okay, so and this kind of tables,

1198
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,480
they don't appear always okay.

1199
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:46,120
Sometimes developers include the header
of the table inside the body as well.

1200
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:46,960
Okay.

1201
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:51,280
In this case, what we have
we have a table, we have a head in here

1202
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,040
and we have t body separately.

1203
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:56,080
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

1204
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:02,400
Any questions on that?

1205
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,720
Okay, good.

1206
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:07,320
All right,
so now let's open up our header.

1207
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,720
Okay, So let's expand this.

1208
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,480
So what do we have in here? This.

1209
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:15,120
So I have a header, and then I have a t r.

1210
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:16,120
Okay.

1211
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:19,320
What does it stand for?

1212
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,840
Anyone knows their role, right?

1213
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:25,480
So t r stands for table of row.

1214
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:26,320
Okay.

1215
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:34,480
And then t h goes in here.

1216
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,000
Table headings.

1217
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,600
Exactly. Or you can do

1218
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:41,320
it. If it's under the

1219
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:44,400
t hat, it's going to be t t h

1220
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:48,440
because it should be the heading
of that column.

1221
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,640
Right. Okay.

1222
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:54,760
So now let's
go ahead and take a look at the body.

1223
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,040
Okay.

1224
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,920
So if you look at the body,
what do I have in here,

1225
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:04,080
guys, again, Right.

1226
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,960
We have multiple, multiple roles.

1227
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:12,560
So if I open the rows up and expand these,
what are we having in here?

1228
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:18,720
T What is the T stand for, guys?

1229
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,600
The table data.

1230
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,080
Right? Exactly.

1231
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:23,680
There we go.

1232
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:27,840
So basically you guys are
tables are consist

1233
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:31,640
consisted of table header, right?

1234
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:35,680
Which has one row and it has the headings.

1235
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:36,400
Right?

1236
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,360
And then what we have in here
we have a table body,

1237
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:45,480
we have a table rows again
and we have the table data.

1238
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:50,680
Okay, so let's go ahead in here

1239
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:55,960
and say with tables

1240
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,320
consist of

1241
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,120
different sections

1242
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,480
or we can say different parts, right?

1243
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,800
So okay, first of all, what we start with

1244
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,040
is we start with table, right?

1245
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:20,200
And we close the table.

1246
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,480
Okay, so what do we have inside the table,

1247
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:32,640
guys?

1248
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,320
We have the header and the body, right?

1249
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,520
So let's start with a T hat, right?

1250
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,880
So we have t hat in here

1251
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,560
and what we can do

1252
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:49,880
t hat is.

1253
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:52,200
All right, so let's take this here

1254
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,920
and let's take this year.

1255
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,920
Okay?
What Else do we have inside the t hat?

1256
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:03,960
What does it come next?

1257
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:04,920
Rose Right.

1258
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:08,120
So and then what we're going to have t

1259
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:11,400
are in here

1260
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:12,720
and then

1261
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:16,400
t are

1262
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:20,200
and inside the rows.

1263
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,160
What are we going to have
if it's our header?

1264
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:26,840
Guys,

1265
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:30,000
we're going to have TDs in here.

1266
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,880
We're inside the header

1267
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,160
guys, we're inside the header,

1268
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:42,480
we're inside the rows of the header.

1269
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,040
Let's take a look in here, guys.

1270
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,560
What are we having in here? Guys,

1271
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:51,160
What is the tag?

1272
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:53,760
The tag is the headings.

1273
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,520
Write the headings in here.

1274
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,640
Okay. All right.

1275
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:03,160
So what we can do in here. So

1276
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:08,760
h All right.

1277
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:13,240
And then close the not to see H

1278
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:20,760
And what we can also say
this is our column data or a heading.

1279
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:22,000
Okay.

1280
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:26,520
The now, okay, so this is what we have
inside the header, right?

1281
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,320
So after the header, what we have

1282
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:33,600
is our t body, right?

1283
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:36,240
So do we have inside the T body guys

1284
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,240
we have again

1285
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:52,720
the rows inside the T body

1286
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:00,640
and then inside the rows.

1287
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:05,400
Guys, what we're going to have,
we have the x data, right?

1288
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,400
So here

1289
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:11,280
what we can do is

1290
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:16,800
put table there.

1291
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:20,240
Okay, so this is how web tables

1292
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:23,880
are structured inside our h html.

1293
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:24,480
Okay.

1294
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:27,680
And as I said before, guys,
if you don't see the header

1295
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:31,320
inside the table
sometimes nothing to worry about.

1296
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:34,560
It's just a part of the body. Okay?

1297
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,760
So sometimes it comes with a t hat,
sometimes

1298
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,040
it's in the header is inside the T body.

1299
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,280
So this is how everything is designed
quite develop.

1300
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:48,440
Okay, so here we don't
we can't really do anything in here.

1301
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,240
Okay?

1302
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:51,360
We just have to

1303
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,120
find our elements accordingly.

1304
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,600
Okay. So

1305
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,480
this one,
this is the closing statement, right?

1306
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:08,840
So you open the t r
you close the t, right.

1307
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:15,160
So if you look in here, so you open the
the tag and you close the tag.

1308
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,200
Right.

1309
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,480
That's you put that slash.

1310
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:20,040
Okay.

1311
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:24,240
So if you see here, you open your row
and you close zero in here.

1312
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:27,560
Okay, so that's the closing of your tag.

1313
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:29,880
Okay.

1314
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,040
So now let's go back here.

1315
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:35,280
Any questions on the structure of the web
tables,

1316
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:47,040
guys?

1317
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,880
Player so far.

1318
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:50,520
Okay, good.

1319
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:51,360
Okay.

1320
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:55,080
So now what
we going to do in this example?

1321
01:42:55,080 --> 01:43:00,680
Guys, We're going to go ahead and start
navigate this Web page.

1322
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,520
Okay. Well, well,

1323
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:03,840
well.

1324
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,360
Identify this table.

1325
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,520
What we're going to do

1326
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,560
is we're going to see how many rows
we have inside our table.

1327
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,560
Okay. And then

1328
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,920
what we're going to do,

1329
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,720
we're going to get all the text
from the rows.

1330
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:22,640
We're going to print it out
inside our console.

1331
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,600
Okay. Is it clear, guys?

1332
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:30,320
Any questions before we get started?

1333
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:30,960
Okay.

1334
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,160
Seems like not right.

1335
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:36,080
Okay, So let me create

1336
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,720
a new

1337
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,920
class in here and length

1338
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:45,720
study

1339
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:53,240
of table.

1340
01:43:53,240 --> 01:43:56,720
Also. Okay.

1341
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:05,960
This will change

1342
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:17,360
my view of all your.

1343
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,720
Okay, so we're navigating
to that website, right?

1344
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:26,720
So now what I need to do,
I need to locate this

1345
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:28,880
table.

1346
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,520
Okay. Okay.

1347
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:39,920
Let me send you the length.

1348
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,560
There we go. Okay, guys.

1349
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,960
So now what I am going to do,

1350
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,200
I am going to locate this element
step by step.

1351
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,280
Okay?

1352
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:55,440
So what I need in here,
I need to print out

1353
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,960
all the raw information.

1354
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:04,080
Okay, so what I'm going to do.

1355
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:08,200
So most of the time, guys, whenever you're
interacting with the tables,

1356
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:12,680
okay, what you want to do,
you want to get access to the rows.

1357
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,840
And if you want to do that,

1358
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:19,400
then most of the time
you will be using an expat.

1359
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,920
Okay, so what I will do here

1360
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:27,240
are start locating my rows.

1361
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:30,160
Okay, so

1362
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:33,120
in here

1363
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,480
I'll do a double slash, right?

1364
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:39,560
I have my table.

1365
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:42,960
And what am I identifying
my table by guys in here?

1366
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:46,920
What do we have that we can identify it by

1367
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,640
the ID, Right.

1368
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:51,760
So I have an I.D.

1369
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,880
in here is equal to

1370
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,400
task table.

1371
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,800
Right. So one of one. Right.

1372
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:06,840
So what I want to do,
I want to capture all the rows right now.

1373
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:16,880
Okay, So what I need to do, guys in here.

1374
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,520
So if I want to capture all their rows,

1375
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:24,720
how would do this?

1376
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,920
There we go. So

1377
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:30,920
after the table, I want to go to my body.

1378
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:31,600
Right?

1379
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:37,200
So what I can do is put a slash in here
and do t bottom right.

1380
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:40,560
So now let's expand our body in here.

1381
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:46,440
So what I need here,
I need access to all the rows.

1382
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,360
Right?

1383
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,400
I'm going to put another slash
and I'll do t r.

1384
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:55,600
So how many roles do we have now
or how many elements did we locate?

1385
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:59,920
Right now
we located seven elements, right?

1386
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:06,400
So if we have more than one element,
how do we handle this kind of situations?

1387
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,560
Inside my script, guys, where do we store

1388
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,840
these?

1389
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:16,040
We find the elements and then we set them.

1390
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:19,200
We we store them inside the list. Right?

1391
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,480
Okay, so let me copy this.

1392
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:25,960
Get back to our script now.

1393
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:28,680
So now what I'm doing here, Driver

1394
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,200
Dot, find elements right

1395
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:37,240
by experts

1396
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,880
pasted in here.

1397
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,240
Right.

1398
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:42,520
And then assign it to the list of

1399
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,520
web elements.

1400
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:50,320
Right and stuff elements in here.

1401
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:54,240
What I can do is

1402
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,480
throw data right from the table

1403
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:02,240
and import from this facility.

1404
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:05,040
All right. Is this clear? Is the line 18?

1405
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:12,760
Clear, guys.

1406
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,080
Okay.

1407
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:16,640
How to find it in X path?

1408
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,640
So you start from the very top, right?

1409
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,640
So you have the table.

1410
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:23,400
You start your X path

1411
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:27,240
with, the table tag,
and then you see it has an idea, right?

1412
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:32,280
So you can identify that table by ID
and now what you want to do,

1413
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:39,480
you want to move forward
until you get the access to the table.

1414
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:46,520
Rose Okay. Why?

1415
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,240
Why use ID instead of class?

1416
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,760
Why are we using ID instead of class guys?

1417
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:53,280
Okay, Classified as space.

1418
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:53,880
That's fine.

1419
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,360
Is there any other reason why we using ID

1420
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:00,840
guys?

1421
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,000
It's faster. What else?

1422
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,960
It is unique, right?

1423
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,880
It is always unique.

1424
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,560
Unless you have some numeric values
in there.

1425
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:14,200
Okay, ID is more reliable.

1426
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:17,240
Okay,
so that's why we're using ID in here.

1427
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,560
So now what I want to do.

1428
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,560
I don't want any headers in here.

1429
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:24,880
I only want the actual information.

1430
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:25,840
Right.

1431
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:30,120
So what I want to do
I want to go to my body

1432
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:34,120
and then I want to go to the table rows,

1433
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,160
step by step, right.

1434
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,800
Okay. So let's get back to our script now.

1435
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,440
So if I want to see if I want to print out

1436
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:47,520
how many rows
I have in my console, what would I do?

1437
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:48,160
Guys, if you

1438
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:54,480
size.

1439
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:55,240
Right.

1440
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,760
Okay, so let's print it out real quick

1441
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,360
in here.

1442
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:04,320
Real data that size.

1443
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:09,840
Okay, So let's run this.

1444
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:15,880
Let's run
this and see what we're going to have.

1445
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:19,000
Well,
we're going to have inside the console

1446
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:27,440
right?

1447
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,520
Okay. Well navigated here.

1448
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:30,240
Let's get back.

1449
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,520
Okay. Seven rows, right?

1450
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,200
We located seven elements.

1451
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:38,040
We have
we have printed seven rows in here.

1452
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:39,480
So everything is good.

1453
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,280
So that means we have those elements.

1454
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:42,320
Everything is good.

1455
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:46,320
So now, guys, I want to get all the

1456
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:51,840
all the data and print it one by one.

1457
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:52,320
Right?

1458
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,800
So since we are interacting
with different, different elements

1459
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:00,920
at the same time, what do we need to do?

1460
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:04,040
We can either loop right or what?

1461
01:51:04,040 --> 01:51:06,200
What else can we use, guys?

1462
01:51:06,200 --> 01:51:09,080
We can use an iterator right?

1463
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:10,560
Okay, there we go.

1464
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,320
So let's try to use iterator
and we'll use loop later as well.

1465
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,520
Okay?

1466
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:20,040
So what I'm going to do here,
I have an iterator of what guys

1467
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:26,280
what am I to writing through in here? The

1468
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:28,680
web elements.

1469
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:29,080
Right?

1470
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:32,280
So I'm iterating through the web elements

1471
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:36,560
and this row data

1472
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:40,840
is going to give me that iterator.

1473
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,080
Right. Okay.

1474
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:46,480
So now instead of using the
for loop in here,

1475
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:50,520
what we're going to have,
we will be using the while, right?

1476
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,520
So while

1477
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:57,560
there is something on my next step, right.

1478
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:00,720
Only then what we're going to do,
we won't be going

1479
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:04,520
inside this

1480
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:06,640
inside that while.

1481
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:09,440
Okay,
so now what do I need to do next, guys?

1482
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,680
What I want to do at the very

1483
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:15,560
and I want to print out all the

1484
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:19,200
all the information

1485
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:24,840
inside my console.

1486
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,160
Yes, that's a good one.

1487
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:27,320
Yeah. So.

1488
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:29,600
But let's do it step by step.

1489
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:30,280
Okay.

1490
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:33,680
So what is my next step if I do if I

1491
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:35,840
if I take one

1492
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,520
step forward, what am I getting in
return, guys?

1493
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,800
So let's do

1494
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,040
that next. Right?

1495
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:46,880
What am I getting in return here?

1496
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,480
Am I getting a string, guys?

1497
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:51,320
What am I to writing through?

1498
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,440
Am I to writing through strings?

1499
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,120
No. Right.

1500
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:57,720
I'm iterating through the web elements.

1501
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:00,880
So web element

1502
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:05,640
row is equal to my next step, right?

1503
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:09,040
So in order for me to get the string now,

1504
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:17,880
what am I doing?

1505
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:20,880
I need to get the text of that row. Right?

1506
01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:23,640
So string

1507
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,520
row text is equal to

1508
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:31,320
that text in here, right?

1509
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,840
And then what I need to

1510
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:36,680
I need to print this out.

1511
01:53:37,080 --> 01:53:39,520
Okay, So let's run this

1512
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:57,080
and see what
we're going to have in our console.

1513
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,680
Okay. I would go and navigated here.

1514
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:03,960
So as you can see here, we printed

1515
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,920
all the data from the

1516
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,360
from this table.

1517
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:13,240
Pretty cool, right, guys?

1518
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:17,800
So what we did,
we just identified all the rows, right?

1519
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:21,200
We started iterating through them, right?

1520
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,800
We got the text in here
and we simply printed it out.

1521
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:27,080
Okay.

1522
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:39,280
Any questions, guys?

1523
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,520
Feel good? Okay, cool.

1524
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:51,400
So now what I want to do.

1525
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:56,640
So now what I want to do, guys,
I want to print the headers as well.

1526
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:57,960
Okay?

1527
01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:02,560
Each heading that we have in here,
I want to print them as well.

1528
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:04,800
How would I do this?

1529
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,320
So we printed all the rows.

1530
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:09,120
Now what?

1531
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:27,720
What do I need to do in here
to print all the headings?

1532
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:29,440
Okay, that's a very good idea.

1533
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:35,240
Yes. So let's let's go ahead and start
looking for the headings.

1534
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:38,400
Right
So we need to locate the headings first.

1535
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:39,600
Right.

1536
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:43,920
So where are my headings
located in this table.

1537
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:48,120
So this part of my expense
should be fine, right?

1538
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:50,960
Because I'm still interacting
with the same table.

1539
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:52,560
Right.

1540
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,440
What's going to come after this?

1541
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:56,960
Guys?

1542
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:02,120
So what I want to do,
I want to get the headers.

1543
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:13,160
Where am I going next in here?

1544
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:16,480
Okay, I need to go to the T head.

1545
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:17,360
Right.

1546
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:27,360
And what else is that? It?

1547
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:30,400
I want to go to the rows

1548
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,840
and I want to go to the heading
themselves.

1549
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:35,120
Right.

1550
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:38,240
So the heading would be our column. Right.

1551
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,640
So this is the first column

1552
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:43,280
you can see

1553
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:45,240
here.

1554
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,280
One, two, three, four. Right.

1555
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:51,440
So we basically moving
through the columns, right?

1556
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:55,160
So with located four different in here,

1557
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:59,760
what are we going to do with these.

1558
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:03,600
Let me copy this exact

1559
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,280
storing them in a set

1560
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:13,560
or store them in a list right.

1561
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:14,520
Okay.

1562
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:17,680
So list of

1563
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,080
web element, right.

1564
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:24,840
So columns data in here

1565
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:29,120
is equal to driver
dot find elements, right

1566
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:33,280
by express,

1567
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:36,360
place it in here.

1568
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:37,320
All right.

1569
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:41,280
So now what I want to do,
I want to know how many columns

1570
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:49,080
I have.

1571
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,640
We need the size, right?

1572
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:53,120
So print out

1573
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,760
columns, data size.

1574
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:02,200
So since we already used the iterator
in the previous example,

1575
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:05,680
what I want to do,
I want to use a for loop in here.

1576
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:09,000
Okay, so

1577
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,560
create a for loop.

1578
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,280
Right.

1579
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,880
I am iterating

1580
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:19,600
through all the columns, data.

1581
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:20,280
Right.

1582
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:24,440
So what,
what is this container contains of

1583
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:27,920
web elements?

1584
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:29,920
Right. So

1585
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:33,000
web elements in here,

1586
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,360
what I can do column data,

1587
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:39,320
right.

1588
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,520
And then what do I need to do here guys,

1589
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:44,880
in order for me to print it inside

1590
01:58:44,880 --> 01:59:02,760
my console?

1591
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:07,360
It's a writer.

1592
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:09,080
Okay, We already have a loop, right?

1593
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,000
What is my next

1594
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:15,360
step, guys?

1595
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:19,800
We get the text
and we simply printed it out.

1596
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:20,760
Right?

1597
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:23,520
So string

1598
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:28,240
alum text is equal to

1599
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,720
column data.

1600
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,200
Get text

1601
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:35,680
and then print out

1602
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,520
column text in here.

1603
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:45,000
Okay.

1604
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:45,480
All right.

1605
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:48,120
So let's run this, guys, and see

1606
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:53,000
if we are able
to print out the column data

1607
01:59:53,000 --> 02:00:02,760
as well.

1608
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:05,040
Okay. Here.

1609
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:05,880
All right.

1610
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:08,400
So after this

1611
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:09,840
print line, right.

1612
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,400
We can see that we have four,
four columns now.

1613
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:17,640
These are the text of those columns.

1614
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:19,800
Pretty cool, right, guys?

1615
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:22,160
So we can manipulate

1616
02:00:22,160 --> 02:00:26,760
we can get the text from the rows,
We can get the text from the headers

1617
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:30,880
and we can print them inside our console.

1618
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:31,480
Right.

1619
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:51,600
Any questions, guys?

1620
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:54,280
Confused a little bit with this one.

1621
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:58,360
Okay, let's go back in here.

1622
02:00:58,360 --> 02:00:58,840
All right.

1623
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:04,080
So what we need to do is we
we need to look for the header, right?

1624
02:01:04,640 --> 02:01:07,160
So where is our header located?

1625
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:09,920
It's inside the table.

1626
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:10,200
Right.

1627
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:14,280
So if you go inside the table,
you need to go inside the t hat.

1628
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:15,720
Right.

1629
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:21,560
So if I the t hat,
what do I have inside my head, guys,

1630
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:25,200
I have one row in here, right?

1631
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:28,800
So if I expand the row then you can see

1632
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:34,440
I have four different data
which is the heading data, right.

1633
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,840
Or which is the column data.

1634
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:38,000
Okay.

1635
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:43,000
So inside one row, I have four different

1636
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:45,120
column data.

1637
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:48,480
So this is how we should go
by the hierarchy.

1638
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:52,560
So you, you identified the table,
you go to the header,

1639
02:01:52,840 --> 02:01:55,880
you go to its row and you go to its data.

1640
02:01:56,640 --> 02:01:59,960
Okay?

1641
02:01:59,960 --> 02:02:07,240
So you have to move one by one.

1642
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:08,640
Yes, you are getting them right.

1643
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:11,680
So if you look, you identify
we identified four different

1644
02:02:11,680 --> 02:02:20,200
elements.

1645
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:26,400
Okay, Yeah,

1646
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:30,000
almost like an absolute, but you don't
really start from the very top, right?

1647
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,680
So you start from the table and
this is how the furthest that you can go.

1648
02:02:35,680 --> 02:02:40,200
Okay, so after the T or TD,
there's nothing else in the

1649
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,080
inside

1650
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:58,840
the table.

1651
02:02:58,840 --> 02:02:59,320
Okay.

1652
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:14,160
Any questions, guys?

1653
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:17,240
All right, so

1654
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:28,480
let's get back here.

1655
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,040
Okay.

1656
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:34,840
So now what we're going to do, we will be
interacting with the dynamic table.

1657
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:35,760
Okay?

1658
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:40,440
So we set that dynamic
table is what the dynamic table is,

1659
02:03:40,440 --> 02:03:45,320
where inside the table
there might be some changes, some

1660
02:03:46,360 --> 02:03:50,760
new raw insertions,
or it may be something deleted in there.

1661
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:51,560
Right.

1662
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:53,920
So those are the dynamic

1663
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:59,200
web tables, right?

1664
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:00,040
All right.

1665
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:02,760
Too much info today, as I said.

1666
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:03,640
Right, guys?

1667
02:04:03,640 --> 02:04:05,800
Yesterday,
It's going to be intense a little bit.

1668
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,920
So bear with me, guys. Okay.

1669
02:04:07,920 --> 02:04:10,920
A little bit left.

1670
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:11,640
Okay.

1671
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:15,760
We'll

1672
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:19,640
finish the dynamic tables
and then you guys should be good to go.

1673
02:04:20,280 --> 02:04:24,320
Okay.

1674
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:24,920
All right.

1675
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:27,800
So let me actually log in

1676
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:33,280
here.

1677
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,160
Okay. So now, guys,

1678
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,280
what are you seeing in here?

1679
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,600
What do we have in here right after we log

1680
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:48,240
in, Guys, we have a table, right?

1681
02:04:49,240 --> 02:04:53,080
We have a table is the list of the orders.

1682
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:53,640
Right?

1683
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:56,680
So how do we know if it's dynamic
or static?

1684
02:04:56,680 --> 02:05:03,360
Table guys?

1685
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:07,520
Okay, so we have the delete selected
button, right?

1686
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:13,400
Or you can see that there are checkboxes
in here that you can select.

1687
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:14,440
Right.

1688
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:19,160
And since this is the list of all orders,
so that means

1689
02:05:19,160 --> 02:05:24,240
if you receive any more order,
this table is going to get updated.

1690
02:05:24,760 --> 02:05:27,400
Or if you if you're done with the order

1691
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:31,920
or if it's a wrong order,
you can go ahead and delete that order.

1692
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:33,120
Right.

1693
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:37,920
So the username and password
is right on the on the website.

1694
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:43,800
That's under the password.

1695
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:44,160
Okay.

1696
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:48,240
So what we're going to do is

1697
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:50,240
we will be interacting

1698
02:05:50,240 --> 02:05:53,200
with this table today and

1699
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:56,440
to interact.

1700
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:58,000
So then it's a dynamic.

1701
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,800
Yes, a link for

1702
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,880
you should have the link
I think already guys.

1703
02:06:07,880 --> 02:06:08,320
Right.

1704
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:18,720
So because we worked on this website,
a lot of times.

1705
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:21,960
All right, so let's get started with

1706
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:26,080
with the log in.

1707
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,600
So let's go back in here
and let me open up

1708
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:35,160
a new Java class

1709
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,080
and link

1710
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:45,200
dynamic table.

1711
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:47,600
And this

1712
02:06:55,920 --> 02:07:07,600
this one, let's keep that

1713
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:19,120
this.

1714
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:19,440
All right.

1715
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:22,640
So the first thing, what do we
what do we want to do, guys in here

1716
02:07:30,160 --> 02:07:31,640
find the element, right?

1717
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:35,160
Find the log in and

1718
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:36,360
password.

1719
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:42,800
So let me inspect this.

1720
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:45,360
Go ahead and see.

1721
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:45,720
Okay.

1722
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:46,840
There is an idea, guys.

1723
02:07:46,840 --> 02:07:49,560
So let me get this ID

1724
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:53,520
and create

1725
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:57,560
a web element

1726
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:00,560
username equal to

1727
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,360
five or fun element

1728
02:08:06,440 --> 02:08:07,880
by the

1729
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,520
then username

1730
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:15,000
sentence.

1731
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:15,560
All right.

1732
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:18,720
And our username is

1733
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:22,840
that's the

1734
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:34,280
right.

1735
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:34,600
Yeah.

1736
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:38,280
I mean it's it's not good to use
but you can use a different one.

1737
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,000
That's fine.

1738
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,960
You can use you can do you can

1739
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:46,440
you can do an X path and do contains
so that you don't

1740
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:49,880
have to use this numeric values in here.

1741
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:51,720
Right. But usually it's not.

1742
02:08:51,720 --> 02:08:55,520
But since this is a test website,
it doesn't really it's not going

1743
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:57,360
to change anything in here.

1744
02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:03,840
Okay.

1745
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:04,440
All right.

1746
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:11,120
So elements.

1747
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:25,160
So now let's figure out the password.

1748
02:09:25,160 --> 02:09:27,520
Okay. So it has an idea as well.

1749
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,480
So I'm going to copy this

1750
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:41,400
idea.

1751
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:43,440
Right. And

1752
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:51,480
I will send these in here again,
this is my password, which is

1753
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:53,760
password test.

1754
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:54,440
Right.

1755
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:57,320
And now what I need to do,

1756
02:09:57,680 --> 02:10:01,440
I just need to go ahead and click on log

1757
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:05,280
in right now.

1758
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:07,240
There is an idea again in here.

1759
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:11,760
So I'm the copy that.

1760
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:14,960
What elements

1761
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,800
find elements like that I d again

1762
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:29,040
here.

1763
02:10:29,160 --> 02:10:31,680
So in this case what we're going to do

1764
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:34,880
will be simply clicking this right.

1765
02:10:35,440 --> 02:10:37,560
Okay. So let's go back in here.

1766
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:45,360
Let's log in.

1767
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:48,200
Okay, guys.
So is everyone clear what I did?

1768
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:55,080
From line 16 to 21 guys.

1769
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:56,240
Okay, good.

1770
02:10:56,240 --> 02:10:58,920
So now let's get back to our page. Right.

1771
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:02,720
So what we to do in here again, guys,

1772
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,840
we want to

1773
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:08,640
we want to interact with the table,

1774
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:12,560
but this time,
what I want to do, I want to go ahead

1775
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:15,840
after I print

1776
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:20,120
all the text inside my console,
what I want to do,

1777
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:23,920
I want to click on this order book,

1778
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:26,320
which has a bulb feather name in here.

1779
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:28,080
Is that clear?

1780
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:31,400
You guys?

1781
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:34,760
Any questions?

1782
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:37,360
Okay, so where do we start, guys?

1783
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:40,120
So if the task is clear, where do I start?

1784
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:41,560
In here. I logged in.

1785
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:43,800
Everything is good. I see the table.

1786
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:58,640
What's my next step?

1787
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:03,920
I need to find the rows.

1788
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:04,360
Right.

1789
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:07,720
So I need to interact
with the rows. Right.

1790
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:10,840
So Let's see in here.

1791
02:12:10,840 --> 02:12:13,160
This is our table. Right.

1792
02:12:13,360 --> 02:12:15,120
So do we have a table header in?

1793
02:12:15,120 --> 02:12:22,080
Here goes.

1794
02:12:22,080 --> 02:12:22,680
No. Right.

1795
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:25,920
If you look inside the HTML,

1796
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:29,560
there's no section or part which is t hat.

1797
02:12:29,560 --> 02:12:29,840
Right.

1798
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:34,760
So as I said before, guys,
not all the tables will be inside

1799
02:12:35,640 --> 02:12:39,240
with not all the tables will consist of t
hat and t body.

1800
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:39,800
Right.

1801
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:43,520
So in this case, the whole table,

1802
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:48,480
the whole rows,
they are stored inside the T body.

1803
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:53,120
Okay, so I open the selector box in here

1804
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:57,880
and I will start to identify

1805
02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:00,400
this table for table.

1806
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:02,040
Right.

1807
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:04,560
So what do we have in here?

1808
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:07,640
So we have ID, so let's use this IP

1809
02:13:07,640 --> 02:13:12,360
in here. I d

1810
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:15,320
place it here.

1811
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:17,680
Okay, so we identified our table.

1812
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:18,960
This is good.

1813
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:33,840
Okay, so where do I go next, guys?

1814
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,000
T bottom. Right?

1815
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:39,000
So I'm going to go to t body and, then

1816
02:13:39,480 --> 02:13:45,160
I will go to t r.

1817
02:13:45,160 --> 02:13:45,600
All right.

1818
02:13:45,600 --> 02:13:49,800
So now we captured all the roles in here.

1819
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,400
Okay, so we got nine in here,

1820
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:59,160
So we captured nine different elements,
Right?

1821
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:00,520
Okay,

1822
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:03,360
so let's go back in here.

1823
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:05,560
So what do I do with those nine elements?

1824
02:14:05,560 --> 02:14:06,400
Guys,

1825
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:09,320
let me.

1826
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:11,640
Okay, this

1827
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:13,880
what we're going to do,
we will be storing them

1828
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:18,040
inside the list right

1829
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:20,960
list of with

1830
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:25,400
elements in here, say rows

1831
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:29,080
C drive or

1832
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:31,520
find elements

1833
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:34,600
by X Factor in here.

1834
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:37,560
Is this right?

1835
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:40,560
And let's import the list.

1836
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:41,840
Okay.

1837
02:14:42,920 --> 02:14:45,280
So now what I want to do,

1838
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:50,240
I want to get all the text,
print it out inside my console.

1839
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:56,200
But this time what I want to do,
I want to use the regular loop guys.

1840
02:14:56,400 --> 02:15:00,160
Okay,

1841
02:15:00,160 --> 02:15:02,840
so we stored everything in the loop.

1842
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:07,000
So I'm starting my for loop in here.

1843
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,480
So where do I start from Guessing here.

1844
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:13,440
So I have an integer I write is equal

1845
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:17,880
to what?

1846
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:18,840
From zero.

1847
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:21,440
Okay. From zero.

1848
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:24,440
And then I is less than what

1849
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:31,200
the size.

1850
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:31,600
Right?

1851
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:36,240
So we have rows that size

1852
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:41,800
and then we will be incrementing by one.

1853
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:45,040
Okay. All right. So this is our for loop.

1854
02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:46,720
What do I need to do next, guys?

1855
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:49,160
How do I print everything out?

1856
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:50,720
There we go.

1857
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:55,720
So we get the string.

1858
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:59,160
So text right

1859
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:01,280
is equal to

1860
02:16:01,800 --> 02:16:06,240
rows that get I here, right?

1861
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:07,280
Because we lose.

1862
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:10,040
We're using the regular for loop.

1863
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:13,040
So we need to go with the indexes in here

1864
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:15,600
and then get text.

1865
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:20,000
And then what we need to do in here,

1866
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:24,800
we can simply print out a row text.

1867
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:25,640
Right. Okay.

1868
02:16:25,640 --> 02:16:43,240
So let me run this
and see what we're going to have.

1869
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:48,600
Okay.

1870
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:49,640
There we go.

1871
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,200
All right. So what do we see in here?

1872
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:55,200
So it printed all the rows in here,

1873
02:16:55,360 --> 02:16:58,680
but what did it
include inside our console guys?

1874
02:17:00,600 --> 02:17:04,120
So other than all the all the

1875
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:08,160
what's called the data and all the orders,

1876
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:13,280
what else do we have inside my console?

1877
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:15,600
The title of each column. Right.

1878
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:18,360
So the headers. What if I don't want them?

1879
02:17:18,920 --> 02:17:21,120
How do I, how do I get rid of those guys

1880
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,280
if condition?

1881
02:17:28,400 --> 02:17:29,960
Why do we need an F condition?

1882
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:32,760
What do I put in this condition?

1883
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:36,240
We can simply start from one.

1884
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:38,000
Right? Exactly.

1885
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,520
There we go. So

1886
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:44,080
because everything is under t body.

1887
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:49,880
So instead of starting from zero
element of the mess,

1888
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:53,640
we can start from the first one and let's

1889
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:55,520
we run this

1890
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:58,960
and see if we can get rid of

1891
02:17:58,960 --> 02:18:09,800
so right. Okay

1892
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:11,840
here. There we go.

1893
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:16,480
So we only have the information about the

1894
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:21,040
what do you call about the

1895
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:23,000
orders. Right.

1896
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,600
So now, guys, what I want to do in here,

1897
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:29,000
I want to go ahead and click

1898
02:18:29,240 --> 02:18:32,040
on this particular checkbox.

1899
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:36,080
How would I do this?

1900
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:37,880
Any thoughts

1901
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:49,120
contains.

1902
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:57,000
Okay,

1903
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,840
Boolean method.

1904
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:00,440
Okay.

1905
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:03,160
What do I have inside the if condition?

1906
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:06,360
Okay, so if condition,
what am I having inside the?

1907
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:09,400
If okay, so let's say I have okay.

1908
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:12,840
Is okay

1909
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:16,240
a row tax right

1910
02:19:18,840 --> 02:19:21,360
contains let's say

1911
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:27,240
we're looking for a bulb feather right?

1912
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:38,320
Okay then what am I clicking on?

1913
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:40,600
CheckBox. Okay. Where's my check box guys,

1914
02:19:41,800 --> 02:19:46,880
did I identify the checkbox in here?

1915
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:48,560
No. Right,

1916
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:50,400
not yet.

1917
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:52,280
There we go. We haven't decided yet.

1918
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:56,160
So now let's go back in here and find.

1919
02:19:56,160 --> 02:20:02,720
Okay,
so how do I want to locate the checkbox?

1920
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:05,560
The do I just locate this one does

1921
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:14,280
or how do we want to keep this?

1922
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:17,680
Okay, so we have ID name

1923
02:20:17,680 --> 02:20:22,440
so we can just locate one checkbox in here
and go ahead and click.

1924
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:22,960
This does

1925
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:30,440
How do we want to approach this?

1926
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:31,080
Guys?

1927
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:41,200
Any thoughts?

1928
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:44,160
I can locate them all.

1929
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:48,200
Okay.

1930
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:48,760
Okay, guys.

1931
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:51,240
So here what we want to do,

1932
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:56,240
we want to locate all the checkboxes.

1933
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:58,360
Why am I locating all the checkboxes?

1934
02:20:58,360 --> 02:21:01,080
Why am I not just coming here
and clicking on this one

1935
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:12,040
in case the data changes in the future?

1936
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:13,720
Right, Exactly.

1937
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:16,360
So we said this is a dynamic web table.

1938
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:18,760
So tomorrow it can be the bulb

1939
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:23,080
feather can be the last in here of orders
or the first one.

1940
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:25,160
We don't know that. Right.

1941
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:30,360
So if we just locate this checkbox,
it won't click on that.

1942
02:21:30,880 --> 02:21:32,840
Right. Okay.

1943
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:35,760
So now what I will do, I will get

1944
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:39,520
all the checkboxes are available for me.

1945
02:21:39,880 --> 02:21:43,840
Okay, So I am inside the rows right now.

1946
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:45,400
Right?

1947
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:48,680
So where is my checkboxes located?

1948
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:53,840
It's inside each row, but it's inside
only one thing.

1949
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:54,320
Guys.

1950
02:21:54,320 --> 02:22:06,080
What is it?

1951
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:09,400
Input. It's inside the column. Right.

1952
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:15,600
So it's only inside the first column
that we have inside our table.

1953
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:16,400
Right?

1954
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:19,960
So so far, by this X path, guys,

1955
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:24,640
what we did is
we only identified the rows, right?

1956
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:30,600
So what I need to do now,
I need to go ahead and identify

1957
02:22:30,840 --> 02:22:33,120
only the

1958
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:36,000
okay, so how am I going to do this?

1959
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:38,160
So let's take a look.

1960
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:50,840
What do I have inside my rows, guys?

1961
02:22:50,840 --> 02:22:52,240
What is inside my rows?

1962
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:55,040
Guys, the table data. Right.

1963
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:57,480
Which one of these table

1964
02:22:58,400 --> 02:23:01,120
consists of a checkbox? Does

1965
02:23:16,360 --> 02:23:17,520
TDI want input?

1966
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:19,040
The first one, right?

1967
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,520
Only the first data of

1968
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:26,600
of each row has the checkbox.

1969
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:27,000
Right.

1970
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,240
So what we can simply do in here,
we can put td1.

1971
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:35,120
Okay. And it will

1972
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:37,680
that particular cell.

1973
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:38,760
Okay.

1974
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:42,120
And you can see we identified
only eight of them.

1975
02:23:42,400 --> 02:23:46,800
So let's go ahead here you can see that

1976
02:23:46,800 --> 02:23:50,800
we identified all the checkboxes in here.

1977
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:52,080
Okay.

1978
02:23:52,080 --> 02:24:08,240
Any questions on guys?

1979
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:14,600
Why not?

1980
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:17,200
Okay, so you want to do a text box?

1981
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:18,600
Sather Right.

1982
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:21,600
So what if what you're

1983
02:24:23,440 --> 02:24:25,840
here, your condition changes?

1984
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:35,440
What is it going to click on?

1985
02:24:35,440 --> 02:24:37,440
It won't work, right?

1986
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:41,520
So if your condition changes in here,
then you're going to have to manipulate

1987
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:44,920
with your
with your checkbox as well. Okay?

1988
02:24:44,960 --> 02:24:49,920
So that makes it to a different two
different places to change it.

1989
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:55,400
Okay, so what you want to do, if anything
changes, if your condition changes,

1990
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:58,960
so you want to make changes in your script

1991
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:01,440
as less as possible.

1992
02:25:02,040 --> 02:25:03,440
Okay.

1993
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:08,160
So here
we identified eight different checkboxes.

1994
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:10,040
So I'm going to copy this.

1995
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:13,640
And what I will do in here?

1996
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:17,240
So if I, if we identified a checkboxes,
what are we doing

1997
02:25:17,240 --> 02:25:18,320
with those

1998
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:33,200
two? Right.

1999
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:36,520
Before we iterate,
we need to store them right?

2000
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:39,160
We need to store them in a list

2001
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:43,280
of web elements

2002
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,840
right here.

2003
02:25:44,840 --> 02:25:47,320
We can say the checkboxes

2004
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,680
is equal to the driver

2005
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:53,240
that find elements

2006
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:58,520
by x path

2007
02:25:58,680 --> 02:26:01,680
and paste my x path in here.

2008
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:02,720
Okay guys.

2009
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:05,840
So now what
do I need to do in order to click

2010
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,360
on that checkbox?

2011
02:26:10,360 --> 02:26:22,520
If let's not check
if it's selected or not yet.

2012
02:26:22,520 --> 02:26:25,760
Okay, So let's just click on that
how do we do

2013
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:40,680
that?

2014
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:43,320
I am using a specific name.

2015
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:46,400
I'm using specific name in here, right?

2016
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:50,840
So if I change this to a different name,
you're path is not going to work

2017
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:58,480
right?

2018
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:01,480
So your X path indicates

2019
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:04,760
your Xbox indicates box further in there.

2020
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:11,000
What if I change the name in here?

2021
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:15,200
Then I'm going to have to change your
your X path as well.

2022
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:23,280
The one you set before.

2023
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,160
Okay. All right.

2024
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:27,280
How do I click on the checkbox guys

2025
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:32,800
in here?

2026
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:43,840
So I just do checkboxes dot click.

2027
02:27:43,840 --> 02:27:44,520
Okay.

2028
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:55,000
If not, how do we do this?

2029
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:07,680
And then click okay.

2030
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:11,640
Okay, guys, we have a list of web elements
I need to get one

2031
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:17,680
finding by index.

2032
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:20,960
How do I get an element from that?

2033
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:29,560
From the list guys.

2034
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:40,360
Come on, guys, you can do this.

2035
02:28:40,360 --> 02:28:42,720
Get I. There we go. Why?

2036
02:28:42,840 --> 02:28:48,800
Why do we need another loop in here, guys?

2037
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:49,360
No. Right.

2038
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:52,720
Because we are already
iterating through those

2039
02:28:54,040 --> 02:28:55,360
through those rows.

2040
02:28:55,360 --> 02:28:57,040
Right. So we don't need another loop.

2041
02:28:57,040 --> 02:29:01,320
So We simply can do in here.

2042
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:06,480
We get one element
from that, from the list.

2043
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:09,160
And what we can do, we can click on this

2044
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:11,320
right?

2045
02:29:11,320 --> 02:29:18,840
And then what do we need to do
after we click?

2046
02:29:18,840 --> 02:29:21,480
We need to break the loop, right?

2047
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:24,400
So we need to stop it.

2048
02:29:24,400 --> 02:29:28,760
Okay, So let's run this so that you can
visually see what is going on.

2049
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:46,040
Okay?

2050
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:46,440
Okay.

2051
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:47,000
There we go.

2052
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:54,800
What happened, guys?

2053
02:29:54,800 --> 02:30:01,920
What did we click on right now?

2054
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:04,280
Everyone got the Samuel Clements, right?

2055
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:13,640
What is going on in here?

2056
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:34,640
Why did it click on the next one, guys?

2057
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:35,160
All right, go.

2058
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:36,000
Okay, let's.

2059
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:43,720
Okay, This is the code.

2060
02:30:43,720 --> 02:30:50,800
Why did it click on the next one
and not on the bop feather?

2061
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:51,480
There we go.

2062
02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:54,720
So we started from the one, right?

2063
02:30:54,960 --> 02:30:59,120
And here
I'm starting from the first element

2064
02:30:59,120 --> 02:31:01,840
in here,
from the second one right in here,

2065
02:31:02,440 --> 02:31:04,840
because our elements from there,

2066
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:08,200
from the list
is starting from the index of

2067
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:11,560
right.

2068
02:31:11,560 --> 02:31:15,400
We starting from the one
we're getting an AI in here.

2069
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:21,040
So we starting
from the second value of the checkboxes.

2070
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:23,440
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

2071
02:31:23,440 --> 02:31:25,520
Why it clicked on the next one?

2072
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:28,640
So in order to level them up,

2073
02:31:28,920 --> 02:31:33,000
what are we doing in here?

2074
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:39,840
Is it plus one or minus one?

2075
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:45,360
Is it plus
because it clicked on the next one, guys.

2076
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:48,360
So we need to get one back, right?

2077
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:54,840
So what we're going to do,
we need to do minus one in here.

2078
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:57,720
Okay, So

2079
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:00,640
let's get this rerun again

2080
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:04,440
and see if we going to

2081
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:09,120
click on the

2082
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:10,240
right one.

2083
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:13,080
And then there we go.

2084
02:32:13,080 --> 02:32:15,440
So now we have box feather in here.

2085
02:32:15,480 --> 02:32:19,760
We clicked on that checkbox
and now everything is working fine.

2086
02:32:20,360 --> 02:32:20,640
All right.

2087
02:32:22,040 --> 02:32:23,000
Any questions

2088
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:30,600
on this?

2089
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:59,720
Let me close this.

2090
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:02,160
Okay. Yours gives the same result, right?

2091
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:03,320
Okay, good.

2092
02:33:03,320 --> 02:33:06,720
So now change the condition in here.

2093
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:11,400
Change the condition in here
to this Susan MacLaren

2094
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:15,800
and run your code.

2095
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:18,120
But do not change your X path, okay?

2096
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:28,000
What's going to happen?

2097
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,840
See, that's what I was telling you, Andre.

2098
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:33,120
Okay, so because you changing

2099
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:38,640
your condition in here,
but your expert has the name as well.

2100
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:41,560
So that's why that's why it's

2101
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:45,400
going to be changed
in two different places.

2102
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:47,720
If you go with your.

2103
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:51,480
Okay, first

2104
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:55,840
place.

2105
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:56,320
No, no, no.

2106
02:33:56,320 --> 02:34:01,520
It clicked on Samuel Clements
because we starting from one in here.

2107
02:34:01,800 --> 02:34:02,400
Okay.

2108
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:06,040
So if you start from one in here,
that means you starting

2109
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:12,360
from the second checkbox in here
so that that's why you going one forward.

2110
02:34:12,400 --> 02:34:13,040
Okay.

2111
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:16,800
So order for us to go in a level
with that for loop,

2112
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:19,920
we need to get one checkbox back.

2113
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:26,040
Okay.

2114
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:50,120
Any other questions guys?

2115
02:34:50,120 --> 02:34:52,800
Okay. So

2116
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,160
okay, I'll break the code.

2117
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:57,680
Okay. One second, guys. Okay.

2118
02:34:57,680 --> 02:34:59,680
So I have a question in here.

2119
02:34:59,720 --> 02:35:03,760
What if I want to click on Mark

2120
02:35:03,760 --> 02:35:07,920
Smith, Bob Sather and Claire Jefferson?

2121
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:11,200
Guys, what would I change in my code

2122
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:14,440
or how would I do this?

2123
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:24,360
Let's go back in here.

2124
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:34,280
So if Bob is lost, that's fine.

2125
02:35:34,280 --> 02:35:39,480
Put or okay,
So what if I take a look at the table guys

2126
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:43,560
using and take a look at the table?

2127
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:46,960
Do we need any or and inside our

2128
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:48,480
if condition

2129
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:52,960
it will only click one.

2130
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:56,400
Okay we don't need the break
because we're clicking on different ones.

2131
02:35:56,400 --> 02:35:57,360
That's a good point.

2132
02:35:57,360 --> 02:35:59,520
Okay. That I agree with.

2133
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:02,400
Okay, so let's go ahead and delete this.

2134
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:04,080
Right. Okay.

2135
02:36:04,080 --> 02:36:07,080
What about how how would I do?

2136
02:36:07,080 --> 02:36:11,160
How would I click these three
without putting an end

2137
02:36:11,160 --> 02:36:21,000
or statements?

2138
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:21,960
II minus two?

2139
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:26,240
Not really.

2140
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:35,600
Okay, guys,
let's take a look at the table.

2141
02:36:35,600 --> 02:36:50,840
Let's pay attention to the table rows,
guys.

2142
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:52,280
Just two more clicks.

2143
02:36:52,280 --> 02:36:52,840
Not really.

2144
02:36:52,840 --> 02:36:54,960
No. I want to keep it as it is right now.

2145
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:56,600
I don't want to add more clicks

2146
02:36:59,800 --> 02:37:00,960
by product.

2147
02:37:00,960 --> 02:37:03,280
Absolutely. Right. There we go.

2148
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:06,840
You can see in here, family album,

2149
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:11,720
family Album, Sam,
the album in here, right?

2150
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:14,600
So the product they have is the same.

2151
02:37:14,800 --> 02:37:18,240
So what you need to change in here is only

2152
02:37:20,320 --> 02:37:24,560
this part.

2153
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:26,760
Okay, so let's run this

2154
02:37:29,840 --> 02:37:31,200
and see

2155
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:33,880
if this is going
to click on three of those

2156
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:45,000
and we go 1 to 3.

2157
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:46,200
Right?

2158
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:50,200
That's why, guys,
I told you to pay attention on the table.

2159
02:37:50,440 --> 02:37:53,040
Okay. What do have on the rows, guys?

2160
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:55,320
What what is the common

2161
02:37:56,280 --> 02:38:00,080
containing text that we have
that we don't have to write a lot of code.

2162
02:38:00,400 --> 02:38:04,800
Okay.

2163
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:06,920
If there was no

2164
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:09,680
same product, then you would go with

2165
02:38:09,960 --> 02:38:13,080
with different things
you can do, you can put or

2166
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:17,160
inside your F condition
or you could do another if condition.

2167
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:18,640
So it's all up to you.

2168
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:20,640
Okay.

2169
02:38:20,640 --> 02:38:24,720
In this particular situation,
the only thing that you want to change

2170
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:27,640
is the containing text, because they have

2171
02:38:28,680 --> 02:38:31,240
they all have the same exact

2172
02:38:31,240 --> 02:38:34,680
product.

2173
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:35,480
Okay.

2174
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:43,040
Any questions, guys?

2175
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:47,400
Any questions on how to handle
static and dynamic

2176
02:38:47,400 --> 02:39:04,560
web tables?

2177
02:39:04,560 --> 02:39:08,040
And let's see,
people are typing to the code.

2178
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:19,760
Okay, yours click to checkboxes.

2179
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:21,040
Send us the screenshot.

2180
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:22,200
We want to see the code.

2181
02:39:22,200 --> 02:39:51,840
Okay.

2182
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:55,040
Okay. Any questions, guys?

2183
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:56,880
Any questions on the weights?

2184
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:58,200
Any questions on?

2185
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:38,000
The the web tables?

2186
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,080
Yeah. We just need some practice. Right.

2187
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:49,920
So see?

2188
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:54,840
Yeah, yeah.

2189
02:40:54,840 --> 02:40:57,360
The for the floor loop,
we started from zero.

2190
02:40:58,320 --> 02:41:04,000
Okay, so you need to start your
for loop from one.

2191
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:37,600
Okay.

2192
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:39,640
There are only two checkboxes.

2193
02:41:39,640 --> 02:41:57,280
There should be three
right from the album.

2194
02:41:57,280 --> 02:42:05,440
And let's see.

2195
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:07,200
Okay, it's yours.

2196
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:08,320
Checked only one.

2197
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:10,840
I think you have a break inside the loop.

2198
02:42:10,840 --> 02:42:48,320
Okay, so you need to remove that break.

2199
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:55,920
Okay, Let me see.

2200
02:42:55,920 --> 02:43:01,680
I should put on three.

2201
02:43:01,680 --> 02:43:03,280
And you're not getting any errors.

2202
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:07,480
Whoever is getting only two checkboxes,
is there any error?

2203
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:27,920
You guys getting?

2204
02:43:27,920 --> 02:43:28,600
Okay,

2205
02:43:30,240 --> 02:43:30,760
let's

2206
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,800
not sure why it's not clicking.

2207
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:07,920
It should meet one, but it's probably.

2208
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:25,280
Let's see now.

2209
02:44:25,360 --> 02:44:26,160
I should

2210
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:29,280
match or.

2211
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:31,000
Right. And

2212
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:34,960
if you have the same exact code in here

2213
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:38,040
it should be present on.

2214
02:44:38,040 --> 02:44:39,560
So you guys

2215
02:44:44,920 --> 02:44:45,840
are you worse?

2216
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:50,040
Okay, so take a look at
what is the difference between yours.

2217
02:44:50,040 --> 02:44:52,880
Your and demo of these code.

2218
02:44:53,320 --> 02:45:00,800
Okay.

2219
02:45:00,800 --> 02:45:21,240
Okay, guys, any other questions?

2220
02:45:21,240 --> 02:45:24,280
Yes, I'll push the code, guys. Okay.

2221
02:45:24,280 --> 02:45:27,080
Any questions on on anything

2222
02:45:27,080 --> 02:45:34,640
we have covered guys.

2223
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:36,440
Intense, but not too much.

2224
02:45:36,440 --> 02:45:37,920
You want more?

2225
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:45,160
I can bring more guys if you want.

2226
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:46,800
Have not today.

2227
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:49,920
Okay.

2228
02:45:49,920 --> 02:45:50,920
Only fluent ways.

2229
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:52,160
Not clear, guys. Okay.

2230
02:45:52,160 --> 02:45:54,640
Don't focus too much on the one. Great.

2231
02:45:54,680 --> 02:45:55,200
Okay.

2232
02:45:55,200 --> 02:45:57,120
I'll ask Moazzam if you can.

2233
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:59,440
If you can bring up an example. Okay.

2234
02:46:00,840 --> 02:46:03,920
I hope you can.

2235
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:08,280
And he will show you the example for the
what's called for the flown way.

2236
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:13,320
Okay.

2237
02:46:13,320 --> 02:46:15,440
And let me see actually what I have.

2238
02:46:15,440 --> 02:46:16,680
So the

2239
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:21,520
we want to have

2240
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:26,120
some more topics today.

2241
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:26,920
Unfortunately.

2242
02:46:26,920 --> 02:46:29,840
Unfortunately, we're out of time.

2243
02:46:29,840 --> 02:46:37,960
Okay. So.

2244
02:46:37,960 --> 02:46:38,520
All right.

2245
02:46:38,520 --> 02:46:40,520
So let me get this.

2246
02:46:40,520 --> 02:46:42,360
Yeah.

2247
02:46:42,360 --> 02:46:46,640
Opposed to homework in here.

2248
02:46:46,640 --> 02:46:49,360
All right. So

2249
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:54,120
let's see what it was.

2250
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:55,680
Okay, guys.

2251
02:46:55,800 --> 02:46:58,680
All right, so here is the thing.

2252
02:46:58,680 --> 02:47:01,040
So here's what I want you to do in here.

2253
02:47:01,080 --> 02:47:01,440
Okay?

2254
02:47:01,440 --> 02:47:03,480
So they

2255
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:05,280
go to this website, right?

2256
02:47:05,280 --> 02:47:08,160
Click on the checkbox and click on Remove.

2257
02:47:08,640 --> 02:47:11,520
Okay, Click on the checkbox,
click on remove.

2258
02:47:12,800 --> 02:47:16,080
So you want to do you want to make sure

2259
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:18,880
that this text is

2260
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:21,040
is appeared in here.

2261
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:22,680
Okay.

2262
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:24,240
And then

2263
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:29,040
what you want to do,
you want to enable this text box.

2264
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:32,440
Okay, You want to enable it

2265
02:47:32,680 --> 02:47:35,600
and verify that this text box is enabled.

2266
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:40,680
Type something in here
and verified this text

2267
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:45,040
and click on this some disable as well.

2268
02:47:46,480 --> 02:47:49,560
Okay, Click,

2269
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:52,880
disable and verify
that the text box is disabled.

2270
02:47:53,080 --> 02:47:55,200
Is that clear? Guys,

2271
02:47:55,880 --> 02:48:01,640
any questions.

2272
02:48:01,640 --> 02:48:02,280
Okay, good.

2273
02:48:02,280 --> 02:48:06,600
Don't pay attention to this one
because it's not functioning properly.

2274
02:48:06,600 --> 02:48:07,400
Okay.

2275
02:48:07,400 --> 02:48:11,240
Just do the steps and verify
the text in here.

2276
02:48:11,240 --> 02:48:16,560
Verify the buttons,
not the button, the text box, if you like.

2277
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:18,800
And let me post this

2278
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:22,520
of course, announcements

2279
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:35,040
I posted
and of course announcements, guys.

2280
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:36,720
Okay, one more thing.

2281
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,280
Okay, guys, I have a question.

2282
02:48:38,280 --> 02:48:41,280
What Is the topic that you're in with Java

2283
02:48:41,280 --> 02:48:49,000
guys.

2284
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:50,520
Okay. In the maps,

2285
02:48:51,560 --> 02:48:54,080
you know, what's the next topic, guys

2286
02:48:54,080 --> 02:48:57,920
Is it exception handling

2287
02:48:57,960 --> 02:48:58,800
or file hand?

2288
02:48:58,800 --> 02:49:01,440
Okay, okay.
Okay. File reading. Okay, good.

2289
02:49:01,920 --> 02:49:04,880
After that,
you're going to have exception handling.

2290
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:05,600
Okay.

2291
02:49:05,640 --> 02:49:08,000
So what I want you to do now, guys,

2292
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:10,120
what I want you to do.

2293
02:49:10,120 --> 02:49:13,440
So we have eight packages in here, right?

2294
02:49:13,800 --> 02:49:15,400
We have eight packages.

2295
02:49:15,400 --> 02:49:19,200
What I want you to do,
I want you create another package.

2296
02:49:19,680 --> 02:49:20,360
Okay?

2297
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:24,240
Create another package
and name it as utilities.

2298
02:49:24,600 --> 02:49:24,960
Okay?

2299
02:49:24,960 --> 02:49:27,720
Or you can name it as utils.

2300
02:49:27,720 --> 02:49:28,640
Okay,

2301
02:49:29,240 --> 02:49:33,120
So create that package name utils

2302
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:38,200
and what you need to do,
create a java class.

2303
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:42,040
So let me put it here, create a package

2304
02:49:43,120 --> 02:49:46,520
and name it as

2305
02:49:47,960 --> 02:49:49,840
utils. Okay.

2306
02:49:49,840 --> 02:49:50,960
Or utils.

2307
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:52,240
It doesn't really matter.

2308
02:49:52,240 --> 02:49:53,600
Created class.

2309
02:49:53,600 --> 02:49:55,520
Okay.

2310
02:49:55,520 --> 02:49:57,000
And name it

2311
02:49:58,640 --> 02:50:02,760
as common methods.

2312
02:50:03,240 --> 02:50:05,880
Okay guys. So what want you to do?

2313
02:50:06,440 --> 02:50:11,640
I want you to build two functions,
which is common function.

2314
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:15,760
When I call that function,
it opens my browser

2315
02:50:15,880 --> 02:50:19,680
and when I call the second
it will close my browser.

2316
02:50:19,960 --> 02:50:20,680
Is that clear?

2317
02:50:20,680 --> 02:50:26,120
Guys,

2318
02:50:26,120 --> 02:50:27,480
create

2319
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:33,440
functions.

2320
02:50:33,440 --> 02:50:34,320
I mean methods.

2321
02:50:34,320 --> 02:50:38,240
Write methods to open

2322
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:49,320
and close the browsers.

2323
02:50:49,320 --> 02:50:52,720
Okay, guys, is that clear?

2324
02:50:52,720 --> 02:50:55,760
So what I want you to do,
just create a method.

2325
02:50:55,960 --> 02:50:59,520
Okay, so Create two methods.

2326
02:51:00,040 --> 02:51:00,920
Which one?

2327
02:51:00,920 --> 02:51:04,320
The first one opens up the

2328
02:51:06,480 --> 02:51:07,320
what's called

2329
02:51:07,320 --> 02:51:10,080
the browser and navigates to the euro.

2330
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:13,920
Okay, so the URL I can

2331
02:51:14,120 --> 02:51:16,800
I need to pass
the URL inside the signature.

2332
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:18,480
Okay guys.

2333
02:51:18,480 --> 02:51:21,120
So I hope you guys already know
how to create methods,

2334
02:51:21,360 --> 02:51:24,920
how to do the parameters
and how to do the return types.

2335
02:51:25,280 --> 02:51:27,440
Right? There we go.

2336
02:51:27,440 --> 02:51:31,320
So open launching the browser
and navigating to the euro

2337
02:51:31,720 --> 02:51:35,400
closing
is going to be just quitting the browser.

2338
02:51:35,720 --> 02:51:39,920
Okay, So whenever I, I call those methods,

2339
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:44,840
I want those to open
and I want us to close the browsers.

2340
02:51:46,240 --> 02:51:46,680
Is that

2341
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:53,520
clear, guys?

2342
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:56,160
Andre Yes, that's what I want exactly.

2343
02:51:56,680 --> 02:51:59,040
Or you can come up with different idea.

2344
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:06,320
That's fine with me.

2345
02:52:06,320 --> 02:52:10,160
Okay, so let's see how good you are in job
analysis.

2346
02:52:10,200 --> 02:52:14,920
Okay, so this is basic, basic
things that you going to be actually

2347
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:19,800
creating methods inside your framework,
okay.

2348
02:52:20,040 --> 02:52:23,880
Because you're going to have as a separate

2349
02:52:23,880 --> 02:52:27,000
class, which has all the common methods

2350
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:31,920
to click to send keys
to choose anything from the dropdown,

2351
02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:35,880
to choose any checkbox
or any radial button.

2352
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:36,960
Okay, guys.

2353
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:39,840
So you will have a lot of different common
methods.

2354
02:52:40,160 --> 02:52:40,600
Okay.

2355
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:45,000
So I want you to start with these two
methods inside your Common methods class.

2356
02:52:46,280 --> 02:53:01,760
Okay.

2357
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:03,880
All right. Any questions, guys?

2358
02:53:03,880 --> 02:53:20,880
Is there anyone who is confused
about the second homework?

2359
02:53:20,880 --> 02:53:22,600
I hope not. I think

2360
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:28,120
you're confused. Why?

2361
02:53:28,120 --> 02:53:29,760
You just need to.

2362
02:53:30,720 --> 02:53:32,920
You just need to build two methods.

2363
02:53:32,920 --> 02:53:33,480
Right?

2364
02:53:33,480 --> 02:54:10,600
So what are you confused about?

2365
02:54:10,600 --> 02:54:14,840
Okay, so if you're a little bit confused
with how to build those,

2366
02:54:14,840 --> 02:54:18,320
please communicate with the teammates

2367
02:54:19,080 --> 02:54:21,240
and come up with some solutions on that.

2368
02:54:21,960 --> 02:54:25,680
Okay, guys.

2369
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:26,280
All right.

2370
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:29,400
Any other questions

2371
02:54:35,400 --> 02:54:36,960
is no questions.

2372
02:54:36,960 --> 02:54:39,600
Then we can wrap it up for today.

2373
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:42,960

2374
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:44,160
so let me check.

2375
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:46,400
What do we have for the next class?

2376
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:54,560
Not really sure what we have.

2377
02:54:54,560 --> 02:54:59,720
Let me check guys in quick.

2378
