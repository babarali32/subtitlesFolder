1
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,640
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,160
Can you guys hear me?

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,440
So, everyone there?

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,960
You guys did pretty good.

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,080
Can you guys hear me?

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,040
Hey, guys.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,040
How's it going?

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,600
How's everyone doing?

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,160
How was your day?

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
What did you do today?

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,040
What was the highlight of your day?

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,600
It's the

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,840
lawyers.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,040
Gerald.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,760
How's it going?

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,040
Works a lot

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,440
or not.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,520
How did your testing all remain right?

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,800
Tendra.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,880
Angelica.

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,480
The bill.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
How are you guys?

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,600
The minor

24
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Abdoul.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,440
Mariam.

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,160
Amelia.

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,600
Millie. Did you change your name?

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,000
Wasn't it Emily Jo or something like that?

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,080
Lobo.

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,400
What's up?

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,080
BlueBell?

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,560
Oh, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,400
Is that my father's way
you change your name to Don't.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,840
Terrible.

35
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,280
It's just terrible.

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,720
Terrible, terrible.

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,320
All right, let's.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,280
All right.

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:04,920
Are you guys ready or are you guys ready?

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,440
It's ready for you.

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,480
That's ready.

42
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,000
All right, guys, let's get started.

43
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,960
Today's a very good day.

44
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,720
You guys know why?

45
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,640
Today is a very good day.

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,840
There's no way to beat that.

47
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Well, yes, that's true.

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,840
But today's a good day,
because today is our last class together.

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
How cool is that?

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,240
That's cool, right?

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,280
That is a very, very good day.

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,640
No, I mean in a good way, right?

53
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,440
Because if you think about it,
I think my first class with you guys,

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,680
I told you that, like, time flies, right?

55
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,760
Right. I told you that.

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,440
I said the next few weeks,
we're going to be together.

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,760
And now it's time for me to say time
did fly by,

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,080
and it's going to continue to fly by.

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,560
Right.

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,360
So that's how fast time flies

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,560
throughout, you know, throughout syntax.

62
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
You know.

63
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,960
Now, before we start the class,
I want to say

64
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,680
a lot of you guys,
every single one of you guys

65
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,400
that has done
a very good job in this class.

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,640
Every single one of you has done
a very good job.

67
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,800
There are students out there
who where English is not

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,320
their it's not their first language.

69
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,400
And you guys, English is not your first
language.

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:34,760
Right.

71
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,480
I'm not going to say names,
but you guys did a fantastic job.

72
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,520
I can tell even when you guys were writing

73
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,280
the cucumbers scenarios,
you guys really understood the concepts.

74
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,360
Okay.

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,440
So and that was that was very good.

76
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,320
That was that was really, really good.

77
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,560
And this is not an English class, right?

78
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,520
I wasn't criticizing
the way you write English.

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,560
I was looking for other things. Right.

80
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,760
If you understood the
concepts, if you understood

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,840
how to kind of

82
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,120
write a cucumber scenario,
that that was, you know, decent.

83
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,160
That's right.

84
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,880
That was my my main goal. Right.

85
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,040
And a lot of you guys have done a very,
very good job.

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,920
So I congratulate you
for being very good on that part.

87
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,960
For those of you
who are taking this class,

88
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,640
an English is not your first language.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,160
And for the rest of

90
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
you guys that were English
is your first language.

91
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,560
You guys also did a very good job right?

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,640
You were able to understand the concepts
and that kind of thing.

93
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,320
So everyone here has done a very good job.

94
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,280
And some of you guys are have

95
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,200
on the assignments and late,
which is completely fine.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,040
You guys reached out to me and you guys
said, Hey, I wasn't here for this class.

97
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,240
I still turn on the assignment and stuff.

98
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
But the fact that you took time
to build it to do it,

99
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,040
to did it,
the fact that you took the time to do it

100
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,040
shows that you care, right?

101
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,880
Shows
that you're willing to put that effort.

102
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,440
I had some students that missed out
because maybe they were sick or maybe,

103
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,120
you know, life happens, right?

104
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,480
Some of you guys have jobs.

105
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,440
Some of you guys have families
You guys need to do to attend to.

106
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,120
Right.

107
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,000
So you guys some of you guys

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,880
still wanted reached out
and stole some of the assignments.

109
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,560
Right.

110
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,840
And so I congratulate you for
for doing that for yourself.

111
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,960
So today's class is going to be
a little different.

112
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,000
Today's class is actually going
to be very proactive.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,840
It's going to be
just a little bit of review here

114
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,160
and there, but we're going to just heavily
work on JIRA.

115
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,800
Yesterday was kind of rushed.

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,240
You know, I tried to respond to everybody.

117
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,280
Some students missed out on some things
because maybe

118
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,080
I went too fast or maybe I didn't explain
something too well.

119
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,640
So today will basically be
just like yesterday's class.

120
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,560
And we're going to all be proactive.

121
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,680
We're going to help each other out.

122
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,760
We're going to communicate with each other
and that kind of and that kind of thing.

123
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,360
Okay.

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,240
Does that sound like a
like a deal to everyone

125
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,520
and sound like a deal to everyone?

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,440
Okay.

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,280
All right.

128
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,960
So that's what we're going to to do.

129
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,520
And I also want to say
and that's a good question, Fatma.

130
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,720
I also want to say that
everything that we learned, right,

131
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,160
while it may have been the first time
you've heard these words, it may have been

132
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,400
the first time you touched something
like JIRA right throughout the class.

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
Some things are going to start,
make more sense.

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,040
And at the end of the class,
we are going to review all of this again.

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:45,960
Okay.

136
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,280
So you're going to hear all of this again.

137
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,080
Okay. Does that make sense for one?

138
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,080
Most likely.

139
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,880
Maybe I can do the interview
review sessions with these, but

140
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,480
with these classes or any anything,
any other topic

141
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,440
if you want to go home.

142
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,120
All right.

143
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,240
So let's get let's get started.

144
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,720
I have some questions for you first.

145
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,120
Is there a way
you can make your volume higher?

146
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,120
I have no idea. I'm speaking very loud.

147
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,800
I think you have to put the volume
higher on your end.

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,440
Can everyone hear me?

149
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,280
That.

150
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,080
Does it sound low, guys? Does
it sound low?

151
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,440
I don't know.

152
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Like this microphone?

153
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,440
Maybe it's crystal clear. Does it?

154
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,640
Is it good?

155
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,960
Okay.

156
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,400
Mohamed says a bit low.

157
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,480
Okay, So.

158
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,320
Okay.

159
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:50,760
Got it.

160
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,160
Got it, Got it.

161
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
You are cause for us to beat bags of money
after fight.

162
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,240
You are a cause.

163
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,320
I am a cause.

164
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
It's fine.

165
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,880
It's school, all right?

166
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,360
So I'm a cause.

167
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm a cause.

168
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Like, cause and effect.

169
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,560
Okay. All right.

170
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,560
So are we ready, guys? Are we ready?

171
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,800
Are ready or are we ready?

172
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,080
And again, I want to say what was
the number one thing we learned yesterday

174
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
about asking questions?

175
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,840
Right.

176
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,880
And I'll repeat what I said yesterday.

177
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,000
Again, just in short, basically,

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,360
if you have questions, right,
ask the questions.

179
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,280
Okay. Don't be shy. Don't be scared.

180
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,840
Don't be afraid.

181
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,360
There is no such thing
as a stupid question in my book.

182
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,160
You can no such thing.

183
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,200
Okay.

184
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,640
Does that make sense to everyone?

185
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,720
No such thing as a stupid question, right?

186
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,840
No such thing.

187
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,240
So why are you scared of me?

188
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,760
Guys, I'm possibly the nicest person
you'll probably ever meet here at Gitex.

189
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,720
Yeah.

190
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:14,360
So. All

191
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,760
right, so there is a

192
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,760
someone saying. Yeah, right.

193
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,080
Okay, now

194
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,640
you make us believe that there are no

195
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,240
there are no dumb questions, right?

196
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm also not a drill sergeant.

197
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Look, I just wanted to make it clear
yesterday to everyone,

198
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,040
right, that basically
if you have questions, ask the questions.

199
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,960
Okay.

200
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,240
Because, like,
I want you guys to be successful.

201
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,560
But there's a difference, right?

202
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,280
When I'm telling
you guys not to do something.

203
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,040
And then you guys go and do it
and you guys mess up

204
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,120
the whole JIRA board and stuff, Right?

205
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,880
And that's why I'll call you.

206
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,800
I'll call
you kids or something like that. Right.

207
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,520
But am I wrong or am I?

208
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,160
Am I not? What?

209
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,360
So, like, you put yourself
in the same situation, right?

210
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,680
You want to you want to carry
on a whole class yourself.

211
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,360
You want everyone to pay attention to you.

212
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,760
Most of the class is listening.

213
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,680
But then some students are just,
you know, in their own world.

214
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,200
Right? And you can't really
stop, right? You just got to

215
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,280
say you're willing.

216
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,720
Everyone else's module, that's it.

217
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,600
But I just like to keep it 100 with you.

218
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,160
Right.

219
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,320
So that's fine.

220
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,760
All right, so let's get started.

221
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
So let's talk a few things first. And.

222
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,440
And Yes, and it's. Excuse me. Pardon me.

223
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,600
It is my fault.

224
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,760
I did not share my notes

225
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,560
from the last two classes.

226
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,120
Okay, So I still have to share that
with you guys, but

227
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,000
I will still share that with you.

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,920
And, you know, keep them, review them.

229
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,360
We'll touch the materials again.

230
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,720
We're going to revisit that stuff again.
Okay.

231
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,840
This is not just a
you learn it in three weeks and that's it.

232
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,160
You never hear about it again.

233
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,080
We're going to revisit it again.

234
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,160
Yes. The point you're going
to get all the slides, everything good

235
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,640
1 to 2 and I'll make sure to
to message right now.

236
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,560
But it. Okay.

237
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,480
Yeah.

238
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,000
I think sometimes we
click the wrong button like today I did.

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,240
And that's okay. Right.

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,720
Let's just try to follow instructions.

241
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,040
Right. If you get lost. Right.

242
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,720
If you're not sure
if we should click something, then ask.

243
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,560
Right?

244
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
Ask and should we?

245
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,560
Good to go

246
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,960
or good?

247
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Are we good? Right.

248
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,400
So I didn't play with Jared yesterday more
than we're supposed to, but it was it.

249
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,720
That's fine.

250
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,640
It's cool when you start your job
and you accidentally start

251
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,360
touching things,
let me know how that goes.

252
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,960
Okay, so.

253
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,840
But you know that
that's the whole point, right?

254
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
So if you have questions, ask
and that's fine.

255
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,200
Cool question.

256
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,640
The gamer players are going to be know
class will end before ten today

257
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,080
or 10 p.m. Eastern time,

258
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,920
10 p.m.

259
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,000
Eastern time.

260
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,800
So, again, a lot of you guys are saying,
you know,

261
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,480
you accept, you accidentally click
a button or something like that, right?

262
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,040
It goes, We all make mistakes.

263
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,960
That's fine.

264
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,120
We all make mistakes.

265
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,800
But at work, are you going to accidentally
click a button

266
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,160
or are you going to click a button
without knowing what it does right.

267
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,560
All right.

268
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,040
So and here's the thing, right?

269
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,000
We had another user story
here, right? In progress.

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,920
We had the one that I gave you
the task for homework and so moved it

271
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,600
for some reason.

272
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,960
That's beside the fact and I have to go
and look for it.

273
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,360
The homework assignment
was what this segment to work on.

274
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,800
What user story was, the homework on

275
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,320
what?

276
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
No, I changed it.

277
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
Was it one

278
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,080
had an employee, right.

279
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,120
An employee

280
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,360
and an

281
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
employee.

282
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,240
Okay.

283
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,240
See something

284
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
was amiss.

285
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,880
B 11 Right.

286
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,960
It must be 11 one.

287
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,480
But look, someone moved it back.

288
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,480
But perhaps, maybe the person
that moved it by accident.

289
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,160
Right. To the to do column.

290
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,720
Thank you very much for moving it back.

291
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,560
I see that it was also changed
from a story to a test.

292
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,320
So that's

293
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,960
cool. So.

294
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
All right, guys, let's get started.

295
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,320
Okay. I want to review some of these.

296
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Someone changed the description
I sent, and we're tasked with directing

297
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,920
someone.

298
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
Change the description.

299
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,960
I said task.

300
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,720
Okay, so before we get into this
JIRA thing, I got, let's let's talk about

301
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,440
a few things. What is zero?

302
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,200
What is JIRA?

303
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,680
JIRA is a project management tool, right?

304
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,800
And is JIRA the only project management
tool that exists

305
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,080
now? Right.

306
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,800
There are other ones, other ones that
that you may end up working with, right?

307
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,640
There's HPL, there's different tools.

308
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,240
Rally is your DevOps.

309
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,920
There's there's so much, there's

310
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,880
so many other tools
that you'll probably work with it.

311
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
It all depends on the project.

312
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Okay, but JIRA is the most popular one,

313
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,720
which is why we are showing you
how to work with Xero.

314
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,040
That now everything in JIRA, every ticket
that is created

315
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,960
in JIRA is known as what

316
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,200
as an issue, right?

317
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,120
So issues are also known as tickets.

318
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,640
Right?

319
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,840
And so far we've worked
with stories, right,

320
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,600
with user stories and we know what tasks.

321
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,440
All right.

322
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,240
So this is how a user story looks like
and this is how it test

323
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,120
looks like right here. Okay, Well,

324
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,920
okay, great.

325
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,480
Let's see, what else about JIRA?

326
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,720
Yesterday we had a ceremony.

327
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,280
What ceremony did we do together
yesterday?

328
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,840
What ceremony did we do?

329
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,360
What ceremony that we do?

330
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,280
Sprint, sprint planning.

331
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,480
There you go.

332
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,320
Sprint planning.

333
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,200
And if you remember yesterday's
class in the sprint planning meeting,

334
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,200
what did we end up
what happened in that meeting?

335
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,360
Like?

336
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:06,840
What happened at the sprint
planning meeting?

337
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,080
We assigned level of efforts, right?

338
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,160
We gave estimates. Okay.

339
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,800
And but what hours?

340
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,680
Like hours for what?

341
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,640
I was Hours for what?

342
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,920
The development hours and testing.

343
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,080
There you go.

344
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,280
That's what we did yesterday on
and just like that, what else

345
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,480
can you tell me about that sprint
planning meeting we were working with?

346
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,320
What artifacts?

347
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,480
Like we were here right?

348
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,200
And what were we working with?

349
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,680
You guys remember

350
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,200
the backlog. Right.

351
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,200
And once we gave the item a estimate,

352
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,200
what did we do?

353
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,840
We moved it right.
We moved it to the sprint, right?

354
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,600
We moved it to Sprint.

355
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,280
Call.

356
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,480
So we moved it to the sprint.

357
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,360
So segment

358
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,320
that sorry,

359
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,080
I see that some folks created
Sprint yesterday.

360
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:27,000
Clean this up
just so that we don't get confused. Oh,

361
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,920
and once you delete the sprint
all of its contents

362
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,160
so we have

363
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,440
Joseph we have Irina NASIR.

364
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,720
Not that me now,
but I'm Ron to all of these tickets.

365
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
Okay.
I'm going to move them to the backlog.

366
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,120
You linked it to the wrong sprint.

367
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,000
Okay, so let me ask you this.

368
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Right?

369
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,160
When we don't link things properly,
what happens to them sometimes,

370
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,320
like what
Essentially what ends up happening?

371
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,560
Well,

372
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,840
they get lost, right?

373
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,320
It's kind of hard to look for them now.

374
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,920
They exist, right?

375
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,280
We just have to go and look for them.

376
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,320
So I'm doing this.

377
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,640
I'm moving
the service of that to the backlog.

378
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,240
I'm going to move this one
that doesn't have a name.

379
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,240
I'm going to move this one over
and then I'm going to meet

380
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,680
Sprint to.

381
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,160
All right.

382
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,640
Now at at work.

383
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,120
Okay. I'm at work

384
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,960
every not everybody has
the same rights to grow.

385
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,480
Okay.

386
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,240
Obviously, they will protect
they will control who can do what.

387
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,880
We can do certain things. Okay.

388
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,920
So here we have this t sprint
one created by.

389
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,240
No, no, I'm going to move your ticket

390
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,760
back to the backlog
because you get to the wrong sprint.

391
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,080
Okay.

392
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,400
So I'm going to go all

393
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,280
the way to the backlog.

394
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,320
All of this backlog

395
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,840
C scroll and there you go.

396
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,400
And I'm going to delete the sprint,
please.

397
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,080
No one else creates sprints
because I just made this

398
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,440
right.

399
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,560
So cool.

400
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,400
All right, so we're here.

401
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,040
All right. Let's see.

402
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,560
Do we have training your page

403
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,000
so we don't mess with real syntax page?

404
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,280
This is the training page to get.

405
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,560
This is the the training page.

406
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,440
You get cool.

407
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,320
So you just got to kind of follow
through with it.

408
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
We can think of something.

409
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,000
I can talk to them if you want to.

410
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,640
You know, We'll see.

411
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,000
All right.

412
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,240
So what else did we learn about JIRA?

413
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,760
We learn how to create a task.

414
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,400
We learn the linking, right.

415
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,240
When we're linking a ticket
to another ticket

416
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,440
or an issue to another issue,
what are we doing there

417
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,440
when we're linking?

418
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,720
Like, what are we doing?

419
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,160
What what what is that called?

420
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,960
Like when when we are linking
any issue to another issue, Right.

421
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,000
What are we doing there.

422
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
No, not, not copy name like we are.

423
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,000
What are we doing?

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,960
We're not assigning.

425
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,120
So when we are linking a ticket
to another ticket, any ticket,

426
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,760
any any of them, what are we doing
there with these tickets?

427
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,160
No, no, we're not us.

428
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,800
I'm not talking
about user starship testing.

429
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,920
I'm talking about any issue.
It can be any issue.

430
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,040
We're not comparing them
when we are linking

431
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,120
a ticket to another ticket,

432
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,560
guys,
when we are linking to tickets together.

433
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,000
What is that?

434
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,760
What are we doing there?

435
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,360
It means that we are establishing
a relationship with

436
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
with those issues, Right?

437
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,480
They somehow relate to each other right.

438
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,000
And somewhere. Right, guys,
we talk about that.

439
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,280
You guys remember, right.

440
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,000
For example, yesterday
we had the user stories.

441
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,680
Okay?

442
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,240
And the reason that we were linking

443
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,120
our tasks to the user stories is
so that when I come here to the user story

444
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,000
right, and I open it right,
if I open this, I can see

445
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,160
the links here.

446
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
I can see the links to to this one.

447
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,400
Okay.

448
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,880
I can see if we'll link that and it shows
like you see, I can see tested by right

449
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,360
and I can see all the tasks
that were created and they're linked here.

450
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,440
Okay.

451
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,440
So we are establishing this relationship,
all the tasks that you guys created

452
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,640
and if you linked it properly,
they would be linked here, right?

453
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,640
So I'm saying, you see
and this is what would tell you this h.r.

454
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,880
Must be to admin user log in
which was we worked on yesterday.

455
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
If i open this ticket in a new tab.

456
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,880
Okay.

457
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,600
And i opened the ticket
and if i go down to issue links.

458
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,040
Right, it says show 87 more links.

459
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,320
And this is this issue is tested by
and it's all of these right.

460
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,640
So that makes sense.

461
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,160
But there are some folks here

462
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,960
that when they did it,
they selected the option blocked by.

463
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,640
Okay.

464
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,520
Do you guys remember when I told you
what to select when you're linking?

465
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:17,880
Right.

466
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,000
I said to make sure that it says tests.

467
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,360
Right.

468
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,440
Because now those folks that select block
buy it doesn't make sense.

469
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:26,840
Right?

470
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Like this issue is blocked by these tests.

471
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,920
It doesn't make sense.

472
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,440
You guys see this now
and some folks that I see that

473
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,720
had not created multiple tickets
for some reason,

474
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,960
I'm not sure why,
but we can see that you linked it

475
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,280
and it's not properly linked
because it's blocked by at work.

476
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,880
This would be a big deal
because this user story is not blocked.

477
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,440
Right.

478
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,200
We don't when we're saying is blocked by
this is a big issue.

479
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,760
This issue can

480
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,000
this user story
can probably be blocked by a bug.

481
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,680
But nothing else.

482
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,600
Okay.

483
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,320
This doesn't really make sense.

484
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,600
So we need to fix this. Okay.

485
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,760
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to

486
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,560
Lenny also linked it
and this is blocked by this is why

487
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,360
whenever we do our linking, we need to pay
very close attention to that.

488
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,080
So I'm going to exit this.

489
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,080
I want to delete these links here
because they don't make sense.

490
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,560
Right.

491
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,120
And I want to see something else here.

492
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,600
So, okay, now it looks good, right?

493
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,560
So now when we open this issue. Right.

494
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,960
And let me first page it from as we to
I open the story,

495
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,840
I see the acceptance,
what can we call this interconnect?

496
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,680
You can call it anything you want,
as long as you understand

497
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,200
that there is a relationship
that you're establishing

498
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,320
within these tickets that you can get in
JIRA, we link it, right?

499
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,400
So we call it linking.

500
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,600
And here

501
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,320
now we see all
the issues that you guys created, right?

502
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,080
So it looks like a lot of
you guys did a very good job,

503
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,920
except someone who created this ad,
an employee is linked to this.

504
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,600
I have to figure out who linked this here.

505
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,080
It shouldn't be here.

506
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,240
So I'm actually going to delete this link.

507
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,240
Right.

508
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,120
And I'm going to refresh the page.

509
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,160
Okay. Amnesty. That's right.

510
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,840
So all of you guys, look, look, this
this looks so neat.

511
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,400
A lot of you guys followed instructions.

512
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,920
We have the name.

513
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,360
We have your
we have the Kua, we have the server.

514
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,200
He didn't add the hyphen here, but
you guys see how readable this is, right?

515
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,240
I can go here, I can see the tickets.

516
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,640
I can see that
this ticket was created by Ahmed. Right?

517
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,440
I can see that this is not does.

518
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,400
I can see that this is Luis Cabrera's.

519
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,280
I could see this is Jimi's
I can see saw bonds, right so forth.

520
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,800
This is admin user log in.

521
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,040
So this is all. Yes, yes.

522
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,920
We're talking about yesterday's work.

523
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,640
Yeah, we're talking about yesterday's
work.

524
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,800
Does that makes sense?

525
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,560
Mean We're talking about yesterday's
work, right?

526
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,520
So this is all the work that we did
yesterday.

527
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,560
It looks like this year

528
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,880
follow the naming convention,
but he created a story instead.

529
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,520
So you need to change it to a task.

530
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,280
I'm going to remove it from here
because when you created it's not a story.

531
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,200
Okay. So

532
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,960
and just to do it for you,
this here, I'll open this a new tab

533
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,920
and you'll come here

534
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,600
and you can easily go here
where it's a story and you can change.

535
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,760
It goes to task, right?

536
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,520
And that's it, man. Problem solved. Right.

537
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,120
There you go.

538
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,680
And then we refresh it. Right.

539
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,840
It will be changed to a task right now.

540
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,560
Really change it for this year,
which wasn't this year

541
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,840
with students, humans, humans here

542
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,400
were is this year.

543
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,800
This year right here we change it.

544
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,240
See, it's a test done.

545
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,480
Well, okay, so I change it, right?

546
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,560
So we need to be careful
with what we create at work.

547
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:08,360
So, for example, if you're creating a bug,
but you create a user story by mistake,

548
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,440
obviously you can fix it, but

549
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,160
you don't want to do that right
first time is okay, second time is okay.

550
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,840
But when you keep making the same mistakes
again and again and again,

551
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,280
they're going to start to think

552
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,760
that you're not paying attention
to the work that you are doing right?

553
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,040
Sharif
didn't follow the naming convention.

554
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,080
Okay.

555
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,480
So Sharif so Sharp didn't
follow the naming convention.

556
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,000
He just put his name there.

557
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,760
This is 41.

558
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,760
So if I open it, the scenarios gods,
it links it, right?

559
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,360
But for some reason,
he said, blocks this one.

560
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,400
I don't know why, but he didn't.

561
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,360
You didn't fix the naming convention,
so that needs to be fixed.

562
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,840
Okay. Okay.

563
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,640
And is to be fixed.
But look, everyone else very good.

564
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,880
We're here with in the Sierra.

565
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,800
It looks like this
here created another ticket.

566
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,600
For some reason and that's fine.

567
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,640
So, guys,

568
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,200
when you create a task or an issue

569
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,280
or a ticket in JIRA,
you don't have to create another one.

570
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,640
You can just added the same one. Okay?

571
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,120
You just have to be careful
with how you're creating it,

572
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,560
where you're linking it to
and that kind of thing.

573
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,640
Okay.

574
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,400
Oh, Danny, Alexis,

575
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,560
someone said just testing

576
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,000
whatever it was, and

577
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,200
I can see who created this

578
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,640
mark to life or to life.

579
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,880
Just testing who's smart to life

580
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,840
is underwater.

581
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,600
Life is right to life.

582
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,240
27 That you MLB.com. Right.

583
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,360
So yeah, that wasn't that wasn't
part of the test yesterday, right?

584
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,720
So we're supposed to do that.

585
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,320
Okay, so this makes sense, right?

586
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,680
Look, we're saying this user story,
right, is tested

587
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,560
by all of these, and it shows like this
because you guys linked it well, right?

588
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,400
You guys linked it very good.

589
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,600
This here needs to change Chances
68. Right.

590
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,600
But then some of you guys selected tests
and you see now it doesn't make sense

591
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,480
because that user story does not test
these tests is the other way around

592
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,520
these tasks test this user story.

593
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,240
Does that make sense?

594
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:28,840
Right.

595
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,080
Does that make sense, guys?

596
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,160
So that's the kind of tricky part
with zero, we need to know

597
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:40,240
we need to be careful with what wording
we choose, right and so forth.

598
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,160
Sports makes sense.

599
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,880
So Christine Amar, just testing

600
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,800
again, Kazeem

601
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,560
mean, you need to change the way
that you have linked this.

602
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,640
Well, all right.

603
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,680
So that was just released to us.

604
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,440
And a lot of things happened, though.

605
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,160
A lot of things happened yesterday.

606
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,360
A lot of people went in there.

607
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,600
It changed a lot of things.

608
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,440
And I don't know why.

609
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
William as see 0901

610
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,480
gmail.com assign this to himself, right?

611
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,560
So you're already doing things
that you were supposed to do.

612
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,400
Okay. Does that make sense?

613
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,360
So who was that and what?

614
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,880
All right,
so we're here back in the board game.

615
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,120
And your task,
your homework task was to do

616
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,480
HMS B one, Right?

617
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,720
So I'm going to open it.

618
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,960
I'm going to look at it again.

619
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,240
And this is B one.

620
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,440
It looks like someone changed this, right?

621
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,800
What what was it before?

622
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,680
Yeah, this is what was there.

623
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,800
This is what was there.
But someone changed it.

624
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,360
And I know I want to call it.

625
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,880
What else are they?

626
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,040
And this is
what was the acceptance criteria.

627
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:15,680
And I can tell that a lot of you guys
did a very good job at linking.

628
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,480
You created the task.

629
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,160
I haven't read the scenario yet. Okay.

630
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,760
If the old and if the old

631
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,720
acceptance criteria doesn't make sense,
does that mean that you have to change it?

632
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
No, you don't change the acceptance
criteria.

633
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,120
You don't change the acceptance criteria.

634
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,640
Or who changes the acceptance criteria
out of project?

635
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,840
Who changes the system
script to the VA right.

636
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,800
The IT.

637
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,400
Okay.

638
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,920
So for those of you who read this
and said, Oh, this acceptance criteria

639
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,320
doesn't make sense, you are right,
It doesn't make sense.

640
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,400
And we purposely did that to make sure
that you were actually

641
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,800
that you would actually be able
to point that out.

642
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,800
Right.

643
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,160
So acceptance criteria, that's it.

644
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,440
And it kind of looks like a

645
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,560
and this was different, right?

646
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,040
Because it kind of
looks like a cucumber scenario, right?

647
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,760
Kind of looks like it.

648
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,080
Well, the thing is that in some projects,
like in my project, my B.A.

649
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,360
actually writes the acceptance criteria

650
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,120
in Cucumber scenario style.

651
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,760
Okay.

652
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,760
You write it in cucumber scenario style.

653
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,920
Okay.

654
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,280
So sometimes I don't even have to write
a different scenario.

655
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,960
I can just use that one that you wrote.

656
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,160
Does that make sense?

657
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,480
So you're saying, Yeah, just copy paste.

658
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,200
That's it.

659
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,080
If the acceptance granted
does not make sense,

660
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,800
should we point that out somewhere
in the queue?

661
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,120
It does, yes.

662
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,960
Yes, you can.

663
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,600
That's very good.

664
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,280
Alan, you commented on the test.

665
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,760
Okay.

666
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,600
So anyway,
does that make sense to everyone?

667
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,720
So this one says

668
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,480
when user failed, first name, middle name,
last name, employee I.D.

669
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,000
and user and a user by the say

670
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,840
a lot of things that are off here, right?

671
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,560
Doesn't make sense. Right.

672
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,600
So we can change this right?

673
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,080
When a user fails and a user enters,
you say

674
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,920
and a user enters

675
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,480
a first name, middle name,

676
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,400
last name and employee I.D., Right.

677
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,320
And the employee the and clicks

678
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,840
save button, right?

679
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,520
Yeah, clicks, save button.

680
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,840
Okay.

681
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,040
Then the user.

682
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,640
Then the user has a different first
and last name

683
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,480
and the user doesn't have a middle name.

684
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,800
So this one looks like
this is talking about.

685
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,000
So this right here, it doesn't make sense.

686
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,400
Right?

687
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,120
There's a lot of things that are off
that don't make sense or like what?

688
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,480
This doesn't make sense.

689
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,400
So what do you do in this case?

690
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,800
You get this for work.

691
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,160
You don't you don't understand.

692
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,520
What do you get it right?

693
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,280
You ask A, B, A, okay.

694
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,200
But there are times

695
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,360
where you the bay, let's say
the bay is busy

696
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,680
and the bay can't respond to your email
right now.

697
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,080
They can respond to your to your chat,
your to your message.

698
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,000
Right.

699
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,200
You are still required to create a test.

700
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,880
You still have to create a task on it.

701
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,880
So it can be on the JIRA board. Right?

702
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,760
There are two things that you can do.

703
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,040
Okay.

704
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,400
I'm going to tell you this right
now. Right.

705
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,680
So what you do is this, yes, you can ask
for documentation, but we're assuming

706
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,160
that the bay is busy, that you can get
the documentation for some reason.

707
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,360
Okay.

708
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,560
So listen,
there are a few things you can do.

709
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,840
Are you guys ready?

710
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,760
There are few things you can do.

711
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,520
This acceptance
granted doesn't make sense to me at all.

712
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,640
So we're going I'm
going to tell you what I'm going to do.

713
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,680
Come.

714
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,320
First thing you can do
is this is a ticket.

715
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,240
No one can

716
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,480
know.

717
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,920
You don't you
don't bring things to the product backlog.

718
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,600
That is not your responsibility.

719
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,280
Right? The VA does that.

720
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,800
You guys are never to move
anything to the backlog.

721
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,200
And you guys don't.

722
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,840
You guys don't manage the board like that?

723
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,360
No, Q8 does.
No developer does either. Okay.

724
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,880
This is just like what the VA does.

725
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,920
They manage this stuff.

726
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,560
Sometimes the project manager can try to,
you know, be in there and stuff like that

727
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,680
and they can move things. That's fine.

728
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,280
But if the VA can't respond to me,
I sent a message.

729
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,440
I'm getting no response.

730
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,480
I have to show some progress, right?

731
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,080
I need to document
what I'm experiencing at the moment.

732
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,440
So there are a few things you can do

733
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,320
or a couple of things
actually that I would do.

734
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,160
This is a ticket.

735
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,120
So what I would do is

736
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,560
I would go to the ticket and scroll
down to the comments section.

737
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,080
Okay.

738
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,760
And I'm going to add a comment.

739
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,880
Okay. And I'm going to say,

740
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,560
need more

741
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,240
clarification on acceptance

742
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,520
criteria. Right.

743
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,480
And you can say I

744
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,560
reached out to

745
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,600
and I'm going to tag whoever
and you can type people here.

746
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,440
You see this,
someone say reached out to a cell.

747
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,680
Okay.

748
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,960
On on ten yesterday was 19, right?

749
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,480
October 19

750
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,600
time, 1920 21.

751
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,120
Right.

752
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,240
And there you go.

753
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,200
And now what a and then bam.

754
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,560
There you go. I documented that. Right.

755
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,320
Does that make sense, guys?

756
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,600
Does that make sense?

757
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,400
And you can mention things
like this. Yes, absolutely.

758
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,640
But even though you can say it,
you still need to document it.

759
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,600
Right?

760
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,360
You still need to documented
because remember

761
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:39,240
when we talked about word of mouth
being so valuable, Right.

762
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,120
What are you going to trust?
What are you going to trust?

763
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,600
More documentation or word of mouth?

764
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,440
Which one are you going to?

765
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,880
Which one are going to trust?

766
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,840
Documentation. Right.

767
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,640
So at the same time, to protect myself
and to show progress.

768
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,480
Right. I didn't understand it.

769
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,920
I need clarification because
without clarification, I can't test this.

770
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,480
Right.

771
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,440
So I am going to come here, comment on it.

772
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,400
Right.

773
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,760
Because this is what I did call
and then tomorrow's standard meeting,

774
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,480
I'll be like,
yeah, for a time as B 11 one.

775
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:19,120
I just, I reached out to ASL
because I need more clarification on this.

776
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,400
So would you happen to have some time
today to discuss this acceptance criteria

777
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,960
with me, or would anyone have had to have
some time to discuss it with me?

778
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,040
Please?

779
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,960
And I also commented
that on the ticket. Right.

780
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,680
And that would be your daily stand up,

781
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,560
your daily stand up status code.

782
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,080
Does that make sense?

783
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,240
Are we going to have access to this class
practice more?

784
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,400
Yeah, well.

785
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,840
Well, be always on state of meaning.

786
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,480
What does that mean?

787
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,520
Be always on stand up.

788
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,440
I'll be okay.

789
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,040
Yes. Everyone is in the stand up meeting
everybody.

790
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,600
Right.

791
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,960
Are the business hours,
the A's, the developers,

792
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,560
the test, the the.

793
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,440
I'll tell you,
my project was on the calls.

794
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,840
The clients are on the call.

795
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,160
The business hours on the call,
the federals on the call,

796
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,920
the developers on the call.

797
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,560
The rest of the team is on the call.

798
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,240
So everyone's on the call.

799
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,440
Yeah, I changed the AC.

800
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,320
Was there. Okay.

801
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,240
No, it wasn't okay.

802
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,360
You're not allowed
to change the acceptance criteria,

803
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,680
but as testers, as a Q

804
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,280
way, am I allowed to change the acceptance
criteria?

805
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Am I allowed to know

806
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,120
who is allowed to do that?

807
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,640
No, not even a little bit.

808
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,320
We can't change it.

809
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,080
Right? The VA right

810
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,960
now, if this acceptance criteria
needs to be changed

811
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,640
and you talk to the VA and the VA
says something like, Oh yeah, I wasn't

812
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,040
so clear on the acceptance credits yet,
but this is what you have to do, right?

813
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,920
You can tell the VA, okay, can you please
update the ticket to reflect that?

814
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,920
Right.

815
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,920
Well,

816
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,880
does that make sense?

817
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,800
It is only it only VA.

818
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,840
It could be the business analyst
or the project manager.

819
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,120
One of those two.

820
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,520
Okay,
but not the developers, not the testers

821
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,440
unless they're specifically
asked to do so. You got

822
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,840
not the

823
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,320
lead, but usually doesn't change
acceptance criteria or nothing like that.

824
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:37,360
Oh, the product owner.

825
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,680
Okay.

826
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,800
Do you guys know who the product owner is?

827
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,360
An agile environment.

828
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,480
The product owner

829
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,600
is not a manager.

830
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,680
Be as the boss. The head.

831
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,360
The investor?

832
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes, the investor.

833
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,360
The product owner is the client, right?

834
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,960
They are the owner of the product

835
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,440
because they are
the ones that are paying for the product.

836
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,880
Does that make sense?

837
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,960
So they are not the project manager, okay.

838
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,200
They are on the client side

839
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,520
or so think of it like that.

840
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,920
Think of it like this.
They are the product owner.

841
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,760
They own the product, right?

842
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,560
And maybe that person didn't pay for
the whole project by themselves, right?

843
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,800
Maybe their team did,
but they assigned him or her, the product

844
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,440
owner go.

845
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,520
And that's and that's, you know, and it's

846
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,360
always going to be the client's
always going to be the client.

847
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,840
That's why it's called product owner.

848
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,200
PEO Product owners are seen as managers.

849
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,120
Sometimes they don't necessarily manage,
but whatever

850
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,800
they say goes right
because they are the broker.

851
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,120
They're the ones that are paying
the contractors to do the work right.

852
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,120
They are the client side.

853
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,040
So whatever the client's idea
is, is whatever the client says is

854
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,280
what has to be
what as to what has to go to be done.

855
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,360
It's it's the client

856
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,800
all. Could

857
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,240
you briefly explain team communication
daily, weekly calls and so on.

858
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,040
That's a scrum environment
you're talking about.

859
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,880
What exactly is your question?

860
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,760
You'd be more specific than that.

861
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,680
Like you guys know the scrum by, right?

862
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,880
You have your ceremonies,

863
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,720
you have your daily standards,
you have your other meetings.

864
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,760
What what exactly do you like?

865
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,000
What exact questions do you have?

866
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,920
They said Paul is the one communicating
with the customer.

867
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,440
It's the other way around, some sort.

868
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:39,720
Okay.

869
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,040
So in some projects and some projects
and just what I said,

870
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,000
the manager
between the client and the team.

871
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,640
So the thing is that the client side,
let's say the client is Google, right?

872
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,440
Google is truly the one that's
where the money is coming from.

873
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,600
Google, right?

874
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,280
So and and Google has its own teams,
they have their own teams and stuff,

875
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,560
and then maybe they assign
a few team members to with your team.

876
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,680
Okay.

877
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,680
So they will assign one of those members

878
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,640
the product owner role.

879
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,400
Okay.

880
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,800
And they are the ones that are considered
the product owners, Right.

881
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,400
And then they have their own team, Right?

882
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,480
So I'm sure that's what he meant to say

883
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,880
at some point, product owner MBA
communicates with client.

884
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,920
So the product owner,

885
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,280
what they can do is
even though they're owning the product,

886
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,400
they don't fully 100%
on the product, right?

887
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,680
So what they have to do
is, let's say the PR, let's say

888
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,160
you'll give us the PR
you work for for Google, right?

889
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,320
Google makes your product owner
for the project that we're working on.

890
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,360
I am the contractor,
you're the product owner.

891
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,920
So you kind of already know
what is expected.

892
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,240
You know what
the project needs to be, right?

893
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,160
So you tell us what has to happen.

894
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,640
So I am the contractor side.

895
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,400
Let's say I'm the program manager
and I will I will talk to you.

896
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,280
You'll get it and I will say, hey,
our team is doing this right.

897
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,960
Our team is doing this.
Is this good, Right?

898
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,880
And we actually show what we do
to your Geeta and her team, right?

899
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,600
And now you'll get a
has to grab the product

900
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,320
and has to kind of showcase that product
to the more internal folks of Google.

901
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,080
Does that make sense?

902
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
Does that make sense, guys?

903
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,560
So at that point,
it's really all the client side.

904
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,200
So the product owner is the client.

905
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,000
I mean, they are part of the client side.

906
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,840
Okay.

907
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,720
That's that's what you need to
that's what you need to understand.

908
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,360
Okay.

909
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:50,160
Now they deal with their internal meetings
separately and lot of their meetings.

910
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,720
You won't be in a lot of their meetings.

911
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,120
Actually, they have their meetings
of their own kind.

912
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,280
Does that make sense

913
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,960
that they are the ones that will tell you

914
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,720
the requirements that will sit down
with the business analyst?

915
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,080
I will talk the requirements
out, everything like that.

916
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,880
But And then when they need like

917
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,600
maybe when they need authorization
or they need permission

918
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,360
or they need to have their work reviewed
by someone else, the product owner

919
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,080
will reach out to someone else
at that point.

920
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,080
Okay.

921
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,800
So as a tester, what can we do
and what can we not do under oath?

922
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,000
Okay, that is a good question.

923
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,960
So, Indira, you will just be responsible

924
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,440
for moving and reporting your own tasks.

925
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,280
You will be able to create test

926
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,480
cases, you will be able to create
tasks if you're asked to,

927
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,560
but you probably most

928
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,400
likely would never be required
to create a user story.

929
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,640
Okay, That's not that's not your
that's not your role, Right?

930
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,240
That's more of a of a test.

931
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,000
Okay.

932
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,440
You also won't be able to mess around

933
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,800
with any of the developers work
because that makes sense.

934
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,880
You're only responsible for your work.

935
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,960
So. So you also won't be
starting a sprint.

936
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,160
You won't be moving things
from the backlog to the sprint backlog.

937
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,400
That's actually all done
by the bay and stuff.

938
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,920
But yesterday's meeting, we had like a
an example of how that meeting would go.

939
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:22,600
Okay.

940
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,000
So yesterday's meeting
I played the VA role

941
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,840
reports
basically linking issue and commenting.

942
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,720
Yes, exactly.

943
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,200
I keep track of your progress, right?

944
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,080
Yes. So so basically, we are restricted
not to mess up like yesterday

945
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,720
in a lot of

946
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,120
places, guys, they won't really restrict
you so much.

947
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,840
You'll have the freedom
to go and move tickets all over the board.

948
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,280
But it's not going to look good, right?

949
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,680
Especially like in a real project.

950
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,080
I know this is like a project
that we're showing you here,

951
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,480
but you guys remember like when we were
creating a new task and saw that message

952
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,000
that said this will change
the scope of the sprint, Right?

953
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,760
Do you guys remember that
message yesterday?

954
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,080
So those kind of things
will impact the project.

955
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,680
And when they generate reports,
it doesn't look so good.

956
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:11,520
Okay.

957
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,880
It doesn't look that great.

958
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,280
Testers are saying test for themselves
or the VA.

959
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,720
It can go either way for us, maybe the bay

960
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,880
or the team says okay, four assigned out,
take it to yourself.

961
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,120
Right.

962
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,360
So you would go to the board
and you will assign it to yourself.

963
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,360
Okay.

964
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,920
All of a sudden, this one to myself,
someone changed this again

965
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,160
for some reason.

966
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,160
So. Right.

967
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,800
So you'll come here and you'll.

968
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,400
You'll assign it to yourself in JIRA.

969
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,760
Who's the reporter in the ticket?

970
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,200
When you see Reporter Who's the reporter?

971
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:50,280
You guys know?

972
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,280
No, no. Who is the reporter?

973
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,200
No, no, no, no, no.

974
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,000
Who is the reporter?

975
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,240
I'm objecting to the answer.

976
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,560
The person that created the ticket.

977
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,080
That is the reporter.

978
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,560
Okay.

979
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,520
Right, guys, You guys remember
who was right here?

980
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,440
Do you see this right here?

981
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,760
Who is the reporter?

982
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,880
The person that created the ticket?

983
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,800
Okay, The person that created ticket.

984
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,000
And here it looks like it can be changed,
but at most in most projects,

985
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,040
you won't be able to change this. Okay?

986
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,440
You won't be able to change the reporter.

987
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,480
Well, and who was the assigned me

988
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,200
was the assigning.

989
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,080
Yes. You guys,
whoever or whoever is working on it.

990
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:37,720
Right.

991
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,280
Whoever is working on
ticket is the assignment.

992
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,440
It could be the developer if it's assigned
to them, it could be the tester.

993
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,440
Right.

994
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,680
So that makes sense. So

995
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,720
who creates the tickets?

996
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,680
Now, guys, we already talked about this.

997
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,760
We already talked about this guy, right?

998
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,920
Who creates the tickets, guys?

999
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,000
The business analysts. Right. The bias.

1000
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,520
Most of the time they will create
almost all the tickets, right?

1001
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,240
They're the ones that are going to be
writing the acceptance criteria

1002
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,160
and stuff like that.

1003
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,360
Right now, they may ask you to create
a separate task.

1004
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,400
In that case,
that's a different type of ticket

1005
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,640
that you may have to create yourself.
Okay.

1006
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,880
So you may like this task
that we're creating.

1007
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,600
You may be asked to create some testing
task just to keep track of your project.

1008
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,360
Do you guys

1009
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,680
remember
like when you guys had to install job

1010
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,760
intelligence or Eclipse
or whatever it is you guys are using?

1011
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,280
Right?

1012
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,840
So when you start a project, right,

1013
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,200
these are that
you may have to do some things like that.

1014
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,160
You may be

1015
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,040
there may be a task for you on the board
just to keep track of track of that.

1016
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,480
Like, okay, Marvin used to install JDK
and Intel.

1017
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,000
AJ Okay,
that's a to do. Is it in progress?

1018
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,440
And in most companies you won't be able

1019
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,840
to just go on Google
and install it yourself.

1020
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,000
Helpdesk may have to do it for you.

1021
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,720
You got another department of the company
may actually have to do that for you.

1022
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,400
Yeah, it does.

1023
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:19,680
Does that make sense?

1024
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,240
Okay, cool.

1025
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:22,720
Yeah.

1026
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,240
Okay, cool, cool.

1027
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,960
Does anyone have any questions so far
you guys are asking very good questions.

1028
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,680
And again,
if it doesn't make sense, that's okay.

1029
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,920
It's going to start to make sense later.
Okay.

1030
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,160
You have to keep, you know, doing it
and and so forth.

1031
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:40,760
Okay.

1032
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,000
So yeah, exactly.

1033
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,280
So first things let's just talk about this

1034
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,000
high level
JIRA is a project management tool, okay?

1035
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,200
It's where we basically manage
the project, right?

1036
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,920
We have the backlog, we have
the requirements, everything like that.

1037
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,680
And we're able to keep track of our work

1038
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,720
there right?

1039
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,800
So we have to keep track of our work.

1040
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,440
There we go.

1041
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,800
And this is what we can do.

1042
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,000
What?

1043
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,480
Yeah, we keep track of our work
and we get to show what we're working on.

1044
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:15,760
Okay?

1045
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,560
This is how we show our work go by.

1046
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:23,560
Does anyone have any questions?

1047
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,560
So anyone have any questions?

1048
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,680
Go. Yes,

1049
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:34,960
it is.

1050
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,680
Is your software Agile project?

1051
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,000
So this, this, this?

1052
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,280
Yeah,

1053
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,080
that it is.

1054
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,920
So do we select Tester
or it was by default.

1055
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,200
What do you mean?

1056
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,120
What can you clarify your question more

1057
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,200
you select that you your
you have to select it.

1058
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,080
You have to change it.

1059
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,760
You have to change it.

1060
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,520
Right.

1061
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,080
Okay. So

1062
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,200
I'm going to create another sample task.

1063
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:13,880
Okay.

1064
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,560
Before we can
we before we test the rest of users

1065
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,720
for the remaining of the class,
we're going to create,

1066
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,080
I'm going to move these
to the In Progress column.

1067
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,760
Okay?
We're going to work on all the tickets.

1068
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,440
It was.
I want to. Please don't move anything.

1069
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,040
Please don't move anything.

1070
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,120
What was the other one? So there's a move.

1071
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,640
Anything.

1072
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:39,000
Sharif was assigning this to himself.

1073
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,920
Okay, so please don't remove anything.

1074
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,800
So here's what I'm going to do.

1075
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm going to open h.r. Ms..

1076
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,680
Three, and i'm going to basically do
what i did yesterday again.

1077
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,520
Okay.

1078
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,840
And i hope that some of you guys
can follow along.

1079
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:52,880
You got

1080
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,800
all right, so i open the

1081
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,800
ticket, and this is the
the search and employee, right?

1082
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,960
Is everyone paying attention?

1083
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,000
So it was you
that asked questions yesterday

1084
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,440
or saying how do you link
how do we do this?

1085
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,480
Stuff like that? Right.

1086
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,720
So I'm doing it again.

1087
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,800
I'm doing it again, guys.

1088
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,360
I'm doing it again.

1089
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,400
Yeah.

1090
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,040
So my attention.

1091
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,640
So we open links in a new tab

1092
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,120
and someone already

1093
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,040
added a ticket to this and

1094
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,440
so, okay,

1095
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,600
so this is the acceptance criteria
and it's here.

1096
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,320
All right.

1097
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,080
And as an admin user, I should be able to

1098
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,640
to search for an employee
by specifying employee name.

1099
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,920
For some less.

1100
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,960
As an admin user,
I should be able to search

1101
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,320
for an employee by specifying employee.

1102
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,680
So we have two requirements
basically and one user story

1103
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,040
and that's completely okay.

1104
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:58,440
So for this one, we need to write to
I at least two different scenarios.

1105
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,160
Okay.

1106
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,360
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to click on Create.

1107
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,880
Okay. So first of all, I'm
going to copy the name, right, right.

1108
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Copy the ticket, name

1109
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,480
and then

1110
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,840
know that was the task.

1111
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,120
So I'm going to click Create

1112
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,600
and I'm going to make sure
that this is selected to task.

1113
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,520
I'm going to make sure
that this is not selected.

1114
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:24,240
The story that is not above
that is not epic.

1115
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,960
I'm going to make sure
that this is selected to task.

1116
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,680
Are you guys following instructions?

1117
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,360
Right, That's following.

1118
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,560
And then what am I going to do here?

1119
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,640
Going to place the name,
but first I'm going to say Q8 space hyphen

1120
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,640
at the end and say hyphen
and then my name.

1121
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,280
Right?

1122
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,840
Okay. There you go. So I did this.

1123
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,240
And what is next?
What are we going to do next?

1124
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:50,040
So I'm going to scroll down.

1125
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,160
I'm going to scroll down
and you see this right here.

1126
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,320
This is the important part right here.

1127
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,720
So those two, those tickets that said
block by are tested by something.

1128
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,120
You need to make sure that this linked
issues, guys

1129
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,960
says tests
at the time of creating the ticket.

1130
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:09,960
I'm going stop right there.

1131
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:22,080
Does anyone have any questions on this
part? No,

1132
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,720
No questions.

1133
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:25,720
Okay.

1134
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,840
This everyone, what are you going
to make sure that linked issue says

1135
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:33,840
when you're creating the ticket?

1136
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:39,400
Because this task that we are creating
is going to have our cucumbers in there.

1137
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,120
All right.

1138
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,720
That tests this ticket
right here from as B 1113.

1139
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,320
Right.

1140
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,000
Does that make sense?

1141
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,120
No, no, no. You just choose test.

1142
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,440
That's it, right?

1143
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,840
It's just test.
And what am I going to enter here?

1144
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,920
This task is testing what ticket?

1145
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,880
What ticket is this? Test testing

1146
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,960
HMS B 11 three.

1147
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,640
Yes, Very good.

1148
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,880
So let's say this.

1149
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,600
B, 11, right three.

1150
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,320
And it's right here.

1151
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,840
And I'm going to select this. Right.

1152
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,440
And again, let me ask you again, I already
asked you in the beginning of class,

1153
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,480
but why don't you write
your commerce scenario first and see what

1154
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,880
the rest of the options. You can do
that, too.

1155
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,680
I'm just showing you like the linking part
and everything because that's really

1156
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,680
what confused a lot of people.

1157
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,400
Okay, well,
I know you're just listening right now.

1158
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,640
You're just listening.

1159
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,960
You're not following along.
You're just listening, guys.

1160
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,200
You're not doing what I'm doing.
You're just listening. Please.

1161
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,880
So when I'm linking an

1162
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,400
issue with the other issue,
what am I doing?

1163
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:51,680
What am I doing when I'm linking to issues
or when I'm linking issues with issues?

1164
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,600
What is that?

1165
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,560
I'm establishing what? Right.

1166
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:00,080
I'm establishing a relationship right
between the issues right there.

1167
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,680
I'm linking it right.

1168
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,120
I'm establishing a connection. Right?

1169
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,120
That's exactly as everyone makes that.

1170
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,280
Does that make sense to everyone?

1171
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,120
Yeah.

1172
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,280
Well, all right.

1173
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,360
Okay, so then I've linked this,
assigned me as myself,

1174
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,880
So I'm so, like, the cell,
and you guys will select your name,

1175
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,960
but don't do it
now. You're just watching this,

1176
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,760
and then you don't select
anything for epic link, right?

1177
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,960
We don't select anything for our link
and for Sprint.

1178
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,840
What do we select for Sprint?

1179
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,000
Sprint one what? Sprint one is

1180
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,320
what?

1181
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,960
Sprint one And why are you saying to
why would we select to

1182
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,280
we're going to select a
term as B 11 sprint one.

1183
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,160
Right guys, that is this current sprint
that we're working with.

1184
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,280
So I'm going to select that
and there it is right?

1185
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,600
So I'm going to delete this.

1186
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,200
I'm going to hit cancel
and I'm going to do it again.

1187
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:01,440
Okay.

1188
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,680
So step number one,
what is step number one

1189
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,400
now? Step number one is copy.

1190
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,040
What? Copy the name. Right.

1191
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,880
I'm going to come here and copy
the take a name.

1192
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,320
Right.

1193
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,000
You can't highlight right click copy.

1194
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,480
You can highlight command C for copy.

1195
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,160
Right.

1196
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,400
Once I do that,
then what is the next step?

1197
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,120
Create. Okay.

1198
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,720
And then what I do in the summary

1199
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,200
of exactly.

1200
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,680
Make sure that what that the issue type is
what?

1201
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,080
Make sure that the issue type is.

1202
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,560
What story do I make sure
do I make sure that this does bug a bit?

1203
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,200
What am I looking for?

1204
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,280
The task. Right.

1205
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,560
I want to make sure
that this is selected to task.

1206
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,720
Okay.

1207
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,200
And the summary.

1208
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:55,920
Okay.

1209
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,400
To a space hyphen,

1210
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,000
what am I going to do?

1211
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,200
Paste the name that you copied,
which is search and employee right.

1212
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,720
And then hyphen and then your name.

1213
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,800
Exactly right. Okay, next.

1214
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,280
What are you doing?

1215
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,840
Oh, and by the way,
I want you to see this.

1216
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,320
I am creating the target, right?
I am a cell. Right?

1217
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,800
Do you guys see how by default
it says reporter me?

1218
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,480
You guys see that

1219
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,680
this is
because I am creating the ticket, right?

1220
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,040
So whoever creates
the ticket is the reporter, okay?

01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:09,360
to make sure that everyone understands it.

1301
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,040
Okay?

1302
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,440
We're going to make sure

1303
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,920
Okay, cool.

1304
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,360
That's exactly what we're going to do.
Right.

1305
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,040
So step one, what is step one?

1306
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,400
Guess what is step one?

1307
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,240
And let's help
the rest of the class. Right?

1308
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,520
So we can understand
everyone can understand this.

1309
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,040
Copy. What?

1310
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:32,240
Copy The the second name,
which is this one, Right.

1311
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,320
How do you copy?

1312
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:37,200
You can highlight right click copy. Right.

1313
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,200
Or you can highlight right in the windows.

1314
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,240
It's control C and Windows, it's
command C, right.

1315
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,800
There you go. One, copy it.

1316
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,240
And then what are we going to do?

1317
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,040
We're going to click on Create.

1318
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,800
Okay?

1319
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,520
And then we're here.

1320
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:03,000
What is the next step?

1321
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,680
You really are immune to start again.

1322
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,640
All right.
So that's exactly what we're going to do.

1323
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,920
Let me cancel this
and let me start from the beginning. Okay?

1324
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,240
Let me cancel this

1325
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,760
and then we start from the beginning
because that's a very, very serious

1326
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,120
so so what?

1327
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,240
Take it we're working on as B level,
right?

1328
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,320
Right. HMS B 11 three.

1329
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,760
So we're on the zero board. Everyone
look at the screen.

1330
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,000
Okay, look at the screen.

1331
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,560
So first of all, the actual real step
one is going to be what we're working on.

1332
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:36,000
HMS B 11 three, what is going to be
the first actual real step,

1333
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:40,720
right click right
and open in new tab, right?

1334
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,240
So we lose the mouse
and you right click your mouse

1335
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,760
and then you click on Open
Link and new tab, right?

1336
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,200
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1337
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,680
And then once it opens in the tab,
you see it it open right here.

1338
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,360
So we're going to navigate
here, we're going to click on it.

1339
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:54,880
Okay.

1340
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,520
And then what is step two?

1341
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,560
What is copy?

1342
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,320
Copy the ticket name right

1343
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:08,320
When I come here and I'm going to say
I'm going to copy this.

1344
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,160
Copy the name. Right.

1345
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,280
Command C, control C, right click,
see, copy of that.

1346
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,280
And then what am I going to do? That's

1347
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,840
great.

1348
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,160
Okay. Very, very good.

1349
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,160
And then that was okay.

1350
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,160
The next step, What do we do?
I think we're on step.

1351
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,400
What is this? Step four?

1352
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,960
Step three was click on create. Right?

1353
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,800
So we're on step for it.

1354
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,600
So step four,

1355
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,200
task task.

1356
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,240
Someone says task big task, right?

1357
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,160
So I'm going to make sure
that the issue tab says task.

1358
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,200
Is this correct here?

1359
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,640
Is this correct?

1360
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:44,880
Okay.

1361
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:51,400
Now, for those of you
that did, is this correct?

1362
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,480
Right. No. Right.

1363
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,320
What should it be?

1364
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,280
What should it be?

1365
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,960
It's going to be a task, right?

1366
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,880
Exactly.

1367
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,240
All right.

1368
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,720
Now what what is the next step?

1369
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,400
What is the next step?

1370
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,440
What Someone says paste
name to paste your name.

1371
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,320
Okay. Go away. So we're going to type Q a

1372
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:18,360
hyphen paste

1373
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,920

Okay. Very good.

1375
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,760
You guys are doing very, very, very good.

01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,840
Okay, so next step, guys. What do we do?

01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,000
What do we do?

1378
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,440
What do we do?

1379
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,600
We scroll down.

1380
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,840
Okay, okay.

1381
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,760
I'm scrolling down. And then what

1382
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,760
length issues?

1383
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,960
Gerald was the one that had questions
about this yesterday.

1384
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,320
Today he's on fire.

1385
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:50,040
So, Gerald issues what what do we make

Write tests.

1392
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,280
So I can test. Very good.

1393
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,800
What is next

1395
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,360
What am I doing about the issue?

1396
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,880
What what am I doing here?

1397
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,160
Establishing a relation with the take
I'm linking, right?

1398
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,960
I'm creating some sort of connection
relationship.

1399
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,080
And what am I going to

1400
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,760
link this issue to?

1401
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,400
Like what?

1402
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,360
HMS B 1113 right.

1403
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,320
So H are and this B level
and it comes up, right?

1404
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,440
You can either type the whole thing down

1405
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,400
or you can select it from the list.

1406
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,560
Okay, so then select it. All right.

1407
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:49,640
Next step,

1408
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,080
what assigned to yourself. Okay.

1409
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:56,040
In this case, I'm using the sales account,
so I'm going to use like the sub.

1410
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,680
Okay, Very good.

1411
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,600
And then what else is next?

1412
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,160
The sprint.

1413
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,480
Okay, The sprint.

1414
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,640
And what sprint am I going to select?
That's

1415
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,120
a term as B to one is like right on it.

1416
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:11,160
Like she had those answers ready. Right?

1417
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:15,320
HMS B 1101 Right.

1418
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:15,960
It's right here.

1419
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,000
Am I going to click on HMS B ten
Sprint one

1420
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,120
Why am I going to click
on the T sprint one?

1421
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:25,600
I'm going to click on a sprint one
now, right?

1422
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,880
I'm going to click on HMS B 11
Sprint one go.

1423
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,080
So when I click on this right
and then right

1424
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,560
and then what you can do, listen guys,

1425
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,400
what you can do before clicking create,

1426
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,560
you can go ahead and write your cucumber
scenario here.

1427
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,880
Okay? Right.

1428
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,880
Write your cucumber scenario here.

1429
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,880
Okay, cool it.

1430
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,720
Actually,
I am going to choose a name for this

1431
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:58,880
so that it's easy for you guys to find
that I'm going to type sample ticket.

1432
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,360
Okay, so that you guys can see it for
your review.

1433
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,080
Cool. Does that make sense?

1434
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,680
So this is going to be a sample ticket
that you guys can review.

1435
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,040
Does this mean that you will include
the name

1436
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:14,040
sample ticket in the name?

1437
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,720
No, man, you guys are so smart, right?

1438
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,520
I would hire me hire
all of you if I could.

1439
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,480
Right.

1440
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,040
So you're going to ride your cucumbers
and arrows here, right?

1441
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,480
Very got.

1442
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,080
So I'm going to go ahead and create this.

1443
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:28,800
Okay.

1444
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,840
Go ahead and create this equal
that's been created.

1445
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,160
I will go back to the board
and I have to look for it right here

1446
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,160
to read it.

1447
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,360
Let's say it was for me.

1448
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:48,040
So the one that I create is a sample
random ticket sample.

1449
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,000
There you go.

1450
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,280
So I want to move this to in progress.

1451
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:52,600
All right.

1452
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,800
That's a sample ticket
for you guys to review. All right.

1453
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,040
Very good.

1454
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:59,760
So now we are going to work on.

1455
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,920
Oh, we did HMS.

1456
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,080

01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,640
Okay, Let's work on HMS before.

1459
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:12,240
And for those you who have issues
on the ones that you guys did yesterday,

01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,640

Hold on.

1468
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,360

Yes. Everyone work on HMS Beloved three.

1470
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,800
I have a question for you guys.
I have a question.

1471
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,960
I question

1472
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:41,960
Right.

1473
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,840
Are you going to coming to JIRA and

1474
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:49,480
are you going to change anything on HMS
B 11 three?

1475
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,280
Are you going to open the ticket
and change?

1476
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,840
Stop here
and change the acceptance criteria

1477
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,000
for the whole class
to get confused and stuff?

1478
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,200
Right?

1479
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:01,240
If you are,
please show me a personal message

1480
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,400

to me, personal messages, that's fine.

1482
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,880
We need to have a discussion thread, but
for the rest of you, please don't do it.

1483
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,200
Go Vote.

1484
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,280

Okay, let's see.

01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,680
What does that HMS Batch 11?

1489
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,680
What do you mean?

1490
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,040
You were when I was creating.

1491
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,200
It's right here. The one.

1492
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:40,760
So it's right here.

1493
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,120
It's right here to

1494
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,120
I mean, when you click Create,
I declare create.

1495
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:48,880
This is what?

1496
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:49,480
This is what I see.

1497
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,920
I see the same thing you're seeing

1498
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,080
someone.

1499
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:15,080
Are you good?

1500
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,520
Tomorrow? You're good.

You're right

1502
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,480
about moving the window to the right.

1503
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,640
What about moving the window to the right?

1504
01:10:32,640 --> 01:11:18,400
What did I move to the right?

1505
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,480
You move the sample.

1506
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,960
Want to be able to see the description?

1507
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,440

You want to search right here.

1510
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,560
Oh, are you asking why you can't see it in
your monitor?

1511
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,400
Is that what you asking?

1512
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:44,800
Is because my monitor
is actually larger than yours.

1513
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,280
Yeah.

1514
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:56,720
Yeah. Yep.

You can open it.

1517
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,440
Why not?

1518
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,920
Why can you not open that up?

1519
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:20,640
What is what is the situation?

1520
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,200

01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,960

no idea what you guys are talking about.

1523
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:37,400
Sorry.

1524
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,560
Can we move create,
can we move create issue window?

1525
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,120
No, you can't.

1526
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,800
If I create it, you can't move it.

1527
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,800
Even I can't do it

1528
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,840
that it's opening the same page for me.

1529
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,000
Well, what are you trying to open.

1530
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,040
I'll show us some screenshots.

1531
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,400
Oh help us show.

1532
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,320
I was like,
well what are you trying to do?

1533
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,600
Wow, very good.

1534
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:05,680
So far,
nobody has done anything to these tickets.

1535
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,480
Like everyone has left it alone.
Very good.

1536
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,880
Guys, I want to applaud you for that.

1537
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,960
I applaud you for that.

1538
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,360
That's what's what's
what's the problem, guys?

1539
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,400
Yesterday,
you guys were not following instructions.

1540
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:38,560
And today you guys are.

1541
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,160
Now, is this hard?

1542
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,040
If you even make a mistake, that's fine.

1543
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,480
If you make a mistake, we'll fix it.

1544
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,560
Mistakes
are good because we want to fix them.

1545
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,480
I want to show you how to fix it

1546
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:59,640
so you make a mistake.

1547
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,400
That's okay.

1548
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,680
We will fix it together,
but we will fix it

1549
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:07,080
together.

1550
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,120
Let's see.

1551
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,080
Yeah,
we'll give you feedback. I'll actually.

1552
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,520
I'll help you fix the issue.

1553
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,520
That's the point of today's class today.

1554
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,160
It's just going to be proactive. Okay?

1555
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,280
We're just to fix mistakes.

1556
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,560
Maybe a lot of
maybe you make the same mistake.

1557
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:22,160
Other people do it,
and we can help everyone else.

1558
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,120
Oh, it's not all.

1559
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:29,800
Yes. So click on open link in new tab.

1560
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,040
You have to know right there. Right.

1561
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,320
You're
right. Clicking open linking the tab.

1562
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,160
Click on that. So

1563
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:42,480
if you guys make mistakes, that's okay.

1564
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,520
We're going to fix it together.

1565
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,080
Okay.

1566
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:45,960
We're going to fix.

1567
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,200
I know how to do it, but it's not opening.

1568
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:57,120
It's just saying the same.

1569
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,360
Oh, you have to right click on the ticket.

1570
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,800
So no,
if you know, if you look at the screen

1571
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,520
because we know

1572
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,160
look,
you actually have to write click on a link

1573
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,120
and then open the link in a new tab.

1574
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:15,120
So maybe it's
maybe it's thinking something.

1575
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,720
Maybe you're you're just do that
first, go directly to the link,

1576
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,800
right, click it and open a new tab

1577
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,080
to write your comments in there.

1578
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,520
Should we always say click?

1579
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,640
And actually
now you can make it high level.

1580
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,760
That's okay.

1581
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,080
You can make it high level.

1582
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,280
That's fine.

1583
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,960
You can make it high level.

1584
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,480
I'm not sure how to write the cucumber
criteria when I don't know where

1585
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,000
they are supposed to search,
but they're a bunch of click.

1586
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,680
Okay, some other stuff on there map
too much of what they're up to.

1587
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,040
Place them up in second time out.

1588
01:15:53,040 --> 01:16:07,920
Everyone.

1589
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,120
All right. So

1590
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,880
is everyone paying attention here?

1591
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:14,160
I we're paying attention to.

1592
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,440
So I'm going to explain
this acceptance criteria

1593
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,400
because I expect your cucumbers and arrows
to be top notch.

1594
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,520
First of all, I told you
from the beginning, how many cucumber

1595
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:26,520
scenarios
are we going to right, at least for this

1596
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,600
to get to?

1597
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,000
You can write both of them in the same
task.

1598
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:34,440
Okay.

1599
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:34,880
You can write

1600
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,680
both of them on the same task
if you want to create another test for it,

1601
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,880
knock yourself out.

1602
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,560
I'll have a go for it, Offer it, go crazy.

1603
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,720
Get what I used Your only want to practice
Grade another test.

1604
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,840
You go for it.

1605
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,920
So for this one, as an admin user,
you already have admin credentials.

1606
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,160
I should be able to search
for an employee by post

1607
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,160
by specifying the employee name first.

1608
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,400
The last name for this one.

1609
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,840
I'm not going to be so specific,
but just go on the application

1610
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,280
and see where you need
to search for the employee and that's it.

1611
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:07,080
Okay.

1612
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,680
The second one, as the admin user,

1613
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,760
I should be able to search for an employee
by specifying the employee I.D..

1614
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,480
So it looks like you're
just searching for an employee.

1615
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:19,040
But the first one, you're
you're searching by first and last name,

1616
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,720
and the second one
you're searching by I.D..

1617
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,400
Okay, just go in there.

1618
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:29,280
Look, an existing employee search
the employee search and employee ID,

1619
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,920
you know, like, just go ahead and undo it
and write a cucumber scenario for it.

1620
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,720
Okay?

1621
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:43,200
Does that make sense?

1622
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,720
Does that make sense, guys,

1623
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:52,280
when I'm trying to fix my problem
from yesterday. So?

1624
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,120
So. Okay.

1625
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,560
Sheriff. Sheriff.

1626
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,360
Sheriff. What sprint are we in

1627
01:17:59,240 --> 01:17:59,840
or what?

1628
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,480
Sprint are we in?

1629
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,160
What?

1630
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,200
No, we're not in Sprint three.

1631
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,720
What sprint are we in?

1632
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:10,800
This is the ticket number of Sheriff.

1633
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,080
This is not the sprint number, right?

1634
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,800
If you look at the sprint
right here, it says, What sprint?

1635
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,040
Are we unsure
if you see what sprint are in one.

1636
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:20,640
Right.

1637
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,400
So you should be looking for HMS

1638
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:28,200
B 11, Sprint one, not three.

1639
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,520
If you go back and edit

1640
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,480
the cucumbers narrows and hit create,
why would you hit create?

1641
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,840
If you go back and edit the cucumber
scenarios, why would you created

1642
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:40,640
if you're editing the ticket
guys in order?

1643
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,960
Okay, so in order to edit a ticket,
this is what you do.

1644
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,360
Okay, let me show you

1645
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:48,240
because everyone paying attention, right,
is their own fan attention.

1646
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,400
Let's say you created a ticket
and you didn't write your scenario.

1647
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,160
That's completely okay.

1648
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,120
Yeah, I think it was.

1649
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,960
Do you guys have the login info for

1650
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,960
or the application?

1651
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,200
See that somewhere

1652
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:08,200
here?

1653
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,760
Yeah. There you go. Tomorrow.
Thanks so much.

1654
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,440
Those are the credentials.

1655
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,000
Thank you. Thank you.

1656
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:13,600
Thank you.

1657
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,200
You got so let me go back to this.

1658
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:20,040
If someone needs to write, okay,
If someone needs to edit

1659
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,080
a ticket,
are you going to create a new one?

1660
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,120
Now? You're not going to create a new one.

1661
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,960
You can edit an existing one, right?

1662
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,320
So I'm going to edit this one for a lot
less time is going to pictures.

1663
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:34,040
I'm going
to just mess around with it. Okay.

1664
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,760
But the you know what?

1665
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,560
We're a lot this was a lot of nice
and we have a lot of

1666
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,480
I want

1667
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,240
said a lot of I'm going
to just play around with your ticket okay

1668
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,160
So just
I'm just going to use just for example.

1669
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,320
So here is the lottery ticket. Okay.

1670
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,800
So let's say I forgot to edit it.

1671
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,160
You guys see, if I hover over here,
I have the option to.

1672
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,720
EDIT Right.

1673
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,880
Okay, you can click on this

1674
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,880
and you can edit, you can edit here,

1675
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,360
you can delete stuff,
you can change stuff.

1676
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,000
I am editing.

1677
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,200
Okay, Does that make sense?

1678
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,200
Just go and then hit save
and then it saves that ticket.

1679
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:23,280
You don't need to create a new ticket.

1680
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,760
Okay, we'll just edit the ticket.

1681
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:27,600
Cool.

1682
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,000
All right.

1683
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,560
And guys.

1684
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,680
Okay,
so I'm going to let's do a bonus here.

1685
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,280
Okay.

1686
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,480
Let's do a bonus.

1687
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,400
Let's do a bonus. Okay.

1688
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:43,120
Well, so here's going to do
first of all, this is task one.

1689
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,520
Task two.

1690
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,080
Listen, guys,
everyone tasked to send one listening

1691
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,360
task to

1692
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:53,760
listen.

1693
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,200
And I'm going to see if you can figure out

1694
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:01,120
is to create
first of all, go into the syntax h.r.

1695
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,440
Mess application, guys.

1696
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:06,120
And let's see who, can find a bug.

1697
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,200
Okay.

1698
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,600
And if you find a bug created in jira,

1699
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:14,680
that's going to be,
first of all, a very big bonus for you.

1700
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:18,960
Okay, guys, in our previous classes,
i just want to bring something.

1701
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:19,440
What do you mean?

1702
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,720
Where where else would you create the bug?

1703
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,720
We're working. And you're right.

1704
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,480
So here's the thing, right?

1705
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,240
And let me just show you real quick.

1706
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,120
Everyone just pay attention.

1707
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,240
You're going to go to the gear board.

1708
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,280
This is the gear board. I'm here.

1709
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,000
And in order to create a bug,
instead of going to a ticket,

1710
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,400
I'm going to click Create up here.

1711
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,040
You guys see this?

1712
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,440
Okay.

1713
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,520
Do you guys see this? You guys?

1714
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,320
So instead of opening a ticket,
I'm actually going to be

1715
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:52,920
on the JIRA board and I'm going to click
the Create button right here.

1716
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,560
Okay?

1717
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:56,920
Does that make sense to everyone?

1718
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:59,880
So in here, So I'm going to click Create.

1719
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:04,120
And when you click create issue type,
if I'm creating a bug,

1720
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:10,720
what do you think I'm going to select?

1721
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:14,120
What if you want to select, right

1722
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,680
of the hard question, right?

1723
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,760
You're going to enter the summary, right?

1724
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,840
And now, guys, hold on.

1725
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,240
Listen, the summary doesn't
have to be the name we've been using.

1726
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,200
You can name
and whatever I'm going to say this.

1727
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,000
This is just a sample bug sample
bug ticket.

1728
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:32,920
Okay.

1729
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,880
The name is going to be I'm
just going to make something up.

1730
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,080
Okay. Log in.

1731
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,800
Button logging button, not working.

1732
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:44,160
Okay, cool.

1733
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:44,680
All right.

1734
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,720
And then as everyone penitential,

1735
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,440
everything else
almost will likely be the same.

1736
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,000
Right?

1737
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,280
For bugs.

1738
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,360
We're not going to link anything.

1739
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:54,480
Okay.

1740
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,880
You're not going to link anything. Okay.

1741
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,360
What was that?

1742
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:03,160
I said for bugs,
you are not going to link anything.

1743
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:03,440
Well,

1744
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,720
you. Oh, yeah.

1745
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:08,080
I'm sorry. You add your name. My bad.
I forgot about that.

1746
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,240
You add your name so I know that it's you.

1747
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,040
So have my name to the name.

1748
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,520
You don't link anything with bugs.

1749
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,600
Okay, guys, just

1750
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,600
don't play anything

1751
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,520
with bugs, okay?

1752
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,320
All right, Now

1753
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:34,080
what I'm going to do
is I'm going to assign it to myself,

1754
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,920
and you're going to send it to yourself,

1755
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,560
and you're going to assign it
to the current sprint.

1756
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,160
What's the current sprint?

1757
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,200
Is that AFGE Sprint one?

1758
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,000
Is it Sprint one?

1759
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,280
Is it four, has four one.

1760
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,200
What is a current sprint

1761
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,160
that's not inside the HMS B level guys?

1762
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,400
I said not inside.

1763
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,000
Right.

1764
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,120
Okay guys, everyone pause
what you're doing.

1765
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,840
Does everyone stop it, please?

1766
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,320
Because I'm creating bug
and this is what the next step is.

1767
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,200
Okay, I'm going to cancel
everything I was just doing.

1768
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,440
Okay, everyone, attention on the screen,
please.

1769
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,040

There was my screen, right, guys?

1778
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,680
Did everyone stop working on it?

Are you on the screen over here to Mana

1794
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,280
was named Marja.

1795
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,440
The Sierra's here.

1796
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,480
Lobo, Right.

1797
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,560
Okay, Go, go, go.

1798
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,840
Oh, there's. There's the other movies.
I didn't know we had to lose.

1799
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,840
The other is Castro. We have Cabrera.

1800
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,840
Okay, cool.

1801
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,960
So I'm to create a bug.

1802
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,120
Okay, I'm going to create a bug. Cool.

1803
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,480
So what I'm going to do
is I'm not going to open a ticket.

1804
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,520
I'm going to be the springboard, okay?

1805
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:25,640
I'm going to be on the springboard
right here.

1806
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:26,160
Okay.

1807
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,960
That is step number one to make sure
that you are on the springboard.

1808
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:34,680
Okay, then I'm going to click on Create.

1809
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:35,880
Okay.

1810
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,760
And if I'm creating a bug,
what do you think this should say?

1811
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,200
If I'm creating a bug,
what do you think they should say? Bug,

1812
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,000
Right.

1813
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,640
How? That's a that's a very hard question.

1814
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,080
Right?

1815
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,760
So that's a complicated question.
Right. Okay.

1816
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:55,760
So for the summary,
I'm going to write this sample bug ticket

1817
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:01,080
ticket and I'm going to say

1818
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,120
and then these tickets, guys,

1819
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,120
they don't need to have the same name
as the tickets that you're testing, Right?

1820
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,880
I'm Going to name it something else.

1821
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,720
I'm going to make something up. Okay.

1822
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:13,680
I'm going to say login
button to our content

1823
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,760
and then at the end
you're going to put your name on

1824
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,320
and then I'm going to scroll down

1825
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,360
and the description right

1826
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,360
to see, are you sending pictures

1827
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:26,360
or you're or is your are you on the screen

1828
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,760
because I saw that like for your test.

1829
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,080
They were kind of not right So

1830
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:35,280
watch the screen this here right.

1831
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,280
So here's the thing
right in the description

1832
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:43,520
here you are going to list

1833
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,440
write the steps to reproduce

1834
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,800
okay we're really talked about the bug
lifecycle.

1835
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,000
We talked in the previous classes
how to report a bug.

1836
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,080
I'm not going to give you that answer.

1837
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:58,360
I want to see how much you guys
remember that.

1838
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:02,480
So cool.

1839
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,760
And then I want to scroll down.

1840
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,840
You are not going to link it
to any ticket.

1841
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,600
Okay. Now you don't need to write it in
cucumber form.

1842
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,800
We don't write our bugs and form.

1843
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,440
You just write steps.

1844
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:18,760
Can you write steps that
so we don't link anything?

1845
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,920
That's a good thing.

1846
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:24,760
So that's less there
and then you assign it to yourself, Okay?

1847
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,040
And then you assign it to the current
sprint. Right?

1848
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,320
And the current sprint is what

1849
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,280
mess is

1850
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:36,560
AFGE Sprint one is a disparate one
is it for said

1851
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,920
Sprint one, it's HMS B 11, Sprint one.

1852
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,440
Right. That is the sprint.

1853
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,680
Okay, cool.

1854
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,160
That is so you create a bug.

1855
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,560
Let's do it again.

1856
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,160
And this length issues here

1857
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,680
doesn't matter because
we're not linking it so you don't have to.

1858
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,120
This doesn't matter what it says
because we're not working in issue.

1859
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,600
Okay, let's do it again.

1860
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,200
Okay, Let's do it again.

1861
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,160
Do it again.

1862
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,640
All right, Ready?

1863
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,840
So, step one, what is step one?

1864
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:15,800
Where are we going to be?

1865
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,400
Where are we going to be not step one,
Where are we going to be?

1866
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,200
What's it called
was the proper word for it.

1867
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,120
What is the proper word, friend?

1868
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:25,560
Where are we going to be?

1869
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,400
No, that's not step one.

1870
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,960
Step one
is we're going to be on the sprint board.

1871
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,760
That's right, Mustafa.
We're going to be on the Sprint port.

1872
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,640
So am I going to be here?
Am I going to be on the backlog

1873
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,040
in the going to be in another ticket?

1874
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,400
No, I'm going to be on the sprint
port Red.

1875
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,040
Okay.

1876
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:49,000
Step two, what is step 24814141.

1877
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,880
And because I'm creating here's
the hardest part.

1878
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,920
Here is the hardest part
because I'm creating a bug.

1879
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:59,080
What should the issue type be?

1880
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,000
Is there going to be a story?

1881
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,960
Is it going to be epic?

1882
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,240
Is it going to be a task?

1883
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:08,480
If I'm creating a bug, it's
going to be a bug, right?

1884
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,840
Very good. Okay.

1885
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,480
And then here

1886
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,160
is just me.

1887
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:16,640
I'm is going to write
the name of the public,

1888
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:20,520

1889
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,040

01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,040
steps,

1893
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:33,240
not acceptance criteria.

1894
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,560
Don't don't give me that kind of hard
to type right now.

1895
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:36,680
Steps to reproduce.

1896
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:41,520
Right
Steps reproduce right steps to reproduce.

1897
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,440
Go. Okay.

1898
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,880
And you scroll down.

1899
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,720
You will not link anything again.

1900
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:51,600
You're going to

1901
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,840
assign it to yourself,
this case of a cell,

1902
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:58,560
and then you're going to pick the current
spread a term as B, please

1903
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,080
pay attention
to what you're linking it to.

1904
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,960
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and

1905
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:04,640
okay.

1906
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,160
And I'm going to move it here in progress
just so that you guys can see how

1907
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,840
to create. Okay, simple book. Take it.

1908
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,960
All right. Ready, guys? I got now

1909
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,800
the real syntax application, the syntax
HMS application that you guys are using.

1910
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,600
There are some real bugs there.

1911
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,920
So see if you can go and find them. Okay.

1912
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,680
See If you can go and find them
after you write your scenarios.

1913
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,280
All right.

1914
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,520
So go ahead. Go ahead.

1915
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,400
Read the tickets.

1916
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,840
If you find more than one, create
more than one ticket.

1917
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:34,360
Right.

1918
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,280
Create more than one public guys.
Go crazy.

1919
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:38,400
Go for crazy.

1920
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,640
All right.

1921
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:45,080
If they an employee
if they file employee I.D.,

1922
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,720
it's if anyone saw an employee I.D.

1923
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:52,000
on a website, you can just
go to the website and just look up

1924
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,760
whatever play these. Right.

1925
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:59,720
So let's see.

1926
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,200
Okay. Very good.

1927
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:05,040
Someone created a bug already.

1928
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,040
They're sick.

1929
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,680
They see space,
not function or display correctly.

1930
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,520
So this is interesting.

1931
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:13,600
Let's see.

1932
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,800
Let's see what Alan says.

1933
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,080
All over this.

1934
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,840
This is a beautiful bug, but

1935
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,400
I like the way it's spread, right?

1936
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,960
And I like the way it's spread.

1937
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,400
And guys, if you create your bugs,
go ahead, move it to the in progress.

1938
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,680
I actually don't move it to in progress.

1939
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:33,000
Don't move anything too in progress
because the ones that are in progress

1940
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
are for you guys to see for samples
and stuff by the way,

1941
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,960
you guys are doing a very good job
at following directions today,

1942
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:40,840
which is

1943
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:45,960
something that historically another batch
has not been able to do.

1944
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:50,240
But yes, on the syntax page,

1945
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,880
does everyone have the syntax,
your URL that the page

1946
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,000
we sent it up?

1947
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,320
What is it?

1948
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,680
I think I have it.

1949
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:04,440
Give me a second.

1950
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:07,080
Look it up.

1951
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,440
Let me look

1952
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:11,680
right here.

1953
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,360
This is the this is the URL.

1954
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:19,600
Okay.

1955
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,000
Okay.

1956
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,240
And that's the URL and the credentials.

1957
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:28,040
Can someone
please send the credentials again because

1958
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,840
they're somewhere,
but I don't know where they were is.

1959
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,320
Thanks to the one

1960
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:36,720

Nice Dominic.

1965
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:50,200

1966
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,920
You created a task you in. Well

1967
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:56,640

1968
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,760

You were on fire also the bugs.

01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,320
Obviously the bugs.

1971
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,560
Guys, I want to see the bugs go. See?

1972
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,440
This is it.

1973
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,680
I want to see who's a good tester.

1974
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:11,400
Go and go and find any bugs.

1975
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,320
Guys.

1976
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:55,000

1977
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,080
Oh, guys, I'm sorry.

1978
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:01,080
So, by the way, let's just

01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,000
let let's.

1980
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,480
It's 837.

1981
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,720
How about we take a break
and we come back?

1982
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:12,000
Are you guys good with 10 minutes

1983
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,440
today is?

1984
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,320
Just you guys just working on zero.

1985
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,520
So you're going
to come back in 10 minutes.

1986
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,840
So it sounds like we're having
some performance issue.

1987
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:20,880
Maybe that's bug.

1988
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:24,120
I don't know. It's up to you to report it.

1989
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:28,480

01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:44,040
If you guys made mistakes, please
let me know so we can fix them together.

1995
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,360

01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:50,040

and we're going to have that complete
by the end.

2010
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:05,400

the bug bug hunter Bug hunters.

2015
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:21,600
Bug bounty hunters.

2016
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,000
Let's see.

2017
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:26,600
I want to see who I want to see

Alexis, I look into your stuff

2025
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,480
boxes. You need to take a break.

out of the way.

2040
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:04,440
We talked about this, right?

2041
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,600
We talked about this before.

2042
01:48:07,200 --> 01:49:49,680
When you are putting a bug.

2043
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,920
All right, guys. All right.

Would you reported?

2052
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,840
Would you not say anything?

2053
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,960
What would you do?

2054
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:20,640
Someone moved this.

2055
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:23,200
Someone my bug got to in progress.

2056

Come.

2060
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:40,680
All right.

2061
01:50:40,680 --> 01:51:13,400
Why would you move it back to in progress?

2062
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:17,080
All right, guys, are we back
or are we back to one

2063
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:21,440
there?

2064
01:51:21,440 --> 01:52:30,320
Alexis, you want me to look at your.

All right, guys, come on, let's go.

2066
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,800
I want to see want to see some bugs here?

2067
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,680
I want to see some bugs here.

2068
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:39,120
All right, let's see

2069
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:44,000
when we go to the bottom,

2070
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,080
the mirror opens this bug,

2071
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:49,200
and let's see if it's good. Let's see.

2072
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:50,440
Let's see what the mirror did here.

2073
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:54,960
It said the mirror or dimmer

2074
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:56,800
is the mirror here?

2075
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:01,440
Same class.

2076
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,400
All right, let's see.

2077
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:05,360
A bug steps to reproduce.

2078
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:06,680
He says

2079
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:10,160
you don't need to copy the sample bug test
part of the name

2080
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:13,160
the mirror that's just made
so that you guys can see the ticket

2081
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:15,160
in case
you want to know what it should have.

2082
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:18,760
So go ahead and fix that. The

2083
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:24,200
so it says

2084
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:27,480
multiple search results

2085
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:29,640
with incomplete information on directory

2086
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,160
steps you reproduce

2087
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:37,320
open a chance website,

2088
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,680
log in with credentials.

2089
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:41,440
Very Good.

2090
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,720
Click on the directory,

2091
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,480
click on job panel.

2092
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:48,600
So as I'm going to actually test this

2093
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:52,280
as see if it makes sense.

2094
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:52,880
Right.

2095
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:57,120
The second step is log
within the credentials username admin

2096
01:53:57,480 --> 01:54:00,600
and say

2097
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:02,440
oh, what size don't

2098
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,960
see. It's

2099
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:07,640
because a lot of us are using it. Huh.

2100
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:18,400
Is it a bug or is it not?

2101
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:18,840
Okay.

2102
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:19,840
So okay.

2103
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,560
So set logging username

2104
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,560
and then the password.

2105
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:27,600
This he provided password. Very good.

2106
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:30,360
He provided the password.

2107
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:33,120
He he already has the exact steps

2108
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:35,800
to reproduce which is awesome.

2109
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:39,200
Right? I know what I'm doing.

2110
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:41,280
So I'm logging in.

2111
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,440
It's going to take a while
because you guys are using it

2112
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:53,920
as it's

2113
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,920
kind of stuck here.

2114
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:03,360
So. Okay.

2115
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:06,760
And the next step says Click

2116
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:10,680
on the directory directory tab directory.

2117
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:14,960
But oh, there's only one directory

2118
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,000
here, so maybe it can be a little bit
more specific there.

2119
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,600
The mirror right.

2120
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:23,400
So I'm going to click on directory.

2121
01:55:23,640 --> 01:55:25,520
That's what it says.

2122
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:28,800
And then here it says Click on job title.

2123
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,080
Job title or job title field

2124
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,240
and search directory.

2125
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:34,920
So click on this.

2126
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:39,080
I guess he gives you a choice,
a dropdown right?

2127
01:55:39,080 --> 01:55:42,560
And choose accountants

2128
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,840
to choose accountants

2129
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,520
and click Search.

2130
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:56,640
So I click Search.

2131
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:57,680
We're going to wait.

2132
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:01,520
And he's saying that the actual result
multiple entries with the name

2133
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:05,120
a billion on the top
for job title account and

2134
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:10,000
missing information such as phone number,
extension, e-mail address.

2135
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,960
It's better for each person
with the same job title and they want

2136
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:18,240
only one entry name title Extension
fields are accurate.

2137
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:19,640
Let's see.

2138
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:23,520
So I see what he's saying.

2139
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:27,960
Okay, So I see

2140
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:30,440
what he's saying.

2141
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:34,320
He's saying that okay, for the job
title accountant.

2142
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,640
So he's saying that there's more

2143
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:39,280
than one person
whose name the billion on a title, Right?

2144
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:44,520
Is it possible
for people to have the same name?

2145
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:49,520
Is it possible for people
to have the same name?

2146
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,680
Yeah, it is. Right. We having

2147
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:55,800
Christine Williams from Fairfax,

2148
01:56:55,800 --> 01:57:00,600
you know, there is another Christine
Fairfax, Christine Williams from Fairfax.

2149
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:05,760
So maybe there are multiple people
with the same name that are accountants.

2150
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:07,240
Okay.

2151
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:12,080
The missing information such as full
number extensions that email addresses.

2152
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:14,560
So this is this is interesting, right?

2153
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,040
The mirror.

2154
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:18,240
This is good
that you're thinking outside the box.

2155
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:25,440
Now, but before we report this bug,
we need to make sure that the requirement

2156
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:29,640
says that there should not be any of this
missing information.

2157
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:29,920
Right.

2158
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:33,440
What if the requirement
what if there's no requirement for it?

2159
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:36,440
What if what if there's a requirement
that says it's fine

2160
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:38,640
if there is no phone number
or email address?

2161
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:41,440
Right.

2162
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:45,480
So the expected results for each person
with the same title,

2163
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:49,280
only one entry
there could be different employees

2164
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:52,680
can use Gerken language.

2165
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,680
No, not really.

2166
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:57,960
I mean, not really use list of steps

2167
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:01,600
you can try.

2168
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:05,400
I mean, again, when using Gerken,
you just writing English, right?

2169
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:10,680
So you can
you can try it as long as it makes sense.

2170
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:14,440
So the whole point of cucumber

2171
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:17,920
name title extension fields are accurate.

2172
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:20,040
Okay. I see

2173
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:21,120
so this is all right.

2174
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:22,920
But before reporting this above,

2175
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:27,320
I would have checked the requirements
to make sure that this is a bug.

2176
01:58:27,320 --> 01:58:27,840
Right.

2177
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,800
So the MIRA, you did a very good job
at thinking outside

2178
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:34,440
the box is a very good job.
And think outside.

2179
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:35,440
That's really good.

2180
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:36,720
That's very good.

2181
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:38,920
That that is very good.

2182
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:43,120
So, Damian, can you please move
your take your bug to 51.

2183
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:46,800
Can you please move it to the Don
column only?

2184
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,200
Dan There you go.

2185
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:50,560
Let me see the next bug here.

2186
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:57,360
Ahmed 254 to 54

2187
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,760
When trying to use syntax HMS website,
it takes several minutes

2188
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,680
to get so these aren't, these aren't steps

2189
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,200
Ahmed is often they're

2190
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:13,600
these aren't, these aren't really steps

2191
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,720
right you're just giving
a description of the bug

2192
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,880
so these aren't really steps to reproduce
a return to

2193
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,680
the syntax. HMS

2194
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:25,760
takes

2195
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:28,800
on side with all the credentials.

2196
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:31,560
All the sub pages are slow
to open website.

2197
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:33,800
Totally should be checked for performance.

2198
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:37,520
Okay, this is good.

2199
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:39,000
The description is good.

2200
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,520
But you didn't really list
steps to reproduce.

2201
01:59:43,120 --> 01:59:45,960
Yes, you just indicated what happens.

2202
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:46,480
Yeah,

2203
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:49,720
but I see that
you're thinking outside the box,

2204
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:52,600
so I'll give you

2205
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,920
eight out of ten for that.

2206
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:55,560
Okay.

2207
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,480
Often
you can move your ticket to the column

2208
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,600
that the done column.

2209
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,160
And so there should be
two people in there.

2210
02:00:04,160 --> 02:00:06,640
Don't call them what you want. So

2211
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,440
let's see,

2212
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,360
let's look at and

2213
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:19,320
and are you are you in class two

2214
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,040
so far?

2215
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:22,960
So far so far.

2216
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,840
I see no screenshots,
which is a big bummer

2217
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:29,000
because I can't see the bug, right?

2218
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:33,520
Can't see the bug.

2219
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:35,680
I can't it can't see the bug.

2220
02:00:35,680 --> 02:00:40,520
I cannot see the bug.

2221
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:44,120
So simple bug ticket's error. Finally.

2222
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:47,360
And by the way, you don't need
to include this in the ticket.

2223
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,760
I just put that in my ticket
because I wanted you guys to easily

2224
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:54,320
find it in case you need to see

2225
02:00:54,320 --> 02:01:02,480
how I create the bug ticket.

2226
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:03,640
The merry go crazy.

2227
02:01:03,640 --> 02:01:05,600
Go find bugs. That's fine.

2228
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:07,760
So description

2229
02:01:08,240 --> 02:01:11,880
Application error
By finding an employee by employee name

2230
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:17,160
application is unable to file
employee by employing name.

2231
02:01:18,120 --> 02:01:18,840
Okay.

2232
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,240
Expect the results by typing an employee
name.

2233
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,360
Admin should find an employee in a native
based

2234
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:25,320
open h.r.

2235
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:27,160
Mess log in to syntax hms.

2236
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:29,200
Okay, i'm logged in

2237
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:31,840
navigate to admin,
so maybe I have to go back

2238
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:34,000
to the office and navigate to admin.

2239
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,760
But a user guru to user management

2240
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:40,680
admin user management and was the next of

2241
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:43,640
users.

2242
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:44,160
Okay.

2243
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:47,280
And then username users.

2244
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:47,720
Yeah.

2245
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,160
And then it says

2246
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:54,480
type in employee name
and the employee name field.

2247
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,800
But she doesn't say what employee.

2248
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:00,240
So this bug is not that descriptive.

2249
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:04,760
And where are you that you didn't indicate
what name

2250
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:06,240
to enter?

2251
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:09,840
You see, I need those details to reproduce
this bug that you are reporting.

2252
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:13,240
Okay, so go ahead and edit this ticket.

2253
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:15,960
But so far everything was good.
I like it. It made sense.

2254
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:17,840
I was I was running through this bug
really fast.

2255
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:20,360
This is really good
and really, really, really good.

2256
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,240
Okay, so I'll come back to okay, I know.

2257
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:25,800
I'll come back to it. I'll come back it.

2258
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:28,960
So let's see. I was picking bugs so

2259
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,160
I saw some Anthony

2260
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:34,920
of performance issue.

2261
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:37,280
Okay, let's see. 261.

2262
02:02:37,560 --> 02:02:38,160
Let's see.

2263
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:42,640
Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.

2264
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:45,560
Okay,
so he wrote this bug in cucumber scenario

2265
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:48,840
and he said it test this one.

2266
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:50,840
We weren't supposed to link anything
with the bug.

2267
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:51,720
Anthony Right.

2268
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:54,400
We weren't supposed to link anything
with the

2269
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:57,600
right.

2270
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:57,920
Yeah.

2271
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:00,960
So it says given the
you are given the user has the URL

2272
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:06,280
when entering the URL in the URL text,
but then there is a slow load.

2273
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:09,200
Okay.
Maybe we can change the steps, right?

2274
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:12,080
To be like one, two, three, like steps
you produce.

2275
02:03:12,760 --> 02:03:13,440
This is okay.

2276
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:17,320
I mean, I understand, but maybe
you could say like navigate to your URL.

2277
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:20,760
What happens is that
the page takes a long time to load.

2278
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:22,360
This is good.

2279
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:25,320
Obviously you would report a performance
issue like this.

2280
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:26,160
So good job.

2281
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:29,480
Just fix the change wearing a little bit.

2282
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:30,240
Anthony

2283
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:31,680
Yeah, that's fine.

2284
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:32,960
Just change a little wording.

2285
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:33,880
It's fine.

2286
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:35,240
You're like, one, two, three.

2287
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:37,600
So far, so far it
I want to point this out.

2288
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,720
I'm mean, I give some hints out.

2289
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:44,920
I haven't seen a bug that shows me what
time, what browser, what you was used.

2290
02:03:44,920 --> 02:03:47,120
I don't see any of that. Okay.

2291
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:49,360
I don't see any of that.

2292
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,960
I don't see of that.

2293
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:52,720
Go back.

2294
02:03:53,160 --> 02:03:54,600
Okay. So

2295
02:03:56,720 --> 02:03:58,160
let me.

2296
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:00,160
Alexis,
did you want me to look up your ticket?

2297
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,680
If so, what I did was that.

2298
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:08,400
Alexis, are you there?

2299
02:04:08,400 --> 02:04:10,960
So, Daniel, how's it going?

2300
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:14,520
Are you.

2301
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:15,840
I didn't know you were in the class.

2302
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:18,000
That's the school

2303
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:24,760
which my Levins

2304
02:04:45,560 --> 02:04:47,760
is two likes.

2305
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:52,800
231 or look for 231.

2306
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:55,320
So 4231.

2307
02:04:55,320 --> 02:04:55,960
Okay.

2308
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:58,080
Bug create by not working.

2309
02:04:58,080 --> 02:04:59,600
Let's take a look.

2310
02:05:00,640 --> 02:05:03,160
Let's take a look at this. Bug

2311
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:07,200
user opens website zero

2312
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:10,480
stuff surfaces.

2313
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:11,520
Oh no.

2314
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:15,240
We're working on the syntax website,
the actual syntax one page

2315
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:18,200
and we're finding a bug
if you can link any bug there

2316
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:23,080
and, you're trying to reproduce it. Got.

2317
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:28,520
So go to the actual syntax website
like this website right here.

2318
02:05:28,520 --> 02:05:31,520
And everyone's trying to, to, to look up

2319
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:35,360
lookup bugs. Okay

2320
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,160
so let's see.

2321
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:39,440
I'm just thinking I'm just going let's see

2322
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:45,440
Christine, did I tell Christine
to move this over to the dump column or.

2323
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:47,440
No, I don't think so. Right.

2324
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:49,960
I don't think I did that.

2325
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:53,760
I, I don't, I don't remember.

2326
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:57,800
I don't, I don't remember.

2327
02:05:57,920 --> 02:05:58,640
Does this doesn't mean that

2328
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:02,640
Christine possibly did something
she wasn't supposed to do,

2329
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:04,320
right?

2330
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,840
Maybe

2331
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:09,240
they maybe so.

2332
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:12,440
243. All right, let's take a look.

2333
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:16,720
Let's take a look.

2334
02:06:16,720 --> 02:06:18,160
Just just move it back.

2335
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:21,120
You can move the Take it back.

2336
02:06:21,120 --> 02:06:22,120
Move back.

2337
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,200
Okay. Login button.

2338
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:26,200
Not working.

2339
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:31,440
Let's take a look.

2340
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:35,520
But just Dexcom.

2341
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,600
So this is a bug.

2342
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:39,960
Then What we're trying to do
then is we're trying to.

2343
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:41,920
We're trying to find the real bug.

2344
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,800
So you actually going

2345
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:46,600
to the syntax website,
you actually go in to the syntax website

2346
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,960
and you're trying to see
if you can find the bug.

2347
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,800
Okay, that's what you're doing.

2348
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:54,480
So you have the URL right and everything.

2349
02:06:54,480 --> 02:06:57,320
We already shared it.

2350
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:59,640
Can someone share the URL again
that we need?

2351
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:03,920
You're going to go to the syntax website
and you're going to actually try to find

2352
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:04,920
a real bug

2353
02:07:06,160 --> 02:07:09,400
to be a real, real bug.

2354
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:13,240
Let's take a look to 42.

2355
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:16,440
So look at what guys the sample

2356
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:19,560
bug ticket
name should not be on the ticket name.

2357
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:24,200
I just wrote that so that you guys
can find my ticket in case you needed help

2358
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:26,680
writing the ticket. Thank.

2359
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:29,840
So don't copy
the sample bug keywords, just

2360
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:31,680
change it.

2361
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:39,200
So in the build,
let's see what the bill says here.

2362
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:42,840
I don't see a description of this,
so it says there's not a slow

2363
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:46,320
in page loading navigate to syntax atrium
runs website.

2364
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:51,280
Enter this click on logged by an accepted
result page opens immediately.

2365
02:07:52,080 --> 02:07:55,160
Page does not open the actual time
approximately

2366
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:58,040
2 minutes browser Internet explorer

2367
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:02,280
time 850 day 20 Right.

2368
02:08:02,280 --> 02:08:04,720
That's really good. That's a good stuff.

2369
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:07,600
My question is going to be like,
did you test as in Chrome?

2370
02:08:07,880 --> 02:08:10,840
Did you test as in Firefox? Did you test?

2371
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:13,200
Is it in Safari? If you have Safari,

2372
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,880
did you or did you not?

2373
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:17,200
Right.

2374
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:21,600
So these questions will come up.

2375
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:24,800
Okay. So there you go. This is good.

2376
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:28,080
So once you are on the bill, go ahead

2377
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:31,320
and move your ticket to the done column.

2378
02:08:31,320 --> 02:08:33,000
This is good.

2379
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,600
Very good. Very good. Very good.

2380
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:35,640
Just make the changes.

2381
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:38,680
It's a done column
and then they will, Christine.

2382
02:08:38,680 --> 02:08:41,680
They move the ticket back as Christine
take it back.

2383
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:43,800
Very good,
Christine Friday, I'm so proud of you.

2384
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:46,960
So the thing is,

2385
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:49,680
Sorbonne, let's see this.

2386
02:08:49,680 --> 02:08:51,480
This ticket looks interesting.

2387
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:53,400
This bug was innocent.

2388
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:58,320
We had a Chrome browser
navigate to E shop and mobile. Now.

2389
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:00,640
So one safari there might

2390
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:04,560
so run it.

2391
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:07,280
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

2392
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:09,080
Have everyone's attention, please.

2393
02:09:09,080 --> 02:09:10,800
Everyone's attention, please.

2394
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:12,480
Can I have everyone's attention, please.

2395
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:14,200
Can everyone's attention please.

2396
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:16,520
Everyone's attention

2397
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:18,960
is everyone's in the screen, right?

2398
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:23,560
So we're actually

2399
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:26,720
using the real Syntax website.

2400
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:29,040
We're not going to another website, guys.

2401
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:33,640
We are going to the syntax
a mess website, this application,

2402
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,600
and we are trying to find real bugs.

2403
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:39,200
We're trying to find real bugs.

2404
02:09:39,960 --> 02:09:42,400
Okay, So that's what we're doing.

2405
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:45,480
All right, so you're going to

2406
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:48,720
another website here, so

2407
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:49,960
your bug looks nice.

2408
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:51,680
Okay, I'll tell you that.

2409
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:54,240
But it's not the syntax HMS application.

2410
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:57,440
It's like you working at Google,
but you're reporting an Amazon bug.

2411
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:03,840
You know, So, yeah, let's see.

2412
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:05,640
Let's see.

2413
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:08,720
Sahay Morano, 31.

2414
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:10,960
Isaiah It's 31.

2415
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:13,680
So where are you from? Ukraine.

2416
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:14,520
Russia

2417
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:20,280
is right here.

2418
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:21,320
Okay, cool.

2419
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:24,240
Let's see.

2420
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:27,680
Ukraine.

2421
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:30,280
This reminds me of
that boxer that just won the

2422
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:33,640
was the
best heavyweight boxer in the world.

2423
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:34,680
What's the name?

2424
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:37,200
Alexandre used to is from Ukraine.

2425
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:42,000
It's really good, right?

2426
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:46,960
His I really, really like that guy
so this is above

2427
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:51,160
and says the user is logged in

2428
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:55,080
as an admin as an add user page.

2429
02:10:55,080 --> 02:11:00,360
So this is saying that I'm logged in
as an admin, which I am.

2430
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:06,120
And on the add user page,
where is the add user page?

2431
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:07,960
Where's the add user page?

2432
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:10,080
I cannot find it.

2433
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:13,560
So from here go not there.

2434
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:16,720
Oh, did I just show you another bug of no.

2435
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,840
That I show you another blog.

2436
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:21,120
Those are supposed to happen

2437
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:22,360
that going to show it again.

2438
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:24,000
But that was about

2439
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:29,480
so it says okay,
let me go back to the ticket.

2440
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:33,160
So system user

2441
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:37,080
open link in the tab.

2442
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:40,680
Okay, so we provided a link

2443
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:42,400
steps to fill out the necessary

2444
02:11:42,400 --> 02:11:46,600
information, start, interrupt
as is required,

2445
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:50,120
password alerts will appear and disappear
correctly one by one.

2446
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:52,080
That's great.

2447
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:55,160
What does it mean?

2448
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:57,120
What does it mean

2449
02:12:01,040 --> 02:12:06,160
that what is x?

2450
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:07,000
What is

2451
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:12,760
you mean actual results?

2452
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:15,000
Like can I change this to actual results?

2453
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:16,520
Are you okay with that

2454
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:21,120
system changes to the actual results

2455
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:25,160
because that's how he reported his bug.

2456
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:27,000
So password alerts

2457
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,840
will appear and disappear one by one.

2458
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:33,920
Passwords are overlapping,
passwords are overlapping ones.

2459
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:36,600
And so he said insert this employee name

2460
02:12:37,960 --> 02:12:40,720
some tests.

2461
02:12:40,920 --> 02:12:43,360
Why is it,
oh, did I just show you another bug?

2462
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:46,200
But I think I showed you another bug.

2463
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:46,760
Right.

2464
02:12:47,160 --> 02:12:48,120
You see this?

2465
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:55,480
I enter testing tests, which can be
a real name, but it's saying invalid.

2466
02:12:55,480 --> 02:12:57,760
What is the problem with this? Right.

2467
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:01,800
So employee name and

2468
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:13,800
okay is still saying invalid
that I just find another bug.

2469
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:15,080
Yes I did.

2470
02:13:15,080 --> 02:13:17,720
I just found another bug.

2471
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:19,320
The password for a strong password.

2472
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:21,000
Please use a hard just to combine.

2473
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:21,240
Okay.

2474
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:31,440
I'm going the sixth.

2475
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:32,000
Okay.

2476
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,360
I'm getting error message when I should
and because it says

2477
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:37,240
should have at least eight characters.

2478
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:40,160
But there's more than eight here
that I just find another bug.

2479
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:43,200
Probably.

2480
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:44,520
Good job.

2481
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:45,720
That's not bad, sir.

2482
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:49,080
Hey, move your ticket
over to the dumb column.

2483
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:52,920
But I did just find three other bugs
so you can report those if you need

2484
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:54,560
to count.

2485
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:58,320
Parts of you need right to.

2486
02:13:58,440 --> 02:14:03,520
I'm logged in here to close this.

2487
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,760
The job. Sorry. Job.

2488
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,920
So let's see.

2489
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:13,920
Two 6102 62.

2490
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:14,480
So it was.

2491
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,120

2492
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:22,800
cancel button issue.

2493
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:27,360
The user is logged in as add
user on service already.

2494
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:28,560
So this

2495
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:32,280
we are to 62 right here.

2496
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:35,400
So users name and password

2497
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,640

2498
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:39,800

So you may want to change that, right?
You will want to change that.

2505
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:06,960
So is this welcome.

2506

So welcome

2507
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:13,640
Okay, so user clicks change

2508
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:25,360
password, but it's going to take a while.

2509
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:28,680
User clicks on cancel bunch of close

2510
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,800
cancel
one doesn't work to execute the process.

2511
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:32,280
All right.

2512
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:35,160
Let's see that to cancel.

2513
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:40,800
Oh, so now this is not about this is not.

02:15:54,360 --> 02:16:00,040
Oh, yeah, that is true.

2518
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:02,280

That's a very good logging.

2533
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:44,640
Good.

2534
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:49,560
Good at the menu on the top left
tried to click on performance, but

2535
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:56,560
start to click on the performance button.

2536
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:58,720
I want to click on it

2537
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:01,440
to performance change color to gray,

2538
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:05,640
but it does not lead us to the specific
page.

2539
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:07,080
Let's see. I clicked it

2540
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:11,200
there.

2541
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:14,400
Let's see.

2542
02:17:14,400 --> 02:17:21,880
It's taken a long time to load.

2543
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:22,400
All right.

2544
02:17:22,400 --> 02:17:25,520
So let's I'm going to look at this later

2545
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:27,560
because, yes, you guys are

2546
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:30,640
is a good let me ask you this.

2547
02:17:30,640 --> 02:17:34,560
How do you guys feel creating bugs,
looking for bugs on the application?

2548
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:35,160
Right.

2549
02:17:35,760 --> 02:17:37,120
A lot of these bugs are good.

2550
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:39,480
I just wish I could go faster, but

2551
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:45,680
this is not even loading for me anymore.

2552
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:47,840
A lot of this, a lot of these are good.

2553
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:52,200
A lot of you guys added screenshots, a
lot of information, everything like that.

2554
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:54,840
How do you guys feel,
What do you guys think?

2555
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:56,280
Was it was it good?

2556
02:17:56,280 --> 02:18:00,160
Was it?

2557
02:18:00,160 --> 02:18:01,160
You cannot open the page.

2558
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:04,040
Neither can I.

2559
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:06,960
But did you guys see how you guys reported
the bugs

2560
02:18:07,160 --> 02:18:10,520
and I was following
what you're saying Step by step.

2561
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:11,400
Right.

2562
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:13,760
So That is

2563
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:16,920
something that everyone will do
in the projects at work.

2564
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:20,520
This is why you have to be

2565
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:22,480
as detailed as possible.

2566
02:18:22,480 --> 02:18:24,640
Okay. To edit.

2567
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:26,520
Is it like the same?

2568
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:27,440
Can you repeat the question?

2569
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:30,360
Christine to edit isn't same like task

2570
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:34,360
as I mean, let's

2571
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:40,040
something happen to my idea

2572
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:41,760
to edit bug what is the question.

2573
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:45,480
Don't Christine I don't get to all to edit

2574
02:18:45,480 --> 02:18:49,200
the bug is the same like test yes

2575
02:18:49,320 --> 02:18:50,000
okay.

2576
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:53,760
Yep so all right guys
how do you guys feel?

2577
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:55,200
That was good, right?

2578
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:57,960
We're hands on

2579
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:02,640
everything right?

2580
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:06,200
We're very good. Awesome.

2581
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:09,240
Right?

2582
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:11,240
HMS based, not even open.

2583
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:12,680
Of course it's a bug.

2584
02:19:12,680 --> 02:19:15,480
If it doesn't open, of course
it's a bug, right?

2585
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:19,440
Even though it's a performance
issue, it's a bug which is still reported.

2586
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:21,000
So very, very good.

2587
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,080
You guys, guys,
give yourselves a round of applause.

2588
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:25,760
This was JIRA. You guys did great.

2589
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:27,720
You guys does great.

2590
02:19:27,720 --> 02:19:32,720
And then later, throughout the course,
you will.

2591
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:34,320
You guys will do much, much better.

2592
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:36,640
We want to revisit this
and so forth. Okay.

2593
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:40,520
You guys will do a project
at the end of class

2594
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:45,120
and then you guys will do a big project

2595
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:48,120
like every batch
and you guys will also just go for that.

2596
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:51,000
So you guys will have your practice
and everything.

2597
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,760
That cool. All right.

2598
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:55,120
So that's to come later

2599
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:58,760
in the class plot point
is that those topics will be revisited.

2600
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:00,760
Okay, cool.

2601
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:03,840
But we good? Are we got it.

2602
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:04,200
All right.

2603
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:08,680
We don't want to make tomorrow late
for class, so let's get this thing going

2604
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:11,600
right.

2605
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:15,640
You guys ready?

2606
02:20:15,640 --> 02:20:18,520
Are you ready?

2607
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:34,680
Yikes.

Late for work.

02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:37,080
I mean, late for work.

2610
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:37,760
My bet.

2611
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:41,280

02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:51,480
No, no. Are you. Are you in or what?

2798
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:53,120
We're waiting for you.

2799
02:31:53,440 --> 02:31:59,760
It seems in.

2800
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:02,920
It thinks you enter are probably

2801
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:04,320
okay. I'm going to start this.

2802
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:06,680
If it is,
are we good now? All Are we good?

2803
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,160
Are you there

2804
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:14,120
waiting for.

2805
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:18,720
No, no to say something.

2806
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:19,080
Hello?

2807
02:32:19,080 --> 02:32:21,720
No, no rain for you

2808
02:32:25,960 --> 02:32:26,640
there.

2809
02:32:26,640 --> 02:32:32,160
No. Okay, you're in.

2810
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:33,360
You're in. That's fine.

2811
02:32:33,360 --> 02:32:33,760
That's it.

2812
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:36,920
Ready?

2813
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:37,560
All right. Ready,

2814
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,840
set and

2815
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:44,600
easy.

2816
02:32:44,600 --> 02:32:46,760
So, guys, squad games.

2817
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:47,760
Okay, Ready, set.

2818
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:49,360
And you go

2819
02:32:53,720 --> 02:32:54,040
equal.

2820
02:32:54,760 --> 02:32:57,960
Pay attention.

2821
02:32:57,960 --> 02:32:59,000
Still. See?

2822
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,040
Oh, guys, I think it's

2823
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:04,200
a support testing life center.

2824
02:33:05,080 --> 02:33:07,600
That's what I think.

2825
02:33:07,600 --> 02:33:10,440
Actually, I would probably pick
the software testing life table.

2826
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:11,760
That makes more sense.

2827
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:14,920
I think. I think so.

2828
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:22,560
So one of those two for sure.

2829
02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:29,400
So we chose the software test center,

2830
02:33:29,400 --> 02:33:31,920
so they show who answered those questions
incorrectly.

2831
02:33:33,240 --> 02:33:38,600
I was on their man.

2832
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:41,040
All right.

2833
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:41,520
Okay.

2834
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:44,040
We have Merriam on top of the podium.

2835
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:45,480
We have two winners.

2836
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:48,000
Second place or my Dominic and Louis.

2837
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,520
It's not it's not bad.

2838
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:51,600
Not bad at all.

2839
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:54,960
Okay, so Mariam,
who's married, by the way, is married.

2840
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:57,080
Oh, marry him from Maryland. Wow.

2841
02:33:57,920 --> 02:33:59,320
That's. That's impressive.

2842
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:01,960
Okay, whatever the rest.

2843
02:34:01,960 --> 02:34:03,240
I don't see Aisha here.

2844
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:04,200
I don't see Alan.

2845
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:06,320
What happened?
Everyone was scared of Alan.

2846
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:06,960
Right.

2847
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:07,440
Ready?

2848
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:12,720
Here we go.

2849
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:13,640
Testing hard.

2850
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:16,280
You have environments, is

2851
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:17,960
all this is.

2852
02:34:17,960 --> 02:34:19,080
I think we.

2853
02:34:19,080 --> 02:34:20,920
We about this a lot.

2854
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:24,760
I think it's stage
four is right guys I think is like stage

2855
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:29,160
acceptance royalty and then it goes to the

2856
02:34:29,880 --> 02:34:32,240
and then it goes to a

2857
02:34:34,520 --> 02:34:36,360
all my guys

2858
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:40,440
7 seconds six, five, four, three

2859
02:34:41,040 --> 02:34:45,880
two, one.

2860
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:47,520
Very good

2861
02:34:47,720 --> 02:34:48,720
very, very good.

2862
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:51,720
For those of you guys, we don't start
testing on the stage environment.

2863
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:53,360
Right. Where were those?

2864
02:34:53,360 --> 02:34:53,680
Right.

2865
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:56,640
What is who does the testing first
and in what environment.

2866
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,360
Right.

2867
02:34:58,040 --> 02:35:01,200
And who does the testing first.

2868
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:04,280
Who does who does the testing first.

2869
02:35:04,280 --> 02:35:09,120
That's do right does do right and does
and what environment do they tested

2870
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:13,960
right in the dev environment.

2871
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:14,920
Right. Exactly.

2872
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:17,280
And they do unit testing there. Right.

2873
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:19,960
So why would they
why would stage come first?

2874
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:21,640
That's All right.

2875
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:24,440
So that's okay.

2876
02:35:24,920 --> 02:35:26,000
Let's see

2877
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:28,720
how name is on top.

2878
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:30,360
Louis, What happened?

2879
02:35:30,360 --> 02:35:32,280
Dominic happened.

2880
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:34,680
Guys, we got to kind of Ellen's up.

2881
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:37,320
He bumped up to second place, his second

2882
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,520
in the podium to mine.

2883
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:42,600
I Don't see your name.
I don't see your name. Yeah.

2884
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:46,560
Okay, so the goal is to get rid of Mariam.

2885
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,720
Okay, Ready?

2886
02:35:49,160 --> 02:35:50,040
So true.

2887
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:54,000
Or False black box test requires
internals of the application.

2888
02:35:54,720 --> 02:35:58,080
I'm going to say yes, obviously.

2889
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:02,280
Yes, I think I'm gonna say yes.

2890
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:05,600
It's 8 seconds.

2891
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:08,080
7 seconds, 6 seconds, five,

2892
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:11,320
four, three, two.

2893
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:15,000
I'm going to say no.

2894
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,080
It's very, very good. Very good.

2895
02:36:19,240 --> 02:36:19,560
Black

2896
02:36:19,560 --> 02:36:23,440
box testing requires sense of what
type of testing requires

2897
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:27,640
internal of the application.

2898
02:36:27,640 --> 02:36:30,160
White box testing right there. Good.

2899
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:31,640
You guys ready?

2900
02:36:32,160 --> 02:36:34,400
Let's see. What do we have here?

2901
02:36:34,400 --> 02:36:37,080
Okay, Ellen moved up to first place,

2902
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:39,480
ma'am, is by second by two points.

2903
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:42,640
Sebas off I shot from Florida.

2904
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:45,560
Why don't we see ice here from Fairfax?

2905
02:36:45,560 --> 02:36:48,520
Okay, Ready Sebas Whoa.

2906
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:50,800
Who's the boss? Came out of nowhere.
Ready?

2907
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:53,440
Here we go.

2908
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:54,240
Here we go.

2909
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:54,680
Ready?

2910
02:36:54,680 --> 02:36:57,000
Said why box testing is done by joint
thrusters.

2911
02:36:57,440 --> 02:36:59,640
Absolutely, Yes, I'm going to say no.

2912
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:01,680
I think.

2913
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:05,200
I think it's. Yes, my guys.

2914
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:12,160
You guys, help me out here.

2915
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:18,120
So is that no or yes.

2916
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:21,480
Guys, we just had this question last.

2917
02:37:21,480 --> 02:37:24,280
Guys, we just had this question last.

2918
02:37:24,280 --> 02:37:26,400
Right. Why? But I even told you why.

2919
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:29,680
Box testing requires
internal knowledge of the application.

2920
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:32,880
Who knows that the developers do it right?

2921
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:35,360
So is it done by testers?

2922
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:37,160
No. Right.

2923
02:37:37,160 --> 02:37:39,720
Oh My goodness, guys,
we can actually sell this.

2924
02:37:39,720 --> 02:37:40,680
No way.

2925
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:42,840
Okay, Just keep this between us, okay?

2926
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,800
Keep this between us.

2927
02:37:44,800 --> 02:37:46,600
We can't show some of this in red.

2928
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:49,280
So let's see what we have here.

2929
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:54,720
Oh, I ship from
Florida comes Alexis is of third place.

2930
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:56,800
You get a Dominic

2931
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:59,800
is up okay
Dominic made it back to the podium, guys.

2932
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:01,360
All right.

2933
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:01,920
By the way,

2934
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:06,000
I forgot to mention the second, third,
second and third place Also got a gift.

2935
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:06,800
All right

2936
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:11,160
you got to do that,
I said don't tell them.

2937
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:16,400
So the way it works is
you can still be in last place and.

2938
02:38:16,400 --> 02:38:18,040
You can catch up all the way to first.

2939
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:22,040
That's how it works
and that's how it works this way.

2940
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:24,240
It doesn't
mean you're going to be in last place.

2941
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:25,360
So I shall. From Florida.

2942
02:38:25,360 --> 02:38:29,040
Very good.

2943
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:31,920
Smoke testing and request
regression testing are the same.

2944
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:34,960
Yes, I think so.

2945
02:38:34,960 --> 02:38:38,480
Actually, I remember this

2946
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:40,320
maybe probably

2947
02:38:42,360 --> 02:38:44,160
8 seconds, seven, seven,

2948
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:47,640
six, five, four, three.

2949
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:52,760
Just.

2950
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:54,120
But thank goodness

2951
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:56,760
that.

2952
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:57,640
Very good.

2953
02:38:58,520 --> 02:39:00,640
Okay, so Dominic is gone.

2954
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:03,760
Alexa still in third
eye shut and Florida stays on top.

2955
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:05,560
There's not anymore.

2956
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:06,320
There's not a worse.

2957
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:09,600
The question is supposed to be blank

2958
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:10,280
ready

2959
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:14,960
whenever they're ready.

2960
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:17,120
True or false? Ad hoc testing.

2961
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:19,040
It also known as exploratory test.

2962
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:21,320
Who likes exploring?

2963
02:39:21,320 --> 02:39:22,920
I don't think that's true.

2964
02:39:22,920 --> 02:39:26,240
Maybe it is. No, I don't know.

2965
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:29,480
What would you guys chance
if someone tells the answer

2966
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:42,000
to very, very good

2967
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,280
very, very, very, very good.

2968
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:46,240
Okay.

2969
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:46,920
Okay,

2970
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:49,320
I'm ready.

2971
02:39:49,320 --> 02:39:52,560
So let's see what's up with this.

2972
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:54,600
Joseph makes it.

2973
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:57,240
We have yet to offer it.

2974
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:59,280
I saw Joseph is there.

2975
02:39:59,280 --> 02:39:59,840
Joseph are.

2976

2985
02:40:28,120 --> 02:40:31,360
All right, I Don't want to let us know.

2986
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:35,160
These are her pluses.

2987
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:37,400
Very good for the 50 people.

2988
02:40:37,400 --> 02:40:39,880
What primitive data types

2989
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:44,280
and boolean floats.

2990
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:45,840
Bytes.

2991
02:40:46,520 --> 02:40:48,960
What else?

2992
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:51,040
Char long

2993
02:40:52,600 --> 02:40:54,120
double Wonderful.

2994
02:40:54,120 --> 02:40:55,520
Very, very good.

2995
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:57,840
Okay, Very good.

2996
02:40:58,360 --> 02:40:59,560
Very good.

2997
02:41:00,800 --> 02:41:01,280
Yeah.

2998
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:03,480

3000
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:08,840
Welcome to the podium.

3001
02:41:08,840 --> 02:41:11,120
It isn't third place now but

3002
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:14,680
to get it isn't so and and

3003
02:41:17,040 --> 02:41:18,040

02:41:18,040 --> 02:41:19,680
Okay, this is interesting.

3005
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:21,640
It's going to get interesting.

3006
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:24,320
Okay, ready?

3007
02:41:24,320 --> 02:41:27,480
Small testing
is execution of lightweight test.

3008
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:31,160
I don't think so,
but I'm keeping my opinions

3009
02:41:31,160 --> 02:41:32,280
to myself

3010
02:41:36,400 --> 02:41:37,600
right now.

3011
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:40,280
I'm going to.

3012
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:41,280
What would you guys choose

3013
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:47,680
then?

3014
02:41:48,280 --> 02:41:49,640
This is. That's

3015
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:56,360
what happened, guys.

3016
02:41:56,360 --> 02:41:58,240
The one Brian

3017
02:41:59,640 --> 02:42:01,080
And what if this was squid games

3018
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:06,840
which click the wrong button on thing
So yikes, the whole podium

3019
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:10,880
changed the whole of your gear doesn't

3020
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:12,240
You can still catch up.

3021
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:14,760
Whoever was at that point,
you guys can still come back up.

3022
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:18,960
We have Joseph Angelica's
in second our hottest now on the podium.

3023
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:21,360
All of us are welcome to the podium.

02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:24,120
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome.

3025
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:29,280
Okay, nine players have reached
answers for.

3026
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:32,440
Okay, Ready? True or false?

3027
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:36,000
Compliance
testing is less important than smoking.

3028
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,080
Testing,

3029
02:42:37,720 --> 02:42:41,280
I must say.

3030
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:42,240
What am I going to say?

3031
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:44,880
I'm going to say

3032
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:49,440
compliance testing,

3033
02:42:49,440 --> 02:42:52,440
which is also known as five way testing.

3034
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:57,960
Right.

3035
02:42:57,960 --> 02:43:00,000
This lesson for it. Very, very good.

3036
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:02,040
It's just as important.

3037
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:03,720
It's very, very, very important.

3038
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:06,840
Okay, let's see what happened here.

3039
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:09,200
The podium stays the same.

3040
02:43:09,200 --> 02:43:11,440
These guys, they know their stuff.
They're not messing around.

3041
02:43:11,440 --> 02:43:14,800
You eat Angelica
Joseph for order, not mess around.

3042
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:15,600
Okay,

3043
02:43:17,040 --> 02:43:19,760
Positive
and negative testing are the same.

3044
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:22,440
I'm going to go With what?

3045
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:23,760
Yes, I think so.

3046
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:28,560
Are they the same, if I'm mistaken?

3047
02:43:28,560 --> 02:43:35,360
Can someone correct me, please,

3048
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:41,880
for two reasons.

3049
02:43:41,880 --> 02:43:42,480
I don't know why.

3050
02:43:42,480 --> 02:43:44,840
I really want to find out
who answered that question.

3051
02:43:46,200 --> 02:43:48,240
I really want to know who.

3052
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:49,920
I just want to know who that was.

3053
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:53,600
But I'm not going to be to do it.

3054
02:43:54,120 --> 02:43:56,040
All these guys are messing around,
but it's okay.

3055
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:57,120
The next question is going to. Right.

3056
02:43:57,120 --> 02:43:59,240
We're not ready. Set. Let's go.

3057
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:03,000
At most project
the testing hierarchy of environment is.

3058
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:06,720
This is a great question, guys I think

3059
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:11,720
and I think I really think
that we start the testing

3060
02:44:11,760 --> 02:44:16,440
in the stage environment.

3061
02:44:16,440 --> 02:44:22,520
Maybe I don't, but

3062
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:25,680
very good.

3063
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:27,200
And I think we had this question.

3064
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:30,360
And so if you got it wrong again,
don't know what's up.

3065
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:36,120
So. Oh, I delegate
Luis on the podium now Louis

3066
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:39,480
welcome very much to welcome welcome,
welcome to the podium.

3067
02:44:39,480 --> 02:44:42,200
Louis Angelica, you're in first place.

3068
02:44:42,240 --> 02:44:43,560
You are the podium.

3069
02:44:43,560 --> 02:44:45,400
All right, let's see you guys ready?

3070
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:47,040
12 of 13.

3071
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:52,360
What's the proper way
to print out a console?

3072
02:44:52,360 --> 02:44:55,680
I think, guys, you're going to ask me
my professional opinion.

3073
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:57,240
I'm going to go with the

3074
02:44:58,680 --> 02:44:59,520
with the

3075
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:04,280
with the rectangular one.

3076
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:10,960
So. All right.

3077
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:13,000
Very, very good.

3078
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:16,520
Right now, let's see to the podium.

3079
02:45:16,520 --> 02:45:18,200
Joseph is up in second place.

3080
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:20,040
Marianne from Maryland made it back.

3081
02:45:20,040 --> 02:45:25,000
Welcome welcome welcome for how this is
is that mesmerized?

3082
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:26,120
Is there

3083
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:31,120
that's okay I said don't worry
you're answered these correctly.

3084
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:32,680
That's okay.

3085
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:33,880
That's right.

3086
02:45:33,880 --> 02:45:36,120
That last question.

3087
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:39,120
What is syntax for main method?

3088
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:45,240
Oh, I think you're going to ask me
for my professional opinion.

3089
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:48,320
I really think it's going to be
the triangle.

3090
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:51,520
I think so.

3091
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:53,920
That's just what I would select.

3092
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:59,520
But I don't know.

3093
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:02,400
She does go

3094
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:06,680
it said Square games.

3095
02:46:06,680 --> 02:46:09,800
All right, So

3096
02:46:10,840 --> 02:46:11,240
tricky.

3097
02:46:11,240 --> 02:46:11,800
Right?

3098
02:46:12,640 --> 02:46:13,040
All right.

3099
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:15,240
Let's see, guys.
