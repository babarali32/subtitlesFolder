1
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,880
All right, guys,

2
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,440
let's get started.

3
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
What's going on, guys?

4
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,440
How's it going?

5
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,320
How's everybody doing?

6
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,120
Good.

7
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,200
Everyone is doing good.

8
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:50,640
Nice.

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,880
Okay.

10
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,120
I'm doing good.

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
Thank you, guys.

12
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,000
Hopefully you guys completed the homework

13
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,200
and created some functions.

14
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,640
Right with to open and close the browsers.

15
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,280
The common methods that we talked about

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,280
last class.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,240
Okay, good.

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,320
How is everyone feeling, guys?

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,160
Is everyone tired?

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:31,040
What's going on, guys?

21
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Everyone is good.

22
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,640
Ready to learn? Okay, that's good.

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,120
Okay, so we're almost there, right, guys?

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,280
So there are probably three or four,

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,400
four classes left for us in selenium.

26
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,400
Little bit overwhelmed. Okay, that's fine.

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
So that's.

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,240
That's what happens, right?

29
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,280
Yeah, we have

30
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,920
we have probably four more classes.

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,200
Okay.

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,360
I mean, three, three selenium classes
and one more.

33
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,960
I'm going to go over the page
object model design.

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,320
And that's how you guys are going to start
with your framework.

35
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,600
Okay.

36
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,120
And then you're going

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,040
to start with this and G
and then you will start with Cucumber.

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,600
Okay, So three more classes to go.

39
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,840
Okay, Couple more topics to cover.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,800
So hopefully you guys in a good mood.

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,840
It happens that
you guys are going to get overwhelmed.

42
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,480
Okay. It's okay.

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,720
Just a little more push, right?

44
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,400
And we're going to be finished
by the end of the year.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,080
Okay.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
Okay.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:55,040
Any questions before we get started, guys?

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
Not really, no.

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,040
I mean, in testing
G testing G is a different tool, right?

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,440
So test and G, what you're going to do
is you're going to integrate it with Java.

51
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,240
And so so you're still going to be using
Java and Selenium at the same time.

52
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,200
And you will add test and G on top.

53
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,480
Okay.

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,080
So Test G has its own features
that you're going to be using

55
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,720
along with Selenium and Java.

56
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,960
Okay.

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,600
So remember guys, when you started,
you started with one tool, which is Java,

58
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,400
and then you added selenium,
you're adding test and G now

59
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,080
and then you're going to be adding
cucumber, you're going to be adding Maven,

60
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,560
and then you will

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,200
be learning sequel
API testing and everything.

62
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:40,920
Okay.

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,120
So it's basically
a lot of different combinations of tools.

64
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,960
Okay.

65
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,760
This, Angie is a framework, right?

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,720
It's a library as well. Okay.

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,160
So it's a library like, like selenium.

68
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,360
It has its own, not the methods

69
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,560
because testing G
is consisted of annotations.

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,480
Okay,
I won't probably teach any other subject.

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,840
Okay. So selenium.

72
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:15,080
I used to teach cucumber as well,
but not this time.

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,760
It's going to be different,
different combinations. Okay.

74
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,400
So that's how you, you, you form
your your framework.

75
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,400
Okay.

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,760
It's not just Java and Selenium
and you go test everything.

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:31,400
You're going to be having different
different tools, integrate them between

78
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,320
between each other,
and then you're going to form

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,120
a complete framework.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,520
All right.

81
00:05:44,760 --> 00:06:02,520
Any other questions
before we get started, guys?

82
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,000
Face some technical questions. Right.
Okay.

83
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,360
So let's go over our sets
and compare it to selenium.

84
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,800
It's a completely different tool.

85
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay? It's a completely different tool.

86
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,160
It's based on annotations.

87
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,680
So in testing G, you're not going to have
main methods, guys.

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,600
Okay.

89
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,480
It has a different execution point,
but that's going to be

90
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,920
the major difference
between selenium and test engineer.

91
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,480
Okay.

92
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,240
So right
now, in order for us to run anything

93
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,680
in any classes, what we have is
we have our main method, right?

94
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
So which is our execution point.

95
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,680
So in testing, you won't have it.

96
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,240
It has a different execution point.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,680
Okay.

98
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,320
All right.

99
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,160
So let's start. Right.

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,480
Okay.

101
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,080
So let's do a quick recap what we've done
last class, guys, and what we covered.

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,920
Last class.

103
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,600
What did we cover?

104
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:12,720
Last class, guys.

105
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,840
Let's see.

106
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,240
Okay. Weights and web tables, Right.

107
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, So what did we
what do we know about weights, guys?

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Weights in selenium?

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,040
What kind of weights do we have?

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,320
Okay, three types of weights,

111
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,640
implicit, explicit and alone weight.

112
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,240
Right.

113
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,200
All right.

114
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,360
So what do we know about explicit?

115
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:59,840
What is an explicit weight, guys?

116
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,120
Waiting for a condition.

117
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,720
Okay.

118
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
Or condition to be true.

119
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay.

120
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,880
So explicit weight is

121
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,760
used to tell a web driver to wait

122
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,720
for a certain amount of time
and for a certain amount of condition.

123
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,680
Right.

124
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,160
So what is the class that we use
our explicit

125
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,360
weight with

126
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,240
expected conditions.

127
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,880
Class. Right. Okay.

128
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,960
So you set a separate
and independent condition

129
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,840
for some elements
that you want to be visible.

130
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,320
You want to be clickable
or you want to be enabled.

131
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,160
So you are just waiting
for a certain condition.

132
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,920
Right. What about fluid weights, guys?

133
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,840
What do we know about fluent weight?

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,000
Fluid weight is a global weight.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,120
Okay, good.

136
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:24,560
What else?

137
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,440
Time frequency.

138
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,640
Okay, so it's used to tell the web driver

139
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,120
for a certain condition
as well as the frequency

140
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
of the ongoing execution. Right.

141
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,080
So it's not used so often. Yes.

142
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,800
Yes, it is not used so often.

143
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,320
That is correct.

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Okay. So what

145
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,440
what kind of methods does it have, guys?

146
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,680
What is it that we can use

147
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,880
or what is it that we can

148
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,400
implement when we are trying to use

149
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:15,720
fluent way?

150
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,200
What it did last class.

151
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,520
Right, guys?

152
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,320
Okay. Polling.

153
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,560
That's very good.

154
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,880
So you can you can set

155
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,000
polling duration, Right.

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,160
How many seconds you want each iteration
of following to be okay.

157
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,640
What else?

158
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay.

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
So you can ignore some exceptions.

160
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,440
Right.

161
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,160
And you can also set some timeout time.

162
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,520
Right.

163
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,360
For you
can see before throwing an exception.

164
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,000
Exactly.

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,280
So basically,
you're trying to manage some of the

166
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,640
implementation in the execution.

167
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,640
Right. Okay.

168
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,360
All right.

169
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,520
So now let's talk about
let's talk about the Web table.

170
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,240
Okay.

171
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,400
So what did we say about the web tables,
guys?

172
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,800
How many types of web tables do we have?

173
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,120
What is a web table on the Web page?

174
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,760
There are elements, right?

175
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,040
And we got two types. Okay.

176
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,920
So it's a static and dynamic.

177
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,720
Okay.

178
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,680
Okay.

179
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,440
So what's the difference between
static and dynamic web

180
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,560
tables, guys?

181
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
It consists of rows and columns.

182
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,080
That's very good.

183
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,960
Okay.

184
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
Static is fixed. Okay.

185
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,040
So nothing is changing in the static web
table, right?

186
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,440
What about dynamic?

187
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,920
Dynamic.

188
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,680
We have the data changing, right?

189
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,320
So, like,
we've done an example last class, guys,

190
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,720
that that
show that you can click on something,

191
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,960
you can delete some rolls
or you can add more rows, right?

192
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,160
So those web tables,
they are considered as dynamic web tables.

193
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,760
Right?

194
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,120
Okay, good.

195
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,240
So let's see.

196
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,480
Okay.

197
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
Here. Let's see what we have.

198
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,520
All right.

199
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,760
Okay, guys.

200
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,920
So today we are going to do we're going

201
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,880
to be covering a different

202
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,960
a different table,
a different approach to the table.

203
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,760
Okay.

204
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,720
And and we will be covering

205
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,640
calendars at the second half of the class.

206
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,720
Okay.

207
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,640
So if you look at this table,
guys in here,

208
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,000
what do we see?

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,640
So we got what?

210
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,960
Let's go back in here.

211
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,880
So we got five in here, five rows in here.

212
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,280
And then if I click next,
there is another five rows.

213
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,560
If I click next, there is another three.

214
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,440
Anyone knows what this is.

215
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,920
Call one, two, three.

216
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,760
Anyone knows what this is called in ten

217
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,360
pages.

218
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
It's not as almost.

219
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:43,280
Yes sheets.

220
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,600
Not really

221
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,880
X elements.

222
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,840
Okay.

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,280
So Pages is really close
to what it's called.

224
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,680
Okay.

225
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,520
So what does this navigation
bar code, guys?

226
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,840
Anyone knows

227
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,560
Oksana?

228
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,680
Absolutely right.

229
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,720
It is called pagination. Okay.

230
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,600
So in tech, guys,
whenever you hear something

231
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,200
about pagination
that is either called inside the tables

232
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,880
or some of the
some of the pictures are changing greatly.

233
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,000
So if you click next, it
you stay on the same page, guys.

234
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,000
But you are trying to move

235
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,680
to a different different data
or to a different element.

236
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,720
Okay. So this is called pagination.

237
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,160
Okay.
So you were staying on the same page.

238
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,680
We have a table
that only thing that is changing

239
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,840
in here is our table data.

240
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
Okay.

241
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,080
Sounds like a bad word.

242
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,120
Okay. Yeah, well,

243
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,440
that's actually if it is
if it sounds like a bad word,

244
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,400
it's easier to remember, guys.

245
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,720
Okay, so don't forget this.

246
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,360
Okay.

247
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,400
All right, so this is called pagination.

248
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,560
Okay.

249
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,120
So today
we will be working with the tables

250
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,760
which have pagina

251
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,440
and we will be having in a dynamic

252
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,280
script in order to go back and forth
until we have our conditions

253
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,320
or we have the data that we need to find.

254
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,720
Okay.

255
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,520
Is that clear?

256
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,240
Guys, any questions?

257
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:47,280
Okay.

258
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,560
Expected to call them pagination. Yes.

259
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,920
So basically, pagination

260
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,880
is more professional way to call it.

261
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,360
Let's put it this way.

262
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,920
Okay.

263
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,680
So if you say pagination at work
now, they'll all know.

264
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,280
If you say a page, they'll they'll think
it's a complete web page.

265
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,640
Okay.

266
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,520
So pagination
would be a professional approach

267
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,720
to this.

268
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,120
All right, so let's do this.

269
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,440
Right?

270
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,400
So let's go back

271
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,240
to our intelligence.

272
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,080
Let me put it here.

273
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,000
Tables

274
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,600
divided

275
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,800
into several

276
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,080
pages.

277
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,840
Then navigation, bar

278
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
is called

279
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,640
pagination.

280
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Okay. All right.

281
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,400
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to create a new package

282
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:05,360
in here,

283
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,320
and I will be creating a new class.

284
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,720
Okay.

285
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,880
So what I will say with tables, with

286
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,360
pagina is

287
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,720
this.

288
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,160
All right, so let me go back

289
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,080
here and copy this

290
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,920
pasted in here.

291
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,760
And what I will do,
I'm going to change the U around here,

292
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,920
and I'll send the URL to
you guys in a second.

293
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,320
There you go.

294
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,200
All right.

295
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
So now let's get started. Okay.

296
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,320
So what I want to do in here,

297
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,040
so when I navigate to this page, right,
I land in here.

298
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,720
So what I want to do, guys,
I want to go to this second page.

299
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,120
Okay.

300
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,080
I want to go to the second page
and get this row

301
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,680
and print this out inside my console.

302
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,120
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

303
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,720
Any questions?

304
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,760
Okay, good.

305
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,920
All right.

306
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,680
Okay.

307
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,440
So once I navigate to this page,
what is my next step?

308
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,920
And here goes

309
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,480
with finding the elements.

310
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,120
Right. Okay, so let's locate the element.

311
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,520
Let me go ahead and inspect this.

312
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,000
So let's go back in here

313
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,440
and let's expand this a little bit.

314
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,080
And so I have a table, right?

315
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,200
So let's identify this by the class
name in here.

316
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,440
All right.

317
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,280
So copy this

318
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,680
in this up.

319
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,320
We'll see.

320
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,680
What is the shortcut?

321
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm not sure.

322
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,000
I think it's f 12 guys,

323
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,640
if I'm not mistaken, to click on F12,
it should bring up the down.

324
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Okay.

325
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,680
If the page is too slow, that's
because we are all using the same page.

326
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,040
And this is for

327
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,600
and the server is not that powerful.

328
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,440
Okay.

329
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,760
So we're
all using the same server right now.

330
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,280
So that's why it may get a little delayed.

331
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

332
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,040
So that's why
if it's if it's delayed for you guys

333
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,640
so that it doesn't
get delayed on my side just

334
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,880
just follow me right now

335
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,480
how I'm going to implement everything
and then you can type.

336
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,600
Okay.

337
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,280
All right.

338
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,840
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to create a next path for this.

339
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,920
Okay?

340
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,680
So double slash, right?

341
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,840
We have a table in here,

342
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,680
and then we're trying to identify this
by class, right?

343
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,880
So I paste the class in here.

344
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,200
So it's one of one.

345
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,560
Everything is good.

346
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,040
So our table is unique, right?

347
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
So what?

348
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,320
What I need to do next, guys, in here,

349
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,600
let's take a look

350
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,960
at the structure of the table in here.

351
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,720
So where do I have to go
next, guys, in order

352
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:11,640
for me to capture the rows?

353
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,560
T hat
do I have to go to the T hard right guys?

354
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,000
Because

355
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,120
I have t hat antibody,
but the thing that I need

356
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:29,880
is only the rows, right?

357
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:39,720
Is it t body or t hat guys?

358
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,520
Okay, so let's navigate to the t body.

359
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:46,840
Right.

360
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,840
So if we go to the t body and expand
this, we're going to see

361
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,760
all the rows in here, right?

362
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,360
So what I will do slash t body in here

363
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,640
and slash t r right.

364
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,440
How many, how many roles did

365
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,120
I just find guys.

366
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,640
13. Right.

367
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,840
How many are displayed
for me right now, Guys?

368
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,040
Five.

369
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,600
Right.

370
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,160
So if you look at the structure

371
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
of the table in here, guys.

372
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,800
So if you look at the style,
it says display the table row.

373
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,600
Right.

374
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,640
And if you look after the fifth row
display is none.

375
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,640
Okay.

376
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,280
So if I move to the next page in here

377
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,840
and go to the second page of the table
and here

378
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:52,400
you can see that 1 to 5 is getting
this is getting displayed none.

379
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,760
And here it is displaying the table row.

380
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,120
Okay.

381
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,160
I hope you guys see this changes in here.

382
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,720
Okay.

383
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,680
So if I go back, we're getting displayed
in a different set of rows.

384
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,640
And if I if
I change the pagination in here,

385
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,480
you can see that
the display of the rows is changing.

386
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,880
Okay, so let's go ahead and get this.

387
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,760
Okay, So get back in here

388
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,520
and try to try to find these elements.

389
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,040
We're going to have to

390
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,360
store these elements.

391
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:51,000
Guys, inside the array list.

392
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,560
Right.

393
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,440
So list of what guys,
what am I going to have

394
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,280
a container of

395
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,280
list of web elements.

396
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,960
Right. Okay.

397
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,200
So let's create
a list of web elements in here.

398
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,160
So lists of web elements.

399
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,400
So we say table rows, right.

400
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,680
Is equal to let's import this guy

401
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,800
here and let's see for the list

402
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,000
as well from Java utility class.

403
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,680
Right.

404
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,200
And now what we can do driver dot
find elements right

405
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,080
by X path and let's paste this path into

406
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,040
okay.

407
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,080
So line 18, what it does, it gives us 13

408
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,880
rows of that table, right. So

409
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,560
how do I have to

410
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,080
print all of them out? Guys

411
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,520
I to right through them.

412
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,360
Right. Okay.

413
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,720
Or we can simply,
instead of using the iterator,

414
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,560
what we could do,
we can simply use the for the right.

415
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,560
Okay, so how do I,

416
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,600
how do I go ahead and start iterating
and printing everything?

417
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,320
Guys?

418
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,480
So let's print out everything first.

419
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:28,640
How do I do this?

420
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,080
So if I want to print all the rows
right now, what am I going to do?

421
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,880
What is my next step in here

422
00:25:49,080 --> 00:26:07,320
without the iterator?

423
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,920
Or so that's
that's the regular loop that works.

424
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,120
Okay,
so we have the advanced loop as well.

425
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Okay. So for

426
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,640
so we're iterating through each
and every element, right?

427
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,040
Table row and then we're iterating
through the table rows.

428
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,040
Right. Okay, so what do I do next?

429
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,360
So I have my loop.

430
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,760
I start going through the arrows in here.

431
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:48,720
So what I do next?

432
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,800
Okay, so we

433
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,520
need to get the text
and then simply print out.

434
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,600
Right?

435
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
So let's have a

436
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,280
let's say so text is equal to

437
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,440
table row,

438
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,520
get text.

439
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:08,840
Right.

440
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,080
And what I want to do, I want to print

441
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,000
the row text.

442
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,640
Right. Okay.

443
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,120
So now let's go ahead and run this

444
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:30,440
and see what we're going to have.

445
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,320
Okay.

446
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,400
So we're running in here.

447
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,240
Okay, guys, what happened?

448
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,560
Only five was were printed, right?

449
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,160
Only five rows were printed.

450
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,880
Why? Guys?

451
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Because they are visible, right?

452
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,840
Because we then go to the second
and third pages inside the table.

453
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,560
Right.

454
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,800
So they only display in rows.

455
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,600
We have our from 1 to 5
and then you can see

456
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,680
there is this much break in here.

457
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,600
So that means they are empty, Right?

458
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,880
So as you can see in here,
there's no display whatsoever.

459
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,320
So our selenium is not going to see that
until we go to that specific page.

460
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,960
Okay, guys, is that clear?

461
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,720
Okay, good.

462
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,680
So now what I want to do, guys,
I want to click on the next

463
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,680
and get this row eight

464
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,200
and only print this one.

465
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,040
Okay.

466
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,720
But the thing is,
I don't want to have like

467
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,560
we know we're printing row eight,
but what if this guy is moving to row ten?

468
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,360
Okay, so I want to keep our code
as dynamic as possible.

469
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,240
Okay.

470
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,760
So that we can print every time this guy,
no matter

471
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,360
what page this guy is.

472
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,680
Okay,

473
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,440
Is that clear?

474
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:25,320
Guys, any questions on this?

475
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,600
Okay, good.

476
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,240
All right, so let's go ahead

477
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,840
and start doing this.

478
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,400
So the first thing that I want to do
is what goes in here.

479
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,440
So we know

480
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,440
there's one row we want to print, right?

481
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,040
So but how do we get to the other pages,
guys?

482
00:29:48,360 --> 00:30:05,520
How do we keep everything dynamic in here?

483
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,800
Find the elements.

484
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:16,680
Okay, So what element do
we need to find in here?

485
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,400
Pagination.

486
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,520
Okay,
so we need to find which one, one, two

487
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:25,000
or three guys. Two.

488
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:33,320
What if tomorrow is on the third page?

489
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,920
If needed element is not present,
move to the next page.

490
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,240
That's a very good
that's a very good idea.

491
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,520
We need them all. Okay, guys.

492
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,960
So how do we how do we go through

493
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,280
one page
to a to another page without going

494
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,560
without going through 1 to 3?

495
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,920
What if tomorrow we have five pages?

496
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,000
So right now,
if I store one, two, three, tomorrow

497
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,560
I will need to store four or five.

498
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,800
Right. So I am changing my script, right.

499
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,520
So right now,
what is not going to be changing

500
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,800
in this pagination guys

501
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,720
next button and the previous button.

502
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,440
Right.

503
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,440
So the navigation arrows.
Absolutely right.

504
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,480
Okay.

505
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,360
So we don't care
how many pages we have in here.

506
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,680
We know that we can navigate through them
one by one.

507
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:36,840
Right.

508
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:43,560
So what I'm going to do in here,
I am going to locate this next button.

509
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,080
Okay?

510
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,920
And I think we can we can find this

511
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,440
by by the class name in here.

512
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,640
So let's create an X path for this.

513
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,920
Okay? So let's do

514
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,920
a tag.

515
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,680
We have them here at class

516
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,680
is equal to this guy.

517
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,720
Okay?

518
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,920
One of one.

519
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,680
And we can use this X path, right?

520
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,920
Is everyone clear
what I'm doing in here, guys?

521
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:24,480
Am I going too fast?

522
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,320
Okay, cool.

523
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,160
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to copy this X path.

524
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,920
I'm going to go back to our script.

525
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,280
So now what I will do, I will create a web
element purple in here.

526
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,280
Okay?

527
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,960
And I'll say next button, right
is equal to driver

528
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,480
signed element

529
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,160
by X pass

530
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,680
and I will paste that x.

531
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,760
Thank you.

532
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,080
Okay, so now guys,
when do I need to click on the next button

533
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,040
in here

534
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,560
inside the loop?

535
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,920
Okay, so I'm trying when the row is empty.

536
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:24,360
Okay, So I'm trying to find this guy.

537
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,160
So if we don't keep clicking until sound.

538
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,400
Right? So that's a very good

539
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,040
idea.

540
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,560
Okay, so we need to keep clicking
until we find this

541
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,080
specific element, Right?

542
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,560
So how are we going to do this?

543
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,120
Okay, so

544
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,000
it is a little bit of a tricky logic
in here.

545
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,560
Okay, guys, So we know that here, guys,

546
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,560
we have we're getting the text
with printing out the text, right?

547
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,360
What if I want to print only that row?

548
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:12,960
Guys, how am I going to do this?

549
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,680
Okay, so we need an F condition, right?

550
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,600
So, okay,

551
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,240
so if right, we have a row text in here,

552
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,040
we're we need contains.

553
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,280
And then what was the guy's name?

554
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,960
Okay, whatever it is. Right.

555
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,720
So our key J only then what

556
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,680
I am going to do, I am going to go ahead

557
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,000
and print this value right.

558
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
Okay, so I'm looping. Looping.

559
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,480
If I see this, I'm going
to print this guy. Okay,

560
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,560
So now, guys,

561
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,360
what I will do, I need to know

562
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,560
when to click on the next button.

563
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,400
Okay?

564
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,040
So in order to do that, I'm

565
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,840
going to implement
a little bit of a different logic.

566
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,040
Okay.

567
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,000
So what
I am going to do in here before my fault,

568
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,560
I will create a boolean value of a flag.

569
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,800
Okay, so I'll say Boolean flag

570
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,880
is equal to true.

571
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,600
Okay,
so now what I will do before my for loop,

572
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm going to I'm going to create
a wire loop in here.

573
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,560
Okay.

574
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,360
So I'll say why loop?

575
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,360
Okay.

576
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,320
While we have a flag in here.

577
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,520
Okay.

578
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,480
What I'm going to do, I'm going to start

579
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,360
moving.

580
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,240
Okay, Bear with me, guys.

581
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,760
I'll explain the logic one by one.

582
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,760
Okay, so now what I did and here

583
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,040
I created a bull, a Boolean flag,
which is true, right?

584
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,200
And when my flag is true,
I am going to start my iteration.

585
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,600
Okay.

586
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,680
Okay. I'll.

587
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,200
I'll come to your question. Why?

588
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,640
Why not just while true. Okay.

589
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,760
So you will see the difference yourself.
Okay.

590
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,000
Let me finish this and I'll explain it.

591
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,680
Okay.

592
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,680
While the flag is true, okay,
what I'm going to do, I'm going to start

593
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,240
going through each
and every row inside the table, okay?

594
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,200
But then if I go inside the fourth.

595
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,360
Okay, and I don't find anything,
what do I need to do?

596
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,120
Guys, if I don't find this guy,
what do I need to do?

597
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:57,200
Guys, click on the next button.

598
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,080
Right?

599
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,800
So what I will do after the
four, look what I will do.

600
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,840
I will click

601
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,080
on the next button.

602
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,760
But guys,

603
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,640
when I find this guy,
what do I need to do?

604
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,720
Guys, we need to break it.

605
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,480
Very good. Right.

606
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,400
So break in here.

607
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,040
Right. So what did we do right now?

608
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,320
What did I break right now?

609
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:34,560
In here, guys, we broke the fourth loop.

610
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,720
Now what I need to do,
I need to break my wire loop.

611
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,080
How do I break my wild loop?

612
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:44,160
Guys,

613
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,160
my flag needs to be false, right?

614
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,360
Right After I find that row that I need.

615
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,240
What I need to do,
I need to set this flag as false.

616
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,080
Right.

617
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,920
And I think this answers to your question,

618
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,680
Jamal, then, that we cannot
just go ahead and put true in here

619
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,760
because we won't be able to set this
as false.

620
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
Okay.

621
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,040
So that's why I need here
as separate variables

622
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,160
so that I can manipulate the
values inside that wildly.

623
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,560
Is that

624
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:30,120
clear, guys?

625
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,720
Okay, so now, guys, I'm
going through the logic again.

626
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,800
Okay?

627
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,000
So I have a wild loop.

628
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,120
If the flag is true, right?

629
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,480
I'm going inside the table rows.

630
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,000
So I'm.

631
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,880
I'm looping.

632
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,520
If I don't find it what I do,
I click next.

633
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,160
My flag is still true, guys, right?

634
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,080
So if flag is still true,
I am going to the wild loop again.

635
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,240
Okay,
so now that I clicked on the next button,

636
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,520
on what page am I

637
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,040
to write?

638
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,080
So on the second page
I am iterating through the

639
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,560
through the rows again, right?

640
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,360
I get the text
and if I see that this guy is available,

641
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,200
I immediately set my flag as false.

642
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,280
I print out that row text and I break

643
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,400
my for loop.

644
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,760
Is that clear? Guys?

645
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:38,720
Any questions on this?

646
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,760
Yes, we click next.

647
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm coming to that point a little later.

648
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,720
Okay. Why does flag

649
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,840
and course

650
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,880
in here

651
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,280
I'm not really sure

652
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,040
why it has the what's called
it has the underscore, but it's fine.

653
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,000
Guess it's not a big deal

654
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
where I got the name.

655
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,800
It's right here, right on the eighth,
eighth row.

656
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,480
Okay. So what I'm going to do,
let me run this.

657
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,200
Okay, guys, if I run this right now, on
what page On the table pagination,

658
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,120
are we going to end up

659
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,080
the flag is going to be

660
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,480
your your kind of condition.

661
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,000
Okay.

662
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,880
So most of the time, whenever

663
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,400
you need to set some kind of condition
as a Boolean value

664
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,680
like we've done in here,
you want to name it as flag.

665
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,680
Okay.

666
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,080
Because usually flag means red flag
or white flag.

667
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,040
So that's how

668
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,160
it's used in tech as well.

669
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,640
Okay.

670
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:09,640
So if you have some Boolean values
that you want to set it to, true or false,

671
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,360
okay.

672
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,240
Usually with these Boolean values
are going to be

673
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:19,720
named as slot.

674
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,840
Okay. All right.

675
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:33,240
So let me run this.

676
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,840
There we go.

677
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,600
So we end up
we end up on third page, right?

678
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,960
But if we look in the console guys,
we got what we want it,

679
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,240
right? Why?

680
00:41:47,240 --> 00:42:03,120
Why did we end up on the last page
and not the second?

681
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,480
Because the loop is going to end
after we click this, right?

682
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,240
So When I'm here, when
my condition is met, the flag is false.

683
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:19,440
We print the value, we break the loop,
but we still inside the Y loop, right?

684
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,720
So we need to click on this.

685
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,560
So how do I avoid to click this
and stay on the second page? Guys

686
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,800
in for loop?

687
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,760
So if I put it in for loop guys,
what's going to happen?

688
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,320
If I put it inside the for loop?

689
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:57,520
What's going to happen in here guys?

690
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,680
It's not going to work, right?

691
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,160
Because it's going to click
on the next button after each row.

692
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,000
Okay?

693
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,240
So after each iteration,
it will need to click

694
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,000
the next button

695
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,680
so that if condition

696
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,160
is really good guys, but

697
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,280
we don't have to break in there, right?

698
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,680
So in what condition am I clicking on

699
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,040
the next button? Does

700
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,400
when out of for loop?

701
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Okay.

702
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,000
But sometimes when I'm out of for loop,
I don't want to click

703
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,440
right

704
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,640
like we have at the last iteration.

705
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,840
So I'm out of for loop,
but I don't want to click on next button.

706
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:05,600
So how do I avoid this?

707
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,760
Any suggestions guys?

708
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,760
Any thoughts?

709
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,840
Okay. Seems like not.

710
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,560
That's fine. So

711
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,320
the only

712
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,160
time that I want to click on
the next button

713
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,360
is the same time
when I get inside the y loop.

714
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,440
Guys, right?

715
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,640
Whenever my while,
whenever my flag is true.

716
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,920
Only then what I'm going to do,

717
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,320
I'm going to click on next button.

718
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:41,680
Okay?

719
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,240
So what I will do, I will
simply do is flag in here.

720
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,600
Go ahead

721
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,880
and click on this.

722
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,360
Right.

723
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,040
Because on my second iteration,
when I find this,

724
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,520
my flag is already what guys,

725
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,880
my flag is already false.

726
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,240
So if I go out of the loop,
what is my flag right now?

727
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,960
My flag is false
and this guy is stating that it is true.

728
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,640
Okay.

729
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,120
So that's why
what we want to do, we want to go ahead

730
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:35,160
and well, in order
for you to break the while, the right

731
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:42,480
you need to set the condition as false.

732
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,080
Okay.

733
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:48,880
So in y loop,
you can't use the word right.

734
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,720
Okay.

735
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,440
So y loop is based on the conditions.

736
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,640
Okay, guys.

737
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,920
So that's why inside the Y loop in here,

738
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,400
what we have

739
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,120
in here is the

740
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,200
we have a condition, right?

741
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,920
And inside the iterator guys, remember,
each dot has next.

742
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:16,560
What is it?

743
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,200
It's a it's a boolean value, right?

744
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,640
If if, if that has next is true,

745
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,400
only then you're stepping inside that one.

746
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,680
Okay, So if I run this right now,
what's going to happen, guys in here?

747
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,720
Am I going to still

748
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,400
end up on the

749
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,320
on the third page

750
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:45,480
or the second one?

751
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:45,920
Okay.

752
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,400
So it seems like everybody
ran already, right?

753
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,640
So let's run this

754
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,760
and see what's

755
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,240
going to happen.

756
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,440
There you go.

757
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,720
We stopped in here and we're printed out

758
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,440
the row that we need it

759
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:18,800
right?

760
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,760
You can break

761
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,120
y loop with the break.

762
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,960
Okay, Try it. Try it.

763
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,720
But I've never seen anyone
break into y loop with break.

764
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:39,600
Okay.

765
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,560
You can probably do it,
but I don't think so.

766
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,640
Guys.

767
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,440
Oh, you guys did it.

768
00:47:48,440 --> 00:48:01,120
Okay, good.

769
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,920
Okay, If it works.

770
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,400
Nice.

771
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,760
Good.

772
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:24,560
All right, guys, any questions on this?

773
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,160
Our questions.

774
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:40,800
Is everything clear, guys?

775
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,400
Okay. Nice.

776
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,960
All right, so let's go ahead
and do another exam sample in here,

777
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:48,720
okay?

778
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,280
Okay.

779
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,960
All right, So

780
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,960
let's take this here.

781
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,440
All right?

782
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,480
So what I'm going to do is create

783
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,040
a new class.

784
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:18,160
This.

785
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,160
Okay, guys. So the next example.

786
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,840
Okay, so what we're going
to do, we will be having

787
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,480
an example on this application.

788
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,040
Okay, So let's see.

789
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,720
Right.

790
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:50,240
So, man, what was the password?

791
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,320
Okay, I hope you guys all know the

792
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,480
this application right

793
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,720
already.

794
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,720
Okay, So

795
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,400
this thing, when we log

796
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,440
in, I think we're going to be landing
here.

797
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,520
Okay, so what?

798
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,560
We just log in, guys,
we will be logging in

799
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,040
to this specific

800
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,240
of what's called to this specific page.

801
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,840
Right.

802
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,320
So what we need to do

803
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,560
I'm going to go to the PIM.

804
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,800
Okay.

805
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,000
I'm going to go to Pim.

806
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,920
I'll go to

807
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,880
let me see to add employee.

808
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,280
Okay, So what

809
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,400
I'm going to do,
I'm going to add some employee in here

810
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,240
and when I say it's going to navigate me

811
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,640
to the employee list in here.

812
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,280
So you see here we have a huge table.

813
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,640
Okay, So

814
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,320
it's a alphabetic.

815
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,640
It's going to say it's going to get saved
in alphabetical order.

816
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,360
Okay.

817
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,920
So what I want to do when I save that
employee, after I save it,

818
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,320
what I want to do, I want to find this

819
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,480
employee inside this table.

820
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,600
Okay, click

821
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,440
on the checkbox and delete that employee.

822
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,480
Okay?

823
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,160
Is that clear, guys?

824
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:42,680
Any questions?

825
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,200
Okay, so whenever we add

826
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,200
an employee, whenever we add an employee,
you can see that

827
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,440
it might be in a different page as well.

828
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,480
Okay.

829
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,160
So you click on this, it's
going to be the second page and we have

830
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,040
72 pages.

831
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:04,800
Okay?

832
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,440
So all we need to do, we need to find that
employee through the seven from 72 pages

833
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,320
and then start
and then delete that employee.

834
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:15,840
Okay.

835
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,600
So what I would suggest for this example,
just follow me, okay?

836
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,680
Because when I start adding
an employee, guys,

837
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,640
it will add an employee for you as well.

838
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,320
Okay?

839
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,920
If you run it at the same time
as I am doing it.

840
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,080
So this website is going
to get really slow.

841
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,600
Okay. So

842
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,440
if it gets really slow, our

843
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,440
test is going to fail, so you won't see
what is actually going on.

844
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,520
And there might be a lot of different
duplicates as well.

845
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,120
Exactly.

846
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,640
So for right now, just follow me

847
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,600
how I'm going to implement everything
and then you can do it yourself.

848
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,080
Okay? All right.

849
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:05,760
So let's get back in here.

850
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,680
Copy this.

851
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,760
Let's change the URL

852
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,880
incident here.

853
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,520
So now what I need to do is

854
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,240
let's look out.

855
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,440
So what I need to do is
I need to go ahead and start

856
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,160
locating these elements right.

857
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,520
So I'm going to inspect this

858
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,320
in here.

859
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,000
Go ahead.

860
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,840
My username right here.

861
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,240
I have the ID for the text username.

862
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,920
So what I'm going to do then copy this ID

863
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,320
and go ahead and start my script.

864
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,960
Right. So element

865
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,000
username is equal to driver

866
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,400
find element

867
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,840
by ID.

868
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,520
This is my ID value and what I need to do

869
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,000
I need to click

870
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,000
right.

871
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,360
So before

872
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,480
before I go to the password
guys, what I want to do,

873
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,920
I want to during my execution, I want to

874
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,360
I don't want to use any threat
that sleeps or anything.

875
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,440
Right.

876
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,960
Oh. Username seventies.

877
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,600
Sorry. Yes.

878
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,760
Two keys and it's going to be my right.

879
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:51,840
Okay.

880
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,880
So what I want to do,

881
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,080
I don't want to use any threat
but sleep if there are any interactions.

882
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:58,920
Right.

883
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,360
What do I have to use in here
in order to wait for some elements?

884
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,760
What Kind of wait.

885
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,000
Implicit. Right.

886
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,080
So let's set that implicit rate once.

887
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:13,800
Right.

888
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,760
And hopefully that's going to run.

889
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,480
That's
going to run throughout our execution.

890
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:22,680
Right.

891
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,280
Okay.

892
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,160
So how do we where do I need to set that?

893
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Guys, after after

894
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,360
navigating?

895
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,160
Right.

896
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,280
So driver

897
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:49,760
that manage for managing timeouts in here.

898
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:50,920
Right

899
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,880
implicitly wait

900
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,640
so what do we need to specify in here guys

901
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,440
inside the parentheses
guys the duration right.

902
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,920
So we want to wait for 20 seconds in here
and then

903
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,160
we actually need to say

904
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:14,840
that we want to wait 4 seconds, right?

905
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,720
So we don't want to wait for days
or hours.

906
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,360
20 seconds should be fine for us. Right?

907
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:21,840
Okay.

908
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,640
So now let's continue
let's go back to our page and let's

909
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,480
locate our password in here.

910
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,200
So it has an I.D. as well.

911
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,120
Let's go back

912
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,440
Web elements.

913
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,640
Password is equal to five four.

914
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,440
Second element by the

915
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,640
basis in here,

916
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,080
and then password

917
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,160
sent keys

918
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,040
in. I think it was

919
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,480
this was the password.

920
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,880
My mistake. Yep.

921
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,040
There you go.

922
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:14,480
All right.

923
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,840
And then I entered the username
and password.

924
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:23,120
So now what I need to do,
I just need to click on the log in button.

925
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,000
Right.

926
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,400
So this button has an idea as well.

927
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,240
So that's very good. So copy this

928
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,280
here and other web elements

929
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,840
equal to driver, but

930
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,320
find the elements

931
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,520
again by D

932
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,600
and paste this here
and what we need to deal with.

933
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,680
Log in button is just simply click

934
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,360
right.

935
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,480
So is everybody clear guys

936
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,760
what I'm doing until line 25.

937
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:11,040
Any questions in there?

938
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,440
Okay, cool.

939
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,000
So let's log in again

940
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,720
and there go.

941
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,480
So we're logged in and here.

942
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,160
So what I need to do,
I need to click on this Pim first

943
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,080
and then click on there and improve.

944
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:34,680
Right.

945
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:37,720
So what I'm to do the locate

946
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:41,160
this in here,
How can we identify this element?

947
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,880
Guys?

948
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,760
What is it that we can use in here?

949
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,000
Okay, what else?

950
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Instead of link text,
there is an idea, right?

951
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So it is the most safe one.

952
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,000
So what we can do, we can use an ID here.

953
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,680
So let's get back

954
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,320
web element.

955
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,360
I think

956
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,720
I am button

957
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,640
for my element by ID

958
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,840
and would paste that I.D.

959
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,240
And what we do is

960
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,680
we're simply going to click

961
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,200
right. Okay.

962
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,360
So after we click this, after we click,

963
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,680
what we're going to have is

964
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,680
we will have this

965
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,040
ADD employee button in here, right?

966
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,920
So I am going to locate this.

967
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,720
This one has an ID as well.

968
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,800
So what I'm going to do is copy
this idea in here.

969
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,600
Okay? And

970
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,880
I will create another web element in here.

971
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,080
Okay.

972
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,320
So add employee button

973
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,560
driver side element,

974
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:17,120
I.D., though, and

975
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,680
an employee that clicked.

976
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,160
Okay, so let's go to add employee in here.

977
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,280
So now what we need to do,
we need to actually

978
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,440
create or ADD and new employee, right.

979
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,000
So in order to do this,
I need to locate a couple

980
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,160
of different elements in here,
which are the first name.

981
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,760
Last name. Right.

982
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,600
And then what I need to do,
I need to save this employee.

983
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,400
Okay, so first name in here.

984
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,640
What do we have?

985
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:53,960
Okay, so we have an idea. Cool.

986
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:55,800
So let's

987
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:00,400
go back.

988
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,160
Where Element

989
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,200
first name

990
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,440
Driver.

991
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,640
Got my element

992
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,280
by I.D.

993
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,480
again.

994
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,280
Then first name

995
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,520
send keys.

996
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:34,080
So let's see.

997
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,080
We need to come up
with the name guys in here.

998
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,920
So I'm just going to put anything in here
and let's see

999
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,640
how that's going to work out.

1000
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,120
Okay, so first name.

1001
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,840
So let's identify the last name here.

1002
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:58,000
And we have an idea of last name.

1003
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,240
The first element.

1004
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:07,800
Last name is if this is driver,

1005
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,000
find element by E,

1006
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:11,480
Right.

1007
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,720
I'm good. Okay.

1008
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,880
That's a good one.

1009
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:23,240
Last name the keys,
whatever the last name is.

1010
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:30,280
Right.

1011
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:30,960
Okay.

1012
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:32,000
All right.

1013
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,920
So once I enter

1014
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,360
past them and last name.

1015
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:41,200
Right, what I need to do is
I need to click on Save.

1016
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:45,240
Let's see what we got for saving here.

1017
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,800
We've got an idea as well.

1018
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,840
So let's copy this

1019
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:55,320
and implement it here.

1020
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,480
Save button driver

1021
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,240
to find element like this ID

1022
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,840
and then save

1023
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,360
click.

1024
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,200
Okay.

1025
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,520
So let's say in here

1026
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,240
we are entering something

1027
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,600
and clicking on Save.

1028
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:21,920
So what happens is it gets in here.

1029
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:27,200
Okay, the next thing I want to do,
I want to see the whole table, right?

1030
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,760
In order for me to see the whole table,
I need to click on employee list in here.

1031
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,560
Okay,

1032
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:41,320
So let's go ahead and inspect this.

1033
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,480
Okay. So

1034
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,440
it has this idea as well.

1035
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,800
So let's use this idea as well.

1036
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,320
Okay.

1037
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,720
Now let's get back

1038
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,960
where elements

1039
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,440
in most button equal to

1040
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,920
driver dot find elements by idea.

1041
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,600
And this is our idea,

1042
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,160
right?

1043
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,120
Okay.

1044
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:22,440
And then what we want to do, we want to

1045
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,040
simply click okay.

1046
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,600
Is this clear, guys?

1047
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,680
Any questions on
what I am doing right now?

1048
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,680
So let's click on employee list in here
and we're going to see

1049
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,440
the whole table, right?

1050
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,600
Okay.

1051
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,960
So what do I need to do right now, guys?

1052
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,520
So before moving forward,
before doing anything, guys,

1053
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
So what I need to do,
my job is to find that employee, right?

1054
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,640
So this employee is right here.

1055
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,440
So what we want to do,
we want to store this

1056
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,200
whatever we going to be entering

1057
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,840
is going to be stored on max pages.

1058
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:11,680
We'll try to store it on the next pages
so that we can go to the next page.

1059
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:13,920
Okay.

1060
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,800
So right now, what is my next step, guys?

1061
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:30,160
What do I need to do in here?

1062
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,760
Locate the table.

1063
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,120
Right.

1064
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:37,000
Okay, so let's do this.

1065
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,720
So we have this table, right?

1066
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,280
It has the ID.

1067
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:50,080
So what I need to do,
I need to go through the rows.

1068
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,120
Right. So let's find this table.

1069
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:58,720
And here, table.

1070
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,200
Right. I.D.

1071
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,760
equal to

1072
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:10,920
resolve.

1073
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:11,760
Table.

1074
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,120
Right.

1075
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:15,240
So where do I need to go, guys?

1076
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,040
So I located the table.

1077
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,360
This is my table. One of one.

1078
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,920
And what I need to do in here.

1079
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,120
Let's collapse this.

1080
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,640
So I need to go to the body

1081
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:31,440
right? So

1082
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,920
slash

1083
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,120
the body and then the rows.

1084
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,400
Right.

1085
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,400
Okay, So I identified the rows in here.

1086
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:45,480
So now what
I need to do to copy this x path,

1087
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:50,120
go back in here
and store it inside the list

1088
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,160
Web elements. It's

1089
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,080
all right.

1090
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,320
And I'll say table was equal to

1091
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,760
five elements

1092
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,800
of X plus.

1093
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,320
This is my x five and what I'm going to do

1094
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,920
for this class.

1095
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,840
Okay,
So now, guys, I have a question for you.

1096
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:24,400
So once I am here, we added the employee,
Everything is good, right?

1097
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,960
So I'm on this page.

1098
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,440
I located the
all of the all the rows of this table

1099
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,160
and I start iterating to my rows.

1100
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,120
Right.

1101
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,000
What is the criteria that

1102
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,000
I am going to

1103
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,480
delete That employee that I just added?

1104
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,120
What am I looking for in here?

1105
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,160
How do I differentiate my employee

1106
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,040
that I just added

1107
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,360
by ID?

1108
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:00,240
Okay, good.

1109
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,080
So not name
because names can be duplicated.

1110
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:04,600
Right?

1111
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,160
Job can be duplicated.

1112
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,240
Last names can be duplicated.

1113
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,040
But IDs are always unique.

1114
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,080
Right? Very good.

1115
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,000
But where am I getting this idea?

1116
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,480
So I save this and the ID is generated
automatically.

1117
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,640
Guys, where am I going to get this?

1118
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,440
I don't know.

1119
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,320
The IDs that

1120
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,040
for the employee that I just created,
where am I going

1121
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:42,760
to get it?

1122
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,320
Any thoughts

1123
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,200
for employee list?

1124
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:58,120
Okay, let's see.

1125
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,320
I think okay.

1126
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:04,360
Are you talking about this?

1127
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,760
Okay, that's a good point.

1128
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,800
We can get it from here. Okay.

1129
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,560
Is there any other place that we can get

1130
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:18,720
this ID from?

1131
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,200
That's a very good observation,
actually. Yes.

1132
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:35,840
We have an employee ID in here.

1133
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,120
The last employee in the list.

1134
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:39,800
Not really.

1135
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,280
Right, guys,
The employees are sorted by first.

1136
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,560
A last name.

1137
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,800
Okay.

1138
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,880
It's given to us. Where?

1139
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,680
Yeah, we can get it from the row, guys,

1140
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:01,400
but we don't know it yet.

1141
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,200
Now we don't need a scanner in here right.

1142
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,040
Okay,
so one thing that we can get it from here.

1143
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,720
That's a good point.

1144
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,400
Is there any other way that we need?

1145
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:29,120
We can get it.

1146
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:32,160
Okay, guys, I need to get the ID,

1147
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,360
but I need to get the ID,

1148
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:42,600
but not from here.

1149
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:49,960
There's no creation log.

1150
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,360
Most recent person added, Not the headache

1151
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:58,280
guys, pay attention, guys.

1152
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,800
It's a small detail.

1153
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,400
It's a small detail that you can find it.

1154
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:10,360
Guys, let's

1155
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:18,320
see. So

1156
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:22,200
from an employee.

1157
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:22,920
Where?

1158
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:32,480
From an employee, it had an I.D., right?

1159
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:37,400
So if I go on an employee
when I'm adding that employee,

1160
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:39,720
there we go.

1161
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:42,880
It's already given to us, right?

1162
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,080
So you don't have to go to the next
and perform some actions.

1163
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,560
You can perform the same action

1164
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:56,840
right on the same page.

1165
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,640
Now, you said you can get it
from the employee list, right?

1166
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,120
Not not employee list,
but from last year you create it. Right.

1167
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:12,960
And you said you can get it from here.

1168
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,200
Yeah.

1169
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,280
When you added it
right after you added you,

1170
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:21,240
you come to this page.

1171
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,440
But then he agreed.

1172
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,000
You agreed when I said this point.

1173
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,520
Okay, that's fine.

1174
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,080
Okay, that's fine.

1175
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:28,440
Okay.

1176
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,960
We could get it from here, guys.

1177
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:34,320
Okay.

1178
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,640
All right, good.

1179
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,000
All right.

1180
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,240
So we can get it from here
when we are entering the first name.

1181
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,680
And lastly. Okay, but here, guys,

1182
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:46,080
I go here.

1183
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,640
What am I getting in here, guys?

1184
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:49,680
Am I getting the text from this?

1185
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,680
From this text box?

1186
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:56,640
What am I getting?

1187
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,200
I need to get the value.
How am I going to get the value in here?

1188
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:07,880
Guys?

1189
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:17,360
Is there a method
that gets the value in here?

1190
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:25,840
Let's go to the to our script.

1191
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:31,480
Do we have to get attribute value
method ghosts?

1192
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:34,360
What is the actual method
that we use to get

1193
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,360
to get the values

1194
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,480
from the HTML to get that attribute right?

1195
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,480
So when I

1196
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:49,080
when I just enter the first name
and last name in here,

1197
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:53,520
what I need to do,
I need to get that attribute.

1198
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:58,120
But before we do this,
I need to locate this.

1199
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,240
Right?

1200
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,200
So let's see.

1201
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,240
It has the idea.

1202
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,000
Okay, so

1203
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,240
where element

1204
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,640
the employee I the

1205
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:19,120
do field is equal to driver

1206
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,440
find element

1207
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,920
by the

1208
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,120
so now what we can do

1209
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,160
so actual employee ID is equal to a driver

1210
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,880
not drive driver.

1211
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,240
The employee ID field that that attribute

1212
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,960
which is the value
attribute was okay right.

1213
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,000
Okay is that clear guys.

1214
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,400
So we trying to add an employee in here
we passed the first time a last name

1215
01:14:52,600 --> 01:15:00,200
and what we do we getting the value
that is already given to us in here.

1216
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:23,640
Is that clear, Guys, Any questions?

1217
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:23,920
Okay.

1218
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,680
All good.

1219
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,880
Okay, so it's 820.

1220
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,240
Guys,
Let's have a break, a 15 minute break,

1221
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,080
and then we'll come back and continue
with this example.

1222
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:46,720
Okay?

1223
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,040
All right.

1224
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,880
I'll see you guys.

1225
01:15:47,880 --> 01:31:02,040
That 835.

1226
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,880
All right, guys, let's get back. Yeah.

1227
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:11,800
And with this, tell us.

1228
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:19,080
All right, All right.

1229
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,360
Let's see how many people have backed us
so that we can

1230
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:30,400
continue.

1231
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,440
Okay, cool. So we stopped

1232
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,000
where we got

1233
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,720
the value for the employee ID, right?

1234
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:43,680
And what we did was we located

1235
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,880
the table rows from the web page.

1236
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:50,440
Right. So let's go back

1237
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,800
to the employee list.

1238
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,880
Okay?

1239
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,880
All right. Yes.

1240
01:31:55,880 --> 01:32:00,480
So what we want to do in here
is, again, to

1241
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:04,080
to go through each and every row.

1242
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:12,960
And what we need to do, we need to find
our employee first, check it.

1243
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,600
Right. And delete that employee.

1244
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:18,960
Okay. All right.

1245
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,760
So what is my next step in here?

1246
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,920
So let's go in here
and see what's going to happen.

1247
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:28,480
So what is my next step, guys?

1248
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,520
What am I doing next?

1249
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:32,800
So I identify the all the rows.

1250
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:41,400
What am I doing now?

1251
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,200
Set the flag.

1252
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:47,000
Okay, so before we set the flag,
let's loop through the rows.

1253
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:51,960
Okay, so what I will do in here,
I have a for loop.

1254
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,760
Right.
Let's use the regular loop this time.

1255
01:32:55,320 --> 01:33:00,040
So integer is equal to zero

1256
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:06,520
and I is less than

1257
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,240
table rows that size.

1258
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:11,640
Right.

1259
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:15,440
And we're incrementing one by one.

1260
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,080
Okay, so we have this.

1261
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:28,440
So now what I need to do in here goes.

1262
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:33,480
So we start iterating through the rows.

1263
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:40,440
What is next?

1264
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:46,560
Store each element to the to the variable.

1265
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:47,880
Okay. And then do what?

1266
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,520
And then get the text right.

1267
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,600
Okay.

1268
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,240
So let's just do string

1269
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,200
row texts, right?

1270
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:59,120
Is equal to

1271
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,120
table rows that

1272
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:04,880
get text.

1273
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,920
Seems like get
text is not available for us.

1274
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:19,800
What's going on in here guys?

1275
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,160
We need to get each element first right?

1276
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,760
So that I

1277
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,840
and only then get that to the text.

1278
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:31,920
Okay.

1279
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,760
So I got the text now

1280
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,400
what do I need to do next?

1281
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:41,640
Guys?

1282
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,800
What am I looking for right now?

1283
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:44,160
Okay.

1284
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,080
If condition so inside my if condition,

1285
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,160
what am I looking
what kind of condition am I having in here

1286
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,120
if our row text right

1287
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,400
contains what

1288
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,680
contains the employee

1289
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:12,520
ID that we stored on line 38.

1290
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:13,680
Right.

1291
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:19,400
So copy this case this in here.

1292
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,440
And then if, if our condition is mapped.

1293
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:34,200
What are we doing, guys,
before we remove anything.

1294
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:37,400
Right. What do we need to do?

1295
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:41,400
We need to find that checkbox.

1296
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:42,040
Right.

1297
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:46,800
Okay, so we have this x pass, right?

1298
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,800
So we have this x path.

1299
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,920
So how we find that checkbox in here

1300
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:57,480
guys?

1301
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,920
So I have all the rows, right?

1302
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,040
What do I need to do
in order to find my checkbox in here

1303
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,040
by index?

1304
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,040
Okay,

1305
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:21,920
so but first of all,
where do I need to go from here?

1306
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,360
Okay, I have all the rows guys.

1307
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:26,280
Where is my checkbox in here?

1308
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,120
Where is

1309
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:42,840
this located?

1310
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:43,920
Inside the column.

1311
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,080
Okay, which column are we talking about?

1312
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,800
The very first column.

1313
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:51,880
Right. So

1314
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,040
in order for me to get the columns,
what I need to do,

1315
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,200
I need to go ahead

1316
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,280
and get one

1317
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:04,840
right.

1318
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,280
Okay, So here.

1319
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,360
So if I go down, you can see that
we're going

1320
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,040
through each and every

1321
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,440
checkbox in here okay here.

1322
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,720
But now, guys, so

1323
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:25,400
here before guys, we used to have

1324
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:29,280
before in the previous examples
that we've done,

1325
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:32,280
we used to have a advanced for them.

1326
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:35,200
Okay, so in advance for loop,

1327
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:40,080
we're moving through the rows
automatically right in here.

1328
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:43,920
Since we have a regular for loop,
how am I supposed to move

1329
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:45,120
through the rows in here?

1330
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:50,800
Guys?

1331
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:56,160
Any guesses in here?

1332
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:01,120
So let's open up the previous example

1333
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:07,120
in here.

1334
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:07,440
Okay.

1335
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,680
How do I need to move
through my rows in here?

1336
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:22,600
Guys,

1337
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:27,880
let's get back in here.

1338
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,280
Okay, so here.

1339
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:34,640
Okay, so we use the regular loop,
but we started inside the lease, right?

1340
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:37,320
So can I do this?

1341
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:44,400
Can I click on the checkbox
without creating a list of web elements?

1342
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:48,440
Guys, can I just create one web element

1343
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:55,880
and handle this.

1344
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:58,680
Any thoughts on this?
Guys, let's go back in here.

1345
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:00,920
So we we

1346
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:03,920
found all the checkboxes in here, right?

1347
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:12,840
How do I find only one checkbox?

1348
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:24,200
How do I find on the first checkbox
in here?

1349
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:24,840
Any thoughts?

1350
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:37,160
No. Okay.

1351
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:39,440
How do I move through the rows?

1352
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,640
Guys in here.

1353
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:55,920
Can someone help me do that?

1354
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:56,760
No, no, no. Just.

1355
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:57,720
Just here, guys.

1356
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:04,280
How do I locate just one checkbox?

1357
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,080
I just want to know.

1358
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,720
I just want to

1359
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:14,360
locate one checkbox
that's in here in my express.

1360
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:18,840
What do I need to change
in order to locate only one checkbox?

1361
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:21,640
Right now I have 50.

1362
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:22,120
Okay.

1363
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:23,760
Index of what?

1364
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:33,160
I already have an index of one in here.

1365
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:36,200
I have an index of one in here,
but seems like

1366
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,960
I still get 50

1367
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:46,840
value.

1368
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:49,680
Anything else in this x path guys?

1369
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,400
Right on this x path.

1370
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,160
What do I need to change
to get only one checkbox

1371
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,040
nested in index?

1372
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:08,760
Not really.

1373
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,680
Okay guys, that's fine.

1374
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:11,080
Okay.

1375
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:15,800
So here
I have an index of the column right.

1376
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:21,240
So I have an index of the column which
navigates from the top to the bottom.

1377
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,680
Right.

1378
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,920
So what if I identify

1379
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:30,520
one of the checkboxes

1380
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:34,520
on my first row guys,

1381
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:37,440
This is what's going to identify

1382
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,960
my one checkbox.

1383
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:45,200
Okay, so this is one element in here
so we don't have to get

1384
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:49,640
a lot of different elements and store them
in the list of what element.

1385
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,960
Okay, so I'm going to copy this

1386
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:56,240
when I copied this and what I am going

1387
01:41:56,240 --> 01:42:00,480
to do, I'm going to create

1388
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,440
another web element and say,

1389
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,640
driver, find element

1390
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,600
by express and paste it in here.

1391
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:12,960
Okay?

1392
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:19,120
But this is going to locate
only first rows checkbox,

1393
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:21,320
right?

1394
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:25,120
So if that's
the case, how do I keep this dynamic

1395
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:30,240
so that I can keep locating different rows

1396
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:35,440
checkbox guys,
What do I need to change in here?

1397
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,280
Guys, if I want to.

1398
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:41,480
If I want to locate the second rows

1399
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:44,080
checkbox,
what do I need to change in this X path

1400
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:53,200
index?

1401
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,200
Of what index of t or T.

1402
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,480
R does

1403
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,200
t r right.

1404
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:06,360
So because we need to change the row
in here if I do this

1405
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:09,760
so you can see that that our rows

1406
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,840
are being dynamic, right?

1407
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:17,760
So if I go back to my script in here.

1408
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,720
So we need to keep this dynamic, right?

1409
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,720
So what we can do is

1410
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:28,680
we are iterating through the rows, right?

1411
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:32,320
So we're starting from zero.

1412
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,760
And my iteration variable

1413
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,680
is that I in here, right?

1414
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:42,440
So this eye keeps changing
every time, right?

1415
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,760
So what we can do in here

1416
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:49,320
is we can simply use concatenation,

1417
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:51,480
right.

1418
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:54,000
And put it in here.

1419
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,160
Okay.

1420
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,760
So every time

1421
01:43:58,760 --> 01:44:01,480
we change our

1422
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:07,280
our row,
this I in our X path will as well.

1423
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:12,240
Right.

1424
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:14,680
I'm coming to that point. Okay.

1425
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,240
So let's start from here.

1426
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:18,840
If we have any errors
and then we'll move on.

1427
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:20,720
Okay.

1428
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:25,160
So now we identified our checkbox
in here, right?

1429
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:31,200
So what I need to do if my condition is
is met, everything is good.

1430
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:35,960
What I need to do,
I need to simply click on that.

1431
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:37,680
Right.

1432
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:40,880
So I click on that.

1433
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,200
What do I need to do next?

1434
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,360
So I chose this, right?

1435
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,800
I chose this.

1436
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:51,280
What is my next step, guys? Delete. Right?

1437
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:53,960
This is the delete button
we need to work with.

1438
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,280
So here we have an ID

1439
01:44:58,360 --> 01:44:59,280
right?

1440
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:00,720
Let's go back in here.

1441
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:03,720
What I need to do is let's create

1442
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:07,320
this web element.

1443
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,440
Delete button is equal to driver

1444
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:13,600
find element by ID.

1445
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:19,200
This is my and what I am going to do,

1446
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:22,680
I will simply click okay.

1447
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:24,720
All right.

1448
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,880
So I chose the employee in here.

1449
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,640
Let's click on this.

1450
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:29,360
All right.

1451
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,920
So when I click on Delete,
we have something like this.

1452
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:41,480
How do I handle this situation now?

1453
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:47,120
First of all, what is this?

1454
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:49,040
It's an alert. Okay.

1455
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,040
What kind of alert?

1456
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:52,080
Guys, it's a pop up. Okay.

1457
01:45:52,560 --> 01:46:01,200
What kind of pop up is this?

1458
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,640
Confirmation. Okay.

1459
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,480
Is it a JavaScript alert?

1460
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:09,640
Is it a Windows based alert
or is it a Web based alert?

1461
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,400
Which one?

1462
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:17,040
Okay, So if it's a Web based alert,
how can we handle web

1463
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:24,800
based alerts?

1464
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,120
SWAT click

1465
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:30,840
by simply in suspecting this.

1466
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:33,600
Right. Because we talked about it, guys.

1467
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:39,200
It's it's the JavaScript alert
that we need to switch to.

1468
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:44,680
This is a web based alert
so we can simply go ahead

1469
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,240
and inspect these
and we can simply perform.

1470
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:51,600
Click actions or close actions.

1471
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,720
Right. Any actions we have through.

1472
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,000
Celine Right.

1473
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:00,000
We don't have to switch to it
because it is considered as a web element.

1474
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:05,000
Okay, So what I will do in here,

1475
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,120
I will copy

1476
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,760
the ID, okay, Go back in

1477
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,080
here, create another web element.

1478
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:16,320
Okay.

1479
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:20,280
And let's put it confirm delete

1480
01:47:21,360 --> 01:47:25,800
driver, find element

1481
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:34,520
ID, There we go.

1482
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,680
And simply

1483
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,800
to click on this.

1484
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,120
Right. Okay.

1485
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:50,880
So when our condition is met,
we click, we click on delete, right?

1486
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,760
And we click on checkbox,
we click on delete confirming everything.

1487
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,760
So after we confirmed everything,
what do we need to

1488
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:08,480
do, guys?

1489
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:09,520
We need to break them.

1490
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:10,160
All right.

1491
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:13,480
Okay,
so we have to break the for loop in here.

1492
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:20,200
So now if our employee is
not on the first page, guys,

1493
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:22,680
what do we need to do

1494
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:29,360
in this case?

1495
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:32,600
We need to click on the next right.

1496
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,760
So let's create a web element in here.

1497
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:37,840
Okay?

1498
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:41,480
So let's go ahead and

1499
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,800
inspect this.

1500
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:47,560
All right?

1501
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,680
So if it's not here,
we need to click next.

1502
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:53,160
What do we need to
what can we use in here?

1503
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:57,000
What kind of locator

1504
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,360
link text.

1505
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:07,600
Right. Simple.

1506
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,240
So we can use link text in here.

1507
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:12,240
The copy

1508
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:20,360
web element, next button driver

1509
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,680
find element

1510
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:27,520
by link text

1511
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,800
and we can simply paste this link text.

1512
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:32,400
Thank you.

1513
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,600
Okay,
so in order for to click on the link text,

1514
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:39,840
we need another loop, right?

1515
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:45,120
Which will, which will be controlled
by the boolean value of the flag.

1516
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:46,200
Right.

1517
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,360
So I'm going to create a boolean value

1518
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,880
and say flag is equal to true,

1519
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:54,360
right.

1520
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:59,040
And then what I need to do,
I need to create a while

1521
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:04,400
right?

1522
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:05,640
Not sure

1523
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:10,920
I can see here

1524
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:20,320
by idea.

1525
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:23,920
Okay, so you want to use your employee ID
and then

1526
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:30,120
and then find that checkbox, right?

1527
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:35,040
So let's see here.

1528
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,520
Okay. So you want to do this, right?

1529
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:41,200
So is this the same employee
ID that we have right now

1530
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:43,880
for that checkbox? This

1531
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,280
it has a at the end, right?

1532
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:57,000
So what's going to happen is your X
path is not going to work.

1533
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:00,080
Okay. So that's first.

1534
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:04,440
Even though your employee ID was the same

1535
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:08,160
as here in your I.D.

1536
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:13,360
value, what if it's on the fifth page?

1537
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,600
So you're navigating here.

1538
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,400
You're looking for that element.

1539
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:18,600
It doesn't exist.

1540
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:25,280
What are you going to get?

1541
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:29,400
So the element that you're looking for,
it doesn't exist on the web page.

1542
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:33,080
So you getting what you're getting
an exception, right?

1543
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:36,480
Because
until you navigate to that page yourself,

1544
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,520
then you will not be able to pick that up.

1545
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:41,720
Okay. Is that clear?

1546
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:49,120
Does.

1547
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:49,760
Okay, good.

1548
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:51,520
All right.

1549
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,560
So let's go ahead and. Copy

1550
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:57,600
everything

1551
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:00,680
from here and pasted inside this one.

1552
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:03,080
Okay. So we broke the loop.

1553
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:06,320
So we are in a while right now.

1554
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:11,160
So once our condition is mapped in here,
what do we need to do?

1555
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:15,560
We need to set our flag to false.

1556
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:18,000
Right? So flag

1557
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:20,920
is equal to false in here.

1558
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:26,880
So and then after each loop iteration,

1559
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:32,160
what we need to do, let's see,

1560
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:37,680
we need to click on the next button,
right?

1561
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,720
Is this clear, guys?

1562
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:52,320
Any questions before I run this?

1563
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:53,680
Okay, we're coming to that point.

1564
01:52:53,680 --> 01:52:54,240
Okay.

1565
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:56,600
Let's run this first
and see if this is going to work.

1566
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,600
Please do not run, guys.

1567
01:52:58,600 --> 01:52:59,160
Okay?

1568
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:03,040
Please do not run at the same time
as I am doing okay,

1569
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:07,400
because there might be some duplicates
for employee IDs.

1570
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,960
Okay. If we run it at the same time.

1571
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:14,760
Okay, so let's run
this and see what we're going to get.

1572
01:53:15,240 --> 01:53:28,040
Okay?

1573
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:30,960
Okay.

1574
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:32,280
Clicking on this one.

1575
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:37,200
Okay, so you messed

1576
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,400
click on the next button once.

1577
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:43,560
So we are on the page two in here.

1578
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:46,800
Okay, We're on the page too.

1579
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,240
So it didn't click any more.

1580
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,480
What happened, guys?

1581
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:54,200
So we are getting a stale

1582
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:56,840
element except, right?

1583
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:03,800
Anyone knows what this exception is?

1584
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:07,760
Any thoughts, Any guesses on this

1585
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,000
same element?

1586
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,040
Exception codes.

1587
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,200
They stayed for some period of time.

1588
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:34,160
Okay.

1589
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:36,360
You cannot access the elements. Okay.

1590
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:40,240
So sometimes, guys,
when you run your code, you will face

1591
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,440
this stale element exception.

1592
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:47,400
And this exception is one of the worst
exceptions

1593
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:50,440
for a automation engineer,

1594
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:54,960
because for thing,

1595
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:58,240
if you get this stale element exception,

1596
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,520
there is no 100% solution for this.

1597
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:03,360
Okay?

1598
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:07,080
So when you get this
exception, you will need to do

1599
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,680
a set
of actions in order to get rid of this.

1600
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:12,640
Okay.

1601
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:17,240
First of all, what you need to do
is you need to refresh your page.

1602
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:18,560
Okay?

1603
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:21,400
So that's one thing that you can do

1604
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:23,560
in order to resolve the issue.

1605
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:29,560
Second, you need to go ahead
and check your locators.

1606
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,760
Okay.

1607
01:55:30,920 --> 01:55:34,080
So where is this failing?

1608
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:35,360
Why is this failing?

1609
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,080
So it says

1610
01:55:37,680 --> 01:55:39,200
on line 51.

1611
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:43,080
So seems like
when we moved to the second page,

1612
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:46,680
what happened is it didn't get the text.

1613
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:50,280
Look, it says that table rolls

1614
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:55,600
element is stale right now
so it's pretty old and it's it

1615
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:59,280
can't really identify it identified before

1616
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:02,000
but now it's not there.

1617
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:04,680
Okay. Why is this happening?

1618
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:08,160
So most of the time this happens

1619
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:12,920
when your page is getting refreshed
automatically.

1620
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:15,160
Okay. So if I go in here

1621
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:17,640
and click

1622
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:23,400
on the next button in here,
okay, look at the page, guys.

1623
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,720
What happened?

1624
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:27,960
The whole page just got refreshed

1625
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:32,360
in the previous that's in here.

1626
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,480
If I click on next, nothing is changing,

1627
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:38,880
but the table data is changing. Right?

1628
01:56:39,120 --> 01:56:43,760
But in this example,
if you look at this, if I click on next,

1629
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:48,480
you will see that
we're moving to the third page in here.

1630
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:51,440
But the whole page is getting

1631
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:55,160
is getting refreshed, right?

1632
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:58,920
So every time
the page is getting refreshed,

1633
01:56:59,080 --> 01:57:03,320
we need to locate our table
all over again.

1634
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:06,840
Okay, So let's get back in here.

1635
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,520
So whenever we click

1636
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:13,480
the next right, what happens?

1637
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:15,560
We need to locate.

1638
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:19,800
We need to find this element again, Right?

1639
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:21,960
So When are we going to do this?

1640
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:25,560
We're doing this right inside our. Why

1641
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:28,560
is that clear, guys?

1642
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:40,560
Any questions on this now?

1643
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,760
Questions?

1644
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:45,920
Okay, good.

1645
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:49,560
All right,
so what else do we need to change in here?

1646
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,200
So we need to identify

1647
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,040
the table rows again
after we move to the second page.

1648
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:00,360
If there Is there any other thing
that we need to change in here?

1649
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:10,080
Guys?

1650
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:12,800
Okay, guys, I need you to be more active
in here, Right?

1651
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:16,400
Because I'm just going to assume
that you guys

1652
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:19,640
are understanding everything
and I'll just continue

1653
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,160
with whatever material I have,

1654
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:28,080
and we can finish in 15 minutes.

1655
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:28,920
Okay.

1656
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:35,440
So here, guys,

1657
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:39,720
if I need to locate the table

1658
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:41,960
after each iteration.

1659
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:44,600
What do I need?

1660
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:49,560
Is there any other thing
that I need to change inside my wild loop?

1661
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:49,920
Guys,

1662
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,320
what if my page is getting refreshed?

1663
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:55,360
Right?

1664
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:57,360
What am I going to lose in here?

1665
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,720
So I initiate.

1666
01:58:58,720 --> 01:59:02,000
I initialize
this here, this web element in here.

1667
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,720
So everything is good.

1668
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:05,680
What else seems to be off in here?

1669
01:59:05,680 --> 01:59:23,200
Guys Guys?

1670
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,200
All right. No idea. Good.

1671
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,880
Okay, so what?

1672
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:30,120
I am going to do, I'm going to copy

1673
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:36,600
this and paste this in here, okay?

1674
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,600
Because this is one of the elements
that will change during our execution

1675
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:46,520
during each iteration
when we click on the next button.

1676
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,520
Okay, so now what I am going to do.

1677
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:53,400
So let's see in here.

1678
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:56,560
So we already added this guy in here,

1679
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:58,880
so I need to change the name here.

1680
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:03,400
Okay, So

1681
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,000
let's see,

1682
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:10,040
let's

1683
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:17,120
go to the second
page and see what you have

1684
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:20,560
here.

1685
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:23,760
Okay, that's fine.

1686
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,840
Let's add anything with

1687
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:28,440
the and see how

1688
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:33,720
this is going to work.

1689
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:34,200
Whatever.

1690
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:36,840
I don't even know if this name exists.

1691
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:39,960
Okay, so let's run this and see

1692
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:45,120
what we're going to have

1693
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:57,440
to go saving

1694
02:00:57,440 --> 02:01:01,240
before you list.

1695
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:04,960
You can see
we're moving to the next page in here

1696
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:09,160
right? So

1697
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:14,160
now first page.

1698
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:19,280
And here.

1699
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:24,800
And it's going to keep moving
until it finds that employee, right?

1700
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,080
I think we're going to be here
for a while.

1701
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:28,160
I hope

1702
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:32,240
this is going to find that quickly,

1703
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:38,640
but probably not.

1704
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:44,720
So let's see.

1705
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:54,720
I don't even know how many pages we had in
here.

1706
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:58,000
Okay, we're on page 20.

1707
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:11,760
Okay.

1708
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:12,320
Oh, seven.

1709
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,320
Eight pages. Okay.

1710
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:24,800
That's not bad.

1711
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:29,600
And let's see what it's going to find.

1712
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:34,080
It. I'm pretty sure it will, but

1713
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:38,600
we don't know where it is. So

1714
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:45,960
show time.

1715
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:50,200
Exactly.

1716
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,920
Okay. I'm going to wait until 50
and then terminate this.

1717
02:02:52,920 --> 02:03:05,680
Okay, guys, let's

1718
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:24,080
see if it comes up until 60.

1719
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:27,080
What happens
if it doesn't get saved inside this

1720
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:30,000
employee's table?

1721
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,400
Guys, what are we going to do

1722
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:40,080
that?

1723
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:46,240
Okay, so running off access to two.

1724
02:03:46,240 --> 02:03:52,200
Okay, guys, what's going to happen
is that employee that we added

1725
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:57,880
is not going to get saved
inside this table.

1726
02:03:57,880 --> 02:03:58,560
Oh, okay.

1727
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:00,640
There you go. It found it, right?

1728
02:04:02,160 --> 02:04:03,600
It found it, it deleted it.

1729
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:08,600
Right.

1730
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:11,240
Then you can't find it. Oh, wow.

1731
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:12,120
Okay.

1732
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:15,000
So you need to create a defect

1733
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:20,040
in that case, right?

1734
02:04:20,040 --> 02:04:32,160
All right, guys, any questions?

1735
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:33,560
All right, No questions.

1736
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:36,040
Good.

1737
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:41,360
Okay, so now what I want to show you is

1738
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:46,800
let me create

1739
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:54,440
a new class in here.

1740
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:57,160
So now what we will be doing in here,

1741
02:04:57,520 --> 02:05:00,600
we will be handling some calendars.

1742
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:13,040
Okay.

1743
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:13,920
All right.

1744
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:34,040
So let me go in here, see?

1745
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:36,480
Okay.

1746
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:37,680
All right.

1747
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:38,520
I guess

1748
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:45,040
why not?

1749
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:46,440
I plus one.

1750
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:48,560
Yeah, it might have deleted the wrong one.

1751
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:49,680
Exactly

1752
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:53,880
Okay, so you need to make it a plus one.

1753
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:56,320
Right? And that that's.

1754
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:59,880
And then it should delete the right
employee.

1755
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:00,560
Okay.

1756
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:04,080
All right.

1757
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:08,840
So now, guys, what we're going to do,
we will be handling calendars.

1758
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:13,040
Okay, so calendars is the

1759
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:16,600
another web element on the web page.

1760
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:18,560
Okay.

1761
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:22,960
And we will be handling it
a little bit differently.

1762
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:25,640
Okay.
So there's a lot of different calendars.

1763
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:26,280
I mean, I'm

1764
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:31,200
pretty sure you've seen these calendars
when you're booking flights, right?

1765
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:32,800
Or you trying to

1766
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:36,240
put some dates somewhere.

1767
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:36,640
Right.

1768
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:41,800
So most of the time you will see
these calendars when you are dealing

1769
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:45,080
or booking a flight and going somewhere.

1770
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:45,720
Right.

1771
02:06:45,920 --> 02:06:48,760
So these

1772
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,800
these calendars are handled

1773
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:58,320
a little bit different
than the usual Web elements.

1774
02:06:58,480 --> 02:06:59,080
Okay.

1775
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:02,160
And we're going to look into the
into these calendars

1776
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:04,720
what they have inside them.

1777
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,480
Okay.

1778
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:16,440
Any questions, guys?

1779
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:19,560
Now, Questions?

1780
02:07:19,560 --> 02:07:21,920
Okay, good.

1781
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,160
So I have a calendar over here.

1782
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:27,240
So let's take a look
what we have inside this calendar.

1783
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:28,000
Okay.

1784
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,960
So when I click on this guy in here,

1785
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:35,600
right, so we can see that

1786
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:38,560
there is a calendar popping up right.

1787
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:39,440
First of all,

1788
02:07:39,440 --> 02:07:44,040
if you start working with calendars,
like if you're booking any flight, right.

1789
02:07:44,600 --> 02:07:47,440
So what are you going to
what are you going to

1790
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:51,760
look at first, guys,
before you choose the date guys

1791
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:01,600
that year?

1792
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:02,440
Okay.

1793
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:04,840
What else?

1794
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:08,160
The year and a month, right.

1795
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:12,400
So here we have a year and a month.

1796
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,520
In what format, guys?

1797
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:21,640
What is this?

1798
02:08:21,640 --> 02:08:23,040
It's a dropdown, right?

1799
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,800
Exactly.

1800
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:27,440
So in some dropdown,

1801
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:30,320
in some calendars you will see months

1802
02:08:30,600 --> 02:08:33,240
and a year as dropdown.

1803
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:38,600
In some calendars
you will see it a little bit different.

1804
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:40,680
Okay guys.

1805
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:44,080
So let's take a look at the

1806
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:46,440
at the dates now.

1807
02:08:46,440 --> 02:08:49,280
So if you want to

1808
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:53,320
start looking in
or start interacting with the dates,

1809
02:08:53,520 --> 02:09:00,160
what do we have in here guys?

1810
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:03,520
We have a simple table in here, right?

1811
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:07,360
A table with a T hat and, the T body.

1812
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:10,200
So in calendars, guys, most of the time

1813
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:15,480
when you're interacting with calendars,

1814
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:20,120
the dates will be stored
inside the T body.

1815
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:23,040
And the days, days of the week

1816
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:26,240
will be stored inside the T hat.

1817
02:09:27,240 --> 02:09:28,480
Is that clear, guys?

1818
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:38,640
Any questions on that?

1819
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:42,200
Okay, so now what we're going to do,

1820
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:44,760
we will be interacting
with the same application.

1821
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:48,240
So what I want to do is

1822
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:55,920
let's go back in here, let's copy

1823
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:04,200
the log in.

1824
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:04,800
Okay.

1825
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:08,560
So this is our steps to log in

1826
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:12,840
in here, right?

1827
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:14,880
So what I want to do,

1828
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:19,800
so when I navigate here, what I want to
do, I want to click on leave

1829
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:23,120
and then click on the leave list.

1830
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:26,200
And then what I want to do,

1831
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:29,800
I want to interact with this calendar.

1832
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:32,640
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

1833
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:40,200
Any questions?

1834
02:10:40,200 --> 02:10:41,720
All right, good.

1835
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:47,920
Okay, so now let's get back in here.

1836
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,120
Okay, so we're logged in.

1837
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:55,720
So what I want to do,
I want to click on this leave button.

1838
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:57,200
Right?

1839
02:10:57,200 --> 02:11:00,120
So Let's identify this

1840
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:03,200
and what we can do in here.

1841
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:05,280
Can we use a linked text for this?

1842
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:08,080
Guys?

1843
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:09,760
Is it possible

1844
02:11:17,080 --> 02:11:17,960
it has it D

1845
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:21,640
Okay, now about

1846
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:25,480
can we use live text in here

1847
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:26,880
to work as well?

1848
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:28,280
Okay, good.

1849
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:28,880
All right.

1850
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:32,880
So let's use the idea in here.

1851
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:34,200
Go back

1852
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:39,360
Web elements, leave button

1853
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:45,000
driver, find elements by ID

1854
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:53,960
and what we can do need to simply

1855
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:57,600
click this right.

1856
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:58,320
Okay.

1857
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:02,920
So when we click on that, let's go.

1858
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:05,360
So let's see if I click on leave.

1859
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:06,480
Okay?

1860
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:13,240
We don't have to click on the live
list in here.

1861
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:15,360
We don't have to click on this. Right?
Okay.

1862
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:17,600
So we should be in here.

1863
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:20,920
So now in order for me to

1864
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:24,120
to start

1865
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:27,120
to start interacting

1866
02:12:27,120 --> 02:12:31,640
with the calendars in here,
first of all, what need to do?

1867
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:34,760
I need to locate that element. Okay.

1868
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:40,360
So what I'm going to do in here
is to click on this

1869
02:12:40,360 --> 02:12:44,920
and if we have anything in here so

1870
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:50,320
or what we can do,
I think if we click on this text box,

1871
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:54,320
this is going to open up this calendar
so we can do that.

1872
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:57,960
Okay,
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to copy

1873
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:01,280
this ID in here, okay?

1874
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:04,760
And go back

1875
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:09,400
Web elements

1876
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:13,120
from calendar

1877
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:19,720
is equal to driver.

1878
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:22,000
Find elements

1879
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:27,000
I D Right.

1880
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:30,840
And to open that up, what we going to do,

1881
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:34,720
we will clicking this right.

1882
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:35,920
Okay.

1883
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:44,880
Any questions until this point guys?

1884
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:45,600
Okay.

1885
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:49,280
So I'm going to be clicking on that text
box and that's going to open

1886
02:13:50,520 --> 02:13:52,320
this calendar.

1887
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:56,640
So before I choose any dates, Right.

1888
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:58,920
What do I need to do in here?

1889
02:13:58,920 --> 02:14:03,480
What is the elements
that I need to interact with a

1890
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:10,480
month and a year?

1891
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:11,200
Right.

1892
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:15,120
So let's start interacting with a month.

1893
02:14:15,560 --> 02:14:17,600
Okay, So this is my element, guys.

1894
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:31,080
How can I interact with this?

1895
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:32,800
Can we, can we use select?

1896
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:55,920
Plus in this case, guys, now
because of dropdown.

1897
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:59,520
Okay, so we can't use to select class
with this dropdown this,

1898
02:15:00,200 --> 02:15:05,400
is that correct?

1899
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:09,680
We do not have to select.

1900
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:10,760
Okay.

1901
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:15,000
Do we not have selected here guys,

1902
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:19,520
what are we looking for in here before
before we interact with dropdowns guys,

1903
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:25,600
what do we need to look at?

1904
02:15:25,600 --> 02:15:26,760
Okay,

1905
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:30,240
so you guess we can use select?

1906
02:15:30,240 --> 02:15:31,160
Okay. What?

1907
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:40,240
Why can we use select in this case?

1908
02:15:40,240 --> 02:15:40,480
Okay.

1909
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:46,880
Seems like we all forgot
what's going on with dropdowns guys.

1910
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:49,200
So we need to look for the tag. Right?

1911
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:52,760
In order for us to use the select class,

1912
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:57,080
we need to look at the tag
that has an HTML.

1913
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:59,760
Right? So we have a select tag in here.

1914
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:03,840
So that means we we can use select

1915
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:06,960
to class in here, right? So

1916
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:12,240
let's identify this by class name in here.

1917
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,040
Okay.

1918
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:16,800
So web element

1919
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:25,200
months dropdown is equal to the driver

1920
02:16:26,200 --> 02:16:28,760
find element

1921
02:16:28,760 --> 02:16:30,880
by class name,

1922
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:35,480
right?

1923
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:38,160
And then so I identified this element.

1924
02:16:38,240 --> 02:16:55,040
What is my next step guys?

1925
02:16:55,040 --> 02:17:00,960
So what we need to do, we need to create
an object of the select class, right?

1926
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:03,840
So select act

1927
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:06,680
select and here is equal to new

1928
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:10,800
select and inside our

1929
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:14,720
constructor, what we need to do,

1930
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,920
we need to pass this right.

1931
02:17:18,320 --> 02:17:21,320
Okay, so now when do we want to go?

1932
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:22,760
What month, guys?

1933
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:31,480
When do we want to go on vacation?

1934
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:32,160
Right now.

1935
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:35,160
Okay, so right now is what?

1936
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:36,840
Right now is October.

1937
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:39,600
Okay, So let's go in October. Right?

1938
02:17:39,800 --> 02:17:43,280
So how do I how do I select here?

1939
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:48,240
October, guys, how many ways
can we select any option from the dropdown

1940
02:17:57,360 --> 02:17:59,600
by visible text,

1941
02:17:59,600 --> 02:18:02,760
by value and by index.

1942
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:03,440
Right.

1943
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:08,520
So let's select by visible text
and so month dropdown

1944
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:13,000
that not the month dropdown right select

1945
02:18:14,560 --> 02:18:15,800
in here

1946
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:22,800
say select select by visible text.

1947
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:26,040
So if we want to go on October,
do I just put here October

1948
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:33,840
guys,

1949
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:37,440
we just need to put the visible text

1950
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:40,520
that we inside our dropdown.

1951
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:41,240
Right.

1952
02:18:41,240 --> 02:18:46,240
So in this case it's a different text,
it's just an abbreviation in here.

1953
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:50,720
So this is how we're going
to, we're going to put it in here.

1954
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:56,240
So we can put select months

1955
02:18:59,200 --> 02:18:59,800
here.

1956
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:03,000
Okay, So now guys

1957
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:10,120
in here, I need to choose the year
okay, do we need to choose the year?

1958
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:11,440
And here goes,

1959
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:16,040
Oh, we're going this year, so
we don't really need to change anything.

1960
02:19:16,040 --> 02:19:19,200
Right? So now let's go ahead and

1961
02:19:21,720 --> 02:19:24,440
start working on that date.

1962
02:19:24,880 --> 02:19:25,520
Right.

1963
02:19:25,520 --> 02:19:27,880
What date do we want to go

1964
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:30,000

1965
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:35,600

1966
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:39,920
On fifth.

1967
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:42,680
Oh, yeah. Birthdays today. Good. Okay.

1968
02:19:43,360 --> 02:19:45,960
I think I'm given the toughest class

1969
02:19:46,920 --> 02:19:50,600
on your birthday.

1970
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:53,720
Okay.

1971
02:19:53,720 --> 02:19:55,920
All right, let's go on.

1972
02:19:56,120 --> 02:19:57,720
I'm 21st.

1973
02:19:57,720 --> 02:20:02,520
Okay, so what we want to do,
we want to go on Sunday, 21st of October.

1974
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:09,320
Okay, so now,
if this whole thing is inside the table,

1975
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:21,520
guys,
how do we want to interact with the dates?

1976
02:20:21,520 --> 02:20:28,760
Any thoughts?

1977
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:30,360
Okay, list. Right.

1978
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:34,920
And what do we need to do
first, guys, before start, interact

1979
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:43,160
before we start everything
inside the list, find the tables.

1980
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:44,240
Right.

1981
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:47,960
So let's find

1982
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:51,160
the table in.

1983
02:20:51,160 --> 02:20:56,800
Okay, so this is our table
so we can identify this class name, right?

1984
02:20:56,800 --> 02:21:03,480
So let me copy this class name here.

1985
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:04,240
Table

1986
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:10,800
class is equal to

1987
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:12,640
this.

1988
02:21:12,640 --> 02:21:14,720
Okay, so I identified this.

1989
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,160
So now what?

1990
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:19,400
Where do we need to go, guys

1991
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:23,240
from here

1992
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:29,480
to the tea body.

1993
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:33,400
Tea body.

1994
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:35,680
I said head. No I said in header.

1995
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:39,360
All the days of the week are stored.

1996
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:40,680
Okay.

1997
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:43,160
So we don't really care
What day is it going to be.

1998
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:45,360
We care about the dates.

1999
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:49,320
Okay, so the dates will be stored
inside the tea body.

2000
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:52,080
Okay, so we identified the body.

2001
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:55,400
So now I need to go to my rows.

2002
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:56,200
Okay.

2003
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:01,320
So would that be sufficient guys
in order for me to identify where

2004
02:22:02,160 --> 02:22:05,040
what date I need to pick in here.

2005
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:08,640
So let's actually expand this.

2006
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:13,560
So we have five rows in here
and also have the TDs in here.

2007
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:21,440
Anything else
that I need to specify in here?

2008
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:24,800
Do I need to go over each row or do

2009
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:28,440
I need to go through the each date?

2010
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:37,160
Guys in here, we need to go to each date.

2011
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:37,920
Right.

2012
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:41,560
So we need to move one step forward.

2013
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:44,800
So if you look now, I have 35

2014
02:22:44,840 --> 02:22:48,120
elements in here
found like four of them is probably

2015
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:51,560
they are empty, right?

2016
02:22:51,560 --> 02:22:54,840
So here what I am doing, I'm going through

2017
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:57,960
each and every date, right?

2018
02:22:58,200 --> 02:23:03,680
So what I'm going to do in a copy
this express.

2019
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:04,920
Okay.

2020
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:08,280
And what I will do are stored

2021
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:14,400
in a list of web elements.

2022
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:14,960
Okay.

2023
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:18,600
So from dates is equal

2024
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:21,120
to whatever the

2025
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:25,360
elements, I

2026
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:30,360
expect, right?

2027
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:33,040
And let's

2028
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:38,040
import this.

2029
02:23:38,040 --> 02:23:40,880
So now what is my next step in here, guys?

2030
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:45,760
We need a four right.

2031
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:49,920
So for loop in here,

2032
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:54,080
so we have some dates, All right.

2033
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:56,320
And we'll be iterating

2034
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:59,640
through the web

2035
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:03,480
elements.

2036
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:04,920
All right.

2037
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:09,600
So once we start our ideation,
what's going to happen to us?

2038
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:20,000
What do we need to do?

2039
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:24,200
So, yeah, so that's a good question.

2040
02:24:24,200 --> 02:24:29,600
So you can send any text in here as well
because it's just a text box, right?

2041
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:33,880
But sometimes sometimes
you won't be able to do that.

2042
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:34,960
Okay.

2043
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:40,080
You will have to interact
with an actual calendar in here.

2044
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:41,000
Okay.

2045
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,080
But that's a good point.

2046
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:46,440
Yes, you can do that.

2047
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:46,680
Okay.

2048
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:48,600
All right.

2049
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:51,120
So we start iterating.

2050
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:54,520
So now what we need

2051
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:57,680
do we need to set a condition? Right.

2052
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,640
So it's

2053
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:02,920
in here.

2054
02:25:02,920 --> 02:25:06,280
My date.

2055
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:07,000
Right.

2056
02:25:08,280 --> 02:25:10,200
That text

2057
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:18,160
equals 21st, right?

2058
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:22,320
Then what I'm going to do,

2059
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:25,440
I'm going to simply click here.

2060
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:34,160
So after I click, what I need to do, guys,

2061
02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:41,520
I need to break right?

2062
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:41,960
All right.

2063
02:25:41,960 --> 02:26:03,680
So let's run
this and see if this is going to work.

2064
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:03,920
Okay?

2065
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:08,040
I think everyone is running their code,
guys, so let's not do that

2066
02:26:08,040 --> 02:26:10,640
because you can see it's it's very slow.

2067
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:20,800
Okay.

2068
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:21,240
Okay.

2069
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:25,440
There we go.

2070
02:26:25,440 --> 02:26:28,120
So it's

2071
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:31,440
from the dropdown with selected October,

2072
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:34,200
but it's not selecting 21.

2073
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:45,760
Why guys,

2074
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:49,440
I have all parentheses right in here.

2075
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:51,400
The default was 21.

2076
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:53,400
Now default is set, right?

2077
02:26:53,400 --> 02:26:56,360
Default is five.

2078
02:26:56,360 --> 02:26:59,600
There we go. We need quotation. Exactly.

2079
02:27:00,640 --> 02:27:02,160
Because whenever I get the

2080
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:05,560
text, what happens is we need

2081
02:27:06,080 --> 02:27:08,840
we get the string right.

2082
02:27:08,840 --> 02:27:10,360
So now

2083
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:15,840
and every time we interact with the text,
it's going to be string.

2084
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:20,800
So we have to compare this
with the string, right?

2085
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:26,840
So let me close these.

2086
02:27:26,840 --> 02:27:28,960
Okay, So now let's run that again

2087
02:27:44,120 --> 02:27:45,200
where it's a bit

2088
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:50,960
slow, guys.

2089
02:27:50,960 --> 02:27:51,840
There we go.

2090
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:55,800
So you can see that we will have here

2091
02:27:56,040 --> 02:27:58,680
October 21st.

2092
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:02,760
Okay.

2093
02:28:02,760 --> 02:28:05,720
Any questions, guys, on this?

2094
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:10,760
Any questions on how to handle calendars,

2095
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:12,880
how to handle pagination

2096
02:28:25,960 --> 02:28:27,280
questions until you forget.

2097
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:33,240
Okay, good.

2098
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:42,240
All right.

2099
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:43,480
Let's go to the notes.

2100
02:28:43,480 --> 02:28:46,440
So calendars, guys, calendars,

2101
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:49,680
they are

2102
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:53,440
also now

2103
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:58,480
as they focus.

2104
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:00,880
That's

2105
02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:02,920
all right, guys.

2106
02:29:02,920 --> 02:29:05,360
You guys seem really passive today.

2107
02:29:05,360 --> 02:29:09,160
It's either everything is really clear

2108
02:29:09,160 --> 02:29:12,400
and easy or you guys are tired.

2109
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:30,720
Today.

2110
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:37,520
Okay, So there's a lot of information.

2111
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:38,840
Not easy, correct?

2112
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:43,920
Yes. Okay.

2113
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:45,320
So here, you guys.

2114
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:46,680
Why this is not easy.

2115
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:51,320
Selenium itself is really easy, right?

2116
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:52,960
Selenium is very easy

2117
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:56,360
until you start

2118
02:29:56,360 --> 02:30:00,520
implementing the actual Java.

2119
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:01,120
Right.

2120
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:05,160
So if you struggle in Java,
guys will struggle with a lot of stuff.

2121
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:06,240
Okay.

2122
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:11,520
So what
I would suggest to focus more on Java,

2123
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:15,960
because the logic is going to be built
by the job, okay?

2124
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:18,360
Anything you do, anything,

2125
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:21,640
even in your framework.

2126
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:22,280
Okay.

2127
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:25,880
So whenever you start building
your framework,

2128
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:29,600
whenever you start combining
all the different different tools

2129
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:32,320
you need to be really,
really good at Java.

2130
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,040
Okay? So,

2131
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:39,600
so if you are really

2132
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:43,560
behind on Java guys, I'd suggest

2133
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:47,520
to study more on Java
because selenium itself is really easy,

2134
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:52,160
Test is really easy,
cucumber is, is really easy.

2135
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:52,800
It's simple.

2136
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:55,840
English, okay, But if you don't know Java,

2137
02:30:56,200 --> 02:30:59,520
that's going to be a big problem
even in the interview.

2138
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:04,920
And if you find a job, it's
going to be problem at work as well.

2139
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:24,000
Okay.

2140
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,080
Calendar handling.

2141
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:34,680
Yes. So yes.

2142
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:38,760
So basically, as I said,
guys, it's a combination, right?

2143
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:43,720
So you need to know when to click,
when to iterate

2144
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:47,320
and when to break the loop
or when to add another.

2145
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:48,720
Okay.

2146
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:51,720
So you have to build that logic in

2147
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:55,200
with combination Java and selenium.

2148
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:56,160
Okay.

2149
02:31:56,160 --> 02:32:00,600
And if you are really good in Java,
that's easy to build everything

2150
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:03,240
because the most logic that we're building

2151
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:06,440
is consist of Java language,

2152
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:10,920
these storing everything
inside the lease list and

2153
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:14,240
iterating through everything

2154
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:17,120
and setting the conditions,
everything there.

2155
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:19,440
It's coming from Java, right?

2156
02:32:19,440 --> 02:32:24,120
So we need to be really careful
in building the logic.

2157
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:32,160
Okay.

2158
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:39,040
All right, guys, any other questions?

2159
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:41,680
Yeah. You have to practice every
day, right, guys?

2160
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:42,720
It will.

2161
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:45,480
It will get in a

2162
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:50,040
habit, but it's a little it's
a little challenging right now

2163
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:53,520
because every day
we're starting something new.

2164
02:32:54,040 --> 02:32:57,120
And I know it's hard to catch up
sometimes.

2165
02:32:57,120 --> 02:32:59,880
I was in your shoes before and I

2166
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:06,240
and I know how it works.

2167
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:12,520
So every time we finish the class, try
to try to look at what we've done,

2168
02:33:12,520 --> 02:33:16,920
try to go through the logic
and write the actual code yourself,

2169
02:33:17,160 --> 02:33:19,080
do not copy and paste lies.

2170
02:33:19,080 --> 02:33:24,320
You will have time to copy and paste
after year when you confident.

2171
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:30,560
Okay.

2172
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:32,840
It's hard to believe. It's
hard to believe.

2173
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:34,520
I was in your shoes, guys.

2174
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:39,760
Is it what you say?

2175
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:40,720
No, I was guys.

2176
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:41,680
Okay.

2177
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,680
Trust me, I was struggling as well. So

2178
02:34:00,560 --> 02:34:03,000
I wasn't the perfect student either.

2179
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:03,560
Okay, guys.

2180
02:34:03,560 --> 02:34:09,280
So everything comes with practice.

2181
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:09,720
Okay, guys.

2182
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:13,640
So the more you practice, the better
you get in coding.

2183
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:21,720
Okay.

2184
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:22,080
Okay.

2185
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:53,320
Any other questions, guys?

2186
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:55,560
Okay. Seems like no questions

2187
02:35:02,400 --> 02:35:03,960
since we have 20 more minutes,

2188
02:35:03,960 --> 02:35:11,640
guys,

2189
02:35:11,640 --> 02:35:14,200
I can answer some questions

2190
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:20,400
over the pagination.

2191
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:21,240
Sure.

2192
02:35:21,360 --> 02:35:23,600
What is this? What is that?

2193
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:37,320
You didn't understand in the pagination
guys?

2194
02:35:37,320 --> 02:35:38,280
Sure.

2195
02:35:38,280 --> 02:35:38,960
Do you want to.

2196
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:41,040
You want me to go through the first

2197
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:51,400
example or the second one one?

2198
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:52,200
Okay,

2199
02:35:54,160 --> 02:35:59,000
So here, guys, what we're doing is

2200
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:02,400
simple in here.

2201
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:07,200
What we're doing, we are storing
all the rows inside the list, right?

2202
02:36:07,520 --> 02:36:11,640
So and we're identifying
the next one element.

2203
02:36:11,640 --> 02:36:19,080
After that, what we're doing is
we are having a Boolean value in here

2204
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:23,200
so that we can
so that we can have a wildly okay.

2205
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:26,480
So while loop is going to
it is going to help us

2206
02:36:26,760 --> 02:36:30,400
to click on the next button.

2207
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:31,080
Okay.

2208
02:36:31,080 --> 02:36:34,320
So what's going on in
here is for loop is fine.

2209
02:36:34,320 --> 02:36:38,320
We're iterating through the
through the rows and we're looking

2210
02:36:38,760 --> 02:36:41,320
for this condition, right?

2211
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:44,400
So if this condition is not met,

2212
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:49,440
we're going out of the loop
and we need to click the next

2213
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:50,920
right.

2214
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:53,720
So when we clicked on the next button,

2215
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:57,680
we need to start our iteration again,
right?

2216
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:00,800
So that's why we need this loop in order

2217
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:03,560
to get back to our for loop.

2218
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:09,600
Okay, So in the second iteration,
when we get back in here,

2219
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:14,040
we find this guy and our,
our conditions are met.

2220
02:37:14,360 --> 02:37:17,480
So once this condition is met,

2221
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:21,720
what we need to do,
we need to set this flag as false.

2222
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:22,640
Okay?

2223
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:27,000
And then we need to print this out,
print the roll out,

2224
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:30,640
and then what we need to
we need to break everything.

2225
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:31,440
Okay.

2226
02:37:31,440 --> 02:37:36,400
So basically
a loop is going to help us to reiterate

2227
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:41,880
over the rows
and to check on the condition

2228
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:48,480
and is to see if we need to click
on the next button as into

2229
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:57,960
any other questions

2230
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:04,320
I can answer.

2231
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:06,720
Any work related questions as well.

2232
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:10,920
Guys, if you want to ask
since we have 20 more minutes.

2233
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:13,200
If not, then we can wrap up the class.

2234
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:25,520
Guess.

2235
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:27,640
Okay. Homework. That's a very good.

2236
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:29,800
That's a very good point. Yes.

2237
02:38:29,800 --> 02:38:34,120
Homework, guys.

2238
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:43,600
Okay. So.

2239
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:45,600
Okay, so this is the homework.

2240
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:47,880
Okay.

2241
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:51,120
So what I want you to do, log in to this

2242
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:58,080
application right, click on leads,
click on live list.

2243
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:00,080
So come to this page.

2244
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:00,840
Okay.

2245
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:03,520
So interact

2246
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:06,000
with two different in here.

2247
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:07,640
Choose a date.

2248
02:39:07,640 --> 02:39:08,040
Okay.

2249
02:39:08,040 --> 02:39:13,960
From and to okay,
but do not just enter any text in here.

2250
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:17,160
Interact with an actual calendars in here.

2251
02:39:17,800 --> 02:39:18,240
Okay.

2252
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:23,440
So with the tables, with a dropdowns
and here so that you have more practice.

2253
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:24,560
Okay.

2254
02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:28,080
So when you're done with this,
what I want you to do,

2255
02:39:28,320 --> 02:39:32,120
I want you to click on cancel

2256
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:35,440
and reject the checkboxes.

2257
02:39:35,440 --> 02:39:38,880
Okay. So only on these two.

2258
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:42,960
Okay. So

2259
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:45,840
and then what I want you to do, I want you

2260
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:50,920
uncheck the pending approval checkbox.

2261
02:39:50,920 --> 02:39:52,960
Once you do that,

2262
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:57,440
you need to select
it support from this dropdown

2263
02:39:57,880 --> 02:40:00,960
and then you to click

2264
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:03,760
search and quit the browser.

2265
02:40:04,440 --> 02:40:05,040
Okay.

2266
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:07,120
Is that clear? Guys?

2267
02:40:07,640 --> 02:40:14,840
Any questions on the homework?

2268
02:40:14,840 --> 02:40:22,680
Okay, good.

2269
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:23,400
All right.

2270
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:26,120
So if there's no questions, guys

2271
02:40:26,840 --> 02:40:33,360
giving you back 16 minutes of your time.

2272
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:35,480
Seems like everyone is overwhelmed.

2273
02:40:35,480 --> 02:40:41,880
Guys,
you need a little bit of break right?

2274
02:40:41,880 --> 02:40:43,920
Am I still working as a tester?

2275
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:46,000
No, guys, I'm doing both. Actually.

2276
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,200
I'm a backend developer and a tester
at same

2277
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:56,160
time.

2278
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:59,400
Was it difficult for me at the start
when I just found

2279
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:04,960
when I just found a job?

2280
02:41:04,960 --> 02:41:09,040
Yes, it is a little bit difficult because
you don't really know what's happening

2281
02:41:12,520 --> 02:41:14,000
inside, the meetings, right?

2282
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,560
And there are a lot of new tools

2283
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:17,720
that you need to learn
and you need to pick up really quickly.

2284
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:19,600
Okay, So you're going to be you.

2285
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:21,120
They will give you time.

2286
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:21,640
Okay.

2287
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:25,280
When you start working, it's not that
they will give you some test cases.

2288
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:27,360
Okay, You need to automate this now.

2289
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:31,720
You will go through the boarding process,
through the everything.

2290
02:41:31,720 --> 02:41:34,200
You will go through training
and everything.

2291
02:41:34,200 --> 02:41:34,960
Okay.

2292
02:41:34,960 --> 02:41:36,160
But the one thing

2293
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:40,520
that is going to be a little bit
challenging is the meetings, right?

2294
02:41:40,520 --> 02:41:42,120
Because

2295
02:41:42,360 --> 02:41:45,120
you don't know what how the meetings go

2296
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:48,320
and you don't know how they actually do
the process.

2297
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:50,480
Okay. So that's going to be
a little challenging.

2298
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:52,800
Other than that, it should all be fine.

2299
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:54,040
Okay.

2300
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:57,520
Learning new tools is going to be fine
because you're going to get training

2301
02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:00,240
and you will be Googling yourself,

2302
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:04,360
okay.

2303
02:42:04,360 --> 02:42:06,760
Yes, they will be looking at you
as experienced.

2304
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:07,960
TESTER Absolutely right.

2305
02:42:07,960 --> 02:42:13,320
So and first first two weeks,
three weeks, guys, no one is going to

2306
02:42:15,560 --> 02:42:18,080
no one is going to

2307
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:21,600
what's called ask you to do this
or that that you don't know.

2308
02:42:21,600 --> 02:42:22,160
Okay.

2309
02:42:22,160 --> 02:42:25,720
Even in the meetings, guys,
they won't ask you lot of questions.

2310
02:42:26,040 --> 02:42:26,920
Okay.

2311
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:30,560
So you're just going to sit
in the meetings in the first two

2312
02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:35,120
or three weeks because you don't know
the application, you don't know the tools.

2313
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:39,640
So you're just going to be observing
everything, everyone, what

2314
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:44,640
what they're doing, how they talk,
what they talk about in what meetings.

2315
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:53,400
Okay, So don't be that

2316
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:58,320
stressed, what you're going to be doing
when, you when you just start working.

2317
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:02,040
Okay? So it's okay.

2318
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:05,960
My training was since
my project is government,

2319
02:43:05,960 --> 02:43:09,360
I had more time
because I needed to get the clearance.

2320
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:10,200
Okay.

2321
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:12,600
So without the clearance,
I didn't have any access.

2322
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:16,360
So my my training was a little bit longer.

2323
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:18,400
I think it was three, four weeks.

2324
02:43:18,840 --> 02:43:21,920
But after the second week,
I already started coding.

2325
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:22,360
Okay,

2326
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:27,240
They'll start giving you.

2327
02:43:27,240 --> 02:43:29,520
They'll start giving you small tasks.

2328
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:30,600
Okay, guys.

2329
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:34,360
So they will not give
you really big stories to complete

2330
02:43:34,360 --> 02:43:39,280
because you don't really know.

2331
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:42,040
They don't really you don't really know
the application, right?

2332
02:43:43,400 --> 02:43:44,840
Without the clearance. Yes.

2333
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:46,800
So if you find a full time job,

2334
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:50,040
they'll hire you first
and then you can apply for clearance.

2335
02:43:50,440 --> 02:43:54,480
But sometimes most of the time,
if they don't let you start

2336
02:43:54,480 --> 02:43:59,280
without the clearance is when you get
is when you get the job as a contractor.

2337
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:00,280
Okay.

2338
02:44:00,280 --> 02:44:03,120
But you will get through it
at the end of the course.

2339
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:11,520
Okay, guys.

2340
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:12,240
Well, it depends.

2341
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:14,960
It also depends on the company.

2342
02:44:14,960 --> 02:44:20,400
How they want to work it out.

2343
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:24,280
Tomorrow's topic is calendars and

2344
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:27,880
we will be interacting with more calendars

2345
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:31,800
tomorrow,
taking screenshots and actions plus.

2346
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:43,520
Okay I'm

2347
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:46,560
I'm from batch for

2348
02:44:47,760 --> 02:44:50,720
you guys are what batch ten.

2349
02:44:50,720 --> 02:44:57,760
Oh well I know it's
not the last class for selenium right.

2350
02:44:57,760 --> 02:45:04,360
We have next week as well.

2351
02:45:04,360 --> 02:45:06,640
What is clearance usually included.

2352
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:09,280
Do they check your job history.
Yes they do.

2353
02:45:09,600 --> 02:45:12,800
They will check everything and

2354
02:45:13,840 --> 02:45:15,360
you will go through this process.

2355
02:45:15,360 --> 02:45:15,720
Okay.

2356
02:45:15,720 --> 02:45:19,120
Don't don't be really scared
about the clearance jobs, okay?

2357
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:22,720
Because you will pass that
and unless you are a criminal

2358
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:26,680
or anything
or a convicted felon in the previous life.

2359
02:45:26,680 --> 02:45:27,280
Okay.

2360
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:30,760
So if you don't have any of these,
you will be you should be fine

2361
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:43,080
on passing defense.

2362
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:44,960
If they give me my first salary.

2363
02:45:44,960 --> 02:45:46,080
What do you mean

2364
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:11,480
for salary?

2365
02:46:11,640 --> 02:46:13,040
Oh, okay. Okay.

2366
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:14,560
Yeah, that's the contract.

2367
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:32,440

2368
02:46:32,440 --> 02:46:48,920

02:46:54,840 --> 02:46:56,520
Okay? Everything is good.

2372
02:46:56,520 --> 02:46:58,680
You will get overwhelmed. That is fine.

2373
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:00,080
Take a break, guys.

2374
02:47:00,080 --> 02:47:01,120
Start over.

2375
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:03,480
Okay, so everything is going to be okay.

2376
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:06,240
So let's push it a little bit more.

2377
02:47:06,600 --> 02:47:07,840
There is a little less.

2378
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:08,680
Okay, guys.

2379
02:47:08,680 --> 02:47:11,080
So we're almost done with selenium.

2380
02:47:11,280 --> 02:47:14,520
There's a couple more tools
that you're going to learn and that's it.

2381
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:15,960
You're going to be on the market.

2382
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:18,960
Okay,
So everything is going to be good for us.

2383
02:47:20,160 --> 02:47:21,600
Okay.

2384
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:25,360

Okay.

02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:32,600
All right, guys.

2388
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:33,920
Thanks, everybody.
