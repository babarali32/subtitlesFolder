1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,920
We are not.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,120
We have now started to record.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,880
So that's very important, right?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,760
We is Asia

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,240
and it's but

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,760
we should know the path.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,480
Right.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,840
And then the second important thing,
the second important place that will

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,080
always help you create that connection

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,120
or open that file inside the Java program.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,720
What was the name If I am reading
the data, what was the name of that file?

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,200
No, no, no.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,840
Before load file import steam.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,160
Right. That file import stream object.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,280
It creates that connection.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,400
It it lowers the your file inside

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,200
Java program you can think of like this.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,920
So we

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,680
we should know the port

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,360
and then

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,360
we can use file.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,040
I have private file.

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,160
It could not find it printed out.

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,240
Only the word username
which is road inside us out

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,560
here to check if there is a connection.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,080
Yes, there's a class.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,240
It's a class.

28
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
So we should know the path.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
Then we can use file

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,240
input stream class

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,040
to load that file

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,160
inside Java

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,400
program. Right.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,000
So we started discussing about the

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,880
file input stream.

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,480
So if I show you

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,600
this is the description about that
filing for stream class.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,040
If file stream obtains input

39
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,880
by from a file in a file system.

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
So this by its use

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,240
is the same
that the type that we discussed

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,800
in our first class
that it can hold only 256.

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,640
So all the data is loaded in the form of

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,080
what files are available
depends on the host environment.

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,400
Filing for stream
is meant for reading speeds

46
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,720
offered by such as image data

47
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,320
for reading streams
of characters, content of using file data.

48
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,680
So all the data that you guys
will be relating

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
to this file in your stream
will be read in the form of bytes.

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,360
So you guys

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,720
can think of this file stream
if kind of goes

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,400
to that bot that you guys specify

53
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,400
and then reads all the data in the form of

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,600
you can think of in the form of raw bytes

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,880
is not in the form of text

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,000
or in the form of key value
first, key value pairs.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,960
Yet when we use this file
input stream inside these properties,

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,560
then that raw data is actually converted
in the form of developers.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,480
Okay.

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,960
And then from this property object,
we can start getting the properties.

61
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,320
Does it make sense how these
all these different

62
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:49,640
things are linked together?

63
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,720
So this object,
it will go inside your computer

64
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,360
on the spot,
It will read the data in raw form.

65
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,920
Then this object that we are creating,
we are calling this load method in here.

66
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,880
So this raw data will be converted

67
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,680
into will
be converted to those value pairs.

68
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,640
And then using this object,
we can start getting those key

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,040
value pairs.

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,200
So in simple terms,
you guys can think of fighting

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,600
for spin class laws
that file inside the Java program.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,040
Yes. Rather to in the form of zeros
and ones in the form of bytes. Yes.

73
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,160
You are right.

74
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,240
Filing for same laws.

75
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,800
The Delta

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,680
inside the program in the form of.

77
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,640
And if there is any issue

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,640
like, for example,
if that class is not present.

79
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,480
So you have specified the part
and there is no file on that pass.

80
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,800
So what added you guys will get

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,600
this property is object object.

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,880
Convert that data to developers.

83
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,920
Exception. What is that famous exception?

84
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,040
No file found no such file found.

85
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,720
Right.

86
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,520
So if you specify the wrong path or

87
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,640
if that file is not present
or there is an issue, maybe with the

88
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,040
extensions or you guys

89
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,880
are using a wrong separator, those forward
slashes are backward slashes.

90
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
They are a little different.

91
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,960
On Windows, Linux and Mac,
they are a little different.

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,360
They work differently.

93
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,040
So you guys will be getting this file
not found exception.

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,440
Most notably so loaded that are inside

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,920
the program in the form of bytes.

96
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,040
Then using that properties

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,240
dot law

98
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,200
method

99
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,760
that is converted to come

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,080
on, show me the correct path
exception. Yes.

101
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,440
So in the next class I will show you
how to create your own exceptions.

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,360
Then you guys can create
any type of funny errors or exceptions.

103
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,720
The property does.

104
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,920
Load metadata is converted to

105
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,000
e value pairs.

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,480
And what is the parent
class of this properties

107
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,880
class guys

108
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
from which class this class is inheriting

109
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,200
the map class, which means what does it
mean?

110
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,440
Guys?

111
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,520
Can I use all the methods that are present
inside that map, inside

112
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
this property class?

113
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Can I use all those matters?

114
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,000
So all the properties and methods
they are available to?

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,560
This property is class.

116
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,080
So property
load metadata is going to be pairs

117
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,240
and we can use the

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
method from

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,960
map inter

120
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,000
interface to read and

121
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,920
right at the back.

122
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,640
Right.

123
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,960
So this is,

124
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,680
this is what we did in the last class.

125
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,000
Are there questions?

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,920
Is there anything that is confusing you
or maybe some piece of code?

127
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,160
They are not making sense
why we are using specific files

128
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,880
which kind of map the hash table

129
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,280
the tried to save map.

130
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,840
You guys remember that thread
synchronization transitive.

131
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,960
So the only difference
between that cache table and the hash map

132
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:56,280
is that if transitive arrest is seen,
Do you mean is it good idea

133
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:05,680
or do you still have any questions? Yes.

134
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,720
No. All code

135
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,320
is bought from content and absolute,

136
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,360
but the same are
they are not same actually on different

137
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,000
operating systems,
there are different types of files,

138
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,800
different types of parts, absolute bar
to that relative part.

139
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,160
And there are other types of parts.

140
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,240
So let me check

141
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,440
the types of parts in Java I guess,

142
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,360
and there are separate files to

143
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,520
those parts as well.

144
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,280
And they have introduced
more types of boss in Java eight,

145
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,160
but most probably
you guys will be using the relative back

146
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,480
or the

147
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,800
absolute part.

148
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,880
So there is this absolute part.

149
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,720
This is the relative part

150
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,080
and there are these
relatively than normal.

151
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,840
So those who are interested more in part,
you guys can read this, this blog

152
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,440
for me,
it works when I copy the absolute part,

153
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
but when I use the part content,
it would not work.

154
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,920
I have to take the longer part.

155
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,720
Let me check. There must be

156
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,560
there must be something

157
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:41,960
that you may be doing wrong.

158
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,160
Okay.

159
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,360
Actually, there is a whole new library
that the Java guys

160
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,600
have introduced

161
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
in Java eight,

162
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,240
so there is a complete
new set of classes and interfaces,

163
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,440
but it will take like two more months
to learn about all those.

164
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,800
It took me three months to learn myself.

165
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,920
So there is a huge, huge deal

166
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,320
about these parts and everything,
file handling

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,520
and all that.

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
So we will not be going
into those details.

169
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,520
But can you share this screenshot
when you use the content part

170
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,400
and it does not work?

171
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,480
What did you get?

172
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,040
So today we will learn guys
how to read and write Excel file.

173
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,120
But before that I want to show you

174
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,480
something.

175
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,040
So if I say

176
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,000
the let's,

177
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,680
let's have a recap as well.

178
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,080
So let's say guys something easy
you see the same as

179
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,800
So let's say, guys, I want to read this

180
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,360
I want to read the data
from this config dot properties.

181
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,560
So what should be the first thing?

182
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,120
How can I read the data from this
this file?

183
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,200
Well, what should I do

184
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,280
with the bar?

185
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,040
Right.

186
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:35,000
And if I am inside the integrity,
how can I get the part to

187
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,160
right click

188
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,320
and then copy what reference?

189
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,080
Now if we click on that
we will be getting multiple options.

190
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,120
I bought from the repository part
from the content road

191
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,360
file name, absolute part, right?

192
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:07,080
So the issue with the absolute parts
is that are

193
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,800
these absolute parts they can be different
on different computers.

194
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,440
For example, on my screen you see C users

195
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
as one of the ideal projects
on your computer.

196
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,800
You guys will see a different

197
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,200
but right depending upon
where you have stored your project.

198
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,800
So if I push this code through the GitHub
and if you guys clone discord,

199
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,640
you have to go and change wherever
I have used this part inside my project,

200
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,680
you have to change this part
everywhere, right?

201
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,960
To make this project work

202
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,000
because it will be a

203
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,680
different part on your computer,

204
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,720
even though the file is present
inside the project,

205
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,160
even though the file is present
inside this aspect batch.

206
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,000
Devin
If you clone this project from the GitHub

207
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,560
and if I have used this absolute part

208
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
before, you guys can run this project,

209
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,560
you have to change this part
according to your computers.

210
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,080
No, if we use the relative part,
you see the really relative part,

211
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,640
it starts from files
and then config dot properties

212
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,240
if I use relative parts.

213
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,200
So wherever you will be storing
your project, it will not affect

214
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,240
how the project is structured
internally inside your intelligent.

215
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,120
This files dot config got properties.

216
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,600
It will be same everywhere.

217
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,800
So that's why the relative boss
they are preferable.

218
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,240
Okay.

219
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,120
You guys will be having different issues
if I use absolute boss

220
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,880
because they can be different
on different computers.

221
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
So whenever we are developing
a project of another, we are writing code.

222
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,880
We never try to use things
which are specify to our computers.

223
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,000
If I push this code to the dev environment
or the cube environment,

224
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,400
that part will be different
and my project will not work right?

225
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,520
Does it make sense? Guys?

226
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,320
If I push this to a

227
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,440
server I will be getting an issue right.

228
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,640
File not found issue.

229
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,640
So I should always press for the

230
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,600
relative paths

231
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,160
to string

232
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,960
but equal to if for some of you

233
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,520
if this part is not working,
please post in this fourth channel.

234
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,640
It should work
because this is the best practice.

235
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,320
This is how you guys will be doing it.

236
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,760
And you guys, all of you understand why,
why we are using

237
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,560
the relative parts

238
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,680
better.

239
00:14:59,240 --> 00:14:59,640
All right.

240
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,400
So what is the next thing, guys,
that I need

241
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,120
to read the data

242
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,200
so far?

243
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,400
Trump file the party's prompt. Yes.

244
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,720
Only the name will change in here.

245
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,040
Only the name of the file
will change in here.

246
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,960
Best of things.

247
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,920
They will be same.

248
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,960
So the next thing is the file input
stream.

249
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,480
Right.

250
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,840
I now must bring the back from this file
inside my Java program

251
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,440
so that my Java program
can process this data.

252
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,840
So I use and if I have to write the data
which which class I should use guys.

253
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,040
So if I have to read the data,
I use file input screen.

254
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
But what if I have to write the data

255
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,840
is the file output stream, right?

256
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,680
This is how the water flows
in and out in our homes, right?

257
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,040
So if you are washing
some dishes in basins, right.

258
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,400
If you need water,
you open that tap, right?

259
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,120
The water sinks in and then the water
goes away from a different pipe.

260
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,960
So then you have to read the data
from the file system.

261
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,280
We use file input, same when we have less
did that to the hard disk

262
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,160
when we have to store the data to the hard
disk, we use the file output stream.

263
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,280
So that's why we have these two different
classes. Yes.

264
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,880
Like your wife washing your laptop. Yes.

265
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,160
So five steam is equal to new

266
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,120
file input.

267
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,000
Same.

268
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,640
And this file input stream guys,
it expects the block.

269
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,280
So I provided the port
and now I get this out of this error.

270
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,440
Actually what this error is saying.
You're saying that.

271
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,760
Yes, that's the device saying that the
what if I tried to read that file

272
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,840
and that file is not present
on your computer?

273
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,320
What do you want me to do? Right.

274
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,040
So we will learn how to write backup code.

275
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,720
In the case of these kind of scenarios.

276
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,240
So when your Java program is trying to
do something and there are some problems,

277
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,960
for example,
reading the that file is not present.

278
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,800
Trying to connect to the Internet.

279
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,880
Internet connection is not available.

280
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,280
So in those cases, Java says that,
Hey guys, tell me what you want me to do

281
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,680
if that happens.

282
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,080
So right now we are saying that,
Hey, Java, if you don't file,

283
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,840
don't find this file,
stop our program and throw the exception.

284
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,400
So this is the default behavior.

285
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,680
So that's why we are saying
add the exception pool method signature.

286
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,200
So right now
we are saying we will tell you later

287
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,480
how to deal with this issue
if that file is not found out, if the

288
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,640
if the part is incorrect
or something like that.

289
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,600
Okay.

290
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,160
All right.

291
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,360
So now I have read the data

292
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:30,360
in the form of raw bytes.

293
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:39,040
You guys have created a meme out of it.

294
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,200
Yes, Luba? Yes.

295
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,520
I think that

296
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,280
that thing is not same in here right now.

297
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,520
We are throwing file not found exception.

298
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,080
The later thing is actually
a parent child relationship

299
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,480
and it covers this error as well.

300
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,600
So that's why you don't have to write it
and you only write file

301
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,920
input output stream. I will.

302
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,320
I will teach you
how to be filing for streams.

303
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,840
And what are these file on found
exceptions and all that.

304
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Reading the data in the

305
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,200
form of

306
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
the lives.

307
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,280
Ladies.

308
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,200
You see, I give you unique ideas, right?

309
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,600
You see, I will.

310
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,480
You guys can try these ideas

311
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,520
on your husband's

312
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
reading the time
they come up for our lives

313
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,480
in the Java

314
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,080
program

315
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,000
page How to make by Post this to.

316
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,640
It's very easy. It is

317
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,680
to put the dosage inside the machine
and just start

318
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,320
by doing something on your iPad
or something like that.

319
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,320
And when you smell something wrong,

320
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,360
then you have to get out of those
both around the multi

321
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,400
and then make it loud nice.

322
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,960
Oh my God.

323
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,040
Oh my God. I forgot so that

324
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,000
no one is angry at you.

325
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,400
Is it?

326
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,920
Is it as right?

327
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,120
So you have to make that drama as well.

328
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,320
It's the it's part of the recipe. It

329
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,520
so violent per stream

330
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,960
And then what is the next thing guys

331
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,320
all of us did when we were new brothers

332
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,400
So next now I need to convert this rather
to into something meaningful.

333
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,320
Right. That we can understand.

334
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,360
So we use another class
that is called property.

335
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,800
So properties, properties, new

336
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,680
properties.

337
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,720
And there
is this method properties dot law

338
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,600
that will read the raw data

339
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:22,000
and it will convert it to developer. Yes.

340
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,040
And I now I can start getting the data
from this file.

341
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,320
So for example, if I want to read,

342
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,360
maybe let's say a password from here

343
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,640
so I can see

344
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,920
s out

345
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
properties, not get property.

346
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,160
So this get the property, it will return
you the data in the form of a string.

347
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,720
But this that method,
it will return you in the form of of gulp.

348
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,560
And then you have to do proper casting.

349
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:06,080
So this get property is preferred.

350
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,240
And now I should be able to

351
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,840
read that password from my fly.

352
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:27,360
Okay.

353
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,960
All right.

354
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,760
Get property, you guys.

355
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,920
No story, you guys, no

356
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,480
list.

357
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,520
We will not be discussing
load from access or stored that simple.

358
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,640
So we will be.

359
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,400
There are two types of files
that we use to store the data.

360
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,960
One, the common ones.

361
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,720
They are exemplar files
and these properties files.

362
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,680
So both of them, they are a kind of 50 50%

363
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:02,440
used in the industry.

364
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,280
So these are all of these methods.

365
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,040
They are coming from the parent class

366
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,720
of that map interface.

367
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,120
Okay.

368
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,080
You guys want if you guys want to use,
you guys can use those.

369
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
And so that

370
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,520
okay,

371
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,600
I get an error.

372
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,480
What is the reason?

373
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,320
If you get null, it means that
you have not specified the one.

374
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,320
Do you have to press all
to enter and then you have to

375
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,200
add that

376
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,240
exception to the method signature in here
like this or right.

377
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,160
This line throws Iowa exception
after the signature after this

378
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,760
method closing parentheses,

379
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,160
you'll get to make sure that there is no.

380
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,280
So that comes out null.

381
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,120
It comes out null.

382
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,240
Maybe if maybe you are using the wrong
spelling done,

383
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,680
maybe there is something
in uppercase or lowercase,

384
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:12,000
or maybe that property
is not present inside your file.

385
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
So this is how we read the data.

386
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,640
What if, guys, I have to write the data.

387
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,760
What should I do if I have variety
that let's say I want to insert

388
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:31,560
a new property inside the file.

389
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,680
So first I can say properties dot

390
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,360
set property right

391
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,360
and let's say the property name
I want to be.

392
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,920
You are L and then

393
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,840
I want to set it to

394
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,840
in Google dot com.

395
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
I tried both.

396
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,440
When I pass absolute it works,
but not when I use the fourth content.

397
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,480
I send this screenshot for now
I will work with the absolute.

398
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,440
Okay, we can change it.

399
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,680
Right? Not file output stream.

400
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,240
Yes, we will be using the file
artwork screen.

401
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,280
Yes. So out only when

402
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,720
we want to

403
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,240
write the data it will be file.

404
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,520
So we will be using file

405
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,800
output stream.

406
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,640
File output stream is equal to nil

407
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,880
file output stream
and then what should I pass inside

408
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,400
deconstruct guys

409
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,720
the part where I want to store the data.

410
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,600
So what is happening right now?

411
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:10,520
All the data from that file,
with the help of this file input stream,

412
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,480
all the data from that file
is being loaded inside this Java program

413
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,800
and we are now processing.

414
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,480
We are doing whatever
we want to do with that data and then

415
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,760
actually every time we use this file

416
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,200
output stream,
we actually we are creating a new file.

417
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,280
Okay.

418
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,480
So can you guys tell me

419
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,960
Okay, first
let me show you actually what happens.

420
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,440
So I passed the button here

421
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,920
and then which method I should use

422
00:26:51,920 --> 00:27:10,080
to store the data inside that firebase.

423
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,200
So properties dot

424
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,120
store

425
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,240
and I pass the file output stream

426
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,560
and then some comments, let's say

427
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,680
added new

428
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,800
property

429
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,560
the other.

430
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,560
So if I execute this program

431
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,760
and if I open this file

432
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:54,640
in parallel in here, I see my
you are right.

433
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,080
I see my you are.

434
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,960
But can you guys
tell me if I don't use the file

435
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,520
input screen?

436
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,720
If I don't use the file
input stream, why this error please

437
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,840
file import stream.

438
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,200
You have not defined the object file
input stream.

439
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,960
Now you have not written
this file in your stream line,

440
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,040
so how can you use that variable?

441
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:39,160
You have not defined this file in pristine
variable. You

442
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,200
you have to write this line right before

443
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,240
back load method
file and post-game file statement.

444
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,080
Part.

445
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,120
So guys, if I execute this program
without first

446
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,480
reading the data from the file using file

447
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,720
input stream and loading the data,
what do you guys think?

448
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,920
When I ignore this program,
what will happen to this file?

449
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,920
What that I will see inside that file.

450
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:16,080
So if I execute this program,

451
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,200
all the data from that file is gone.

452
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,960
And now I only see the you are.

453
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,320
Then why it happens?

454
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,000
Because we didn't load did.

455
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,960
So this file output stream,
it always creates a new file.

456
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,120
It always creates a new file.

457
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,560
So if we want to retain

458
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,200
the previous data
that is present inside that file,

459
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,240
we must use the file import stream.

460
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,880
We must load all the data
inside this object.

461
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,920
This property is object,
and then we should try do that.

462
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,600
Otherwise, already present
data will be gone

463
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,240
if you guys are not loading that
that our first inside your program did.

464
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,640
So this is a very common mistake.

465
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,720
So make sure you guys are not doing this
mistake and the comments are overwritten

466
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,360
with a timestamp
anyway to check the history

467
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,520
of those revisions.

468
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,680
I don't think so. It is possible.
This file?

469
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,480
I don't think so.

470
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,280
It maintains the history of the comments.

471
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,480
Could you comment Line 16 This one.

472
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,280
I have already commented this line,

473
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,520
so before you guys

474
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,760
can write the data to a file,

475
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,840
you must load the data

476
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,720
that is already present inside that file.

477
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,520
Inside this property is object
because this file output stream,

478
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,960
it always creates a new file
and it overrides

479
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,840
whatever is present
previously at that part.

480
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,040
So you will lose everything
that is already present.

481
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,280
So if you want to retain the data
that is already present,

482
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:09,520
you must first load that data
with the help of file input steam

483
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,560
and you must restore that data inside

484
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,240
of the properties object

485
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,440
that it makes sense.

486
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,760
Could you have used the DOT,
put metadata to store the data?

487
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,360
So when we load the data, we don't need
to write that, put it automatically.

488
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,520
It reads all the data from the file
and stored the inside.

489
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,640
This properties object.

490
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,440
So this is how you should
normally write your program.

491
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,160
So we have to use file in post-game,
not lose all the data. Yes.

492
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,720
Yes. You are right. So let's say

493
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
I have a

494
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,760
third property.

495
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,880
Will are the data.

496
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,040
Yes. Yes.

497
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,160
Set property
or put to method from that map interface.

498
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,440
You guys can use both

499
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,320
how to get back.

500
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,480
There is no way to get back.

501
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,040
It's gone.

502
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,400
If you guys want to get back your files.

503
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,400
I have told you.

504
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,000
How can I get back my previous files?

505
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Previous versions of file in invalid.

506
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,680
You guys.

507
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,600
Do you guys remember
how to get back the files?

508
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,000
Maybe if I made any changes,
how can I get back those changes?

509
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,560
I can right click on my project
and then I can click on local history

510
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,520
and then show history

511
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,880
and you'll see if I click on this

512
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:54,640
config file,

513
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,360
let me close this,

514
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:11,720
not this one.

515
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,360
So now I see that

516
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,200
is saying that there
previously you had this data in here

517
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,560
and now you change the out staccato this
so I can click on this arrow

518
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,480
and then if I close this

519
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,640
I should see my back to back in here
like this.

520
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,120
This is how I can get that my

521
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,280
okay so

522
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,640
let me put back inside of the components.

523
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,920
We should always load the data

524
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,840
in the

525
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,960
in the Java program.

526
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,000
It gives me an error underline it being

527
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,960
properties because you are passing

528
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,160
file in stream to in here
you have path file output same

529
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,560
monad

530
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,040
one one on the you are still there before

531
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,640
it's been around
three more than three months.

532
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,800
We should always load the data
in the Java program

533
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,440
before we

534
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,320
provide the new data for their file

535
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,600
using PY output thing to

536
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,800
avoid losing

537
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,800
and that

538
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,800
yesterday was his birthday.

539
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,360
So today mistakes are forgivable.

540
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:19,880
Okay,

541
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,400
so guys, if I have this back to

542
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,240
Dom on

543
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,280
the master.

544
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,960
So let's say, let's say

545
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:49,600
let's add Neo that.

546
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,560
So if I execute this program guys, will
I lose all of this data or will

547
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,880
data will be retained
and I will see this new property

548
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,320
added in here.

549
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,800
So I am using file import stream.

550
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,360
I am frustrating the data
inside this object

551
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:17,600
and then I am writing this data
with the help of file output.

552
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,000
Fine.

553
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,440
Yes. We added this new property server

554
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:32,680
and the name is dev dev
or if sought for development, will

555
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:44,840
I lose this database
if I execute this program?

556
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,920
So I see the new data in here.

557
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,680
If I use file import scheme

558
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,440
and then I don't lose detect,

559
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,800
then I don't suppose to code.

560
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,440
So this was all about the properties file.

561
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,800
If you guys have any questions
you guys can ask

562
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,560
and now we will move to Excel files.

563
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,200
They are much more exciting

564
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,600
because of the right properties.

565
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,000
Dot Lord fight or state.

566
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,640
Yes sir.

567
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,880
Because we wrote this line.

568
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,960
No, it's not easy peasy.

569
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,240
I think

570
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,440
it's.

571
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,800
Are you guys ready?

572
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,600
Okay,

573
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:56,960
so let's do this.

574
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,680
So let's create a new file.

575
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,960
Thank you for being always honest with us.

576
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,680
Does it help

577
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,760
help you guys when I say something is easy
and let's say, for example,

578
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,760
if I really tell you
that something is not easy.

579
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,480
So we will not.

580
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,160
Not really. It does not tell help.

581
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,240
I should be honest with you.

582
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,760
Okay. So let let me be honest.

583
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,280
Due to the two days, glass is hard.

584
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,120
Does it help now?

585
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,560
Do you guys feel better

586
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,160
or not at all?

587
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,720
Well, what does what does help that

588
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,880
at least we would not be disappointed.

589
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,280
Nothing else.

590
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,240
Okay, let's create a new file,

591
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,600
a new Excel file.

592
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,520
So I hope you guys know.

593
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,360
At least you guys know how to create the
if new file on your computer.

594
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,520
Please don't disappoint me,
especially the Mac users.

595
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,360
Let's create
an Excel file on your computers

596
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,640
so new and

597
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,600
then X Excel x work sheet.

598
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,520
Okay, let's create this one.

599
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,680
No class helps

600
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,400
and let me give it a name.

601
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,520
Batch 11.

602
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,880
Yes, it should be same.

603
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,160
Give me create a excel sheet

604
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,760
using that W piece.

605
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,040
Make sure that the extension is x, l x
and you guys are able.

606
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,280
I think I have the AWP as well
on my computer.

607
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:07,080
So if I you see WP office,
I have that as well.

608
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,360
So if you guys don't know
you guys can do this.

609
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,920
Those who have WP s office
open that WP sources

610
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,080
and you guys should see
something like this.

611
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,600
Now you have to click on this spreadsheet
Those who have Excel,

612
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,200
you have to click on this spreadsheet

613
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,160
and then a new blank spreadsheet

614
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,720
and then you can save it

615
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,400
from using the save button in here
anywhere on your computer

616
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,320
on maybe next up, just

617
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,680
give me accidentally

618
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,240
and then you should see this.

619
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,560
Give me your excellence

620
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,760
x l s x.

621
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,400
This should be the extension. Yes.

622
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,400
In here
we don't need to change the x x extension

623
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,480
only Excel extension
will work with the updated dots.

624
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,680
Yes, I hope so.

625
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,400
And this time. But I have never tried.

626
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,280
Maybe putting a different extension.

627
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,440
How it will affect your program.

628
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:27,600
You guys can try that as well.

629
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,760
Let me know once all of you have the have

630
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,560
a excel X file on your computer.

631
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,040
I can't see Miriam.

632
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,840
You don't have Excel or WP or OpenOffice

633
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:49,640
on your computer.

634
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,320
The extension, I mean, maybe you have
hidden the extensions, so it's fine.

635
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,920
I shared a video on the course
announcement.

636
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,040
You guys can enable the extensions
on Windows Machine using that video.

637
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,520
It's a very short video.

638
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,000
So there is my file, which is Acrobat 11.

639
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,120
We must pass something on that file.

640
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,040
Yes. Let's put some data in here.

641
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,160
So let's put maybe

642
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,360
call and then $5.

643
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,800
Okay.

644
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,360
Like this.

645
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,960
And then let's put maybe gain

646
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,000
and then

647
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,760
Alexi

648
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,440
or Galaxy Happy now

649
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,920
and let's put any data inside anyway.

650
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,480
Just make sure
that you don't put that data too much

651
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,880
from this starting columns

652
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,240
because it will be hard to read that data.

653
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,320
Maybe,

654
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,000
Your Highness

655
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,560
x l x x

656
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,200
x should be at the end of the

657
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,200
then using your actual

658
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,320
Is there anyone who is still unable

659
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:37,800
to create the file?

660
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,120
I'm Ron.
Are you getting any issues errors?

661
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,200
Do you have excel or something like that

662
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,920
on your computer

663
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:56,800
or you don't know how to create

664
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,920
a file?

665
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,440
It's fine. It's fine.

666
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,400
Maybe you guys are.

667
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,440
So let me let let me send my a file.

668
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,480
Those who don't know how to create a file,

669
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,040
you guys can use my file.

670
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,200
Amran, Use my file. Place that file.

671
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,480
So copy this file.

672
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,080
So copy this file and

673
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,200
place

674
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,120
that file in here inside your files
directory.

675
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:35,760
Okay.

676
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,920
Control C Control. We

677
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,200
like this.

678
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,720
We could have just open

679
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,960
the same directory through Excel program,
I suppose.

680
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,400
Or there is some advantage for WP
is not the same.

681
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,320
Pretty much same.

682
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,760
Yes. Normal, actually.

683
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,040
Okay.

684
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,560
We should do that too with our file.

685
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,760
No, you guys just put any data
inside your excel file

686
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,600
and store your files
under this files folder.

687
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,240
If you guys know the parts of your file

688
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,880
on your computer,
you guys can use that part as well.

689
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,360
But because a lot of you faced
many issues, you started, That's why I am

690
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,160
storing this file under this file folder

691
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:35,440
so that you guys don't face issues.

692
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:44,280
Yeah, Control C, control
B, you'll get to control

693
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,200
C and then select your file
folder and control it.

694
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,080
Yes, just copy paste.

695
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,920
So we have to store the Excel to the file.

696
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,680
Yes, the Excel file to this file
directory.

697
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,920
Miscellaneous and

698
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,720
is everyone ready?

699
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:17,920
Do you guys have your files in here?

700
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,680
So let's create a file.

701
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,280
It's not pasting in mine.

702
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:34,080
Or what do you have a mac or windows?

703
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:40,120
You are popping this file
for example using control C

704
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,560
and you are saying you are unable
to paste that file. You

705
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,360
by clicking on this folder.

706
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,840
And in here,
where do you get any errors or what?

707
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,360
What is that

708
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,360
question mark next to Excel file?

709
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,760
Just because I have not installed
the Excel extension in here.

710
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,120
So if you guys want to award

711
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:08,840
that, you guys can install the plug ins.

712
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,960
I think it's called

713
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,360
Excel or something.

714
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,920
Yes, the Excel reader

715
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,880
because but I am having issues with my

716
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,880
because I have installed
too many extensions. So

717
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,880
but you guys should be able
to see that excel of client

718
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,480
type of icon in here

719
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:42,960
in Mac.

720
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,160
It's also not working.

721
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,480
Do you guys know how to copy and paste?

722
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,600
It's fine. It's fine.

723
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,920
So for example,
even if you are on Mac or Windows, just

724
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,520
just right, click on this files

725
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,800
and then click on Open in Explorer.

726
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,720
And this is the folder
where you have to paste your file.

727
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,280
I think now you should be

728
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:18,760
able to paste your file,

729
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,720
right click on your file
folder on directory, click

730
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,960
on opening a Finder or Explorer

731
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:28,880
to write.

732
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,720
Delete the URL.

733
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,240
Yes, You should not be having
that door to you all at the end.

734
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,320
But why you have not?

735
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,560
You are left behind and why you are
putting it inside the package.

736
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,600
Maria, you have not created that

737
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:54,000
the acceptor directly.

738
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,120
So you missed the class

739
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,280
yesterday.

740
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,720
Okay.

741
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,040
Post in this port channel.

742
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,200
Maryam. Post in this post channel.

743
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,560
How can you copy and paste the file?

744
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,320
How you can create a new directory?

745
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,200
I will wait for 2 minutes.

746
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,320
Once all of your issues are resolved,
then we will move forward.

747
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,840
I use command plus C and command plus V
and it works perfectly.

748
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,080
Yes, it should work fine.

749
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:27,800
I don't know why you guys are unable
to just to simply copy and paste.

750
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,880
You guys don't need to install
any plug in.

751
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:35,160
That was it will just put a a icon and
you will be able to add it to that file

752
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,480
currently here Screenshot

753
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,040
on Mac.

754
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,800
You need to go to opening
and then click on finder

755
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,120
files.

756
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,960
If you are having any issues, please

757
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,080
both in this Port General

758
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,720
and shared screenshots

759
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,560
from on

760
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,520
and yes, it's

761
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,720
normal to have that question mark.

762
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,800
Okay.

763
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,520
Yes, explorer is equal to find it

764
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,280
in Mac.

765
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,400
Nice. Follow all of your problems.

766
00:51:08,400 --> 00:52:41,920
I will be back in 2 minutes.

767
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:47,280
Helper Thumbs up your smile Oscar
when you get mad does not fit you.

768
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,960
I'm not mad.

769
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,640
I'm not mad at all. Moto you are.

770
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,600
My life is not that easy to solve
all your problems

771
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,160
in 2 minutes.

772
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,480
That's good. Is pissed off.

773
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,440
We are stuck with just creating excel
files and copying and pasting.

774
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,800
No, actually I am waiting
so that all of you have excel file

775
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:14,160
because you guys
then will not be able to follow me.

776
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,960
Oh i word I was a moment ago.

777
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,840
It's not us.

778
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,320
His girlfriend or no,

779
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,560
it's not about the girlfriend.

780
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:32,400
And the real problem will come
and I will be getting letters.

781
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,520
I can still put my phone on airplane mode
and I can say, Oh, there was

782
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,680
bad signal or something like that.

783
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,680
But later on
I will not be able to make those

784
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,360
excuses. It's

785
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,120
a you'll get I am trying to push it

786
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,000
as far as possible.

787
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,720
No, no, it's not personal.

788
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,920
No, I'm not out the

789
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,400
I am the person who learned
from the mistakes of others.

790
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,320
I see my cousins who are married now.

791
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,720
They just disappear from the world.

792
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,680
I used to see them laughing, playing
cricket and all those activities.

793
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,240
Now everyone is just busy,
work, homework on their thought.

794
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,960
You just coding on
Java? Copy. See and copy. We

795
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,280
is also trying to

796
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,520
extend my computer's life. It's

797
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:57,360
it. And this is called Happiness
Single life.

798
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,760
Everyday

799
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,040
for the demo

800
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:20,360
fight. You.

801
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,920
I hope you guys have resolved your issues

802
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,560
so let's create

803
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,160
Excel demo one.

804
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,840
So guys, I explained

805
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,240
she was helping us still

806
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,960
for she was too much load on.

807
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,800
He is so the excel files

808
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,080
they are divided in in workbooks right

809
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,680
And inside the workbooks

810
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,520
we have different different fields

811
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,400
and inside the shirts
we have these columns

812
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,880
and the rows like

813
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,080
So remember the specter guard.

814
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,280
It will be helpful when we will be reading
the data from those Excel files.

815
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:20,320
So if I open that Excel file,

816
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,960
So you see on the bottom Excel sheet one,
I can create one more sheet.

817
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,880
Let's say maybe sheet two, right?

818
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,040
Then I can create more shirts.

819
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,160
So these shirts,
they will be having different deltas

820
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,440
every kind of life is cool.

821
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,520
The important thing is the mindset.

822
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,720
No, no, it's a trap.

823
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,600
All the ladies, they said this,
everything will be fine.

824
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,400
And after marriage, it's
totally the opposite.

825
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,240
A You guys are all same. Yep.

826
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,520
I don't trust

827
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:56,800
this.

828
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,040
So we will be.

829
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,120
You just need the right person.

830
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,240
That's the problem.

831
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,160
There is no right person.

832
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,560
The one that you.

833
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,520
You are being recorded.
You know that, right?

834
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:21,360
Yep. It If I were to say it openly.

835
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,880
All right, guys, So I'm just.

836
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,240
I was just kidding.

837
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:34,080
So let's create the main method in here.

838
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:46,800
So to read the data
from the Excel files as well,

839
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,920
the first thing as always,
we need the path, right?

840
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,720
And to get the part

841
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,520
we can right click and then

842
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,200
copy board reference
and then copy content.

843
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,120
So string

844
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,800
file is equal to

845
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,640
be bought here.

846
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,600
And again, same file input steam.

847
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,280
So most probably either
you guys will be using some kind of other

848
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,400
they are called readers.

849
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,120
By the way,
this file input stream is a reader.

850
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,080
They help you read the data.

851
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,000
So there are many different types
of readers,

852
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,320
but we will be sticking to file
input input stream.

853
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,560
So again, we need to be file input stream

854
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,960
of the same file.

855
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,400
Input stream is equal to new file
input stream, right?

856
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,800
And then pass

857
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,120
or I should change it to

858
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:53,760
what?

859
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,640
So now I have read the raw bytes

860
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,520
using this file input stream
from that excel file.

861
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,400
Okay.

862
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,640
So the thing I want to convert it
to a Excel sheet

863
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,960
now to convert it to an Excel sheet,
we have these special classes from this.

864
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,680
This is where those jobs do you guys
remember those jobs that we added?

865
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,120
So the building support for Microsoft
Excel file

866
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,920
is not present in Java, so that's why
we are using external libraries

867
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:30,360
to read the data authorized to back out
to those Excel files.

868
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,040
Okay. So now if you type X self

869
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,720
workbook and it should

870
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,200
be from all the data party or boy

871
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,640
and then access of workbook
is equal to new

872
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,200
X s as of workbook, then

873
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,120
you guys should not be getting any errors
and make sure that this track, this,

874
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,120
this class
is being important from user model

875
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,120
and then not excessive.

876
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,440
Do you guys see this import?

877
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:06,000
Is it working fine?

878
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,720
Okay.

879
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,920
And now this file input stream.

880
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,840
So in properties

881
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,120
we had that load method, but in here
that load method is not present.

882
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,080
We simply pass
this file in firstname to the constructor

883
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,400
and here

884
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,240
and now if I hover my mouse over

885
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:28,280
and if I say add exception to method
signature.

886
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,320
Now that both of these errors,
they should also go away.

887
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,480
So it worked for me a couple classes ago,
but now it gives me

888
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,680
an error
and I get the link to the correct jar.

889
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,920
I remember how to import
you just need the right jar.

890
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,840
Just type Apache boy on Google.

891
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:52,320
So let me let me show it again.

892
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,800
And this
this is the link that you should see.

893
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,440
Eleanor, you are using Windows
or Mac, right?

894
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,720
Yes, it is like loading.

895
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,720
So it is Windows.

896
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,400
So you should download
you should go to the downloads

897
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,720
and then

898
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,600
the bin.

899
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:15,160
And from here you guys are
you can download.

900
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:20,240
So this link should work fine for you
if you are feeling in windows.

901
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:27,640
Okay.

902
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,240
Okay.

903
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,120
Is there anyone else
we have facing issues with the jobs?

904
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:41,040
We are all getting hacked right now
by having a party on our computers.

905
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,560
Which one for? Mac?

906
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,000
Let me send you for Mac as

907
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:50,040
this one

908
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:59,400
for the Mac.

909
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,840
Why is the port right now?

910
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:04,040
All because I changed
the name of the variable.

911
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,200
A change I was using file in here.

912
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,560
Then I changed it to part.

913
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:18,600
So make sure that on the line above
you use port.

914
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:23,480
And this pageboy isn't the only thing
that is using long for a log for the

915
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,840
almost all the applications in Java.

916
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,160
They use this log for this,
so don't worry about it.

917
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,160
And there are so many loopholes.

918
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:42,160
Yes. Let me know when you guys are done.

919
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,280
So now I have that.

920
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,280
So I read the raw data from that file

921
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,760
and I have converted it to an Excel sheet.

922
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,640
Now, can you guys tell me what is
what is present inside the Excel sheet?

923
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,480
What is the next thing that I should get
from this Excel file?

924
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,720
Where should I go next after
I have the Excel file to get the data

925
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,040
sheet

926
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:11,200
right, the next sheet, Well,
I get properties.

927
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,120
The next thing I should go to,

928
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:21,680
I should get this sheet right.

929
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,440
I like this.

930
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,920
Let me know once you are ready

931
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:34,160
to leave, I go, Well,

932
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,280
that's about as how valuable.

933
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,840
So I can say sheet
so I can create an object.

934
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:48,000
This this, this sheet is an interface
and I can say sheet

935
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,560
is equal to

936
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,080
X of workbook dot got sheet.

937
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,560
And inside this get sheet matter,

938
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:06,600
I should specify fy the name of the sheet
from which I want to get the data.

939
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:12,320
So for example, in this batch 11 job,
if I open it again

940
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,720
in which this data is present,
guys in which sheet

941
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:23,720
this data is present, see it one, right.

942
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,160
So and we have to make sure
that we are using

943
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,680
the correct spellings
and and we are also using B,

944
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,840
we are not also changing the letters
properties a lot of this.

945
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,680
So the better way is to right
click on it, edit it and copy

946
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:48,120
the exact same name
so that you guys don't make mistakes.

947
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,200
So get sheet.

948
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:56,880
And inside here
I write the name of the sheet.

949
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,360
Let me know once
you guys have written this code

950
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,400
and if everything is good
and you guys don't get

951
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:10,600
any errors, the

952
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,440
boy is done.

953
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:22,480
Katrina is done.

954
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,000
Okay.

955
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,240
So once I have once I have the sheet guys,

956
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:33,840
what should be the next thing?

957
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,680
Alex, you are getting the next shell.

958
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:48,480
Next thing should be rows
and columns, right?

959
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:53,120
Let's make sure that this sheet
is coming from this import.

960
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,440
Let me you this import to

961
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,080
use. Please,
everyone, please make sure that you guys

962
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,480
are using this import

963
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,920
I have done why you are getting error.

964
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,880
Are you doing something differently?

965
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,680
Excessive workbook

966
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,760
and then that should get one.

967
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:24,040
You should not be getting an error.

968
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,440
Select the first option then you.

969
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:31,080
But I don't sense
so you will be getting an error.

970
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,920
Make sure you guys have these imports
the correct proper imports

971
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,760
and if you have imported all the jobs

972
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,320
properly useful, you should not be
asked to convert that sheet.

973
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,240
How you copy shit

974
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,240
name or simply double
click on the sheet name.

975
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,880
So for example, in here, double
click in here under control C control me

976
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,440
break is coming for me.

977
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,160
We still have 10 minutes.

978
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:09,840
So the next thing I should get now,
the rules.

979
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:12,160
Okay, so roll ups.

980
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,560
Roll the roll is equal to a sheet and dot

981
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,400
get through.

982
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,120
And if I check

983
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,840
if I check my excel sheet.

984
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:30,200
Right, so I have this roll
one or two and roll three.

985
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,000
But same is the case in here.

986
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:38,400
These rows, they are index based.

987
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,000
So for example, this roll one
is actually on index is zero.

988
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,160
So if I want to get the data
from the row zero,

989
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,800
I have to specify I

990
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,240
row zero.

991
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,440
Then you please by

992
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:58,760
line 14 again, you'll get a

993
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,720
you want me to type it again.

994
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:09,440
You want me to type it again?

995
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,720
I mean, what will happen
if I type it again?

996
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:21,760
It's is there anything
you don't understand from this line?

997
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:25,080
But it's better to memorize

998
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,360
and, you know, I mean,

999
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:34,280
if you guys are having issues, then
you should ask the ask me about the issue.

1000
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,240
What words will it be typing again.

1001
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,000
Right.

1002
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,600
So let me send you my import.

1003
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,560
Maybe

1004
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,320
all every everyone

1005
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:47,680
you get to use these imports, the

1006
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,040
either you have not imported all the dots

1007
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,840
or you are importing these classes
from different packages.

1008
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,040
So this could be the issue.

1009
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:59,680
If you use these imports,
the issue should resolve.

1010
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:05,240
Let me know if you still face this issue.

1011
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,320
Why do we have sheet to get?

1012
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,640
Because from sheet
one we are trying to get a row.

1013
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,960
You know,

1014
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,200
from this sheet, from this
and from this workbook.

1015
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,280
I am getting the sheet.

1016
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,120
I am storing it in a variable
from the sheet.

1017
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:26,200
I am getting the raw zero
the first row in the Excel

1018
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,120
by specifying its index zero index.

1019
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,760
So once I have the row guys,

1020
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,520
the one side we will read Maxim
so once I have the row.

1021
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,000
So these are not called columns.

1022
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,560
They are called actually cells in Excel.

1023
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:45,920
Okay.

1024
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:50,400
So now if I want to get the data
from this Excel zero,

1025
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,800
I will get this cell from this row.

1026
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,680
So I will say

1027
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,600
cell cell is equal to rule dot.

1028
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,880
In that cell.

1029
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,600
Okay.

1030
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,280
And now if I say s out

1031
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:13,800
and then cell,
I should see data from this cell.

1032
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,880
Why? Edit

1033
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,680
this get role

1034
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:26,160
should be filled out that you are also

1035
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,560
costing it

1036
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,360
Alexey you see

1037
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:34,760
you guys are not using the proper import
my imports are coming from point

1038
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:39,000
Asus don't use models
you guys are using wrong import.

1039
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:43,960
Let me share this important
because all my standard nice

1040
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,760
make sure that you are importing
from the same packages

1041
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,280
not not always zero.

1042
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,800
If you want to get the data from the zero
cell, then only you should be

1043
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:09,000
putting zero in here.

1044
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,360
So I get the call in here.

1045
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,160
I the data that was on

1046
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:18,120
row zero and cell zero.

1047
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,760
I mean, ground starts from zero,
not from one.

1048
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,160
Yes, yes. Cold start from below.

1049
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:31,640
It's also index based.

1050
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,760
It's fine. You guys can ignore this error.

1051
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,880
This log for the error is because
there was an issue with the log for DE

1052
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,720
and they Apache boy guys.

1053
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:44,120
They have removed that implementation
so that you guys are not one related but

1054
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,680
to that issue

1055
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:48,720
that there

1056
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,520
was a vulnerability in the log for J
and the Apache.

1057
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,040
You guys they have removed that log
for their from their libraries

1058
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:09,200
so that you are not at risk.

1059
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:14,360
NULL Pointer Exception Files Batch 11

1060
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,920
Make sure you have data now.

1061
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:31,800
Make sure you have data in sheet one.

1062
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,040
Make sure guys
you have sheet one in your Excel workbooks

1063
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,400
and make sure you have data
inside the sheet. One

1064
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,560
I do.

1065
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,640
And you guys didn't change the name.

1066
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,520
Even if you put a space in here
while editing it,

1067
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:53,040
it will not work.

1068
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:53,480
Again.

1069
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,080
Error

1070
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,040
Can you guys show me your Excel files?

1071
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:37,520
Can you guys show me your actual files?

1072
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,320
So you should have

1073
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,680
this in your Excel file And in here

1074
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,200
you should write this code.

1075
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:52,080
Please match your Excel file
and your job program with my

1076
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:00,720
my program.

1077
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,880
How to Hold on, Sebastian.

1078
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,400
I will show you how to clean
navigating for ready.

1079
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:06,480
Let's go.

1080
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,040
Step by step.

1081
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:10,760
It's fine.

1082
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:36,880
It's fine if you guys are getting
that logger error, you'll get the.

1083
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,520
You don't have to write new keyword
after the sheet.

1084
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:40,840
Remove that new keyword.

1085
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:44,560
You see, I don't have new keyword in here
before the get sheet

1086
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,480
these please guys, please make sure

1087
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,960
that you have the exact same code

1088
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,680
More than

1089
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,560
please delete your operating system
and reinstall it again.

1090
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:11,600
I hope it will resolve your issue.

1091
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,200
It needs to stop

1092
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:44,640
something wrong on line 17.

1093
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,200
So I guess you guys are doing this
this mistake.

1094
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:52,560
Are you guys passing this file in stream
to this constructor?

1095
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,640
Ramon, this is your issue.

1096
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:57,680
You are not passing this file
in stream to this constructor.

1097
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,280
All of those who
are getting issues on line number 17 guys,

1098
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,840
make sure you passed the object of file
input stream to this excessive

1099
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:15,080
workbook.

1100
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,760
Okay?

1101
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,480
Yes. Let me copy the code

1102
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:26,800
and send it to you.

1103
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,840
Can you please tell about indexing it?

1104
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,320
Same as the error is the start from

1105
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,400
index zero.

1106
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,000
The excel rose themselves.

1107
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:44,120
They also start from zero.

1108
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:48,000
So those who want to go on the break,
you guys can go on the break.

1109
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,680
We will be back by 1145.

1110
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,720
Those who are facing issues.

1111
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,400
Stay with me.

1112
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:59,040
I will resolve your issues. Now.

1113
01:16:59,040 --> 01:16:59,760
It works. Yes.

1114
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,800
Because you are not you are not passing
this file in stream object.

1115
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,960
I think I am getting an issue with my jar
file.

1116
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,640
Let me make this break to

1117
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,400
50. Please post.

1118
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,840
In this Portner and guys resolve
what issues

1119
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,480
mine kept trying to cast modeling.

1120
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:28,080
That means that you have not imported
the jobs properly.

1121
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:33,120
I thought I was the only one
making mistakes.

1122
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:36,680
Your file don't work
prints create your own file.

1123
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:48,120
If my file is not working.

1124
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:51,560
Oh, maybe because you have
you guys compressed control.

1125
01:17:51,560 --> 01:18:04,600
As of writing this data in the Excel file,

1126
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,440
nobody's gone on break

1127
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,680
it slower.

1128
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,160
Could not find a exception.

1129
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:44,280
An internal pointer exception.

1130
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,680
It is the issue with the data files

1131
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:53,040
and a tundra

1132
01:18:53,400 --> 01:19:02,040
glass loader issue with the data files.

1133
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,400
This is the error I am getting

1134
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:07,800
no class def.

1135
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,360
So all of these issues?

1136
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,400
No class, therefore class is not found.

1137
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:18,600
They are all the issues with your files
guys.

1138
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:23,040
You have to import 18 jobs from the lib
folder, all access x

1139
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,960
and mail folder and the six data files
that are outside of these folders.

1140
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:36,840
There should be 18 jobs in your project.

1141
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,240
NULL pointer
exception. You'll get to show me.

1142
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,400
Show me your file from the intel.

1143
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:47,880
So what you guys are doing, you'll be
you guys are storing the data in this

1144
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,160
file, which is outside of the intelligent,
but inside the intelligent.

1145
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:53,200
The file that you guys are reading
data from.

1146
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:59,440
It does not contain any data.

1147
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,840
So you guys have to store the data inside
this file.

1148
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,880
Let's control s and then update this file
the intelligent alphabet.

1149
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,720
If you guys open this

1150
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,200
x x x log book,

1151
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,680
merge or you guys will see

1152
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:48,680
there is no data in here.

1153
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:52,160
Make sure guys the updated file is present
inside intelligence

1154
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:55,280
or use the part of this

1155
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,560
file.

1156
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:20,400
This one
that you have placed on your computer.

1157
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,040
These are great

1158
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:26,880
with our batch
you don't need any life to on your mind

1159
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,080
we are doing they're just perfect.

1160
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:38,840
Yep yep yep.

1161
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:41,160
Control. Yes yeah.

1162
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,760
You guys have never worked with files
just furious

1163
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,760
with it. With the Excel files.

1164
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,000
How many of you have never opened
an Excel file before?

1165
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,680
Before this class?

1166
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:53,360
It's fine.

1167
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,040
It's fine If you don't have opened
the Excel files in your life.

1168
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,200
But just curious.

1169
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,520
Just want to know how many of you haven't

1170
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,320
Will error

1171
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:48,640
in this file is not working.

1172
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,840
Sebastian

1173
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,080
Ellen,

1174
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,480
can you share this screenshot of your data
files?

1175
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:14,640
A in the file not found,

1176
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:18,120
but you see in your file folder

1177
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,480
you have a space between batch and 11,

1178
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:25,080
but in the bottom that you are mentioning
you are not specifying the space.

1179
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,480
Abdul This.

1180
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,000
Please pay attention to these small things
like spelling

1181
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,880
of your files,
the spellings of your sheets.

1182
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,920
You have proper data in your Excel files
before

1183
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:39,600
you try to read them.

1184
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:46,480
Finally, user

1185
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,360
most of our documents

1186
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:54,000
you are missing
that do not excel at sex extension.

1187
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,480
Most of also this part.

1188
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,560
I don't know if a file is present
on this part or not,

1189
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:04,640
so right click on must have ordered
x less sex and on that file

1190
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,160
there is the neck of Aisha and me.

1191
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,360
Sebastian, we are next.

1192
01:24:51,360 --> 01:25:21,920
You have removed the next.

1193
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:27,600
Now the issue with the job files.

1194
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,440
Did you say I am missing data files?

1195
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,600
Yes. Tundra.

1196
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:32,280
Either you are missing the data files

1197
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:36,800
or the Either
you have imported the wrong data files.

1198
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,720
So when we modify the files
outside of intelligence, we save control.

1199
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,120
S Yes, we save control. S

1200
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:47,320
And it does save that file
inside the intelligent.

1201
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:55,760
We have to do that separately.

1202
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,680
And then you are importing the complete

1203
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,840
folder that void or to bin folder.

1204
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,760
Remove the last two imports.

1205
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:14,840
Click on that and press
that minus sign on the top.

1206
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:20,120
Shiva, are you with us?

1207
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:25,080
Yes. Now, if you modified the data,
you have to do it again.

1208
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:29,520
Shiva, can you start a meeting and
can you show them how to import the jars?

1209
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,600
So there are a lot of students,
a lot of facing the issues with the jobs

1210
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:36,240
or maybe I can show you guys. So.

1211
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:38,400
Shiva okay, I will show you.

1212
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,680
You check the other issues. So guys,

1213
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,240
if I go here

1214
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:50,320
and if I go to file,
so let me repeat it again.

1215
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:53,520
Nice.

1216
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,520
You'll get
I will explain how it is working.

1217
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:01,840
So file and then if you click
on project structure,

1218
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,400
so you guys should see something
like this.

1219
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,920
Okay,
You guys should see something like this.

1220
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,400
Now how I have imported these files.

1221
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,840
So the first thing that I did,

1222
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,440
I went to this website,

1223
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,960
this Apache poi,

1224
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:25,360
and I went to this downloads
folder in here.

1225
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,640
Okay, so this download folder.

1226
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:34,720
So I see this binary distribution
and I see this source of distribution.

1227
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:43,520
So remember, guys, we have to use this
binary distribution.

1228
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,520
Abdul
You are not putting a space on line 15

1229
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,000
and you have a space
between the name on Batch 11

1230
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,320
and that and other space
between before that extension.

1231
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:59,800
Please make sure you remove those spaces
or you change the part accordingly.

1232
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:03,720
So because I am using windows,
I will be downloading

1233
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,120
this boy being a door to zip file.

1234
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:12,960
Those who are using Mac, you guys should
download this dot b g that file.

1235
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,560
Yes. Let me handle

1236
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,480
those who are facing DOT issues.

1237
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,240
Are you guys clear on this? You
the Mac users?

1238
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,080
I made those changes, Abdul just

1239
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:31,320
just give me one moment.

1240
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:34,280
So don't make Mac users.

1241
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:37,200
You guys have to go to this link

1242
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,280
and the windows later.

1243
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,400
You guys have to go to this dot the link.

1244
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,200
So because I'm using windows,
I will be opening the second link

1245
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,200
and then I can use any of the link

1246
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:51,000
to download these DOS.

1247
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,400
And once I have downloaded these jobs,

1248
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,360
I will navigate to the folder

1249
01:28:57,160 --> 01:29:00,520
where I have downloaded these jars.

1250
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:05,680
So for example, if I click on open folder,
I see this zip file in here.

1251
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:23,640
Do you guys see this zip file?

1252
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:27,400
Those who are facing issues
with the jar files, Do you guys see this

1253
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,880
zip file in here?

1254
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,600
After that,
do you have to extract those files?

1255
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:33,600
Now, if you

1256
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,600
don't have any program
to extract those files on your computer,

1257
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:41,040
what you guys can do,
you guys can install that program.

1258
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:45,000
It's called when they are

1259
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,080
and if you type

1260
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:51,560
now they are on Google.

1261
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,320
You can download the software in here
and then you should see

1262
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,400
exactly the same view as I have.

1263
01:29:58,880 --> 01:29:59,280

1264
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,560

01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:15,000
It will be good
if you guys install all of them.

1290
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,360
If you guys install it

1291
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:23,040
because then it will be processed.

1292
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,200
Will be same
for all of the Windows and Mac users.

1293
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:31,320
If you guys have this program.

1294
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,520
Yes. Maria, it is installed.

1295
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,200
Yes, it is.

1296
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,480
And so now
you going to close this window now?

1297
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,640
I was going to have you install it

1298
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,080
and the others who are

1299
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,560
getting that issue.

1300
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:50,480
So now right click on this file
and click on extract all.

1301
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,640
If you do that, you

1302
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:55,560
it will ask you to a part that you guys
don't need to click anything.

1303
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,720
Just click on extract.

1304
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:02,880
Okay And because I have already extracted
this file, so I get this notification

1305
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,000
to replace these files, most probably
you guys will not be getting this option.

1306
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:10,240
Mac does not have that option.

1307
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:13,640
Oh, that Mac is.

1308
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,760
It's killing me.

1309
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:20,240
Which of which option is not present
on Mac, not school.

1310
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:34,720
The right click option is not available.

1311
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:40,720
Next step up to is not available.

1312
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:45,240
Do you see this icon on that dot pd

1313
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:59,840
z file?

1314
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,560
Yes. Even you guys not near the we not our

1315
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,360
so so everybody's so desperate

1316
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:12,600
to exchange the left house.

1317
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:16,880
I am afraid he will just steal a macbook
from his neighbors or something like that.

1318
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:18,640
Pretty easy.

1319
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:32,640
Is he the Mac folks.

1320
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:36,360
Is there a
is there a mac user who can tell us

1321
01:34:36,560 --> 01:35:10,880
how to extract the files?

1322
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,840
Guys, can someone help Nas? Will

1323
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,560
Yes, we are doing something new.

1324
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,360
You'll get them.

1325
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:25,040
So once you have extracted those files,
you should see a folder

1326
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:28,920
like this.

1327
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:32,080
And if you open that folder,
you should have another folder

1328
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:36,120
in here.

1329
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:41,920
And in here you should see these $8
outside of this lab

1330
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,520
and all all x and mail folder

1331
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:48,000
and five jobs in here

1332
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:52,880
and six jobs in here.

1333
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,600
Now, what you guys can do,
you open, maybe copy all of these jobs

1334
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,240
outside of this folder

1335
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:01,480
in here

1336
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:06,400
so that you have

1337
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,160
all the jobs in a single place
and all you have to basically import

1338
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:14,400
all of these dos, excluding, obviously,

1339
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:27,880
this license and all this. Yes.

1340
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:36,160
I show you for those who have jobs
problem.

1341
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:36,520
Okay,

1342
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,120
So let me undo it.

1343
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:44,800
So now you have to go to the invalid.

1344
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,360
Then you have to click file

1345
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:53,360
and then project structure

1346
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,440
and then click on this

1347
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:59,480
plus button to import the jobs
and make sure you are on modules

1348
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,160
s that batch 11 and on dependencies
you should select.

1349
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,000
You should have these dependencies in here

1350
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,440
selected based added any and modules

1351
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:12,960
your project name

1352
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,480
and dependencies tabs from here.

1353
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:19,320
And then you have to click on this
plus button.

1354
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:20,760
Do you guys see this plus button

1355
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:25,160
break is about to over

1356
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,640
about learn

1357
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,160
your guitar and everyone else bigger.

1358
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:32,400
See this plus button,
click on that plus button

1359
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:40,920
and then you have to

1360
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:45,480
select jobs or directories.

1361
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:50,040
And now you have to go to that folder
where you expect to do your jobs.

1362
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:55,080
So for example, in my case,
I accepted it in downloads compressed

1363
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,320
and then inside this port

1364
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,640
and I have to expand this lib

1365
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,080
and this folder.

1366
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:08,360
Now hold down your shift or control
button and select

1367
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:11,720
all the jars from here

1368
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,800
and then you have to click okay

1369
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:22,080
index to resolve your issues.

1370
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,520
Yes, break is over.

1371
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,200
Now, if you guys still
if you guys are still facing

1372
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:34,040
issues, please post an export channel
and fix your issues.

1373
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:35,280
Nothing in my lib folder.

1374
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:39,160
That means you have downloaded
the wrong jobs Maria or you have deleted

1375
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:44,120
those jobs from that lib folder.

1376
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:44,280
Right

1377
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,160
guys?

1378
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:48,560
So how many of you see go in here?

1379
01:38:48,560 --> 01:39:06,000
How many of you see the data in here?

1380
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,640
Now we can get the whole sheet as a

1381
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:13,920
well, I will teach you how to do that.

1382
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:14,640
Okay.

1383
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:19,560
So can you guys
tell me if I have to get this $5?

1384
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:32,080
What should I change inside this code?

1385
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,440
So this is on still delete.

1386
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:37,000
All right, But it is on now.

1387
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,200
Column cell one.

1388
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:56,720
So if I can do this to sell one,

1389
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:01,640
you give me one place.

1390
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:11,680
It has changed.

1391
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:18,880
Let me copy it again.

1392
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,080
So you copy

1393
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:25,920
and paste

1394
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:37,480
it did not print the dollar

1395
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:43,160
sign and it give an output as a double.

1396
01:40:43,160 --> 01:40:45,920
Mohammad,
are you using the same code as mine?

1397
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,160
And you got this behavior

1398
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:53,840
You guys are

1399
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:58,200
getting 5.0.

1400
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:04,240
Make sure you guys are using that cell.

1401
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:05,760
Can you share the code?

1402
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,280
Those who are getting 5.0.

1403
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:10,880
I will show you how to get as different

1404
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:14,760
as a double value,
but let's not go there still.

1405
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,120
Let's just learn
how to get the values from Excel.

1406
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:21,880
For now, I will tell you how to convert
those data types to doubles.

1407
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:40,200
Are integers or anything like that.

1408
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,040
Okay.

1409
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:45,280
Did you guys store a store
the dollar sign with your cell as well?

1410
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:50,680
I mean, if you store five in your cell,
you will not be getting the dollar sign

1411
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:54,400
and you updated the Excel file
inside the intelligence.

1412
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,840
Well, right
then, once you have stored that

1413
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:01,080
and you'll see the dollar sign
in the Excel, but you don't see it in the

1414
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,560
in the Java program

1415
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:05,520
or you place it before the

1416
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,360
dollar sign because Excel can do
the convergence automatically.

1417
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,680
If you place the dollar sign before, it
will automatically convert it to a number.

1418
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,360
So that's why I have this dollar sign
after the number

1419
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,360
after that, because

1420
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:23,520
it's your Excel guys
excel always doing it.

1421
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,640
These automatic convergence, it's
fine it's fine if you

1422
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:30,480
if you get the delta fine 5.0 or $5

1423
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:34,680
both are fine.

1424
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:37,000
Accountants would know

1425
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:41,200
silver Simon

1426
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,480
out of there
you guys don't need to upgrade Right now

1427
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:47,000
we are just learning how to get the data
from themselves at all rows.

1428
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:53,880
It's Fine.

1429
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:57,480
So now can you guys
tell me if I want to get this thing?

1430
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:02,040
How can I do that?

1431
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,680
My husband dialed me.

1432
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:11,000
It said, Copy that.

1433
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,440
So I should.

1434
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,080
So this is row zero.

1435
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:18,120
This is one two, three, four.

1436
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,440
Right.

1437
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,640
So I should say,
get me the dollar number four,

1438
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,120
and then this is self zero

1439
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:30,880
and this is cell one, right?

1440
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:39,000
So if now I execute my program,
I see King in here.

1441
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:44,200
Do you guys see the king in here?

1442
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:53,480
One hand is good, but two is great.

1443
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:54,120
All right.

1444
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:57,440
So this is this is simple thing, right?

1445
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,600
Getting the from different cells and then

1446
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,800
using it by specifying the raw numbers
and by specifying

1447
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:10,160
the column numbers, we can get data
from different different rows.

1448
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:10,880
Right.

1449
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:15,240
Easy peasy.

1450
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:32,000
I see Queen.

1451
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,440
I am sensing that we will use it for loop
to get all the data

1452
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,600
and definitely definitely

1453
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,440
nested for loops.

1454
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,920
Your your favorite part is coming now,

1455
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:49,800
so let me put more data in

1456
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:59,000
so let's say and this time nice.

1457
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,440
This time let's use the external part.

1458
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,720
So say

1459
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:07,000
our first

1460
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:18,480
name.

1461
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,120
Last name

1462
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,440
is City

1463
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:39,080
being Alexa, age 300

1464
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:40,120
and City.

1465
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:42,200
What is your city Loops?

1466
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:47,280
You guys don't like loops.

1467
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,960
It's Alexa.

1468
01:45:49,960 --> 01:46:06,120
Which city you belong to?

1469
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:07,040
Okay,

1470
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,080
but answers are urban

1471
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:13,960
and minus.

1472
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:16,760
Well, you

1473
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,440
or not being is 23 and princess 22.

1474
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,760
It does not look good.

1475
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:34,520
Uh, maybe 30 is the right way to go.

1476
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,440
Dark mode.

1477
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,240
And please focus on the glass.

1478
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:42,120
We will do this dark light thing later on.

1479
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:47,320
If someone were to leave their city

1480
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:58,800
is this bright?

1481
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,320
I think if you open this file in Excel,
it should be dark.

1482
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:19,640
Let me check.

1483
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:20,880
Here we go.

1484
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:24,000
But still, the cells, they are white.

1485
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,080
So if you have excellent
you are using black.

1486
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,760
I like your that good. Thank you, Silver.

1487
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,640
So if you guys are using
black team on your windows,

1488
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:36,080
then I hope you you can get something.

1489
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:38,320
But the cells still there,
they are still white.

1490
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,440
Marvin

1491
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:43,600
amongst stole my sunglasses.

1492
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,520
So you think that is okay to have to get

1493
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:51,560
okay,

1494
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,840
okay.

1495
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:59,120
Let me make the kid ten years old.

1496
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:02,520
Is it okay now?

1497
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:04,800
They're still bad. You or you?

1498
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,760
You want everything black?

1499
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:07,680
Okay, do this.

1500
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:10,600
Select all the cells and then

1501
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,720
do this.

1502
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:16,680
Now everything is black

1503
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,920
and I can see the text as well.

1504
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,240
Are you happy?

1505
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:30,000
No, Much better.

1506
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,080
So, urban, What is your city?

1507
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:37,360
You guys will never be happy. Yes.

1508
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,560
And then turn the text. Why?

1509
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:42,000
Are you okay with numbers, please?

1510
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,840
Sure. Number two, with your finger.

1511
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:46,160
It is number two.

1512
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:49,600
Man. Is it same

1513
01:48:51,040 --> 01:49:00,840
city?

1514
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:04,080
And let me put another value

1515
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:11,280
now, let's say, and

1516
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:14,640
let's imagine, guys,
we have so many cells in the

1517
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:19,200
we have so many cells in this Excel

1518
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:21,400
Excel sheet.

1519
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,200
Right.

1520
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:25,360
And we want to read all of them now.

1521
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:29,400
It will be hectic if we type those cell

1522
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:32,040
values, rule values all the time, right?

1523
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:36,880
So guys, please make sure that once
you insert this deck, die

1524
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:40,000
in your Excel sheet,
you are storing that, that otherwise

1525
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,080
you will be getting null point
that exceptions.

1526
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:47,680
So this is the deadline
and copy paste thing.

1527
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:51,920
And so this is my file

1528
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:56,040
vegetarian wondered Xl6

1529
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:58,760
Abdul is issue result

1530
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:02,200
as God is hiding his age.

1531
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:05,560
Okay, let me

1532
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:08,080
put my correct page

1533
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:17,640
so so open up it again and make sure

1534
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:21,840
you have your Excel data in here.

1535
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,760
Okay? Now

1536
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,640
let's create this

1537
01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:50,720
new program to detect.

1538
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:51,560
Not yet.

1539
01:50:51,560 --> 01:51:01,880
I am working with Shiva.

1540
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,560
I will make a video next time.

1541
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:06,880
Maybe I'll import jobs
and create these Excel files

1542
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,400
and things like that
so that you guys don't waste time

1543
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:13,800
because it's hard to follow
when you are facing issues.

1544
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:14,440
Right?

1545
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:16,560
It's also fine.

1546
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,920
Maybe you guys can focus now on

1547
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:24,920
on the content
and maybe you can fix your issues later.

1548
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,000
How many of you are still facing issues?

1549
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:34,560
How many of you are still issues?

1550
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:40,960
One, two, three, four, five,

1551
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,760
six. Mine

1552
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:51,800
resolved.

1553
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:55,400
So guys, please join the meeting
and that you are left

1554
01:51:55,440 --> 01:52:00,000
the class for a few minutes
and join the meeting.

1555
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Apparently those doors
don't like the open office.

1556
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:09,160
Elon, did you have the same extension as?

1557
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,400
Exodus six?

1558
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:14,280
Because if you have the same extension,
it does not matter if you have OpenOffice

1559
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:14,760
or Excel

1560
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,120
who try to use my file.

1561
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:25,800
The file that I have sent to you

1562
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:28,760
guys try to use my file,

1563
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:30,200
let me send it again.

1564
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,200
Try to use this file,

1565
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:38,760
place it inside a folder and make sure

1566
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:42,920
that you are placing that file in a folder
for which you know the part.

1567
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:47,760
So for in my case
it's a C user as the Nazarene backstop.

1568
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:50,400
Okay. So.

1569
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:52,440
All right.

1570
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:54,520
So again, I have to read the data.

1571
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:57,880
The first thing that I need is

1572
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:00,360
string. But

1573
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:03,520
and I have seen users

1574
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,520
going to their desktop and then

1575
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,200
the name of my file, which is batch

1576
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:12,560
11 naught x l.

1577
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,360
S s, right.

1578
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:20,360
Like this.

1579
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:24,640
So let's not use the file in here
from the intel at this time

1580
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:28,240
so that you guys know how to read the file
from anywhere on your computer.

1581
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:32,920
Are you guys able to figure out the
part of your file Excel file

1582
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:44,320
in guys?

1583
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:54,000
Have you
figured out the part of your Excel files?

1584
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:54,640
Okay.

1585
01:53:54,640 --> 01:53:58,440
What is the next class that I need
if I want to

1586
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:07,200
If I want to read the data from a file,

1587
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:13,120
I the file input stained glass.

1588
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:13,560
All right.

1589
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:19,320
So far, import
stream is equal to nil file bursty

1590
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:24,760
and I need to pass the path in here.

1591
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:29,160
And if I want to specifically work
with Excel files,

1592
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:32,160
what is the that special class that I need

1593
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:34,320
from Apache for

1594
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:41,280
s x s ISF workbook?

1595
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,200
Right.

1596
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:44,360
Access stuff workbook.

1597
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:46,680
Is it worth the new access book?

1598
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:50,240
And what should I pass inside this
constructor?

1599
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:59,600
Guys, the file import stream object.

1600
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:00,000
Right.

1601
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,480
The file input stream object.

1602
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:06,840
And now how about your mouse in here

1603
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:12,720
and add exception to the method signature.

1604
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:13,360
All right,

1605
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:19,920
so I have this file

1606
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:25,280
in here, and inside this file
I have sheet one.

1607
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:30,720
Right, I have sheet one.

1608
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:33,040
So I will get this.

1609
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,400
Good. You repeat
what is excessive workbook?

1610
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:39,040
So your raw data is converted
in the form of an Excel file

1611
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,640
using this class and this object

1612
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,720
file in raise the data

1613
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:49,040
in the form of raw bytes
in the form of zeros and ones.

1614
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:52,240
This this excessive workbook object

1615
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:54,960
will convert that to excel file format

1616
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:58,280
then this is a clear

1617
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:08,760
multi this

1618
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:11,640
and if I want to get this sheet,

1619
01:56:13,480 --> 01:56:14,640
yes, we will print everything.

1620
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:17,280
If we want to get sheet

1621
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:20,320
I can use this excessive workbook object.

1622
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,920
I can say get sheet.

1623
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,840
And what is the name of my sheet.

1624
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:30,880
The name of my sheet is capital
S at the ability sheet and then one

1625
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,080
and now

1626
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,520
I can maybe use all enter
to introduce a local variable.

1627
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:38,040
Right.

1628
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:41,840
So I have this sheet one from this x

1629
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,960
as a self workbook.

1630
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:50,240
Do you guys get this sheet
one from this exercise workbook

1631
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:55,600
without any errors?

1632
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:58,600
Now, if I want to look through this
data, guys,

1633
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:03,920
I must to know how many rolls
contain the data.

1634
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:04,880
Right?

1635
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:07,920
And how many columns contain the data,

1636
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:11,280
then I can write maybe for loop, right?

1637
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:16,440
So that I don't keep iterating
these empty cells in here.

1638
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,160
Right?

1639
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:18,680
I don't want to upgrade them.

1640
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:24,040
I only want to know how many cells
and columns the data.

1641
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:27,360
And then I can write a loop
to print out the data

1642
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,440
from those cells and rows.

1643
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:33,280
So if

1644
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:34,280
I say

1645
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:41,040
sheet dot, get

1646
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:49,920
physical number of rows,

1647
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,400
let me rename it to something simple

1648
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:55,200
number of rows.

1649
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:59,760
Okay,
so this get the physical cell number.

1650
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,720
That physical number of rows,
this method will return me

1651
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:08,640
the number of rows that

1652
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:13,240
are not empty.

1653
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:25,560
So if I printed this out,
I get four right?

1654
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:46,320
And if I go to my sheet,

1655
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:51,960
I have one, two, three and four rows.

1656
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:52,800
Right.

1657
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,120
So you have got the number of rows

1658
01:58:56,120 --> 01:59:01,400
that actually contains the data
from this sheet in the seat in the.

1659
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,600
Do you guys got the same

1660
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:12,880
where did you get the string part.

1661
01:59:12,920 --> 01:59:18,360
So I drew I have placed this for this file
on my computer.

1662
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,600
So for example, inside this folder.

1663
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:26,760
So if I click my mouse inside this address
bar, it gives me this address.

1664
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:32,240
So I copied this address and then I batch
11 dot Excel as after that

1665
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:34,960
in here

1666
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:40,160
based on that file in here
and then append this batch 11 dot.

1667
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:43,400
I go to that there. Now how many

1668
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:46,800
arrows in your in your excel file,

1669
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:49,360
how many those contain the actual data

1670
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,640
we are using cheat.

1671
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:59,640
So when we are using sheet,
I have just changed

1672
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:04,200
the name to sheet one.

1673
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:07,480
Okay, let me know what you guys are done,
but do not make sure you press.

1674
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:10,720
You are pressing control
as if you don't save.

1675
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:15,880
The data in your Excel file Java program
will not be able to read it properly.

1676
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:22,120
We use excess as a sheet. Yes.

1677
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:25,520
Or it's all also fine
sheet or excessive worksheet.

1678
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:27,560
Then they are both fine.

1679
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:44,520
So they are both fine.

1680
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:47,240
So can I move forward?

1681
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:50,440
Are you guys getting the same output

1682
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:56,680
file not found?

1683
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:57,160
It is.

1684
02:00:57,160 --> 02:00:59,440
You are not specifying the file name.

1685
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:04,720
You see after this memory I have specified
the name of the file as well.

1686
02:01:04,720 --> 02:01:06,760
Batch 11 dot Excel as you.

1687
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:11,360
You are not specifying that order
two more backward slashes

1688
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:18,040
and then write
the name of the file as well.

1689
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:27,600
What is the issue?

1690
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:31,800
And you cannot resolve
the access of workbook.

1691
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:35,360
Nabeel, You are using the wrong imports.

1692
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:40,520
Make sure that the import
they are from here.

1693
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:42,760
So you should have these to import.

1694
02:01:42,760 --> 02:01:43,720
Let me do mine.

1695
02:01:43,720 --> 02:01:49,600
Both.

1696
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:53,160
Please use these imports.

1697
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:56,640
Hossam
You also got the error file not found.

1698
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:00,960
You also have not specified the

1699
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:06,960
this the name of your Excel
and the extension.

1700
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:07,440
Right?

1701
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:10,120
Because inside that folder
there can be so many files.

1702
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:14,040
And so, for example, in my case,
you see I have so many files.

1703
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:17,760
How do I know
I am specifically looking to this file?

1704
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,880
I have to specify the
name of that file as well.

1705
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:24,400
It will install for me

1706
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:32,280
for some reason.

1707
02:02:32,280 --> 02:02:34,360
You have to print that out.

1708
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:35,880
Put that

1709
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:39,480
said hi.

1710
02:02:39,480 --> 02:02:41,960
I hope I'm pronouncing your name properly.

1711
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:45,440
You have to get
the physical number of rows

1712
02:02:45,440 --> 02:02:47,600
and then you have to print those out
as well.

1713
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:54,080
And guys, make sure everyone
is saving your files before

1714
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:55,600
you run your Java program.

1715
02:02:55,600 --> 02:03:05,000
Otherwise
you guys might get different results.

1716
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,520
Some here now.

1717
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:12,720
I got it now. Thank you.

1718
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:15,480
Is there anyone else
who is getting any issues?

1719
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:19,760
Nabeel, is your visual field.

1720
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:24,000
Someone else was getting two rows
and now you getting two rows.

1721
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,960
After any change in Excel file,
it should be saved.

1722
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:28,080
Yes, it should be saved.

1723
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:31,080
Farhad,
make sure you are saving your file.

1724
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:37,560
And there are four rules
in your Excel file.

1725
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:40,560
There are four roads in an Excel file
and you are storing that file

1726
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,840
and also you are reading the same file.

1727
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:45,840
Make sure guys,
you are reading the same file

1728
02:03:47,160 --> 02:03:47,800
because I

1729
02:03:47,800 --> 02:03:51,560
think you guys are still reading that file
from the previous file

1730
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:54,840
because that file had two rows
I have created.

1731
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:58,920
This is a new file that I have created
and I have saved it.

1732
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:01,440
Are you guys still using the old file?

1733
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:04,840
Because that file had two rows

1734
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,800
and yes, one is on your computer
and one is your intelligence.

1735
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:22,960
If you are using the file from
intelligence, you have to save that file.

1736
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,640
Soon it will be clear what is the issue.

1737
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:26,080
Those are getting two rows.

1738
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:29,280
Soon it will be soon it will be clear
when we will be printing the data.

1739
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:33,920
Not very soon.

1740
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,560
It will be clear, don't worry.

1741
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:38,440
So now I got the number of rules

1742
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:41,520
that are present inside.

1743
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:42,680
Seems like 2 minutes.

1744
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:48,520
And you still you will start yelling.

1745
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:52,440
Okay, so guys,
we now have the number of frauds.

1746
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:57,320
So now what I can do,
I can start a follow loop, right?

1747
02:04:57,320 --> 02:05:01,000
I can start to follow to get all the rules
one by one.

1748
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:02,840
So for example, if

1749
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:07,920
from this sheet, if I say sheet dot,

1750
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:11,640
get roll, if I write zero,

1751
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:14,160
I will be getting the raw number
zero, right.

1752
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:17,600
If I say

1753
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:23,320
you guys don't have to follow me in here.

1754
02:05:23,320 --> 02:05:27,680
So if I type discord manually for lines,

1755
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:33,520
then I will be getting all those four rows
right.

1756
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:38,640
How can I use a loop tool
to get this number zero from three?

1757
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:43,520
I can save for?

1758
02:05:43,520 --> 02:05:48,160
I starting from 0l4

1759
02:05:49,120 --> 02:05:53,720
and I can write this once.

1760
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:54,760
Right?

1761
02:05:55,160 --> 02:06:00,200
And if I boss I in here, will

1762
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,640
I get the same behavior guys as this one?

1763
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:06,360
Then will
I be able to get all the rows one by one?

1764
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,000
Then this loop will execute

1765
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,560
starting zero till three.

1766
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,360
Do you guys understand
what how this loop is?

1767
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:23,120
Will give me the same results
as this one. Yes.

1768
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:26,040
I should be using the number of rows
to make it more generic.

1769
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:26,760
Okay.

1770
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:31,200
So you have replaced number of rows
because it is also returning before.

1771
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,160
Right?

1772
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:35,720
Is there anyone who's confused about this
loop over this loop is going

1773
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:47,600
right so I can remove this one.

1774
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:50,040
Right? This is Manuel I'm using.

1775
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:56,720
So once I get a row,

1776
02:06:56,720 --> 02:07:00,160
so let's say A for the first start
duration, I will be on this row.

1777
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:01,000
Right?

1778
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:04,800
This rule has one, two,
three and four cells.

1779
02:07:06,360 --> 02:07:07,960
So what I can do,

1780
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:12,720
I can again get the number of cells
as well in that specific row.

1781
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:17,480
For example, if I say integer number of

1782
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:22,200
cells, I can get the actual number

1783
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:26,560
of by saying row door
to back the physical number of cells.

1784
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:29,760
Can you guys tell me for the first start
duration what

1785
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:32,320
this physical number of cells
will return me

1786
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:40,440
for? Right.

1787
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:43,880
Because there are one, two, three

1788
02:07:44,120 --> 02:07:48,200
and four cells in my program right?

1789
02:07:48,200 --> 02:07:49,760
And now

1790
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:53,160
I have this number of cells.

1791
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:55,200
I can write another loop. Right.

1792
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:57,840
Who got the data
from all the cells? One by one.

1793
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:02,480
So I can say and I can write
another loop de is equal to zero.

1794
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:04,760
J is less than number of cells.

1795
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:08,400
And now if I say

1796
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:13,640
the row lot that cell

1797
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:16,560
and I boss J in here

1798
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:21,480
and if I print this out

1799
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:31,680
and let's put a space as well in here

1800
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:36,600
and after this inner loop,
let's put a printout in here

1801
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:42,040
so that each row is printed in a new line.

1802
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:53,680
So now if I execute this program,
I should use print, not print.

1803
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:54,640
And then

1804
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:58,240
let me executive edit

1805
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:10,080
So now I get all of my data, all of my

1806
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:14,760
with the help of two loops,
one loop is going through all the rows.

1807
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:19,200
One by one, the inner loop goes through
all cells one by one.

1808
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:30,320
Do you guys get the same results?

1809
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:35,960
How many of you have understood
how these loops are working?

1810
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:39,840
I get an error with what I tell you, J.

1811
02:09:41,040 --> 02:09:42,080
If you have used

1812
02:09:42,080 --> 02:09:45,080
this I somewhere else
you will be getting an issue. Now.

1813
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:55,520
You guys want me to debug this code
and explain how it is working?

1814
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:56,000
Okay.

1815
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Let me debug disqualify you.

1816
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,080
Okay. Please focus in here.

1817
02:10:02,080 --> 02:10:05,880
So I placed the debug point in here

1818
02:10:06,600 --> 02:10:09,720
and then I am saying

1819
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:21,160
I am saying debug so.

1820
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:24,280
Okay. Perfect.

1821
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:26,040
So right now I am on this line, right?

1822
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:27,760
Printing out the number of rules.

1823
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:29,920
So I know that there are four rows.

1824
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:33,440
That's why I started an outer loop

1825
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:37,080
to go through those rows one by one.

1826
02:10:37,080 --> 02:10:39,720
So when I say

1827
02:10:39,720 --> 02:10:43,560
step over, I start the loop from zero.

1828
02:10:43,960 --> 02:10:44,800
Right?

1829
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:47,760
So right now the value of I is zero.

1830
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:50,440
So if the value of I is zero

1831
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:54,320
and I call this get or method
which row it will return me.

1832
02:10:54,320 --> 02:11:00,520
Guys, if I say sheet one dot get roll
and I pass zero,

1833
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:04,200
I am passing I in here
which roll it will return me.

1834
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:07,400
It will return to me First row, right?

1835
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:08,200
The first row.

1836
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:11,680
And once I have the first row.

1837
02:11:11,680 --> 02:11:14,320
How many columns
are there in the first row?

1838
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:16,840
How many cells are there in the first row.

1839
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:18,680
Four.

1840
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:23,560
So this row door
to get the physical number of cells.

1841
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:26,560
What? So that return me guys

1842
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:28,120
inside the first row

1843
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:32,480
I have one, two, three, four
and I am saying

1844
02:11:32,720 --> 02:11:36,880
hey Java from this roll
that I have got in the above line

1845
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:41,800
that tells me how many cells
actually contain the data.

1846
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:44,600
Tell me how many cells actually contain.

1847
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:47,280
So Java is saying that
there are four cells.

1848
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:50,880
So I start an other loop and that loop

1849
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,880
starts from zero till three
because this is on

1850
02:11:55,880 --> 02:12:01,000
index zero, this is one, two and three.

1851
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,960
So when I say row door to get cell

1852
02:12:05,480 --> 02:12:08,400
and right now the value of J is zero base.

1853
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,760
So if you observe J is zero.

1854
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:13,960
So if I say from first row, if I say

1855
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:17,160
get me the value of cell zero,
which values should I get? Dies

1856
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:23,640
the first name in here.

1857
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:25,440
Right? This first name.

1858
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:29,040
So if I open my console, if I say Sister

1859
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:31,480
dot out row zero got cell

1860
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:35,880
I got the first right first name right.

1861
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:40,840
And if I say row zero, get to cell one

1862
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:44,440
which value I should get

1863
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:48,960
the last name right.

1864
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,600
The row is still zero.

1865
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:53,240
And now I am saying you're told that
Hey Java,

1866
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:56,160
give me the next value from the next cell.

1867
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:02,560
So if I execute it again,
I get the last name.

1868
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:06,840
And because I am using print not println,
so all the data will be printed

1869
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:09,200
in the same rule in the console. Right.

1870
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:12,000
And the space is also printed in here
in between.

1871
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:16,720
Then I say again, Hey Java,
give me the data

1872
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:20,360
from the first row and cell two.

1873
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:22,640
So I get it.

1874
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:25,400
And then if I say a city, I get again.

1875
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:27,120
Right now the inner loop

1876
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:30,040
is it

1877
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:33,960
will be terminated after four iterations
right?

1878
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:35,240
Because we have four.

1879
02:13:35,240 --> 02:13:38,160
So now we will
go back to the outer loop again.

1880
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:41,400
So now we print a new line in here.

1881
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:41,960
System board.

1882
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:45,320
Also data is printed on this new line,

1883
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:48,280
and this time
what will be the value of eyeglasses?

1884
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:51,680
For the second iteration
of the outer loop?

1885
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:54,000
The value will now change one,

1886
02:13:54,960 --> 02:13:58,920
and if I save one, it means rule, right?

1887
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:03,280
Getting like the third B and the city.

1888
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:07,760
So this time I will repeat
this inner loop again from 0 to 4.

1889
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:10,440
But this time the rule is a second.

1890
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:16,200
So I am repeating same thing,
but this time the row is two.

1891
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:19,680
So I will get all the cells
that are from the second row.

1892
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:22,080
Then I repeat it again.

1893
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:27,760
I put the third rule, I repeat it again
and I keep on getting all the data

1894
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:29,320
like this. Is it clear now

1895
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:36,120
if cell two is blank, the loop ends there.

1896
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:39,880
Therefore, that role,
because the number of cells is dynamic,

1897
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:41,800
we will discuss that as well.

1898
02:14:41,800 --> 02:14:44,040
Dammit,
we will discuss those issues as well.

1899
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:44,400
Don't worry.

1900
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:47,520
You remind me at the end of the class

1901
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:49,320
let's let's go step by step.

1902
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:52,400
There is there is another method
which will give you

1903
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:57,480
the value of the last cell
that contains the data.

1904
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:01,680
This cell is actually telling you
how many rows actually have the data.

1905
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:04,680
Okay,
we will use that matter most probably

1906
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:06,560
we can.

1907
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:08,920
You guys can color your cells.

1908
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:10,720
You guys can write formulas.

1909
02:15:10,720 --> 02:15:13,800
You guys can do anything
that you guys can do

1910
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,600
with Excel using the as a particle.

1911
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:22,880
But we will not be discussing that.

1912
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:25,680
I will teach you how to do that.

1913
02:15:25,680 --> 02:15:30,000
But you guys don't need
the Excel formulas, right?

1914
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:33,640
Because You guys can write your
own formulas as well In Java

1915
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:37,000
now you have all the data from Excel here.

1916
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,200
Do you guys can play with that data
as you want? Yes.

1917
02:15:42,200 --> 02:15:45,040
You you don't need dividual basic anymore.

1918
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:45,720
Dammit.

1919
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:49,800
After learning this you will not you
you can do every all of your processing

1920
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:57,000
java.

1921
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:01,240
Or is there any one guy or guys
who would not understand

1922
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:35,120
how we are getting all this all this data.

1923
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:40,320
So we use this program for big data like
test or different log ins and passwords?

1924
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:43,480
Yes. And do automatic testing in test
cases.

1925
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:46,640
Yes. Alex. Yes.

1926
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:49,560
Access us from sheet one or two.

1927
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:51,480
Get real.

1928
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:54,000
Farhad, can you show me your import?

1929
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,720
Most probably you are not importing it
from the proper classes.

1930
02:16:57,720 --> 02:17:00,440
Please use these imports

1931
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:07,200
or let me actually

1932
02:17:09,440 --> 02:17:11,640
copy and paste

1933
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:31,360
my code.

1934
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:33,600
Yes, but remember guys,
you have the change.

1935
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:34,640
The port

1936
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,480
java dot util

1937
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:43,080
and you guys are looking

1938
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:46,880
for shortcuts everywhere.

1939
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:47,720
Yes there is.

1940
02:17:47,720 --> 02:17:51,520
There is a short one,
but it can create problems as well.

1941
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:55,280
These are always, always before
for the individual imports.

1942
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:56,880
They are always preferred

1943
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:59,840
because what happens
is that when you put that star

1944
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:04,320
Java taught you to stop, all the classes
from that package will be included.

1945
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:06,480
Your program.

1946
02:18:06,480 --> 02:18:10,600
So there there is a lot
how to do optimizations and all that.

1947
02:18:10,640 --> 02:18:13,200
Then your code is compiled
from source to binary.

1948
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,000
So we never want to do that.

1949
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,400
Start all means import
all the classes from that package.

1950
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:24,200
It's not good.

1951
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:26,120
Okay, so it's clear. It's clear right

1952
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:29,800
now, guys,

1953
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:32,760
instead of just displaying this data,

1954
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,840
let's let's try to store this data

1955
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:39,120
in Some kind of data structure

1956
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:41,880
does have a replica of the library is

1957
02:18:43,440 --> 02:18:45,840
which libraries the Excel Apache boy ones.

1958
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:48,720
No I don't think so. Excel has this one.

1959
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:53,680
We have to import it manually.

1960
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:55,440
Yes, it's pretty simple.

1961
02:18:55,440 --> 02:18:58,360
So instead of just printing out this data,
guys,

1962
02:18:58,360 --> 02:19:01,400
let's try to store that data
in some kind of data

1963
02:19:01,440 --> 02:19:04,840
constructor,
maybe in arrays or maybe in maps

1964
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:11,880
or something like that.

1965
02:19:11,880 --> 02:19:17,280
Can you guys suggest any data
which data structure can hold the rows

1966
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:29,760
and columns to

1967
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:34,240
the ADD is right

1968
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:36,600
to the arrays can hold the data

1969
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:40,800
or but to the errors they again,

1970
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:44,080
we have to specify the size in front of.

1971
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:46,040
They don't have a ready made matter.

1972
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:48,680
Did they have a lot of issues? Right.

1973
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:53,520
So can I can
I build a combination of maps and list

1974
02:19:53,520 --> 02:20:01,200
or science
or something like that, distorted Data.

1975
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:07,560
So let me copy this
main method from here. So

1976
02:20:10,920 --> 02:20:12,080
yeah, let's based

1977
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:21,280
it in here.

1978
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:21,880
All right.

1979
02:20:21,880 --> 02:20:23,760
So now this is important, guys.

1980
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:24,920
This can confuse you.

1981
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:34,200
So I want you to focus everyone.

1982
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:37,680
So the data structure that we will be
using, it's very important.

1983
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:41,480
You guys will be using same data structure
in your frameworks.

1984
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:44,160
So what I will do,

1985
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:53,160
I will create a map.

1986
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:55,520
First, I will create a map.

1987
02:20:55,520 --> 02:21:00,680
The key of the map will be this header.

1988
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:04,200
So I will say

1989
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:07,080
let me actually

1990
02:21:08,080 --> 02:21:10,760
give me one moment.

1991
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:13,440
So I will say

1992
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:19,520
just first name as the key

1993
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:24,120
and what should be the value of this key
for the first row,

1994
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:26,920
the value will be in,

1995
02:21:28,240 --> 02:21:31,640
then the second key will be last name

1996
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:34,920
The value will be

1997
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:37,040
Alexi.

1998
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:42,880
Oops.

1999
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:45,800
Then the third key will be age.

2000
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:51,240
The value will be 30, 40 will be city

2001
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:56,080
and the value will be

2002
02:21:57,840 --> 02:22:00,360
is it five?

2003
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:04,400
Am I pronouncing it right?

2004
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:05,760
Then I will.

2005
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:08,520
I will build another map.

2006
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:13,360
No. So again,

2007
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:18,640
the key will be Eve.

2008
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:24,680
So the key will be first name? No.

2009
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:34,240
Okay, let's forget about this.

2010
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:40,080
And this time.

2011
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:43,200
This time the value will be

2012
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:50,520
prints.

2013
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:53,480
Sorbonne.

2014
02:22:53,480 --> 02:22:59,600
Then in this.

2015
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:02,120
And then I will build another map.

2016
02:23:03,440 --> 02:23:04,640
The key is will be.

2017
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:06,840
And I am creating these new these maps.

2018
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:07,960
They are new. Okay?

2019
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:12,640
Each time I'm creating a new map.

2020
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:14,600
So, Asger

2021
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:19,160
and Z 27.

2022
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:22,040
And now.

2023
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:23,320
So I.

2024
02:23:23,320 --> 02:23:28,040
If I have three rows, I will be having

2025
02:23:30,040 --> 02:23:33,120
I transport metrics.

2026
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:36,880
If so, I will be having three maps

2027
02:23:36,880 --> 02:23:42,200
right.

2028
02:23:42,200 --> 02:23:46,560
Is let's call it map one.

2029
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:47,480
Let's call it

2030
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,480
map to

2031
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:56,400
and looks like map three.

2032
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:57,920
Can I do this guys.

2033
02:23:57,920 --> 02:24:02,400
Can I create three maps and in each map

2034
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:10,160
can I stored the data like this?

2035
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:13,560
Guys, do you understand what I am doing?

2036
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:16,680
I am creating three maps

2037
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:19,040
separate maps

2038
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:22,160
different from each other
and putting this data in here.

2039
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:25,440
And then now

2040
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:28,760
there will be too many maps
if if there are too many of those.

2041
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:29,600
Right.

2042
02:24:30,400 --> 02:24:33,000
So let's put these maps inside a list.

2043
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:39,560
So I will then create a list.

2044
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:44,600
And on the index number zero,
I will place this map one

2045
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:46,920
on index.

2046
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:50,680
Number two, I will place

2047
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:53,880
this map to

2048
02:24:55,360 --> 02:24:59,080
and then this map to the right.

2049
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:00,480
All you guys can think of.

2050
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:04,920
I will wrap this these maps.

2051
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:07,280
I will create a list and each

2052
02:25:08,480 --> 02:25:09,920
index of the list

2053
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:17,040
zero index
one or two will be having a map.

2054
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:17,680
Right?

2055
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:23,080
So I have built a custom data structure

2056
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:27,440
with the help of maps
and loops to store this data.

2057
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:30,840
And as per your needs in real life,

2058
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:36,160
you guys can also use these different
vector structures that we have learned

2059
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:39,560
in the collections framework

2060
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:41,560
to store different types of data.

2061
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:46,680
Now, if this thing makes sense,
I will write the code for you.

2062
02:25:46,680 --> 02:25:50,280
But if this thing is not making sense,
please ask me questions

2063
02:25:50,440 --> 02:26:03,600
right now.

2064
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:07,440
Actually, let me keep this image
so that you guys can

2065
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:19,320
therefore put it to later all.

2066
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:21,680
So I will keep this image in here.

2067
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:28,680
Okay. But

2068
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:32,040
so let me remove this.

2069
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:35,480
Oops, it's

2070
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,800
okay. And

2071
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:45,440
this time let me open this picture

2072
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:47,800
in here.

2073
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:50,040
So you guys remember this picture, okay.

2074
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:57,080
It will help
you understand what I am doing.

2075
02:26:57,080 --> 02:27:00,560
So this code of ours is already working
fine right now.

2076
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:03,560
It shows,
but instead of printing out the data

2077
02:27:04,520 --> 02:27:07,000
we want to store that data

2078
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:11,480
in the form of maps for each row.

2079
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:13,560
For each row.

2080
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:15,520
Want to create a new map.

2081
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:17,520
Yeah. So.

2082
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:20,720
And this will also help
you understand the ripple tools.

2083
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:24,600
Zero nine So first I am creating a list.

2084
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:27,320
Inside that list.

2085
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:29,600
I have a map.

2086
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:31,920
And inside that map, let's

2087
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:35,440
to keep things
a simple let's use settings.

2088
02:27:36,800 --> 02:28:01,560
Okay,

2089
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:05,160
So do you guys understand
how I have created this data structure?

2090
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:09,440
I created a list inside the list.

2091
02:28:09,440 --> 02:28:10,760
I have a map.

2092
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:14,240
So each index of

2093
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:16,640
the list,
it will actually be storing a map

2094
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,080
Do you guys understand
this, this data structure,

2095
02:28:21,040 --> 02:28:24,200
how I am creating a list of maps.

2096
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:28,520
So previously you guys were storing
personal tags,

2097
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:33,560
string of diverse numbers, and different
different things inside the list.

2098
02:28:34,360 --> 02:28:39,360
This time I am storing
maps inside the list.

2099
02:28:39,360 --> 02:28:40,200
This is possible.

2100
02:28:40,200 --> 02:28:44,840
You can store lists inside of the maps or
maps inside the list or list inside this.

2101
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:48,320
Basically, you can create any combination
of data structure.

2102
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:52,840
So I have created a list of maps

2103
02:28:58,320 --> 02:29:00,800
and before each row

2104
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:05,040
I will create a new

2105
02:29:05,040 --> 02:29:12,560
so I will say hash map.

2106
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:13,880
String

2107
02:29:14,960 --> 02:29:18,520
string hash map is equal to nil

2108
02:29:20,760 --> 02:29:22,320
hash map.

2109
02:29:23,240 --> 02:29:25,560
So before each row.

2110
02:29:26,040 --> 02:29:30,920
So this outer loop is
is going through the rows, Right?

2111
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:34,320
So before I enter this inner loop,

2112
02:29:34,320 --> 02:29:38,280
I always create a new map.

2113
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:44,960
And inside this map, inside
this map, what do I do?

2114
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:45,840
I say,

2115
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:50,080
So let me show you how
to do without the map, without the loop.

2116
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:53,760
So I will say hash dot put.

2117
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:56,440
And what will be my key?

2118
02:29:56,440 --> 02:29:59,080
My key will be

2119
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:03,360
first name

2120
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:05,840
and what will be my data?

2121
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:10,240
My data will be a rows zero door

2122
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:14,480
to get cell zero.

2123
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:15,240
Right.

2124
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:19,080
And then I have to do those things as well
so that the data is converted.

2125
02:30:19,080 --> 02:30:19,960
Boasting

2126
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:24,640
it is said before that class will be hard.

2127
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:27,440
Is it not making sense, guys?

2128
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:28,200
It will be clear.

2129
02:30:28,200 --> 02:30:30,280
Just give me one moment

2130
02:30:38,240 --> 02:30:39,000
and last

2131
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:45,400
name, age

2132
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:49,320
and city.

2133
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:50,920
So cell zero.

2134
02:30:50,920 --> 02:30:52,840
Cell one.

2135
02:30:53,160 --> 02:30:54,920
Cell to

2136
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:56,920
cell three.

2137
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:57,760
Okay,

2138
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:04,480
focus on this code codebase for each row.

2139
02:31:04,480 --> 02:31:06,880
For each row

2140
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:09,160
I am creating a map

2141
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:13,080
and inside that map

2142
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:18,200
is something we will use a lot at work.

2143
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:21,880
So you guys will create
the readymade methods for this

2144
02:31:22,360 --> 02:31:25,240
and then you will be using those methods.

2145
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:28,480
You guys will not be writing it again
and again only once inside

2146
02:31:28,480 --> 02:31:33,760
your project.

2147
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:34,080
Yeah.

2148
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:40,080
So from each row
I get the value of cell zero.

2149
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:41,040
What for?

2150
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:41,880
For the row one.

2151
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:48,200
What will this cell
zero will return me right? Yes.

2152
02:31:48,200 --> 02:31:50,440
You guys will be having access
to the frame loads,

2153
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:55,320
but it's better to tool to understand
it as well

2154
02:31:55,320 --> 02:32:08,560
so that you guys can do the modifications.

2155
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:12,680
Yes, it will take time.

2156
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:15,760
No. Later
we will be getting the first name right.

2157
02:32:15,880 --> 02:32:20,200
If we want to get the game,
we have to start the outer loop

2158
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:22,560
from which index
I start at the alternate days

2159
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:25,360
if I want to directly jump
to get start of first name,

2160
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:28,800
I should say one in here

2161
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:32,920
right.

2162
02:32:32,920 --> 02:32:36,000
And I created the hash map.

2163
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,400
I put it back in here. Right.

2164
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:40,560
Let's not use this loop. And that's

2165
02:32:41,560 --> 02:32:42,720
that's it.

2166
02:32:43,960 --> 02:32:46,120
You have successfully stored the data.

2167
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:48,760
And one last line.

2168
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:52,480
We have to store this map
inside the list as well.

2169
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:55,560
So Excel that are both ADD and that

2170
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,520
hash map.

2171
02:32:59,600 --> 02:33:01,920
All right, next loop.

2172
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:04,800
So when this loop will be done executing,

2173
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:10,520
No, I want you to type it, Katrina.

2174
02:33:10,520 --> 02:33:12,440
It will be good if you type it.

2175
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:16,880
But let me send this to.

2176
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:21,400
Okay, So after the loop, if I print out

2177
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:28,920
my list of maps, why we change it to one?

2178
02:33:28,920 --> 02:33:32,600
Because if I change, if I don't change
I to one,

2179
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:36,720
it will read the first name
last name, ID and city as well.

2180
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:40,240
And it will sort that
that I want to exclude that first row

2181
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:42,640
because they are headers

2182
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:45,880
line 32.

2183
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:49,560
I am storing that map inside the list.

2184
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:53,640
Mohamud storing
that map that I created the list,

2185
02:33:53,760 --> 02:34:02,600
the list that I created in here.

2186
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:03,640
We don't need it.

2187
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:05,840
Later on I will replace it with the loop.

2188
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:07,320
Then you will be needing. Okay.

2189
02:34:07,320 --> 02:34:08,720
Right now we don't need assignment

2190
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:10,440
right now.

2191
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:11,440
We don't need

2192
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:22,080
a Why don't we read the keys?

2193
02:34:23,120 --> 02:34:26,280
But putting them again,
Yes, we will do that.

2194
02:34:27,040 --> 02:34:29,640
But to let's let's go step by step

2195
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:33,440
so that you guys understand at the end
I will make everything dynamic.

2196
02:34:34,320 --> 02:34:36,600
You guys will not be hard
coding any single thing,

2197
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:39,880
but just make things simple.

2198
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:50,160
So if I execute this program, guys,
I get a list.

2199
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:55,920
And inside each list there is a map.

2200
02:34:55,920 --> 02:35:00,000
So this is a map inside
a list at index zero that contains

2201
02:35:00,600 --> 02:35:04,880
the as first name value as E as,
last name value

2202
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:09,680
as a city, value as your key or whatever
it is.

2203
02:35:10,240 --> 02:35:12,840
Then on the second index,
you see this comma

2204
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:15,400
on the second index

2205
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,880
in here and here

2206
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:23,160
I have first name, name Prince,
last name for bond and city.

2207
02:35:23,160 --> 02:35:23,640
Then age.

2208
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:27,600
Then you have another map

2209
02:35:27,880 --> 02:35:31,080
that has the data from the row
number three.

2210
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:33,360
Is it clear, guys?

2211
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:38,880
Do you guys get the same results?

2212
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:42,840
Are you guys able to see all of your data
in the form of list of maps?

2213
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:52,920
Yes. Let me change the clock.

2214
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:54,120
I hope you feel better.

2215
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:57,120
Silva okay.

2216
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:00,000
So tell me
how many of you don't understand

2217
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:06,520
what is going on
so that I can debug this code for you.

2218
02:36:06,520 --> 02:36:08,240
It's fine if you guys don't understand.

2219
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:10,760
I will debug this code for

2220
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:14,760
what is tool string.

2221
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:17,840
So all the data is ready
in the form of objects.

2222
02:36:17,840 --> 02:36:22,880
I am converting it to string because
I have created this map of strings.

2223
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:24,960
If you make an object off,

2224
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:29,320
if you make a map of objects,
do not need to load that those string.

2225
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:30,720
Can you

2226
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:35,040
send issue?

2227
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:40,240
Here is my excel file.

2228
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:48,920
Okay, let me debug it for you.

2229
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:51,840
So I need to place a debug client. Right.

2230
02:36:51,840 --> 02:36:53,040
What is my list?

2231
02:36:53,040 --> 02:36:56,320
Automate list sorted on yours is not

2232
02:36:57,360 --> 02:36:59,600
are it depends.

2233
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:08,840
Are you using array list and hash maps.

2234
02:37:08,840 --> 02:37:12,160
If you want the data in in a sequence

2235
02:37:12,160 --> 02:37:15,000
you can use a link to the hash map
Simon in here.

2236
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:22,640
Then you will be getting
the same business.

2237
02:37:22,640 --> 02:37:26,160
Let me actually replace it
with linking the hash. Mark

2238
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:30,280
It's always good to store

2239
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:32,800
the got in linked hash map

2240
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:36,480
so that we retained that order

2241
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:39,640
from the file.

2242
02:37:39,640 --> 02:37:43,320
So before the debugging,
I need to place the debug point.

2243
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:46,560
So I place a book
point in here. Then I see

2244
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:55,360
the debug.

2245
02:37:55,360 --> 02:37:58,680
So initially I create is the font readable

2246
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:04,680
days.

2247
02:38:04,680 --> 02:38:05,360
Okay.

2248
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:11,160
So first of all, I create a list of maps.

2249
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:13,960
Okay. Like this, a list of maps.

2250
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:17,560
But right now this list of maps is empty.

2251
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:20,520
Okay, it's empty.

2252
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:23,200
So I put into the number of no,
that is not required.

2253
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:26,440
So I get the first row

2254
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,040
with the help of I'll provide loop

2255
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:34,520
and I create a new map.

2256
02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:38,240
Right now, this first

2257
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:43,080
row that I have got, it
contains the data in

2258
02:38:43,560 --> 02:38:51,840
in all the cells, right?

2259
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:57,280
If I say road or to get cell zero,
I will gain.

2260
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:57,960
Right.

2261
02:38:57,960 --> 02:39:01,120
Because I am starting the loop
this time from one.

2262
02:39:02,480 --> 02:39:06,240
So I am actually on this road
second, dropping like Z, part B and this

2263
02:39:07,120 --> 02:39:12,000
so I am saying row
zero, get me the value of cell zero.

2264
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,480
So it will give me king

2265
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:20,720
So I break this. KING

2266
02:39:20,720 --> 02:39:24,800
And I store in here inside this map.

2267
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:30,840
And the key that I am using is first name.

2268
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:35,280
Then I pick the second value
because I am specifying cell one

2269
02:39:35,960 --> 02:39:38,520
and I store that inside the map

2270
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:42,240
with the key last name.

2271
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:44,360
Then I put the third value

2272
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:50,280
in here and I save it inside the map.

2273
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:56,440
The form of the key. It.

2274
02:39:56,440 --> 02:39:58,720
Then I pick the last value.

2275
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:04,480
And I started as with the key city.

2276
02:40:04,480 --> 02:40:06,760
So now I have a map.

2277
02:40:07,480 --> 02:40:10,720
Now I have this map created

2278
02:40:10,720 --> 02:40:12,880
and filled with the data

2279
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:17,760
and now I am storing that map.

2280
02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:21,000
I am saying Excel data,
which is this list.

2281
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:24,480
I am saying Excel data
or that and I am putting this map

2282
02:40:24,600 --> 02:40:27,440
inside that list at index zero.

2283
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:30,720
Is it clear, guys,
or there is something that is confusing

2284
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:37,720
for this first iteration?

2285
02:40:37,720 --> 02:40:39,840
The rest will be same.

2286
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:41,840
The only thing that will change

2287
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:46,120
for the second iteration,

2288
02:40:46,120 --> 02:40:49,120
we will simply replace the first row.

2289
02:40:50,600 --> 02:40:53,520
So if you check this hash map

2290
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:57,320
at the bottom, first

2291
02:40:57,360 --> 02:41:02,960
name King, last name, Alexi, age 30,
and the city is also saved.

2292
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:07,320
I am still confused

2293
02:41:07,360 --> 02:41:11,160
the, uh, nine row number 19 domino.

2294
02:41:12,440 --> 02:41:14,280
Not a line number on the right.

2295
02:41:14,280 --> 02:41:15,720
Number 19 is very simple.

2296
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:19,240
I am hoping that the map inside the list,

2297
02:41:19,320 --> 02:41:23,800
just as I put the string inside the list
and number inside the list.

2298
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:26,440
A person object inside this.

2299
02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:28,520
This map is also an object.

2300
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:32,120
I am putting that object inside the list,
storing that object

2301
02:41:32,400 --> 02:41:34,440
inside the list at index zero.

2302
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:39,880
So you can see you can do that.

2303
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:44,480
Yes. Alex, We moved the data from Excel
to our hash map.

2304
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:46,080
Yes, you are right.

2305
02:41:47,320 --> 02:41:50,040
Yes, you are right.

2306
02:41:50,040 --> 02:41:54,000
So once the once the map is filled
with the data guys

2307
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:57,560
from the row number one.

2308
02:41:57,560 --> 02:42:00,320
So right now, if you see this Excel

2309
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:03,600
that at least it has a size zero, right.

2310
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:05,280
It does not have anything.

2311
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:09,240
The moment I see Excel that are not
and to what happens in here

2312
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:10,880
excel that are not bad.

2313
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:14,600
Now this Excel data,
the size has changed to one

2314
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:18,840
and if I expand this add index is zero.

2315
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:24,440
I have a linked hash map of size for
if I expand that,

2316
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:28,440
I have my data inside the list.

2317
02:42:28,760 --> 02:42:31,920
I have map inside of the map,
I have my data.

2318
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:33,360
Okay.

2319
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:36,120
If kind of nesting, I am putting one

2320
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:39,120
data structure inside of the other.

2321
02:42:39,560 --> 02:42:40,480
Does it make sense?

2322
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:41,680
Now come on now

2323
02:42:43,400 --> 02:42:48,360
let's.

2324
02:42:48,360 --> 02:42:51,760
So right now on index number zero,
I have the data

2325
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:55,080
from rule number one.

2326
02:42:55,080 --> 02:42:57,960
So when I will be on the psyche
and I iteration,

2327
02:42:58,800 --> 02:43:03,600
I again create a new map, okay,
I create a new map as well.

2328
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:06,840
I will share the code,
create a new map, and

2329
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:11,320
I call it again, hash map.

2330
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:13,320
This hash map again empty.

2331
02:43:13,320 --> 02:43:18,400
I will fill my code
the same like you still not working.

2332
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:23,640
Mustapha,
can you please post in this port?

2333
02:43:23,640 --> 02:43:28,120
Why did you put I is the to one
Because I want to start getting the data

2334
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:31,960
from this raw second the row
that is at index number one.

2335
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:34,200
I want to get the data from here.

2336
02:43:34,200 --> 02:43:37,200
Not I don't I'm
not interested in the in the first row

2337
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:39,120
because they are simply headers. Right.

2338
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:45,280
I am interested in the actual data.

2339
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:51,160
Lobo, is it clear?

2340
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:55,280
Okay, so now I get the second row, right?

2341
02:43:55,320 --> 02:43:56,280
What? What? What?

2342
02:43:56,280 --> 02:43:59,320
This hash map, guys, First name prince

2343
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:02,280
are last name

2344
02:44:02,280 --> 02:44:07,360
for born, then EJ.

2345
02:44:07,880 --> 02:44:11,640
And once I am done filling the second map.

2346
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:14,280
So right now this Excel data.

2347
02:44:14,320 --> 02:44:17,400
Oops, this Excel data,
it has only one element.

2348
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:21,840
The moment I say Excel that are not add
this excel

2349
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:25,320
that I will now store two maps.

2350
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:31,040
The first map contains for Ali
masking let's see 30 bla bla.

2351
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:35,440
And now the second element contains
Prince or Bon Edge and City.

2352
02:44:36,160 --> 02:44:39,280
So now I have two elements in my list.

2353
02:44:39,720 --> 02:44:42,920
First element is a map
that has four entries.

2354
02:44:43,280 --> 02:44:46,840
Second element is also a map
that also has four entries.

2355
02:44:46,840 --> 02:44:49,960
And now I can repeat,
keep on repeating this loop

2356
02:44:49,960 --> 02:44:55,240
and I can put all the rows
from my Excel sheet inside this map.

2357
02:44:56,160 --> 02:44:59,880
Does it make sense now, guys?

2358
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:01,120
Rafa to this picture.

2359
02:45:01,120 --> 02:45:03,760
Guys,
this code is doing exactly what I have

2360
02:45:04,680 --> 02:45:09,240
shown in the picture.

2361
02:45:09,240 --> 02:45:11,920
And once you guys
debug this on your computers,

2362
02:45:11,960 --> 02:45:14,280
it will make much more sense.

2363
02:45:14,280 --> 02:45:15,720
Do you guys have any questions

2364
02:45:18,360 --> 02:45:21,480
and you guys
can come up with your own data structure.

2365
02:45:21,480 --> 02:45:25,160
Does that mean you guys don't
necessarily need to use this exact purpose

2366
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:37,880
structure? Yes.

2367
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:40,360
You guys can create your own data
structures,

2368
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:44,280
combining maps with the lists with starts

2369
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:49,600
putting the you guys can put basically
any collection inside another collection.

2370
02:45:49,760 --> 02:45:54,960
So for example,
I can create a map of lists, lists,

2371
02:45:55,440 --> 02:46:04,000
array lists, so I can have anything.

2372
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:07,920
So now I'm still hard coding these values.

2373
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:11,360
Can I get these values from,
the Excel sheet as well, guys,

2374
02:46:12,920 --> 02:46:15,600
can I get these values
from the Excel sheet as well?

2375
02:46:15,720 --> 02:46:21,400
This first name, last name.

2376
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:27,680
So this data in which wrote this
that I stored,

2377
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:30,480
it is stored in the rows zero, Right.

2378
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:34,160
So let me create one more demo.

2379
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:37,800
Okay. We are going step by step, right?

2380
02:46:37,800 --> 02:46:59,360
Making it all dynamic. So

2381
02:47:00,920 --> 02:47:04,400
If I say

2382
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:06,720
the role, the role

2383
02:47:07,720 --> 02:47:10,600
of zero or maybe role

2384
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:12,880
zero like this is equal to

2385
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:16,320
shade 1.2 get role.

2386
02:47:16,320 --> 02:47:19,800
And if I pass zero which do this this,

2387
02:47:20,600 --> 02:47:23,040
this line of code
which role it will give me guys

2388
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:26,280
the role

2389
02:47:26,280 --> 02:47:28,680
that is that index number zero right

2390
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:33,200
that contains the first name
last name a density

2391
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:37,200
is it clear, guys,
if I write the score sheet,

2392
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:41,000
one or two give give me the row
and I pass zero in here,

2393
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:46,560
I will be getting the first rule,
the Excel sheet.

2394
02:47:46,560 --> 02:47:47,880
Is it clear

2395
02:47:48,480 --> 02:47:50,640
now? I can I can do the same.

2396
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:53,400
I can say instead of first name I can say

2397
02:47:54,520 --> 02:47:56,520
role zero

2398
02:47:56,520 --> 02:48:02,160
dot get cell zero and then dot posting.

2399
02:48:02,720 --> 02:48:05,240
So this role zero get cell zero

2400
02:48:05,240 --> 02:48:10,200
what it will return me guys.

2401
02:48:10,200 --> 02:48:14,280
So basically you are telling the system
go to rule one by one.

2402
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:17,360
Yes the first time when you do rule I in

2403
02:48:17,360 --> 02:48:20,160
row zero in my map that is set up here,

2404
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:24,360
please put existing data
from every cell in my map. Yes.

2405
02:48:25,120 --> 02:48:29,520
So this the row zero cell
zero will give me the first name?

2406
02:48:29,640 --> 02:48:33,480
Yes. Let me me. It.

2407
02:48:33,480 --> 02:48:36,520
And if I want to
if I want to get the last name,

2408
02:48:36,520 --> 02:48:40,800
guys, let's write it in here.

2409
02:48:40,800 --> 02:48:42,920
If I want to log that last name.

2410
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:44,840
It is also stored in zero zero

2411
02:48:46,760 --> 02:48:48,680
rows, zero

2412
02:48:48,840 --> 02:48:51,480
dot that cell.

2413
02:48:51,960 --> 02:48:56,760
And then I need to pass one in here
and then posting.

2414
02:48:56,760 --> 02:48:57,480
Right.

2415
02:48:58,520 --> 02:49:00,600
And then I can do the same

2416
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:05,960
to get the image.

2417
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:09,320
But this time I need to pass two.

2418
02:49:10,280 --> 02:49:13,320
And then for the city

2419
02:49:14,360 --> 02:49:18,240
also three empty.

2420
02:49:18,680 --> 02:49:20,640
Now let's execute this code.

2421
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:28,800
Max. Execute discord.

2422
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:33,280
So see, first name, last name ID and city.

2423
02:49:33,320 --> 02:49:36,920
Now I am not hard coding,
I am getting it dynamically

2424
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:40,320
from the row zero

2425
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:43,320
and there is one more thing guys.

2426
02:49:43,320 --> 02:49:44,760
Do you see some kind of pattern?

2427
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:48,360
Cannot replace these four lines of code
with a single line.

2428
02:49:48,360 --> 02:49:54,240
And can I write a loop in here?

2429
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:58,200
I am repeating the same line of code,
but sometimes I have

2430
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:02,200
012, three, four right.

2431
02:50:02,200 --> 02:50:04,640
Can we delete line number 28?

2432
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:10,000
Yes, that's deleted, but we will be
needing it in the next iteration.

2433
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,480
Right? Yes.

2434
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:15,680
Let me send decode.

2435
02:50:15,680 --> 02:50:17,320
So now we are one step

2436
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:23,280
into this code making it dynamic.

2437
02:50:25,080 --> 02:50:28,920
So let's in the next demo
and I want you to observe.

2438
02:50:28,920 --> 02:50:31,440
This code dies after the class.

2439
02:50:31,440 --> 02:50:34,400
These steps they will help you understand

2440
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:37,800
what is going on.

2441
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:40,120
How come I am getting it first,

2442
02:50:41,800 --> 02:50:54,280
Jimi, can you share the code?

2443
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:56,880
You let me copy

2444
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:01,280
now I will be needing this

2445
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:05,800
while I am getting an

2446
02:51:07,440 --> 02:51:09,920
null pointer exception

2447
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,960
is due to an

2448
02:51:19,160 --> 02:51:21,280
on line

2449
02:51:21,280 --> 02:51:22,640
to undo five.

2450
02:51:22,640 --> 02:51:25,920
Make sure the city is

2451
02:51:25,920 --> 02:51:28,560
with proper case.

2452
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:32,760
Make sure the in your excel sheet and logo

2453
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:36,360
you have the city with the lowercase

2454
02:51:36,360 --> 02:51:40,600
and make make sure
there is some kind of data inside there.

2455
02:51:40,600 --> 02:51:42,720
So Okay.

2456
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:51,240
If you leave any of the cells blank,
you will be getting an error.

2457
02:51:51,240 --> 02:51:56,120
All Yes, give me because I am
using the link, the hash map.

2458
02:51:56,120 --> 02:52:00,920
I changed it to link Kashmir.

2459
02:52:00,920 --> 02:52:02,520
Okay, so now

2460
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:05,280
I know

2461
02:52:05,280 --> 02:52:10,480
how many cells are there
in my rows, right?

2462
02:52:10,480 --> 02:52:13,400
And with the help of this
get physical number of cells

2463
02:52:14,840 --> 02:52:18,000
so I can now save for.

2464
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:23,200
I gave from zero to number of cells.

2465
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:29,960
And instead of writing all of this,

2466
02:52:29,960 --> 02:52:32,600
I can replace it with

2467
02:52:34,520 --> 02:52:35,640
with, you

2468
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:40,040
know, I don't need because I was repeating
four lines of code unnecessarily.

2469
02:52:40,080 --> 02:52:40,560
Right.

2470
02:52:40,560 --> 02:52:46,080
I can use a loop for there.

2471
02:52:46,080 --> 02:52:53,080
And now if I execute my code,

2472
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:57,040
I again
see my data stored in the form of list

2473
02:52:57,360 --> 02:53:00,640
of maps, list of apps.

2474
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:06,400
So you guys see now we are not hard
coding anything, right?

2475
02:53:06,400 --> 02:53:08,560
Everything is dynamic.

2476
02:53:08,560 --> 02:53:12,560
We are calculating number of cells
which contains the data dynamic.

2477
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:14,160
The number of rows are dynamic,

2478
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:17,280
number of columns are big dynamically,
everything is dynamic.

2479
02:53:18,520 --> 02:53:19,640
So this is what we

2480
02:53:19,640 --> 02:53:24,680
to build for our framework.

2481
02:53:24,680 --> 02:53:27,040
Okay, so this is how we get all the data.

2482
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:29,360
Now, there can be thousand rows.

2483
02:53:29,360 --> 02:53:32,840
There can be 2000 columns
inside that Excel sheet.

2484
02:53:32,840 --> 02:53:38,280
This program will fetch all the data
from your Excel sheet.

2485
02:53:38,280 --> 02:53:40,080
Is it clear, guys?

2486
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:42,120
It's a little tricky.

2487
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:43,560
You guys need some practice.

2488
02:53:43,560 --> 02:53:46,000
You guys need
for debugging to play with this code.

2489
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:46,600
Okay.

2490
02:53:46,600 --> 02:53:52,440
And maybe rewatch
this part of the video again.

2491
02:53:52,440 --> 02:53:56,040
So let's build

2492
02:53:57,400 --> 02:53:59,040
a config.

2493
02:53:59,040 --> 02:54:02,800
So let's build a specific class
because if every time I need

2494
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:06,840
to read the data from the Excel,
I don't want to rewrite this code, right?

2495
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:08,920
I can make a lot of mistakes.

2496
02:54:08,920 --> 02:54:10,480
I can introduce bugs.

2497
02:54:10,480 --> 02:54:15,840
So let's create a function out of this
code and every I have to read the data.

2498
02:54:16,040 --> 02:54:18,040
I will simply be calling this method.

2499
02:54:18,120 --> 02:54:21,120
So this is what you guys will be doing
or on your job.

2500
02:54:21,120 --> 02:54:24,440
So you guys keep on asking me as God
what will we do.

2501
02:54:24,800 --> 02:54:27,280
You guys will be me.

2502
02:54:27,520 --> 02:54:30,320
You guys just need to understand
how the functions work.

2503
02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:32,640
You guys will be calling the functions.

2504
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:35,160
Everything has been billed already.

2505
02:54:35,160 --> 02:54:37,600
Java is there for 25 years.

2506
02:54:38,320 --> 02:54:42,000
Most probably be
the issues that you will be facing.

2507
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:46,280
The solutions are already on stack,
the functions that you will be needing.

2508
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:49,240
They are already built by someone
and they are already shared.

2509
02:54:49,240 --> 02:54:51,640
Open source are your companies.
They will be.

2510
02:54:52,200 --> 02:54:54,320
They have built all those functions.

2511
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:55,960
So don't worry about jobs.

2512
02:54:55,960 --> 02:54:57,840
Jobs are a lot simpler.

2513
02:54:57,840 --> 02:55:03,040
And because you guys are seeing this stuff
for the first time, so no matter

2514
02:55:03,360 --> 02:55:06,480
even if this stuff is easy,
it will look harder

2515
02:55:06,480 --> 02:55:09,360
because there are a lot of data structures
and all of that in work.

2516
02:55:09,800 --> 02:55:11,760
So you guys will be good on your jobs.

2517
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:16,920
Don't worry about that.

2518
02:55:16,920 --> 02:55:20,080
Yes, maybe we should take a break.

2519
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:24,480
And if you guys are facing any issues.

2520
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:28,720
Please
resolve your issues during the break.

2521
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:33,000
How many of us ask for help from you
after getting job?

2522
02:55:33,360 --> 02:55:39,000
Honestly speaking, I am teaching
from batch it only four or three of them.

2523
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:42,640
They ask for my help
and it was very simple.

2524
02:55:42,640 --> 02:55:43,680
They were unable to.

2525
02:55:43,680 --> 02:55:47,320
Maybe some one of the students left unable
to clone a project.

2526
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:52,560
The other student has to test a website
that was written in Python.

2527
02:55:52,560 --> 02:55:54,240
That's why he needed the help.

2528
02:55:54,240 --> 02:56:00,080
And these are these were simple things.

2529
02:56:00,080 --> 02:56:01,080
No problem.

2530
02:56:01,080 --> 02:56:03,360
You will have plus 95 this time

2531
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:06,720
it's four

2532
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:21,200
plus 90. US.

2533
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:31,800
So let's have a big case.

2534
02:56:31,800 --> 02:56:33,800
15 minutes are enough. 17 minutes.

2535
02:56:33,800 --> 02:56:34,240
Okay.

2536
02:56:34,320 --> 02:56:36,360
Please be back 17 minutes.

2537
02:56:37,560 --> 02:56:43,680
Take some rest.

2538
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:46,320
Thank you so.

2539
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:49,240
So this guys, they always stay the same.

2540
02:56:49,240 --> 02:56:52,440
So that's why I have extracted those keys.

2541
02:56:53,200 --> 02:56:54,960
I have extracted that raw

2542
02:56:59,800 --> 02:57:02,400
inside this raw zero variable.

2543
02:57:02,480 --> 02:57:04,560
That's the header. Right.

2544
02:57:04,560 --> 02:57:07,280
And from header, I always,

2545
02:57:07,280 --> 02:57:10,560
always get the same values for each key,

2546
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:15,760
but for the rows, the cell,
because every cell can contain

2547
02:57:15,760 --> 02:57:18,480
different data,
write different different data.

2548
02:57:19,080 --> 02:57:23,000
So all always I get a new row
and that from that row

2549
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,920
I got the corresponding value.

2550
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:30,120
But row zero is always staying the same.

2551
02:57:30,680 --> 02:57:33,360
Why? Because I am for this role.

2552
02:57:33,360 --> 02:57:36,040
I use the same header for this role.

2553
02:57:36,040 --> 02:57:37,920
I use the same header for this cell.

2554
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:39,400
I use the same header. Right.

2555
02:57:39,400 --> 02:57:42,000
So header is always sent

2556
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,800
from here that I am getting the case keys.

2557
02:57:43,800 --> 02:57:45,080
They are always same.

2558
02:57:45,080 --> 02:57:48,000
Even if you look at the data.

2559
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,440
The key
first name is same for the first row.

2560
02:57:50,760 --> 02:57:53,400
Again, I'm using the first name again.

2561
02:57:53,400 --> 02:57:56,040
I'm using the first name
so it always stays the same.

2562
02:57:56,120 --> 02:57:58,600
That's why I am not writing.

2563
02:57:58,600 --> 02:58:01,880
So in here I am getting new row each time,

2564
02:58:01,880 --> 02:58:06,600
but I am always using the zero in here
and now you.

2565
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:11,400
Can you please
explain why we are rewriting after comma?

2566
02:58:12,680 --> 02:58:15,920
Uh, road or cell J

2567
02:58:17,080 --> 02:58:20,720
So this part now it is giving me the data.

2568
02:58:21,080 --> 02:58:24,840
For example, this one, this one one
this one one by one.

2569
02:58:25,200 --> 02:58:27,760
And this part is giving me these keys.

2570
02:58:27,760 --> 02:58:31,760
So, for example,
I, I get to the first name

2571
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:35,880
using this piece of code in here,
but for the data,

2572
02:58:36,160 --> 02:58:40,120
I get the data
this king using this piece of code.

2573
02:58:40,200 --> 02:58:44,600
That's why we have the right place
first to get the key

2574
02:58:44,600 --> 02:58:49,920
and then the value has to store
that inside that map.

2575
02:58:49,920 --> 02:59:02,640
Are there other questions?

2576
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:04,720
So code is

2577
02:59:11,400 --> 02:59:13,200
all about closing in the end?

2578
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:13,960
Yes. Or one.

2579
02:59:13,960 --> 02:59:17,160
We will do that.

2580
02:59:17,160 --> 02:59:19,200
Yes, we will do that.

2581
02:59:19,760 --> 02:59:22,160
So Sorbonne is saying
we are not closing this file.

2582
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:23,760
Interesting. Right.

2583
02:59:23,760 --> 02:59:26,000
So let's that as well.

2584
02:59:26,120 --> 02:59:31,120
So let's say file input stream,
but closed is a best practice.

2585
02:59:31,120 --> 02:59:35,600
Good practice
will always close those files.

2586
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:39,360
So guides are how hard it was to read
the data

2587
02:59:39,360 --> 02:59:42,920
using loops
and storing that inside the list of maps.

2588
02:59:42,920 --> 02:59:47,040
Will you guys be able to understand it
if you offered the class?

2589
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:55,240
Maybe watch this part again
and debug this code on your own?

2590
02:59:55,240 --> 03:00:00,600
Yes, I will be sharing
the exercises as well.

2591
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:09,120
I will send it to the tab as well. Yes.

2592
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:12,480
I want every one of you
to debug this code once and then

2593
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:15,120
write this code on your own.

2594
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:16,800
It's fine if you forget to.

2595
03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:20,680
You can look at the code, look at that
specific line that you forget.

2596
03:00:21,160 --> 03:00:26,480
Then again, hide that code and try try
to write it on own and it will be fine.

2597
03:00:27,080 --> 03:00:30,240
So let's create a method for doing that,
guys.

2598
03:00:30,360 --> 03:00:35,520
Let's create a method.

2599
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:38,760
Let's practice some right now,
see if we get it right.

2600
03:00:38,760 --> 03:00:44,000
Yes, that's great.

2601
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:44,400
Dammit.

2602
03:00:46,200 --> 03:00:50,720
So as we have created the config reader

2603
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:57,280
and the materials, let's create
a specific utility class

2604
03:00:57,840 --> 03:01:01,800
to read the excel file
because every time I want to the data

2605
03:01:01,800 --> 03:01:05,200
from the Excel, I don't want to rewrite
this code again and again.

2606
03:01:05,200 --> 03:01:05,520
Right?

2607
03:01:05,520 --> 03:01:09,000
I just want to pass the name
at the part of the file

2608
03:01:09,680 --> 03:01:14,640
and I should get back
the list of maps from that method.

2609
03:01:14,640 --> 03:01:14,920
Right.

2610
03:01:14,920 --> 03:01:19,800
I want to create a method,

2611
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:23,760
so let me check what is the name of that

2612
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:28,240
inside your project
that you guys will be writing?

2613
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:41,400
So you're scored Excel really?

2614
03:01:41,400 --> 03:01:49,000
So let's create a class, let's call
it accelerator. Yes.

2615
03:01:49,680 --> 03:01:52,800
So in here, let's create

2616
03:01:52,800 --> 03:01:57,400
the public start, the void

2617
03:01:58,200 --> 03:02:02,160
reader matter.

2618
03:02:02,160 --> 03:02:06,080
And this method, it only needs
one team, the part of the file

2619
03:02:07,440 --> 03:02:08,880
string.

2620
03:02:09,280 --> 03:02:13,320
But in simple,

2621
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:17,040
we just need to copy this code from here.

2622
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:19,360
Then here

2623
03:02:22,120 --> 03:02:24,840
and paste it in here

2624
03:02:29,040 --> 03:02:31,560
and add it to

2625
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:36,400
method

2626
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:45,960
signature.

2627
03:02:45,960 --> 03:02:48,480
And we don't want to print this out

2628
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:54,600
and we don't need

2629
03:02:54,600 --> 03:03:15,240
to print this as well.

2630
03:03:15,240 --> 03:03:18,600
And let's return base

2631
03:03:20,880 --> 03:03:22,360
Excel. That

2632
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:25,320
at the end.

2633
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:29,280
Mark and I need to change
the written type in here.

2634
03:03:29,280 --> 03:03:33,800
So it should be a list of maps.

2635
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:38,160
My port word is a read in here.

2636
03:03:38,560 --> 03:03:41,040
Inside this method.

2637
03:03:41,040 --> 03:03:43,960
Yes, there was the scope

2638
03:03:49,960 --> 03:03:51,520
here just for

2639
03:03:55,200 --> 03:03:57,080
the now we have created a method, right?

2640
03:03:57,080 --> 03:04:00,600
If this method takes the port

2641
03:04:00,840 --> 03:04:03,000
and it returns the data from that sheet

2642
03:04:03,720 --> 03:04:08,920
and maybe it will be good
if we can create a method that.

2643
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,880
So right now
we are hard coding this sheet one right

2644
03:04:12,480 --> 03:04:15,600
so that I'm like be present
in a different sheet.

2645
03:04:15,960 --> 03:04:17,120
So what do you guys think?

2646
03:04:17,120 --> 03:04:26,640
Should I create a parameter
for that as well?

2647
03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:30,120
It will be good, right
to give this more flexibility

2648
03:04:30,120 --> 03:04:33,400
so someone can the sheet as of it
right instead of hard

2649
03:04:33,400 --> 03:04:46,480
coding.

2650
03:04:46,480 --> 03:04:49,600
Yeah. So now we have this really method.

2651
03:04:50,200 --> 03:04:53,040
Let's create
an overloaded version of this method

2652
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:55,760
so that if someone is not passing

2653
03:04:56,560 --> 03:05:01,240
the sheet name,
then they can still be able

2654
03:05:01,400 --> 03:05:04,320
our program should still
be able to read from the

2655
03:05:05,400 --> 03:05:07,240
default

2656
03:05:08,240 --> 03:05:13,760
a default sheet right.

2657
03:05:13,760 --> 03:05:15,880
To give more flexibility
to the end ambiguous.

2658
03:05:16,840 --> 03:05:18,000
So I have one created.

2659
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:21,840
I have created one method
that takes the sheet name

2660
03:05:22,640 --> 03:05:25,720
and the other one
that does not take this name.

2661
03:05:25,760 --> 03:05:29,160
It only takes the part
and maybe we can create another overloaded

2662
03:05:29,160 --> 03:05:31,480
button
that does not take the part as well.

2663
03:05:31,720 --> 03:05:36,880
And it will try to read the data
from these default files directly.

2664
03:05:36,960 --> 03:05:38,640
Then we can also do that.

2665
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:42,000
Do you guys want me to do that as well

2666
03:05:42,040 --> 03:05:43,600
another overloaded virgin

2667
03:05:43,600 --> 03:05:45,840
that does not require the part as well.

2668
03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:50,160
So if I create another
overloaded virgin done and,

2669
03:05:50,160 --> 03:05:54,680
if I remove the part as well.

2670
03:05:54,680 --> 03:05:57,720
So by default it will try to read

2671
03:05:57,720 --> 03:06:00,520
the data from

2672
03:06:01,360 --> 03:06:03,800
file slash

2673
03:06:06,720 --> 03:06:09,400
batch 11 dot x less.

2674
03:06:09,680 --> 03:06:12,840
Yeah. What may be.

2675
03:06:12,840 --> 03:06:16,760
So I think the standard name
that you guys will be using for

2676
03:06:16,760 --> 03:06:20,040
let me check from the framework

2677
03:06:20,040 --> 03:06:27,120
and what will be the okay

2678
03:06:28,400 --> 03:06:30,360
let's call it x

2679
03:06:31,320 --> 03:06:34,320
so refactor rename

2680
03:06:36,360 --> 03:06:39,280
x so that none of them

2681
03:06:39,360 --> 03:06:44,120
are more genetically.

2682
03:06:44,120 --> 03:06:47,160
So let's change it to excel.

2683
03:06:48,200 --> 03:06:50,640
Next.

2684
03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:51,080
Yeah.

2685
03:06:51,120 --> 03:06:54,320
So now I am done
creating all those matters.

2686
03:06:54,440 --> 03:06:54,880
Okay.

2687
03:06:56,160 --> 03:06:58,640
Overloaded networks

2688
03:07:04,200 --> 03:07:08,280
then let me put some comments as well
for you so that you guys don't forget.

2689
03:07:08,480 --> 03:07:10,000
So So

2690
03:07:17,800 --> 03:07:21,880
building the raw data

2691
03:07:24,120 --> 03:07:28,040
from what

2692
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:29,440
parameter

2693
03:07:34,040 --> 03:07:35,760
using

2694
03:07:36,400 --> 03:07:39,360
excessive server book

2695
03:07:39,360 --> 03:07:41,400
blast to

2696
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:43,480
convert that and back to

2697
03:07:45,120 --> 03:07:45,640
excel.

2698
03:07:45,640 --> 03:07:48,480
Sorry we had is depart from again.

2699
03:07:48,480 --> 03:07:51,360
I have given this default
but you guys can give any

2700
03:07:51,360 --> 03:07:53,000
default but

2701
03:08:12,400 --> 03:08:14,080
the fun and then

2702
03:08:17,960 --> 03:08:21,440
you getting the feed from

2703
03:08:23,080 --> 03:08:25,480
excel file

2704
03:08:27,080 --> 03:08:30,040
with excel less x

2705
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:32,720
I think excel s will also work fine.

2706
03:08:33,160 --> 03:08:33,600
Assignment.

2707
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:35,400
Can you try that

2708
03:08:38,680 --> 03:08:39,120
assignment?

2709
03:08:39,120 --> 03:08:47,960
Can you try that Excel extension
if it works or not?

2710
03:08:47,960 --> 03:08:49,400
Thank you.

2711
03:08:50,160 --> 03:08:51,960
That thing, the

2712
03:08:52,160 --> 03:08:55,680
number of rows so small.

2713
03:08:56,360 --> 03:08:58,560
But is it better now?

2714
03:08:58,560 --> 03:09:00,960
You know better now

2715
03:09:01,440 --> 03:09:04,000
that actually

2716
03:09:06,440 --> 03:09:09,760
being the data

2717
03:09:15,560 --> 03:09:17,680
in list of

2718
03:09:20,040 --> 03:09:20,880
maps?

2719
03:09:20,880 --> 03:09:23,080
Yes, it works great.

2720
03:09:23,080 --> 03:09:27,120
Creating a list of maps to

2721
03:09:28,680 --> 03:09:31,000
for the data

2722
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:35,280
from Excel file inside

2723
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:42,480
Java all all the things

2724
03:09:49,480 --> 03:09:52,200
you are doing.

2725
03:09:52,480 --> 03:09:55,520
The real zero

2726
03:09:56,560 --> 03:10:00,800
to you there the header

2727
03:10:01,520 --> 03:10:05,720
so that we can use it as

2728
03:10:06,920 --> 03:10:09,840
he is in map

2729
03:10:14,320 --> 03:10:18,600
loop to get all the roles

2730
03:10:21,200 --> 03:10:23,640
from row

2731
03:10:23,640 --> 03:10:26,480
one one

2732
03:10:26,480 --> 03:10:32,000
by one. It's

2733
03:10:36,280 --> 03:10:38,120
you cannot

2734
03:10:38,120 --> 03:10:43,640
the second rule or not there thing

2735
03:10:44,800 --> 03:10:49,080
you draw one by one and

2736
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:54,680
then the row of it
I just changed the extension.

2737
03:10:54,680 --> 03:10:56,520
You could make it or be expanded.

2738
03:10:56,520 --> 03:11:00,040
It would still work
as long as the file itself

2739
03:11:00,040 --> 03:11:05,280
is in Excel format, excluding them.

2740
03:11:06,480 --> 03:11:10,440
And so by changing just the extension.

2741
03:11:10,440 --> 03:11:13,800
Simon the internal structure,
it will still be same.

2742
03:11:13,800 --> 03:11:17,400
Can you please create a new file
using Excel

2743
03:11:17,400 --> 03:11:20,160
or any other program and by default,

2744
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:24,880
save that file as excellence
from that accelerator program.

2745
03:11:25,480 --> 03:11:28,120
Then it will store the data
in a different structure.

2746
03:11:29,240 --> 03:11:33,520
By changing the extension, the internal
structure of the file is not change.

2747
03:11:33,960 --> 03:11:35,400
And these files stream.

2748
03:11:35,400 --> 03:11:39,760
It actually is the internal structure.

2749
03:11:39,760 --> 03:11:42,920
I think that's why that DOT properties
and text

2750
03:11:42,920 --> 03:11:46,680
file was also lacking because the internal
structure was still same

2751
03:11:48,320 --> 03:11:51,360
and storing them in virtual

2752
03:11:51,360 --> 03:11:52,800
variable

2753
03:11:55,080 --> 03:11:57,040
internally they have different structures.

2754
03:11:57,040 --> 03:11:59,560
The excellence file
and the Excel assets file.

2755
03:11:59,560 --> 03:12:00,160
Right?

2756
03:12:00,160 --> 03:12:03,720
I think is the difference about writing
some scripts or something like that

2757
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:08,640
the older one gives that a right?

2758
03:12:08,640 --> 03:12:19,600
Yes, because it changes
the internal structure as well.

2759
03:12:19,600 --> 03:12:24,240
It's good if you guys just stick
to the standard file extensions and file

2760
03:12:24,280 --> 03:12:28,720
how you create those files.

2761
03:12:28,720 --> 03:12:31,080
There are other classes
to read other extensions,

2762
03:12:31,440 --> 03:12:36,840
but we will not be discussing them.

2763
03:12:36,840 --> 03:12:39,480
Creating a new

2764
03:12:40,920 --> 03:12:43,760
map for

2765
03:12:44,920 --> 03:12:48,400
each role to store

2766
03:12:50,160 --> 03:12:53,680
its data

2767
03:12:57,200 --> 03:12:59,200
in acting.

2768
03:12:59,200 --> 03:13:02,120
The of

2769
03:13:03,600 --> 03:13:05,720
actual cells that

2770
03:13:06,880 --> 03:13:09,360
contain the data.

2771
03:13:09,360 --> 03:13:13,680
So. So

2772
03:13:14,280 --> 03:13:17,840
if I show entire corner will not
will not be able to do it.

2773
03:13:17,840 --> 03:13:21,400
I think you is watching
this a smaller screen maybe.

2774
03:13:23,280 --> 03:13:24,480
I hope it is still

2775
03:13:24,480 --> 03:13:33,240
readable, looping

2776
03:13:33,840 --> 03:13:35,080
through

2777
03:13:37,520 --> 03:13:39,680
all the cells

2778
03:13:40,800 --> 03:13:43,120
so that

2779
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:47,280
the data this is the entire code
inside this method.

2780
03:13:47,280 --> 03:13:49,800
Yes, I will send the code

2781
03:13:51,400 --> 03:13:53,680
inserting the data

2782
03:13:53,680 --> 03:13:57,480
inside the map

2783
03:13:59,160 --> 03:14:01,400
from there.

2784
03:14:01,400 --> 03:14:13,760
So building that map

2785
03:14:15,480 --> 03:14:19,040
to the list

2786
03:14:21,560 --> 03:14:26,720
and then closing the file.

2787
03:14:27,680 --> 03:14:30,720
So that other

2788
03:14:31,800 --> 03:14:36,480
programs can use it, and then

2789
03:14:39,360 --> 03:14:41,560
returning in the index.

2790
03:14:41,960 --> 03:14:42,240
Okay.

2791
03:14:42,240 --> 03:14:47,640
I hope it will help
you understand it after after the class.

2792
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:55,440
So me since you.

2793
03:14:55,440 --> 03:14:58,320
All right,
so now if you guys have any questions

2794
03:14:58,320 --> 03:15:03,520
you guys can ask, so next,
let me check what we will be doing next.

2795
03:15:03,520 --> 03:15:05,640
We will be learning how to

2796
03:15:08,800 --> 03:15:09,920
how to create

2797
03:15:09,920 --> 03:15:17,200
new files.

2798
03:15:17,200 --> 03:15:25,320
Let me check if we are missing something,

2799
03:15:25,320 --> 03:15:28,360
Excel or

2800
03:15:30,880 --> 03:15:33,000
we started the exceptions.

2801
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:54,040
And here.

2802
03:15:54,040 --> 03:15:55,280
Okay, all looks good.

2803
03:15:56,720 --> 03:15:57,080
Thanks.

2804
03:15:57,080 --> 03:15:58,200
It is very helpful.

2805
03:15:58,200 --> 03:16:03,760
Question would be
hell were all these lines of jobs,

2806
03:16:03,760 --> 03:16:06,840
these lines
they are reading the data from a fight.

2807
03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:08,800
So this is what you guys will be doing.

2808
03:16:08,800 --> 03:16:10,760
You you guys don't worry about the score.

2809
03:16:10,760 --> 03:16:14,160
So in actual what you guys will do,

2810
03:16:14,160 --> 03:16:16,800
you guys will just use this method.

2811
03:16:17,320 --> 03:16:20,520
We'll just see all of this method. So

2812
03:16:21,600 --> 03:16:24,000
Excel Demo six

2813
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:27,080
So in your project for
you guys will do this

2814
03:16:28,920 --> 03:16:30,600
creative part

2815
03:16:33,800 --> 03:16:34,320
variable.

2816
03:16:34,320 --> 03:16:38,320
Let me copy it from the No,
I think it wasn't done right.

2817
03:16:38,560 --> 03:16:43,960
Create a part variable,

2818
03:16:43,960 --> 03:16:47,640
Pass this variable to

2819
03:16:48,760 --> 03:16:51,240
excel a reader

2820
03:16:52,440 --> 03:16:54,400
not read

2821
03:16:55,440 --> 03:16:57,280
and read the data.

2822
03:16:57,280 --> 03:17:00,440
See what you guys will be doing once
you have created that.

2823
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:03,120
But definitely if you guys understand

2824
03:17:03,440 --> 03:17:07,680
what is going on inside this method,
then it will be

2825
03:17:07,680 --> 03:17:10,880
you guys will be able to modify, modify
that as well, right?

2826
03:17:10,880 --> 03:17:16,080
Introduce new features
may be having some issues in the

2827
03:17:17,240 --> 03:17:18,720
in the existing framework to

2828
03:17:18,720 --> 03:17:22,720
solve those issues
if you know how everything is working.

2829
03:17:23,600 --> 03:17:29,280
So list of maps

2830
03:17:31,440 --> 03:17:33,400
all string

2831
03:17:33,400 --> 03:17:35,320
and then string

2832
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:40,400
excel that

2833
03:17:40,480 --> 03:17:43,600
use that method and

2834
03:17:43,600 --> 03:17:44,600
play with the Stata.

2835
03:17:44,600 --> 03:17:49,080
Whatever you want to do.

2836
03:17:49,080 --> 03:17:53,120
So that's why this is actually
this is how you will build your framework.

2837
03:17:53,360 --> 03:17:56,520
That's what we call the framework.

2838
03:17:56,520 --> 03:17:57,760
See there, blah.

2839
03:17:57,760 --> 03:18:03,040
The system cannot find the law
that I use the oh, I changed the

2840
03:18:03,320 --> 03:18:06,720
I changed the name of the class

2841
03:18:08,280 --> 03:18:10,960
Excel data.

2842
03:18:10,960 --> 03:18:13,920
Okay. What was the actual name?

2843
03:18:13,920 --> 03:18:15,360
It was batch 11.

2844
03:18:15,360 --> 03:18:16,120
Right.

2845
03:18:17,400 --> 03:18:27,360
Let me change it back.

2846
03:18:27,360 --> 03:18:30,600
Batch 11 right next to this

2847
03:18:37,800 --> 03:18:41,400
this budget.

2848
03:18:41,400 --> 03:18:42,200
So you see,

2849
03:18:42,200 --> 03:18:45,000
if you guys have gone through this
and you get any error, you

2850
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:47,280
you guys will be able
to quickly figure it out.

2851
03:18:48,280 --> 03:18:51,000
But if you guys run a run from it,

2852
03:18:51,400 --> 03:18:54,520
you guys will not be introduce
new features

2853
03:18:55,360 --> 03:18:57,600
to the existing frameworks.

2854
03:18:57,600 --> 03:19:00,000
Even if someone has written
their framework for, you

2855
03:19:08,080 --> 03:19:10,560
it's okay
if you guys don't understand things.

2856
03:19:11,440 --> 03:19:14,320
If you at the that's how you learn right

2857
03:19:20,280 --> 03:19:21,640
the words more than the code.

2858
03:19:21,640 --> 03:19:27,120
Yes the comments
they are always more than the code.

2859
03:19:27,120 --> 03:19:29,400
Right.
So this is what you guys will be doing.

2860
03:19:29,400 --> 03:19:33,240
But definitely if you have understanding
what is going inside this raid

2861
03:19:33,280 --> 03:19:36,320
method, you guys will be at new features

2862
03:19:36,320 --> 03:19:45,120
and all that.

2863
03:19:45,120 --> 03:19:48,800
Please open demo six
This is demo six Madina

2864
03:19:55,600 --> 03:19:56,880
You can specify.

2865
03:19:56,880 --> 03:19:59,040
Yes, that was inside my intelligence

2866
03:20:02,440 --> 03:20:05,760
and because I was using this absolute part

2867
03:20:05,760 --> 03:20:10,480
and then I was specifying the name
that that's why I was unable to find it.

2868
03:20:10,480 --> 03:20:11,600
No, no, no.

2869
03:20:11,800 --> 03:20:13,840
I was using the absolute part.

2870
03:20:14,040 --> 03:20:17,160
So it was looking be a floor file excel

2871
03:20:17,160 --> 03:20:20,240
that are this part
C users to the index job.

2872
03:20:20,280 --> 03:20:21,480
That's why I got the error.

2873
03:20:23,040 --> 03:20:23,560
This is not

2874
03:20:23,560 --> 03:20:27,400
where I have stored the data right.

2875
03:20:27,400 --> 03:20:29,520
Marina, this is this is the demo six.

2876
03:20:29,600 --> 03:20:32,360
You mean this this file or the last one?

2877
03:20:32,360 --> 03:20:34,320
That accelerator.

2878
03:20:34,760 --> 03:20:37,120
Okay, one more thing.

2879
03:20:37,120 --> 03:20:40,200
Can you guys tell me
let's say, for example,

2880
03:20:40,600 --> 03:20:44,040
if I want to get this last name,
so I have successfully

2881
03:20:44,040 --> 03:20:47,040
read the data from the Excel,

2882
03:20:47,040 --> 03:20:50,760
but I only want
to get this name from here.

2883
03:20:50,880 --> 03:20:51,960
How can I do that?

2884
03:20:51,960 --> 03:20:55,080
Can you guys tell me this? A list?

2885
03:20:55,080 --> 03:21:00,520
And inside this list I have maps.

2886
03:21:00,520 --> 03:21:02,280
So first the list.

2887
03:21:02,280 --> 03:21:04,920
It has to get my third right.

2888
03:21:04,920 --> 03:21:08,200
Which element I should get from this list?

2889
03:21:08,200 --> 03:21:11,280
So this is stored on the index zero.

2890
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:13,640
This is stored on the index tool.

2891
03:21:13,640 --> 03:21:14,520
Right.

2892
03:21:15,880 --> 03:21:19,440
So what's your date idea inside to get
And this is stored on the index.

2893
03:21:19,440 --> 03:21:22,720
Number three, if I want to get
saw one, why should I write

2894
03:21:23,920 --> 03:21:26,040
inside of this? Get

2895
03:21:28,080 --> 03:21:31,000
I should write one right.

2896
03:21:31,360 --> 03:21:33,760
Because this is at index number zero

2897
03:21:35,000 --> 03:21:37,200
and this is actually next number one.

2898
03:21:37,200 --> 03:21:40,920
Now, once I write index one,
I will get a map.

2899
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:45,560
And if I want to get the value from a map
which method I can use,

2900
03:21:46,200 --> 03:21:48,880
I can then use that.

2901
03:21:48,880 --> 03:21:51,200
And what is the key for this name?

2902
03:21:51,360 --> 03:21:56,400
The key is lost me.

2903
03:21:56,400 --> 03:22:02,560
Okay, so if I execute this,

2904
03:22:02,560 --> 03:22:07,160
I get right from the list
on the second index.

2905
03:22:07,200 --> 03:22:09,960
I have that map
and that map contains the value

2906
03:22:10,800 --> 03:22:14,520
can you show line 13 how you get it,
please?

2907
03:22:15,120 --> 03:22:18,200
Line 13. This one has it in this one.

2908
03:22:18,200 --> 03:22:22,880
This line.

2909
03:22:22,880 --> 03:22:26,160
Well, this line.

2910
03:22:26,160 --> 03:22:31,200
You mean this?

2911
03:22:31,200 --> 03:22:35,040
I knew that this read method returns
a list of maps.

2912
03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:36,840
That's how I wrote it.

2913
03:22:36,840 --> 03:22:37,560
I knew.

2914
03:22:37,560 --> 03:22:40,280
I knew that this method returns a list.

2915
03:22:40,280 --> 03:22:42,240
But if you guys don't know that.

2916
03:22:42,240 --> 03:22:45,280
So, for example, if you guys are not sure
about the return type,

2917
03:22:45,840 --> 03:22:50,440
you guys can also take the help
of invalidate, can select all to enter

2918
03:22:51,320 --> 03:22:54,120
and then introduce local variable.

2919
03:22:54,120 --> 03:22:57,120
Okay,
so it will write it automatically for you.

2920
03:22:57,120 --> 03:23:03,000
But I will prefer that you guys write it
on your own so that you can understand

2921
03:23:05,520 --> 03:23:09,120
why this error appears

2922
03:23:15,800 --> 03:23:16,200
to be not.

2923
03:23:16,200 --> 03:23:22,200
Have you created the overloaded versions
of the method like I did?

2924
03:23:22,200 --> 03:23:25,720
Is there a method
that only takes the part?

2925
03:23:26,080 --> 03:23:48,840
Can you show me the screenshot of that?

2926
03:23:48,840 --> 03:23:51,240
So for example, in my Excel reader

2927
03:23:52,160 --> 03:23:54,360
I created three overloaded versions.

2928
03:23:54,760 --> 03:23:59,800
One only takes the part
one does not take anything

2929
03:23:59,800 --> 03:24:02,480
and one takes part and the sheet name.

2930
03:24:03,600 --> 03:24:07,560
So if you have this overloaded button
in here, then you should not be getting.

2931
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:09,840
And also this public started.

2932
03:24:09,960 --> 03:24:15,840
They are public static methods.

2933
03:24:15,840 --> 03:24:27,160
Yes. How about your mouse over that?

2934
03:24:27,520 --> 03:24:32,320
And so you see, Katrina,
you have this weird

2935
03:24:32,320 --> 03:24:36,120
method that you have created requires
two arguments, a part

2936
03:24:36,120 --> 03:24:40,920
and a sheet name,
but you are only specifying the part.

2937
03:24:40,920 --> 03:24:44,960
So you need to specify the sheet as well
because you didn't create the overloaded

2938
03:24:45,200 --> 03:24:47,920
and then you send overloaded
method. Please. Yes.

2939
03:24:47,920 --> 03:24:50,680
Let let me send the complete accelerator.

2940
03:24:50,680 --> 03:24:51,080
Actually

2941
03:24:53,520 --> 03:24:54,640
actual Excel Excel.

2942
03:24:54,640 --> 03:24:57,280
Fine. Okay. Let me show

2943
03:24:57,840 --> 03:25:07,440
this is the actual Excel file.

2944
03:25:07,440 --> 03:25:09,840
Are there other questions

2945
03:25:11,800 --> 03:25:17,520
or should we try to create new files

2946
03:25:17,520 --> 03:25:23,920
now guys, no questions.

2947
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:26,800
Everything is ouch.

2948
03:25:27,200 --> 03:25:31,080
My brain hurts after that.

2949
03:25:31,080 --> 03:25:32,640
Can we end early?

2950
03:25:32,640 --> 03:25:35,480
Silva, you are not feeling well.

2951
03:25:35,480 --> 03:25:36,120
You can leave.

2952
03:25:36,120 --> 03:25:39,960
You can watch the recording like later

2953
03:25:40,960 --> 03:25:41,400
Start.

2954
03:25:41,400 --> 03:25:43,880
Yes, you can take some rest.
You can watch the recording.

2955
03:25:43,880 --> 03:25:49,760
I will upload it right after the class
as soon as that is processed.

2956
03:25:49,760 --> 03:25:52,280
Let us cry little bit
and then we continue.

2957
03:25:52,840 --> 03:25:55,920
So now you guys understand that

2958
03:25:55,920 --> 03:25:58,760
that report 209 we were storing

2959
03:25:59,640 --> 03:26:02,280
maps inside of that list as well, right?

2960
03:26:02,280 --> 03:26:07,720
It was the same structure.

2961
03:26:07,720 --> 03:26:10,440
So I hope now
you guys will be able to understand that

2962
03:26:11,640 --> 03:26:12,960
more easily.

2963
03:26:12,960 --> 03:26:15,720
How about method? Yes.

2964
03:26:15,720 --> 03:26:22,240
If you guys don't specify anything,
then this method will work.

2965
03:26:22,240 --> 03:26:24,240
5 minutes break to go cry.

2966
03:26:24,240 --> 03:26:26,560
You guys have whole day after the class

2967
03:26:26,560 --> 03:26:30,680
you guys can try for next,
I guess 18 hours.

2968
03:26:30,680 --> 03:26:36,720
Then we will be having the next class
review class.

2969
03:26:36,720 --> 03:26:41,760
What is better looking at retrieving
the data properties of file?

2970
03:26:42,040 --> 03:26:48,080
So if you have data in the fall for
the first name, last name and all that.

2971
03:26:48,120 --> 03:26:53,240
So for example,
you are storing the data of a form.

2972
03:26:53,240 --> 03:26:55,720
You will be using Excel files

2973
03:26:55,720 --> 03:27:00,320
and if you are storing only username
passwords, only one key will appear.

2974
03:27:00,320 --> 03:27:06,360
Then you can use properties
file assignment.

2975
03:27:06,360 --> 03:27:09,680
I can't even cry
after the class need to grocery shop.

2976
03:27:10,080 --> 03:27:12,560
You can cry in the grocery store shop.

2977
03:27:12,560 --> 03:27:14,920
I maybe you will get a discount as well.

2978
03:27:15,120 --> 03:27:16,200
Maybe they will take

2979
03:27:17,760 --> 03:27:19,960
if you need to.

2980
03:27:19,960 --> 03:27:22,800
Some I will go to NYC for work.

2981
03:27:23,120 --> 03:27:26,120
People will be surprised.

2982
03:27:26,120 --> 03:27:31,280
You will get some discount as it well.

2983
03:27:31,320 --> 03:27:32,640
What was this page about?

2984
03:27:32,640 --> 03:27:35,400
I tried to look but I couldn't find one.

2985
03:27:35,400 --> 03:27:37,960
When did he deliver this speech?

2986
03:27:37,960 --> 03:27:40,360
At the end or in the start of the class.

2987
03:27:40,360 --> 03:27:43,720
He did not record or does not go there.

2988
03:27:43,720 --> 03:27:48,120
So that's why I didn't see that.

2989
03:27:48,120 --> 03:27:52,360
I kept asking to record it.

2990
03:27:52,840 --> 03:27:55,000
But you can do it.

2991
03:27:55,320 --> 03:27:57,400
Or I used to give a lot of speech,

2992
03:27:58,040 --> 03:28:00,640
so just just let me give you a motivation.

2993
03:28:00,640 --> 03:28:01,920
Base.

2994
03:28:01,920 --> 03:28:07,480
Do you know how much money you can make
if you know programing?

2995
03:28:07,480 --> 03:28:09,120
There is this

2996
03:28:09,880 --> 03:28:12,920
you guys know, remember the

2997
03:28:12,920 --> 03:28:15,800
remember
the meters from this string class raised

2998
03:28:17,240 --> 03:28:19,320
Nas good I think I Nas knows

2999
03:28:19,720 --> 03:28:24,120
so this is a very simple website
might be created by me

3000
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:28,960
this method this website
what does if you put uppercase letters

3001
03:28:29,880 --> 03:28:34,240
it can convert it to lowercase.

3002
03:28:34,240 --> 03:28:36,600
Okay.

3003
03:28:36,600 --> 03:28:40,920
But money can help others write wars
and then needy people.

3004
03:28:40,920 --> 03:28:42,720
You can give your money to me.

3005
03:28:42,720 --> 03:28:49,080
If you guys don't like money,
I am ready to take all that money.

3006
03:28:49,440 --> 03:28:50,760
I will share my account.

3007
03:28:50,760 --> 03:28:53,200
You guys can all send your money
to my account.

3008
03:28:53,320 --> 03:28:58,080
They will be more than happy if you are
putting a smile on someone else's face.

3009
03:28:58,080 --> 03:28:58,800
Right.

3010
03:28:58,920 --> 03:29:01,640
It's also good.

3011
03:29:02,520 --> 03:29:05,400
Is I am single.

3012
03:29:05,400 --> 03:29:06,720
That's why I need the money.

3013
03:29:06,720 --> 03:29:12,480
So that I can get Mary right.

3014
03:29:12,480 --> 03:29:16,920
So this is a very simple website
converting the uppercase letters.

3015
03:29:16,920 --> 03:29:18,440
You guys can do that, right?

3016
03:29:19,840 --> 03:29:23,240
And using those things matters.

3017
03:29:23,240 --> 03:29:26,120
So this guy is playing some errors
in here, right?

3018
03:29:26,280 --> 03:29:27,800
Simple errors in here.

3019
03:29:27,800 --> 03:29:29,800
Now, let me show you how much money that.

3020
03:29:29,800 --> 03:29:32,720
So that guy just simply use this thing
methods.

3021
03:29:33,440 --> 03:29:35,760
And he created this website. Right?

3022
03:29:36,200 --> 03:29:41,040
So website world

3023
03:29:42,880 --> 03:29:44,640
calculator

3024
03:29:51,520 --> 03:29:53,560
I invented which

3025
03:29:53,840 --> 03:29:56,320
all singles are each

3026
03:30:03,600 --> 03:30:06,840
the estimated world of this website.

3027
03:30:06,840 --> 03:30:10,600
Is this how much money is?

3028
03:30:10,600 --> 03:30:12,120
This guy's

3029
03:30:13,080 --> 03:30:17,000
2.499 million

3030
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:20,280
By just playing a single ad,

3031
03:30:20,280 --> 03:30:22,400
Do you guys know how much visitors he had?

3032
03:30:23,520 --> 03:30:27,800
Estimated Revenue per day 1493

3033
03:30:29,040 --> 03:30:33,000
Because he has so many visitors,
so many people use his website

3034
03:30:33,000 --> 03:30:37,640
to convert the data
to uppercase and lowercase.

3035
03:30:37,640 --> 03:30:39,720
And it's very, very simple.

3036
03:30:40,720 --> 03:30:43,920
40 4k per month.

3037
03:30:43,920 --> 03:30:46,600
So yeah, I mean, so

3038
03:30:49,720 --> 03:30:54,120
we estimated you guys don't know
the power of programing,

3039
03:30:54,120 --> 03:30:58,280
don't want the power of it,
that that's why you guys feel like this.

3040
03:30:58,280 --> 03:30:59,600
It is something

3041
03:31:00,600 --> 03:31:03,000
if you have huge impact

3042
03:31:03,000 --> 03:31:05,160
you guys can make a lot of money right

3043
03:31:05,480 --> 03:31:08,680
these celebrities why these companies,

3044
03:31:08,680 --> 03:31:11,920
they pay a lot of money to them
because they have a lot of followers.

3045
03:31:11,920 --> 03:31:12,760
Right.

3046
03:31:13,440 --> 03:31:16,440
So if you can impact a lot of people

3047
03:31:17,040 --> 03:31:21,120
by making maybe a soft or if you have fan
following or you are a celebrity

3048
03:31:21,120 --> 03:31:24,480
or anything like that, you
you can be super, super rich.

3049
03:31:24,920 --> 03:31:29,760
You guys can now create applications
that thousands can use here.

3050
03:31:29,760 --> 03:31:32,640
Come to my speech
because you guys asked for it, right?

3051
03:31:32,640 --> 03:31:38,200
I have so much material to motivate
you both spiritually and monetary.

3052
03:31:38,200 --> 03:31:40,440
Whichever you guys want,
I can deliver that

3053
03:31:42,280 --> 03:31:45,000
with with examples, real life examples.

3054
03:31:45,240 --> 03:31:45,640
Actually.

3055
03:31:45,640 --> 03:31:49,200
Here are the real life
examples of uppercase and lowercase.

3056
03:31:49,400 --> 03:31:51,840
You always ask me where we are.

3057
03:31:51,840 --> 03:31:54,320
Will we be using those methods?

3058
03:31:54,320 --> 03:32:04,600
You see, this is how you will be using
those methods.

3059
03:32:04,600 --> 03:32:05,880
You are depressing us

3060
03:32:07,120 --> 03:32:09,080
if you guys can

3061
03:32:09,080 --> 03:32:12,200
imagine that title case,
first letter will be uppercase.

3062
03:32:12,200 --> 03:32:15,360
The rest of the letters will be lowercase
Inverse case.

3063
03:32:15,760 --> 03:32:17,400
First letter will be lowercase.

3064
03:32:17,400 --> 03:32:19,520
It s of letters be a per case.

3065
03:32:20,400 --> 03:32:23,480
Hey, sir, is this your website?

3066
03:32:23,480 --> 03:32:26,080
I'm not going to tell you

3067
03:32:26,080 --> 03:32:28,840
this is being recorded right?

3068
03:32:28,840 --> 03:32:31,160
No, this is not my website.

3069
03:32:31,160 --> 03:32:33,520
And you guys can check
Whose website is this?

3070
03:32:33,960 --> 03:32:35,800
Who is

3071
03:32:38,280 --> 03:32:39,160
who is dot com?

3072
03:32:39,160 --> 03:32:41,240
You can put any link in here

3073
03:32:42,840 --> 03:32:45,120
and you will.

3074
03:32:45,120 --> 03:32:48,960
So the people they have usually hidden

3075
03:32:48,960 --> 03:32:51,840
their info from others

3076
03:32:59,720 --> 03:33:00,360
you see

3077
03:33:00,360 --> 03:33:06,240
convert case dot net.

3078
03:33:06,240 --> 03:33:09,200
You know that
the info is not being displayed

3079
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:13,080
but for some of the websites,
the simple ones in there,

3080
03:33:13,080 --> 03:33:22,680
they actually pay extra money
to hide that info.

3081
03:33:22,680 --> 03:33:28,440
I am working on an
android app by the way. It's

3082
03:33:31,800 --> 03:33:32,440
not this

3083
03:33:32,440 --> 03:33:35,640
Mossberg so studies jobs and all that.

3084
03:33:36,280 --> 03:33:40,080
So What does it do is simply expose

3085
03:33:40,080 --> 03:33:44,040
your expenses, generate reports.

3086
03:33:45,440 --> 03:33:49,480
You can use it to pass for fast to others
and all of that stuff.

3087
03:33:49,480 --> 03:33:51,720
What are we are going to test it.

3088
03:33:52,840 --> 03:33:55,320
The maybe

3089
03:33:55,320 --> 03:34:00,640
so I thought it will be very simple
and I can publish it as soon as possible.

3090
03:34:00,640 --> 03:34:04,840
But there are a lot of cases
that you have to kind of

3091
03:34:06,640 --> 03:34:10,720
like, for example, convergent
between different currencies and all that.

3092
03:34:10,720 --> 03:34:13,960
Using the API is all older,
so it's super super complex.

3093
03:34:14,760 --> 03:34:17,040
Maybe I can show you

3094
03:34:17,040 --> 03:34:38,120
if I have that on my computer.

3095
03:34:38,120 --> 03:34:41,120
So this,
this is the idea to develop Android

3096
03:34:41,120 --> 03:34:44,920
apps. It's

3097
03:34:46,560 --> 03:34:47,920
as good when you become rich.

3098
03:34:47,920 --> 03:34:50,920
If you need someone to give the card to,
you know where

3099
03:34:50,920 --> 03:34:54,120
to find a I am already rich

3100
03:34:57,000 --> 03:34:58,280
and now I am looking for

3101
03:34:58,280 --> 03:35:03,440
peace, vacations
and just visiting places and all that.

3102
03:35:03,440 --> 03:35:08,280
I am second one in the line.

3103
03:35:08,280 --> 03:35:10,440
So you guys
run away from this simple code.

3104
03:35:10,440 --> 03:35:12,640
You guys see how much code I have written?

3105
03:35:12,840 --> 03:35:17,000
Let me look at.

3106
03:35:17,000 --> 03:35:18,600
Okay. It will take some time.

3107
03:35:18,600 --> 03:35:21,080
We will get back it later. So

3108
03:35:23,080 --> 03:35:26,280
let's learn how to create new Excel files.

3109
03:35:26,400 --> 03:35:28,120
Yeah, how to create new Excel files.

3110
03:35:28,120 --> 03:35:31,600
It is also very simple,
like we did for the

3111
03:35:34,320 --> 03:35:35,640
I missed the entire class.

3112
03:35:35,640 --> 03:35:37,880
Can you please help me after that?
Yep, sure.

3113
03:35:38,280 --> 03:35:40,800
Don't worry. I will help you out

3114
03:35:40,920 --> 03:35:44,840
So excel them more

3115
03:35:48,280 --> 03:35:57,840
so. Don't worry, I will fix it.

3116
03:35:57,840 --> 03:36:01,640
Okay.

3117
03:36:01,640 --> 03:36:12,520
So as we learn code,
you showed demos six? Yep.

3118
03:36:12,520 --> 03:36:24,600
So let me know

3119
03:36:24,600 --> 03:36:28,920
once you are done.

3120
03:36:28,920 --> 03:36:33,760
Oh, there.

3121
03:36:33,760 --> 03:36:37,040
So if I have to create a file
on my computer.

3122
03:36:37,040 --> 03:36:43,240
Guys, again, what do I need first?

3123
03:36:43,240 --> 03:36:46,120
Let's create a file inside in here

3124
03:36:49,720 --> 03:36:51,280
or you guys will not be able to see.

3125
03:36:51,280 --> 03:36:55,160
So let me.

3126
03:36:55,160 --> 03:36:59,040
So I will create the file in here
on this spot.

3127
03:36:59,040 --> 03:37:02,080
Inside this folder.

3128
03:37:02,080 --> 03:37:08,760
Or maybe let me create another folder
so that you guys can see it easily.

3129
03:37:08,760 --> 03:37:11,400
So inside this batch, 11 right now
it's empty.

3130
03:37:12,320 --> 03:37:12,640
Okay.

3131
03:37:12,640 --> 03:37:13,680
And you

3132
03:37:15,840 --> 03:37:18,480
so first thing that I need

3133
03:37:21,080 --> 03:37:27,600
is thought.

3134
03:37:27,600 --> 03:37:30,760
And right now
this part is not complete, right?

3135
03:37:30,760 --> 03:37:35,280
So I need to specify
the name of the file as well.

3136
03:37:35,280 --> 03:37:35,600
Right.

3137
03:37:35,600 --> 03:37:40,680
Let's put it best not x x x.

3138
03:37:41,640 --> 03:37:45,600
Yeah.

3139
03:37:45,600 --> 03:37:47,200
Should we do that. Yes.

3140
03:37:47,200 --> 03:37:48,840
It's good if you guys follow it.

3141
03:37:48,840 --> 03:37:50,880
Yep. Looks good.

3142
03:37:51,720 --> 03:37:52,080
Let me.

3143
03:37:52,080 --> 03:37:55,440
Once you guys have selected a folder
where you want to create that file.

3144
03:37:55,840 --> 03:38:00,600
So after that part of that folder,
you need to put the name of the file

3145
03:38:00,600 --> 03:38:02,440
that you want to create
and. Then the extension

3146
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:05,400
let me know once you guys

3147
03:38:05,400 --> 03:38:19,960
are done, select
any folder on your computer

3148
03:38:20,760 --> 03:38:23,360
and copy the part from there

3149
03:38:23,760 --> 03:38:26,680
and after that appended
the name of the fight like this.

3150
03:38:27,120 --> 03:38:27,800
Okay.

3151
03:38:28,400 --> 03:38:35,840
Are you guys done?

3152
03:38:35,840 --> 03:38:39,320
Okay, so the next thing we need to create

3153
03:38:44,160 --> 03:38:45,480
is the object

3154
03:38:45,480 --> 03:38:52,600
of X stuff book.

3155
03:38:52,600 --> 03:38:55,800
No excessive workbook lettuce.

3156
03:38:56,760 --> 03:39:06,400
Okay, So

3157
03:39:06,480 --> 03:39:09,920
once I have created the workbook,

3158
03:39:10,760 --> 03:39:12,960
now I will create a shirt.

3159
03:39:13,080 --> 03:39:15,840
Then create folder automatically.

3160
03:39:15,840 --> 03:39:17,040
Yes, it will.

3161
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:20,520
It I will teach you in the next class
how to delete

3162
03:39:20,520 --> 03:39:23,960
files, read
files, cleared folders and all that.

3163
03:39:23,960 --> 03:39:24,520
Okay.

3164
03:39:24,520 --> 03:39:28,440
But I think even if you just write this,
I think it will create

3165
03:39:29,040 --> 03:39:30,800
new folders as well.

3166
03:39:30,800 --> 03:39:31,200
Okay.

3167
03:39:31,200 --> 03:39:35,120
But we will learn it in the next class.

3168
03:39:35,120 --> 03:39:39,720
So once I have the workbook next
I will create these sheets inside

3169
03:39:39,720 --> 03:39:40,680
this workbook, right?

3170
03:39:40,680 --> 03:39:43,040
So I can see X.

3171
03:39:43,040 --> 03:39:48,440
So if not create sheet
and the name of the sheet.

3172
03:39:48,520 --> 03:39:51,040
Right, let's,
let's call it best. One, two, three

3173
03:39:53,520 --> 03:39:54,920
or maybe

3174
03:39:56,400 --> 03:39:56,760
sheet.

3175
03:39:56,760 --> 03:40:05,080
One, two, three.

3176
03:40:05,080 --> 03:40:09,640
And once this sheet is created, let's,

3177
03:40:09,920 --> 03:40:12,160
let's store that sheet

3178
03:40:13,480 --> 03:40:15,360
inside the sheet variable.

3179
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:17,960
So we need to create file or not. No, no.

3180
03:40:17,960 --> 03:40:22,080
You guys need to create this file will
automatically be created in here.

3181
03:40:22,440 --> 03:40:24,640
Inside this folder, I selected this part

3182
03:40:25,040 --> 03:40:28,880
so it will be created
automatically inside in.

3183
03:40:28,880 --> 03:40:35,120
You guys don't need to do it.

3184
03:40:35,120 --> 03:40:43,960
Are you going
are you guys done typing this for?

3185
03:40:43,960 --> 03:40:48,160
I think if we write sheet one, two, three,
it might create that

3186
03:40:48,160 --> 03:40:49,480
and we have to scroll down.

3187
03:40:49,480 --> 03:40:54,280
So let's keep it sheet one, maybe.

3188
03:40:54,280 --> 03:40:56,920
Okay, so that we don't get trouble.

3189
03:40:57,920 --> 03:41:03,480
So once I have this you guys, I can create
the rows inside of that sheet, right?

3190
03:41:03,800 --> 03:41:06,320
So I can say sheet and not

3191
03:41:07,360 --> 03:41:09,000
create role.

3192
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:12,360
So for example,
I want to create a row on index zero

3193
03:41:13,760 --> 03:41:15,840
and once I have created that row,

3194
03:41:16,720 --> 03:41:22,320
row will row is equal to
do not see right now.

3195
03:41:22,320 --> 03:41:23,640
I have the row

3196
03:41:24,840 --> 03:41:26,240
and now I can start

3197
03:41:26,240 --> 03:41:29,640
filling
that the those cells inside this row.

3198
03:41:29,640 --> 03:41:32,920
So if I say a row and

3199
03:41:34,000 --> 03:41:36,800
create cell and if I pass zero in here,

3200
03:41:37,680 --> 03:41:40,840
line ten, can I say X as a substitute?

3201
03:41:40,840 --> 03:41:44,640
Yes. It's also fine.

3202
03:41:44,640 --> 03:41:49,600
So I will be having a created
a cell in here.

3203
03:41:49,600 --> 03:41:50,400
Right.

3204
03:41:51,160 --> 03:41:54,480
So cell cell is equal to cell.

3205
03:41:55,920 --> 03:41:58,560
And now I can say a cell dot

3206
03:42:00,960 --> 03:42:02,960
set cell value

3207
03:42:02,960 --> 03:42:09,720
and I can put any name in here.

3208
03:42:09,720 --> 03:42:12,840
And if you guys want to do some additional

3209
03:42:12,840 --> 03:42:14,840
things like

3210
03:42:17,560 --> 03:42:19,760
getting the formula range

3211
03:42:20,400 --> 03:42:22,920
from this cell, getting this tiles

3212
03:42:24,200 --> 03:42:27,840
and all of these things that are present
in the Excel,

3213
03:42:27,840 --> 03:42:32,040
you guys will be able to find different,
different matter, split unit,

3214
03:42:33,080 --> 03:42:35,960
maybe a cell set of these cell style.

3215
03:42:36,120 --> 03:42:38,880
And here new

3216
03:42:42,200 --> 03:42:44,560
cell die

3217
03:42:45,200 --> 03:42:49,320
but it will be difficult.

3218
03:42:49,320 --> 03:42:52,160
Well let's not go there

3219
03:42:52,280 --> 03:42:56,640
but you can do pretty much
all those things like setting the color,

3220
03:42:56,640 --> 03:43:01,160
setting the formula, setting
the color of the text and all that.

3221
03:43:01,440 --> 03:43:05,720
Okay, So we have set the value.

3222
03:43:06,240 --> 03:43:10,200
And now when we have to write the data
to a file,

3223
03:43:10,320 --> 03:43:13,920
which class will you guys

3224
03:43:13,920 --> 03:43:14,280
file?

3225
03:43:14,280 --> 03:43:18,240
Import stream of the file output stream

3226
03:43:21,120 --> 03:43:22,200
the output stream.

3227
03:43:22,200 --> 03:43:22,520
Right.

3228
03:43:22,520 --> 03:43:25,880
So we will save file output stream

3229
03:43:26,520 --> 03:43:29,520
file output stream equal to new file

3230
03:43:29,520 --> 03:43:33,120
output stream and we pass the path in here

3231
03:43:36,600 --> 03:43:38,760
and now we need to

3232
03:43:41,200 --> 03:43:43,560
include this in the header

3233
03:43:45,440 --> 03:43:48,680
and we can see access of workbook dot

3234
03:43:49,240 --> 03:43:52,360
right and file output stream.

3235
03:43:53,640 --> 03:43:58,240
And again it control and error.

3236
03:43:58,240 --> 03:44:02,840
So I will say add it to the exception as

3237
03:44:04,120 --> 03:44:06,080
okay, let's try to run this code

3238
03:44:06,080 --> 03:44:16,720
If it works.

3239
03:44:16,720 --> 03:44:19,200
But you guys see
the files on your computer.

3240
03:44:19,200 --> 03:44:24,360
So for example, a file has been created,
an Excel file has been created in here.

3241
03:44:25,280 --> 03:44:30,840
And if I open that file,

3242
03:44:30,840 --> 03:44:34,320
I see the data on zero zero
and seven zero.

3243
03:44:35,680 --> 03:44:39,880
So now you guys can write
loops to populate deltas

3244
03:44:39,880 --> 03:44:43,640
as as you guys like

3245
03:44:43,680 --> 03:44:45,280
populating any cells

3246
03:44:45,280 --> 03:44:48,680
using nested loops and all of that.

3247
03:44:48,680 --> 03:44:52,120
Same way
you guys can read or write text files,

3248
03:44:52,120 --> 03:44:54,840
any type of file
that you guys have been dealing with.

3249
03:44:55,200 --> 03:44:55,880
Okay.

3250
03:44:56,400 --> 03:45:00,720
Any type of file.

3251
03:45:00,720 --> 03:45:03,920
So let me put some comments in here

3252
03:45:05,280 --> 03:45:06,760
so that you guys don't

3253
03:45:06,760 --> 03:45:40,960
get confused confused.

3254
03:45:40,960 --> 03:45:45,360
Can we use Google chair to see
if we keep a copy of Google Drive locally?

3255
03:45:45,360 --> 03:45:46,200
I think yes.

3256
03:45:46,200 --> 03:45:49,120
But you have to use libraries.

3257
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:50,760
I don't think so.

3258
03:45:50,760 --> 03:45:55,920
Apache boy sports, the Google
shirt number, you can search on.

3259
03:45:56,440 --> 03:46:01,560
You can search on the Google API to read
and write in that part of Google shirts.

3260
03:46:01,760 --> 03:46:09,120
Yes. Yes, you can do that.

3261
03:46:09,120 --> 03:46:11,560
Creating new sheet

3262
03:46:12,680 --> 03:46:13,680
in store.

3263
03:46:13,680 --> 03:46:15,840
The file

3264
03:46:17,160 --> 03:46:20,040
you guys will be able
to do much more exciting things

3265
03:46:20,840 --> 03:46:24,520
as you move forward,

3266
03:46:24,520 --> 03:46:26,840
creating new rules

3267
03:46:28,640 --> 03:46:36,400
inside the sheet,

3268
03:46:36,400 --> 03:46:40,520
creating new standards and side

3269
03:46:42,520 --> 03:46:43,800
a rule

3270
03:46:44,760 --> 03:46:58,000
of zero 13.

3271
03:46:58,080 --> 03:47:05,360
Be in that bar or that newly created cell.

3272
03:47:06,120 --> 03:47:09,680
You mean you are getting some issues

3273
03:47:10,760 --> 03:47:13,240
creating the user

3274
03:47:14,520 --> 03:47:18,080
output stream

3275
03:47:21,600 --> 03:47:22,200
Boring.

3276
03:47:22,200 --> 03:47:25,720
We are to their

3277
03:47:27,200 --> 03:47:29,600
x so five

3278
03:47:40,320 --> 03:47:44,440
null pointer exception on line 19

3279
03:47:50,520 --> 03:47:52,760
the Lord said well you

3280
03:47:53,960 --> 03:47:56,640
oh because you are writing a cell door

3281
03:47:56,640 --> 03:47:59,720
to get the cell
you have tried to cell, not create cell.

3282
03:47:59,880 --> 03:48:02,960
You are writing that cell in you.

3283
03:48:02,960 --> 03:48:04,560
There is no cell right?

3284
03:48:04,560 --> 03:48:06,640
First You create the cell,
then you can get it.

3285
03:48:07,440 --> 03:48:12,240
Yes. You guys will be having
your review class tomorrow.

3286
03:48:12,240 --> 03:48:13,400
Okay. Are there questions?

3287
03:48:13,400 --> 03:48:20,400
Are there any questions, guys,
from this school?

3288
03:48:20,400 --> 03:48:22,000
Easy peasy

3289
03:48:22,680 --> 03:48:25,160
or not easy peasy

3290
03:48:26,480 --> 03:48:27,680
for Java tomorrow?

3291
03:48:27,680 --> 03:48:31,120
For Java. It's fine.

3292
03:48:31,120 --> 03:48:35,480
It will be fine, guys, because you guys
are looking at the first time.

3293
03:48:35,680 --> 03:48:47,560
It's a little hard to head it now.

3294
03:48:47,560 --> 03:48:48,760
Okay.

3295
03:48:48,800 --> 03:48:53,680
So let me check
if we are missing something.

3296
03:48:53,680 --> 03:48:59,160
Okay.

3297
03:48:59,160 --> 03:49:00,640
And so this is your task based

3298
03:49:03,760 --> 03:49:05,040
how to create Second,

3299
03:49:05,040 --> 03:49:08,560
and it is easier to create more shirts
inside of that Excel.

3300
03:49:09,040 --> 03:49:12,040
So again, create more shirts

3301
03:49:15,280 --> 03:49:15,840
on the

3302
03:49:15,840 --> 03:49:26,880
on the same exact workbook,
create modules.

3303
03:49:26,880 --> 03:49:27,360
Okay.

3304
03:49:27,360 --> 03:49:32,000
Possible with an open source library
to create various files

3305
03:49:32,000 --> 03:49:35,160
like LOG, BPT, Excel

3306
03:49:35,160 --> 03:49:40,560
as excellence.

3307
03:49:40,560 --> 03:49:42,560
We do this task right now.

3308
03:49:42,840 --> 03:49:46,160
Oh no. You guys can do it next week.

3309
03:49:46,160 --> 03:49:50,240
Actually, next Saturdays off,
it will be 25th

3310
03:49:51,120 --> 03:49:54,240
and we will be having a class
on Sunday, next

3311
03:49:54,240 --> 03:49:56,640
Sunday session, days of that.

3312
03:49:58,120 --> 03:50:00,120
Can you show a code

3313
03:50:00,120 --> 03:50:05,240
for an interview?

3314
03:50:05,240 --> 03:50:07,200
Yep. Next. And

3315
03:50:12,480 --> 03:50:14,800
yes, on 26.

3316
03:50:15,440 --> 03:50:19,120
Let me let me check the canvas.

3317
03:50:19,120 --> 03:50:21,400
So we have three more Java classes.

3318
03:50:21,400 --> 03:50:23,600
No, only one Java class.

3319
03:50:23,600 --> 03:50:26,040
One more Java glass

3320
03:50:26,960 --> 03:50:28,880
and better was imported.

3321
03:50:28,880 --> 03:50:33,040
Okay,
but with this message or it's findable,

3322
03:50:33,600 --> 03:50:36,960
it's related to that low for the issue

3323
03:50:37,640 --> 03:50:41,960
that the Internet is facing these days.

3324
03:50:41,960 --> 03:50:43,440
Words are class.

3325
03:50:43,440 --> 03:50:47,360
On Sunday it will be Java class on

3326
03:50:48,480 --> 03:50:53,320
exceptions.

3327
03:50:53,320 --> 03:50:54,960
Yes, you should use a loop.

3328
03:50:54,960 --> 03:50:59,200
That is, if you want to create multiple
roles and cells, you should use a loop.

3329
03:50:59,480 --> 03:51:01,880
It's not going to last for values
you don't want to.

3330
03:51:03,600 --> 03:51:06,600
But Christmas on 25th.

3331
03:51:07,120 --> 03:51:08,440
Yes, it is on Saturday.

3332
03:51:08,440 --> 03:51:09,040
Right.

3333
03:51:09,440 --> 03:51:12,600
So classes on Monday, six

3334
03:51:12,920 --> 03:51:14,120
not on 25th.

3335
03:51:14,120 --> 03:51:22,320
25th is off.

3336
03:51:22,320 --> 03:51:25,480
How about January two?

3337
03:51:25,480 --> 03:51:29,680
I think first on the first off,
then it will be off.

3338
03:51:29,680 --> 03:51:31,960
And I guess the second is also off.

3339
03:51:31,960 --> 03:51:36,640
Let me check.

3340
03:51:36,640 --> 03:51:39,080
Technically,
this second should be off, right?

3341
03:51:39,080 --> 03:51:44,800
Not the first one, because you guys
will stay up all the night. Yes.

3342
03:51:44,800 --> 03:51:50,240
There is no class on one. Yes.

3343
03:51:50,240 --> 03:51:52,160
No class

3344
03:51:52,320 --> 03:51:54,680
on first

3345
03:51:56,360 --> 03:51:58,920
and on second.

3346
03:51:59,840 --> 03:52:03,000
There is this Java class

3347
03:52:06,680 --> 03:52:07,520
and first.

3348
03:52:07,520 --> 03:52:09,520
No class on second? No.

3349
03:52:09,520 --> 03:52:11,760
You guys have a class.

3350
03:52:11,760 --> 03:52:13,640
But we will be done that right?

3351
03:52:13,640 --> 03:52:16,000
We will be done with Java on 26.

3352
03:52:16,680 --> 03:52:19,920
So most probably
you guys will be having your

3353
03:52:25,000 --> 03:52:29,040
first Benjie class in here.

3354
03:52:29,040 --> 03:52:30,360
I am so sad.

3355
03:52:30,360 --> 03:52:31,200
Wait a minute.

3356
03:52:31,200 --> 03:52:33,200
Why do you said

3357
03:52:35,040 --> 03:52:36,920
imagine about the dollars

3358
03:52:36,920 --> 03:52:39,480
that you will be getting
when you will get a job?

3359
03:52:40,080 --> 03:52:43,040
You It will make you happy

3360
03:52:43,040 --> 03:52:44,760
for because Java will.

3361
03:52:44,760 --> 03:52:49,440
And if Java does not enter,
you will not get a job right?

3362
03:52:50,240 --> 03:52:52,920
You teach test and no, I am a developer.

3363
03:52:52,920 --> 03:52:54,200
I'm not a tester.

3364
03:52:54,200 --> 03:52:57,720
So someone with testing expertise

3365
03:52:57,720 --> 03:53:02,040
will teach you about those frameworks.

3366
03:53:02,040 --> 03:53:06,160
How about if we do a review
for whole Java on second?

3367
03:53:06,160 --> 03:53:08,400
What? What about the New Year night?

3368
03:53:08,840 --> 03:53:11,720
Let's have a Java review
on the new year of night

3369
03:53:11,720 --> 03:53:13,840
right at after 12

3370
03:53:14,800 --> 03:53:16,840
starting new subjects on second

3371
03:53:16,840 --> 03:53:21,720
then not good idea,

3372
03:53:21,720 --> 03:53:24,880
but we teach others with Java.

3373
03:53:24,880 --> 03:53:27,000
It's when we will see you again.

3374
03:53:27,880 --> 03:53:28,800
After 26.

3375
03:53:29,800 --> 03:53:32,800
You guys will see me

3376
03:53:35,520 --> 03:53:39,280
in February and here

3377
03:53:40,000 --> 03:53:42,960
in here it all said a squirrel.

3378
03:53:43,200 --> 03:53:48,000
Squirrel, A squirrel.

3379
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:53,760
Time spent in class every week, 22 hours,
time spent studying, doing homework, 20

3380
03:53:53,760 --> 03:53:56,840
to 25 hours total, time spent 160 hours

3381
03:53:56,840 --> 03:54:00,600
plus crying about the classes

3382
03:54:01,480 --> 03:54:04,280
when somebody will get sick.

3383
03:54:04,280 --> 03:54:09,760
It is very weird,
almost all the instructors except so

3384
03:54:09,920 --> 03:54:11,640
some air and they are good.

3385
03:54:11,640 --> 03:54:18,720
They got sick right in batch 11
at least once.

3386
03:54:18,720 --> 03:54:22,320
But once a week
we will see you for Java. Yep.

3387
03:54:23,880 --> 03:54:25,160
Yep. You guys will see.

3388
03:54:25,160 --> 03:54:27,480
I will always be here.

3389
03:54:27,480 --> 03:54:29,480
Any sport issues, anything like that.

3390
03:54:29,480 --> 03:54:32,760
I will always be here.

3391
03:54:32,760 --> 03:54:37,400
Okay, so party boy,
mostly used for reading.

3392
03:54:37,480 --> 03:54:38,840
Writing.

3393
03:54:39,000 --> 03:54:41,160
And you keep us calm.

3394
03:54:41,160 --> 03:54:46,400
I will keep sharing means and something
I will be passing by your classes.

3395
03:54:46,800 --> 03:54:48,480
Yes. Next set our days off.

3396
03:54:49,800 --> 03:54:52,000
So this is the same code

3397
03:54:52,000 --> 03:54:55,680
I have written in here.

3398
03:54:55,680 --> 03:54:57,960
I will be visiting you. Don't worry.

3399
03:54:57,960 --> 03:55:01,480
It's just the same code in here. Yay!

3400
03:55:01,480 --> 03:55:05,880
Happy you guys are finally done with Java.

3401
03:55:05,880 --> 03:55:09,520
So let's discuss about the exception
and types.

3402
03:55:09,560 --> 03:55:12,320
How many more reviews we have.

3403
03:55:12,320 --> 03:55:15,600
One review will be on

3404
03:55:15,600 --> 03:55:19,080
I guess list and add is collections
framework.

3405
03:55:19,760 --> 03:55:29,040
Then the second will be on file
handling and three more reviews.

3406
03:55:29,040 --> 03:55:31,840
Can we have any homework with this topic?

3407
03:55:32,240 --> 03:55:37,120
You guys will be now your projects,
so I want you to take some rest

3408
03:55:37,120 --> 03:55:39,240
because you guys will get super,
super busy.

3409
03:55:40,080 --> 03:55:44,480
So there is no homework for this.

3410
03:55:44,480 --> 03:55:49,480
Let's make it five.

3411
03:55:49,480 --> 03:55:51,400
Are you guys

3412
03:55:51,760 --> 03:55:53,400
okay? If I.

3413
03:55:53,400 --> 03:55:55,320
If I start the next class, I will.

3414
03:55:55,320 --> 03:55:59,640
I will tell you a little bit
about this exceptions. Yes.

3415
03:55:59,640 --> 03:56:01,080
And there will be a review tomorrow.

3416
03:56:02,280 --> 03:56:05,720
By no
homework, you mean only 30 assignments?

3417
03:56:05,720 --> 03:56:08,200
Actually, it's more than 30 assignments.

3418
03:56:08,200 --> 03:56:11,360
A project is kind of combining

3419
03:56:11,360 --> 03:56:14,240
everything
that you guys have been learning so far.

3420
03:56:14,920 --> 03:56:18,360
So all the Java Sea nadiem concepts,
you guys always

3421
03:56:18,400 --> 03:56:21,440
you guys will be putting all together
in the form of projects,

3422
03:56:21,880 --> 03:56:24,960
creating a lot of classes,
creating methods.

3423
03:56:25,520 --> 03:56:26,760
No, no, it will be easy.

3424
03:56:26,760 --> 03:56:29,520
Like, for example
instructor will show you how to do that.

3425
03:56:30,080 --> 03:56:33,000
You create a method
you save inside your intelligent.

3426
03:56:33,000 --> 03:56:37,280
Next time you have to use that,
you simply call that method.

3427
03:56:37,280 --> 03:56:43,760
You don't write the code again for it.

3428
03:56:43,760 --> 03:56:44,920
You guys should be happy.

3429
03:56:44,920 --> 03:56:50,000
Now you finally
you will see some practical examples.

3430
03:56:50,000 --> 03:56:52,160
I don't like recording here.

3431
03:56:52,200 --> 03:56:55,800
Take or not those projects I shall not.

3432
03:56:55,800 --> 03:57:02,880
The recording projects, the decoding ones,
creating the framework.

3433
03:57:02,880 --> 03:57:04,640
You said it's easy.

3434
03:57:04,640 --> 03:57:11,640
We know what it means. So

3435
03:57:12,720 --> 03:57:16,080
after you learn about this class, guys,

3436
03:57:16,480 --> 03:57:20,760
you will be able to fix
all of your issues in minutes.

3437
03:57:21,360 --> 03:57:22,080
Okay?

3438
03:57:22,320 --> 03:57:26,480
All the Java issues
that you guys have been getting Will

3439
03:57:26,520 --> 03:57:29,160
now you will be able to fix all of those.

3440
03:57:30,760 --> 03:57:34,600
So today I will teach you
when you get an error in the console,

3441
03:57:34,680 --> 03:57:37,760
what best does it make sense right now

3442
03:57:38,800 --> 03:57:42,480
other than that description that is shown
that file is not found?

3443
03:57:42,480 --> 03:57:46,640
Is there anything else that makes sense
at this time when you get an error

3444
03:57:48,240 --> 03:57:54,360
in the console?

3445
03:57:54,360 --> 03:57:56,520
Like, for example, if

3446
03:58:03,840 --> 03:58:07,680
if I go to demo six

3447
03:58:08,640 --> 03:58:12,960
and if I, if I change the port

3448
03:58:12,960 --> 03:58:19,600
and try to run it, both these lines,
they make sense.

3449
03:58:19,600 --> 03:58:20,320
Guys.

3450
03:58:20,880 --> 03:58:23,720
All of this except this, see,

3451
03:58:23,720 --> 03:58:32,360
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3452
03:58:32,360 --> 03:58:35,520
So after this class, you
everything will make sense.

3453
03:58:36,120 --> 03:58:38,560
All the errors, how they are generated,

3454
03:58:39,000 --> 03:58:42,280
why you get all
of these lines and all that.

3455
03:58:43,560 --> 03:58:45,760
They will make sense now

3456
03:58:45,760 --> 03:58:49,520
and it starts from

3457
03:58:51,320 --> 03:58:53,240
this very simple example.

3458
03:58:53,240 --> 03:59:08,760
So last 30,

3459
03:59:08,760 --> 03:59:11,560
these errors, they are called

3460
03:59:11,760 --> 03:59:15,000
exceptions in Java could not have known

3461
03:59:15,480 --> 03:59:19,800
from beginning.

3462
03:59:19,800 --> 03:59:22,360
Yes. Some of this stories,
they suggest that

3463
03:59:23,560 --> 03:59:26,960
we should teach
about these at us in this start.

3464
03:59:26,960 --> 03:59:30,480
But tell me honestly, guys,
if I start teaching about this

3465
03:59:30,480 --> 03:59:33,480
error first,
I have to introduce the error.

3466
03:59:33,960 --> 03:59:37,040
If I introduce the error,
I have to write some code

3467
03:59:37,200 --> 03:59:40,400
and then I have to intentionally
make that code for this error.

3468
03:59:40,400 --> 03:59:42,920
Will that make sense to you?

3469
03:59:42,920 --> 03:59:46,680
If if I start reading a file

3470
03:59:46,840 --> 03:59:50,960
using file steam in the first class,
will it make sense?

3471
03:59:51,200 --> 03:59:52,240
What is going on?

3472
03:59:52,240 --> 03:59:53,600
I am creating.

3473
03:59:53,600 --> 03:59:55,680
Hello World was very tough for you guys.

3474
03:59:55,680 --> 03:59:58,680
Like missing those semicolons
and variable names

3475
03:59:58,680 --> 04:00:02,040
and all that.

3476
04:00:02,040 --> 04:00:10,200
There should be one more subject.

3477
04:00:10,200 --> 04:00:16,120
So that's why
we keep this at the very end.

3478
04:00:16,120 --> 04:00:18,280
So I want you to focus guys in here.

3479
04:00:18,280 --> 04:00:19,240
Let's say

3480
04:00:23,480 --> 04:00:23,960
let's say

3481
04:00:23,960 --> 04:00:32,800
you have this code.

3482
04:00:32,800 --> 04:00:37,080
So this is this this out is representing
some important lines of code

3483
04:00:37,080 --> 04:00:38,920
that you have written in your program
there.

3484
04:00:38,920 --> 04:00:40,240
Do something

3485
04:00:40,920 --> 04:00:43,080
and then maybe solve a real life problem.

3486
04:00:43,440 --> 04:00:46,120
Another fresh group coming soon to you

3487
04:00:46,720 --> 04:00:49,160
next month, new baby boys.

3488
04:00:49,160 --> 04:00:50,880
And because

3489
04:00:56,040 --> 04:01:01,080
and then I write some piece of code
or maybe

3490
04:01:03,160 --> 04:01:06,760
we feel toddlers,
I write some piece of code

3491
04:01:06,960 --> 04:01:11,040
and that code throws an error and.

3492
04:01:11,040 --> 04:01:13,160
After that,

3493
04:01:13,640 --> 04:01:15,960
I again have some important lines of code.

3494
04:01:17,120 --> 04:01:19,320
So this imagine this, guys.

3495
04:01:19,800 --> 04:01:25,080
Imagine this.

3496
04:01:25,080 --> 04:01:29,480
Let's say you have this slack application
if you.

3497
04:01:29,520 --> 04:01:31,080
Okay, first let me declare this.

3498
04:01:31,080 --> 04:01:32,880
What do you guys think?

3499
04:01:32,880 --> 04:01:35,240
How many lines of code let me to do this.

3500
04:01:36,960 --> 04:01:39,600
Let's say only two are here
and to offer this.

3501
04:01:39,600 --> 04:01:40,640
How many of code?

3502
04:01:40,640 --> 04:01:52,960
I will see if I edit your this program.

3503
04:01:52,960 --> 04:01:58,640
If I execute this program, I will see

3504
04:01:59,080 --> 04:02:02,280
only the first two lines of code.

3505
04:02:02,920 --> 04:02:05,680
The moment the error is thrown

3506
04:02:05,840 --> 04:02:10,800
from any piece of code, from any line,

3507
04:02:11,520 --> 04:02:14,280
what Java is doing by default,

3508
04:02:14,680 --> 04:02:19,240
it terminates your
app or it terminates your

3509
04:02:20,760 --> 04:02:22,200
program abruptly.

3510
04:02:22,200 --> 04:02:24,560
I go out more
because you have more Mohamud.

3511
04:02:24,560 --> 04:02:27,120
You have written four lines
before that exception.

3512
04:02:27,720 --> 04:02:29,120
Yeah.

3513
04:02:29,120 --> 04:02:32,240
You still want to get two lines of code
even though if you have

3514
04:02:32,240 --> 04:02:37,080
written for.

3515
04:02:37,080 --> 04:02:43,160
Okay, so by default what Java is doing.

3516
04:02:43,160 --> 04:02:45,320
I did not see that.

3517
04:02:45,920 --> 04:02:48,760
Okay. So

3518
04:02:48,760 --> 04:02:51,680
by default, what Java is doing in

3519
04:02:51,720 --> 04:02:56,760
Java is facing an issue
Java does not know how to solve.

3520
04:02:56,920 --> 04:02:59,800
What is the answer to ten divided by zero?

3521
04:02:59,840 --> 04:03:00,720
Right.

3522
04:03:01,080 --> 04:03:04,200
So it's an infinite
we cannot represent infinity.

3523
04:03:04,200 --> 04:03:08,280
So this is something
that is not defined in Java, okay?

3524
04:03:08,360 --> 04:03:10,520
This is something
that is not defined in Java.

3525
04:03:11,040 --> 04:03:14,000
So when Java a situation

3526
04:03:14,920 --> 04:03:17,320
and if Java does not know

3527
04:03:17,360 --> 04:03:19,560
how to deal with that situation,

3528
04:03:20,680 --> 04:03:22,720
Java will terminate

3529
04:03:22,720 --> 04:03:26,360
your application right at that line

3530
04:03:26,840 --> 04:03:30,360
and it will not execute
the rest of the code no matter

3531
04:03:30,360 --> 04:03:34,240
if even there are 1 million lines
of code after this line.

3532
04:03:35,360 --> 04:03:36,720
This is the default

3533
04:03:36,720 --> 04:03:40,040
handling error handling behavior of Java.

3534
04:03:40,400 --> 04:03:44,920
So tell me guys, is it a good idea
to terminate the programs abruptly

3535
04:03:45,240 --> 04:03:47,520
even if I have 1 million lines of code?

3536
04:03:47,520 --> 04:03:51,600
Maybe this line of code
was not doing something special.

3537
04:03:51,600 --> 04:03:53,640
Imagine this slack application.

3538
04:03:54,000 --> 04:03:56,880
If you guys are not able to tag someone.

3539
04:03:57,040 --> 04:04:02,040
Should I close the whole show to the whole
a slack application should not function.

3540
04:04:02,040 --> 04:04:05,800
Should it all be closed
or I should be able to do other tasks

3541
04:04:07,360 --> 04:04:08,040
right.

3542
04:04:08,040 --> 04:04:12,120
It's not a good idea
that if one line code is not working,

3543
04:04:12,120 --> 04:04:15,080
I should just not execute
the rest of the lines.

3544
04:04:15,080 --> 04:04:17,360
I just terminated the whole program.

3545
04:04:17,600 --> 04:04:19,840
It's a very bad idea, right?

3546
04:04:19,840 --> 04:04:23,680
Imagine about other programs
WhatsApp, Facebook, Zoom.

3547
04:04:23,680 --> 04:04:28,160
If you are not able to perform a certain
operation, what happens in real life?

3548
04:04:28,440 --> 04:04:31,320
We get a specific ad added, right?

3549
04:04:31,320 --> 04:04:34,440
We get a specific error error message.

3550
04:04:34,840 --> 04:04:38,840
Like, for example,
if your slack is unable to connect

3551
04:04:38,840 --> 04:04:43,600
to the Internet, Slack just shows trying
to connect or something like that, right?

3552
04:04:44,880 --> 04:04:45,840
Yes. Or send the

3553
04:04:45,840 --> 04:04:48,760
reports to the developers
there to developers

3554
04:04:49,760 --> 04:04:53,800
while the users were using
your application, they faced this issue.

3555
04:04:54,160 --> 04:04:56,520
So you might want to look at this.

3556
04:04:56,520 --> 04:05:01,080
So it's a very bad idea
that if you're a single of code

3557
04:05:01,080 --> 04:05:05,040
is not working, it's a very bad idea
to terminate the complete application.

3558
04:05:05,080 --> 04:05:08,880
We never want to do that.

3559
04:05:08,880 --> 04:05:12,360
So if we never want to do that,

3560
04:05:12,520 --> 04:05:16,960
we must tell Java too.

3561
04:05:17,080 --> 04:05:20,920
We must tell Java how to make how to

3562
04:05:21,000 --> 04:05:26,720
how to fix those issues or what
to do in the case of those issues,

3563
04:05:26,720 --> 04:05:31,640
what to do in the case of those add us
then tell Java not to panic in moment.

3564
04:05:31,640 --> 04:05:35,680
Yes, that's exactly what we will be doing

3565
04:05:35,680 --> 04:05:38,640
using the help exceptions.

3566
04:05:39,400 --> 04:05:40,680
So to do that

3567
04:05:42,280 --> 04:05:43,360
it's very simple.

3568
04:05:43,360 --> 04:05:48,480
In Java we use the pride
cache block, it's the new contract.

3569
04:05:48,920 --> 04:05:51,600
So for example, if we

3570
04:05:51,600 --> 04:05:54,600
if we think that some piece of code

3571
04:05:54,840 --> 04:05:58,320
might throw some errors, we put that code

3572
04:05:58,920 --> 04:06:01,800
inside a new block

3573
04:06:01,800 --> 04:06:04,200
that is called a pride block.

3574
04:06:04,200 --> 04:06:09,200
I mean, we are saying, hey, Java,
you know what, try this code.

3575
04:06:09,360 --> 04:06:12,200
If it works, fine, that's perfectly okay.

3576
04:06:12,440 --> 04:06:14,840
But if it does not work,
fine, don't panic.

3577
04:06:15,840 --> 04:06:21,400
And we are saying if you get any ads,
catch those ads.

3578
04:06:21,600 --> 04:06:25,440
Like, for example,
if you get any exception, exceptions

3579
04:06:26,320 --> 04:06:30,440
catch exceptions and just print out

3580
04:06:33,080 --> 04:06:33,680
the error,

3581
04:06:33,680 --> 04:06:36,080
but please
don't terminate the whole program.

3582
04:06:36,840 --> 04:06:39,560
So now if I execute this program,

3583
04:06:39,560 --> 04:06:45,360
I will still be getting error,
I will still be getting error,

3584
04:06:45,760 --> 04:06:52,320
but all the code inside of my application,
it will still execute.

3585
04:06:52,320 --> 04:06:57,800
So what I have told Java that, hey, Java,
you know what?

3586
04:06:57,800 --> 04:06:59,880
I am writing a piece of code.

3587
04:07:00,120 --> 04:07:02,360
I want you to try it, okay?

3588
04:07:02,360 --> 04:07:03,480
I want you to try it.

3589
04:07:03,480 --> 04:07:06,240
If it executes, it's perfectly fine. Okay.

3590
04:07:06,680 --> 04:07:08,640
Execute this piece of code.

3591
04:07:08,640 --> 04:07:12,520
If you face any issues,
the code that I will be

3592
04:07:12,520 --> 04:07:16,440
writing inside this block, please
execute that code.

3593
04:07:16,800 --> 04:07:20,800
So, for example,
instead of doing this, I can say this

3594
04:07:22,200 --> 04:07:24,480
I can put a print out

3595
04:07:26,760 --> 04:07:28,280
dividing

3596
04:07:28,760 --> 04:07:31,160
by zero.

3597
04:07:31,160 --> 04:07:35,400
Not possible in Java.

3598
04:07:35,400 --> 04:07:39,360
Okay,
I can print an error message to the user.

3599
04:07:40,080 --> 04:07:44,960
So now if I execute this program again,
Java will try to execute this.

3600
04:07:44,960 --> 04:07:46,760
If it succeeds, it's fine.

3601
04:07:46,760 --> 04:07:51,000
If it doesn't or succeeds,
it will print this line dividing by zero.

3602
04:07:51,000 --> 04:07:52,560
Not possible.

3603
04:07:52,560 --> 04:07:55,120
Now let's say I fix code, right?

3604
04:07:55,680 --> 04:07:57,520
I don't get any errors.

3605
04:07:57,520 --> 04:07:59,280
So what Java will do?

3606
04:07:59,280 --> 04:08:01,680
Java will again try to execute this code.

3607
04:08:02,120 --> 04:08:04,320
This time Java will succeed.

3608
04:08:04,320 --> 04:08:08,760
So Java will not execute this backup
code, this alternate code.

3609
04:08:09,320 --> 04:08:15,520
So now if I execute this code, I get five

3610
04:08:15,880 --> 04:08:19,040
and Java does not execute this
catch block.

3611
04:08:20,160 --> 04:08:22,440
It's like an if health condition.

3612
04:08:22,440 --> 04:08:23,440
Yep, yep.

3613
04:08:23,440 --> 04:08:25,800
It's like any first condition here.

3614
04:08:25,800 --> 04:08:27,840
We put the problematic code

3615
04:08:28,920 --> 04:08:30,600
that can cause problems if

3616
04:08:30,600 --> 04:08:34,680
a problem is caused,
this part is executed.

3617
04:08:35,200 --> 04:08:35,960
Okay.

3618
04:08:35,960 --> 04:08:37,680
If anything goes well,

3619
04:08:37,680 --> 04:08:42,360
then Java simply executes that part
and it ignores the catch block.

3620
04:08:42,360 --> 04:08:43,640
It's a backup code.

3621
04:08:43,640 --> 04:08:45,800
Alternative code?

3622
04:08:46,160 --> 04:08:51,960
Yes. If true, ignore the cache.

3623
04:08:51,960 --> 04:08:55,680
Now, this these errors that you guys see,

3624
04:08:56,360 --> 04:08:59,120
they are all classes, actually,

3625
04:08:59,640 --> 04:09:03,840
all the errors
that you guys have been getting till now.

3626
04:09:04,360 --> 04:09:06,880
They are all classes in Java.

3627
04:09:06,880 --> 04:09:09,080
They are everything in Java is a class.

3628
04:09:09,600 --> 04:09:13,080
If I, if I press control
and hover over this

3629
04:09:13,080 --> 04:09:16,600
exception, you see public class exception.

3630
04:09:16,600 --> 04:09:18,680
This is a class actually.

3631
04:09:18,680 --> 04:09:21,320
And what we do in here,

3632
04:09:21,320 --> 04:09:23,720
we are creating an object of the class.

3633
04:09:24,600 --> 04:09:27,360
All the exceptions. They are classes.

3634
04:09:27,360 --> 04:09:28,800
And as we can have

3635
04:09:28,800 --> 04:09:32,640
parent child relationship, we also have
been interrelationship shipping error.

3636
04:09:32,640 --> 04:09:35,720
Question This prior statement suggests

3637
04:09:35,720 --> 04:09:38,920
that a line of code could work
from time to time.

3638
04:09:38,920 --> 04:09:41,400
Yes Sometimes it can cause problems.

3639
04:09:41,400 --> 04:09:43,920
That's
why we are putting it inside the try block

3640
04:09:48,000 --> 04:09:49,000
So let me tell you a

3641
04:09:49,000 --> 04:09:51,760
little bit about the theory.

3642
04:09:52,120 --> 04:09:54,200
So by definition,

3643
04:09:54,200 --> 04:09:57,360
an exception is an event

3644
04:09:58,320 --> 04:10:02,440
which occurs
during the execution of a program.

3645
04:10:02,560 --> 04:10:06,840
So the exceptions there don't compile
time.

3646
04:10:07,640 --> 04:10:10,440
The end,
there can be two types of errors, right?

3647
04:10:10,800 --> 04:10:14,200
One are the syntax address
and the other errors that you guys,

3648
04:10:14,200 --> 04:10:17,640
when you are coding right
and there are other errors

3649
04:10:17,640 --> 04:10:21,240
when you execute a program,
then you get to those errors.

3650
04:10:21,240 --> 04:10:25,440
They are called compile time
errors and runtime errors.

3651
04:10:25,440 --> 04:10:26,560
So these are exceptions.

3652
04:10:26,560 --> 04:10:29,040
They don't include those compile time
errors.

3653
04:10:29,040 --> 04:10:33,600
Those syntax issues are all that.

3654
04:10:33,600 --> 04:10:38,240
So an exception is an event which occurs

3655
04:10:38,320 --> 04:10:42,600
during the execution of a program.

3656
04:10:42,600 --> 04:10:46,680
But for that we should know
that something we created might not work.

3657
04:10:46,680 --> 04:10:50,440
But we are professionals
of just randomly making errors.

3658
04:10:50,440 --> 04:10:53,560
Now you guys will not be making errors
randomly.

3659
04:10:53,560 --> 04:10:55,320
Now you guys will be making errors.

3660
04:10:55,320 --> 04:11:00,960
Professional, make a professional error

3661
04:11:02,360 --> 04:11:03,360
and then debug

3662
04:11:03,360 --> 04:11:09,120
that data. So

3663
04:11:11,320 --> 04:11:15,000
and that does not make me feel good.

3664
04:11:15,520 --> 04:11:20,960
An exception is an event which occurs
during the execution of a program

3665
04:11:21,720 --> 04:11:24,880
that disrupts the normal flow.

3666
04:11:24,880 --> 04:11:26,120
What is a normal flow?

3667
04:11:26,120 --> 04:11:29,840
Normal flow is whatever code
we have written, Java

3668
04:11:29,880 --> 04:11:35,000
should execute all the code line by line
starting from top to bottom.

3669
04:11:35,000 --> 04:11:35,760
Right?

3670
04:11:35,880 --> 04:11:40,560
But what is not normal
is to just terminate the program

3671
04:11:40,760 --> 04:11:43,680
between execute some lines of code
and ignore

3672
04:11:43,680 --> 04:11:49,280
the rest of the code. Yes.

3673
04:11:50,120 --> 04:11:51,400
Let the other

3674
04:11:53,200 --> 04:11:54,480
so it

3675
04:11:54,720 --> 04:11:58,320
it disrupts the normal flow
of the program's destruction.

3676
04:11:58,320 --> 04:11:58,560
Right.

3677
04:11:58,560 --> 04:12:02,840
Whatever we have written,
it does not execute.

3678
04:12:02,840 --> 04:12:06,240
That exception is an object

3679
04:12:06,240 --> 04:12:10,240
which is put on at a runtime.

3680
04:12:10,560 --> 04:12:11,360
Okay.

3681
04:12:11,360 --> 04:12:15,360
Now this is important
because all the errors

3682
04:12:16,680 --> 04:12:19,160
internally, you guys are right.

3683
04:12:19,160 --> 04:12:20,080
They are.

3684
04:12:20,080 --> 04:12:24,240
If else, if we go back to the demo

3685
04:12:24,240 --> 04:12:28,760
seven,

3686
04:12:28,760 --> 04:12:31,800
that's what it demo six.

3687
04:12:31,800 --> 04:12:34,160
I mean demo five

3688
04:12:35,720 --> 04:12:39,200
if you guys check this file input stream.

3689
04:12:39,840 --> 04:12:40,320
Okay.

3690
04:12:40,320 --> 04:12:45,120
If I hold down my control button
and if I go inside this file in stream,

3691
04:12:45,800 --> 04:12:49,000
you guys will see there
is this health condition.

3692
04:12:50,120 --> 04:12:51,000
Okay?

3693
04:12:51,280 --> 04:12:55,040
And inside this file,

3694
04:12:55,040 --> 04:12:57,880
Java guys,
they are checking the condition.

3695
04:12:58,240 --> 04:13:01,520
They are checking if the part

3696
04:13:01,520 --> 04:13:04,520
that you guys are providing,

3697
04:13:04,520 --> 04:13:07,000
you guys are providing a null value.

3698
04:13:08,120 --> 04:13:13,560
Java guys are saying throw new null point.

3699
04:13:13,560 --> 04:13:14,160
But exception.

3700
04:13:14,160 --> 04:13:16,800
Can you guys tell me what is this?

3701
04:13:16,800 --> 04:13:18,920
You guys are familiar
with this part of code,

3702
04:13:19,000 --> 04:13:22,840
What do we call it when we write new
and then the name of the class

3703
04:13:29,120 --> 04:13:31,080
in here I am.

3704
04:13:31,080 --> 04:13:34,320
They are creating an object right? New.

3705
04:13:34,320 --> 04:13:37,360
And then the name of the class
with parentheses creating an object.

3706
04:13:38,720 --> 04:13:42,120
Okay, Word is actually throwing
that object

3707
04:13:43,640 --> 04:13:47,280
who do to the person
who Whoever is calling this file,

3708
04:13:47,960 --> 04:13:51,440
this file, public file,
it's a constructor.

3709
04:13:51,440 --> 04:13:53,760
Whoever is invoking this constructor

3710
04:13:54,600 --> 04:13:59,200
and object of null pointer exception,
which is a class

3711
04:13:59,200 --> 04:14:02,760
if you hover, this is a class class
null pointer exception.

3712
04:14:02,760 --> 04:14:08,600
An object
is being created of this class. Yes.

3713
04:14:08,640 --> 04:14:12,240
You're saying a saying throw
an error message to the console,

3714
04:14:12,520 --> 04:14:14,520
but we actually throw objects.

3715
04:14:14,920 --> 04:14:19,440
Java in Java everything is classes
and objects so we throw,

3716
04:14:19,440 --> 04:14:22,800
we create a new object of the class

3717
04:14:23,560 --> 04:14:25,960
and we throw it to the caller.

3718
04:14:25,960 --> 04:14:29,520
Now, destroying part,
it is automatically handled by Java.

3719
04:14:29,520 --> 04:14:33,800
We just need to write this through so
you guys don't get confused by this tool

3720
04:14:33,840 --> 04:14:35,160
how this is happening.

3721
04:14:35,160 --> 04:14:39,080
It is happening
behind the scenes is doing it. So

3722
04:14:40,680 --> 04:14:43,680
I am calling this method inside file
import

3723
04:14:43,680 --> 04:14:47,800
theme and I am calling that code inside
demo five.

3724
04:14:47,840 --> 04:14:52,640
So what that new the what
that true new null pointer

3725
04:14:52,640 --> 04:14:56,840
exception is saying it is saying
if we pass and null value in

3726
04:15:01,680 --> 04:15:03,080
it will not allow directly.

3727
04:15:03,080 --> 04:15:05,520
So SDR is equal to null

3728
04:15:06,680 --> 04:15:09,800
and if I pass in null value in here,

3729
04:15:10,440 --> 04:15:14,120
which type of edit I will get guys,

3730
04:15:14,120 --> 04:15:16,560
I am passing a null value desperately

3731
04:15:17,400 --> 04:15:20,280
so intentionally
I'm passing a null value in here.

3732
04:15:21,880 --> 04:15:23,920
I will get in

3733
04:15:23,920 --> 04:15:28,200
null pointer exception.

3734
04:15:28,200 --> 04:15:28,920
Okay.

3735
04:15:29,360 --> 04:15:32,320
You see that that that that broke you.

3736
04:15:32,320 --> 04:15:33,480
Where do you see that broke?

3737
04:15:33,480 --> 04:15:35,560
You were inside That is condition.

3738
04:15:35,560 --> 04:15:39,000
This is this is the
this is all because of that throw keyword

3739
04:15:39,760 --> 04:15:44,600
so all the errors
that you guys have been getting till now

3740
04:15:45,840 --> 04:15:48,120
Java guys have written all

3741
04:15:48,120 --> 04:15:51,160
those scenarios with the help of

3742
04:15:51,160 --> 04:15:56,480
if health conditions so that if you guys
make a specific mistake,

3743
04:15:56,640 --> 04:15:59,760
they can throw you a standard error

3744
04:16:00,280 --> 04:16:03,960
and so that you guys know
what you guys did wrong.

3745
04:16:05,320 --> 04:16:12,720
Okay.

3746
04:16:12,720 --> 04:16:15,360
So when something is empty
or null pointer. Yes.

3747
04:16:16,160 --> 04:16:20,640
Whenever
you will be trying to call any methods

3748
04:16:20,880 --> 04:16:23,160
or, any anything,

3749
04:16:23,760 --> 04:16:26,960
anything on an object which has a null,

3750
04:16:27,320 --> 04:16:29,480
you will be getting a null point
of exception.

3751
04:16:29,960 --> 04:16:32,040
Now, I have a question, guys.

3752
04:16:32,640 --> 04:16:34,280
I have a question for you.

3753
04:16:34,280 --> 04:16:38,600
Let's say, for example.

3754
04:16:38,600 --> 04:16:40,960
So it's very good Java guys.

3755
04:16:40,960 --> 04:16:44,640
They are throwing the
as we can catch the errors and all that.

3756
04:16:44,640 --> 04:16:45,280
Right.

3757
04:16:46,440 --> 04:16:49,080
But how do

3758
04:16:49,640 --> 04:16:52,560
how what are what do these lines mean?

3759
04:16:52,560 --> 04:16:55,840
Right.

3760
04:16:55,840 --> 04:16:59,160
How to read these arrows,
how to make sense out of these errors.

3761
04:17:00,840 --> 04:17:02,800
Java guys, including us where they are

3762
04:17:02,800 --> 04:17:06,640
not only now the onset about
they know out errors.

3763
04:17:06,920 --> 04:17:09,720
You know, they also show you the answer

3764
04:17:10,160 --> 04:17:13,080
that they say your file is not found
or something like that.

3765
04:17:13,080 --> 04:17:16,360
They always help you,
but you guys never pay attention.

3766
04:17:18,200 --> 04:17:21,840
Yes. They anticipated and accommodated
every possible error.

3767
04:17:21,840 --> 04:17:22,520
Yes, and I will.

3768
04:17:22,520 --> 04:17:27,640
You are right,
Java guys that were very hardworking.

3769
04:17:27,640 --> 04:17:30,560
But you guys don't even bother
to read the errors, right?

3770
04:17:31,840 --> 04:17:32,800
I'm just kidding.

3771
04:17:32,800 --> 04:17:36,160
You guys are working
very hard as well. So a

3772
04:17:37,840 --> 04:17:40,080
how to refer to these errors.

3773
04:17:40,080 --> 04:17:44,160
If you guys want to read the errors,
this is how you should do it.

3774
04:17:44,920 --> 04:17:47,520
So this line

3775
04:17:51,320 --> 04:17:53,800
in here, it will always be same.

3776
04:17:55,200 --> 04:17:59,200
It's again related to
that tried to save the multiple threading.

3777
04:17:59,200 --> 04:18:04,040
If you are executing multiple threads
only then it will get a chain.

3778
04:18:04,040 --> 04:18:06,360
But you guys will never be writing
multithreaded core.

3779
04:18:06,360 --> 04:18:08,640
So far will this line will always be same.

3780
04:18:09,720 --> 04:18:12,240
The next line

3781
04:18:13,200 --> 04:18:17,160
tells you about the package

3782
04:18:17,760 --> 04:18:20,920
info and the name of the class.

3783
04:18:21,760 --> 04:18:24,040
Okay. Name Of the class

3784
04:18:24,040 --> 04:18:27,000
whose object is thrown at you

3785
04:18:29,360 --> 04:18:31,600
and this line tells you

3786
04:18:33,000 --> 04:18:34,240
so. You see

3787
04:18:34,640 --> 04:18:37,040
this error is originated

3788
04:18:37,920 --> 04:18:40,760
in file input stream door

3789
04:18:40,760 --> 04:18:44,160
to Java at line 130.

3790
04:18:44,880 --> 04:18:49,160
So this added
it is showing you the exact line number

3791
04:18:49,800 --> 04:18:52,360
which caused this issue.

3792
04:18:52,360 --> 04:18:55,920
If we go inside file input stream,
you're not

3793
04:18:55,920 --> 04:19:05,000
Java at line 131 130.

3794
04:19:05,000 --> 04:19:09,840
It shows you the exact line number
which is causing this issue.

3795
04:19:09,840 --> 04:19:15,520
Next, it shows you
the class who was calling this,

3796
04:19:15,880 --> 04:19:19,680
who was calling this piece
of functionality, this file input.

3797
04:19:19,680 --> 04:19:22,160
So this functionality was being called

3798
04:19:22,680 --> 04:19:25,160
by this piece of code.

3799
04:19:26,400 --> 04:19:30,480
That's why you see Java line 93.

3800
04:19:31,080 --> 04:19:34,600
And then it shows you the complete package

3801
04:19:35,520 --> 04:19:39,200
that you have written
which caused this issue.

3802
04:19:39,840 --> 04:19:44,720
So it's saying, hey, girl, there is a
this, there is this package com or syntax.

3803
04:19:44,720 --> 04:19:49,320
Inside that package
there is this sub package class 30 inside

3804
04:19:49,320 --> 04:19:52,960
that there is a class called
Excel Demo five.

3805
04:19:53,280 --> 04:19:58,440
Inside that class there is this man
a method inside that main method online

3806
04:19:59,640 --> 04:20:01,560
you are doing something wrong.

3807
04:20:01,560 --> 04:20:06,920
So if I click on this line 19,
it takes me to exact x

3808
04:20:07,920 --> 04:20:10,920
that exact line
which is causing the problem.

3809
04:20:11,880 --> 04:20:14,160
So it's insane that it is saying, Hey,
is there

3810
04:20:15,000 --> 04:20:17,800
a null pointer
exception is being thrown at you

3811
04:20:18,240 --> 04:20:21,680
and the line of code
that is causing this problem.

3812
04:20:21,680 --> 04:20:24,120
Here is the information about that line.

3813
04:20:24,120 --> 04:20:29,240
Even if you have million lines of code,
even if you have hundreds of packages,

3814
04:20:29,760 --> 04:20:32,640
even if you have hundreds
of methods inside the class,

3815
04:20:33,200 --> 04:20:38,080
Java will tell you the exact line number
which causes the issue.

3816
04:20:38,880 --> 04:20:42,080
Okay. Now

3817
04:20:44,720 --> 04:20:45,760
let me show you.

3818
04:20:45,760 --> 04:20:48,480
It will make more sense

3819
04:20:48,480 --> 04:20:55,760
if I show you with this example.

3820
04:20:55,760 --> 04:20:58,440
So yes, we can avoid the adverse

3821
04:21:00,480 --> 04:21:02,920
we can avoid the errors by writing it

3822
04:21:02,960 --> 04:21:05,760
false conditions like Java guys did.

3823
04:21:06,120 --> 04:21:10,480
But if we write the first condition
guides, will we be able to get of this

3824
04:21:10,480 --> 04:21:16,200
info the package, name
the class, name the exact line number.

3825
04:21:16,200 --> 04:21:17,560
Who is calling your method?

3826
04:21:17,560 --> 04:21:20,120
We will not be able to get info.

3827
04:21:20,520 --> 04:21:21,760
Yes, we can write it.

3828
04:21:21,760 --> 04:21:25,880
False conditions
like you guys can ask that test that you

3829
04:21:25,880 --> 04:21:31,280
You could have avoided this issue
by simply checking.

3830
04:21:31,280 --> 04:21:34,240
So let's say, for example,
if there are two numbers, actually user

3831
04:21:34,280 --> 04:21:45,040
builder was entering these numbers right?

3832
04:21:45,040 --> 04:21:47,640
So I can write
an if condition, I can say if

3833
04:21:48,720 --> 04:21:50,760
number two is

3834
04:21:50,920 --> 04:21:56,320
not equal to zero,
then only perform this operation right.

3835
04:21:56,760 --> 04:21:59,040
Then only try to divide

3836
04:22:02,400 --> 04:22:03,720
number

3837
04:22:05,520 --> 04:22:07,320
by number two

3838
04:22:07,520 --> 04:22:11,840
if it is equal to zero,
should set out message.

3839
04:22:12,120 --> 04:22:14,600
So this error message

3840
04:22:17,520 --> 04:22:19,560
divide by

3841
04:22:19,960 --> 04:22:21,360
zero, Right?

3842
04:22:21,360 --> 04:22:27,800
So yes, we can do that, but it's not good
way to go to handle data. Why?

3843
04:22:27,800 --> 04:22:34,600
Because if you do that, you will only be
getting a single piece of information.

3844
04:22:34,600 --> 04:22:39,520
Whatever you are printing in the console,
you lose all that stack trace

3845
04:22:39,520 --> 04:22:43,320
exact line numbers, package numbers
specific at us.

3846
04:22:43,680 --> 04:22:48,000
And as a programmers, let's say maybe
I have written ten or divided by zero.

3847
04:22:48,520 --> 04:22:51,160
Maybe there is another developer
who has written

3848
04:22:51,720 --> 04:22:56,440
not possible. Now

3849
04:22:57,720 --> 04:22:59,800
if you give the choice to the

3850
04:23:01,320 --> 04:23:03,000
to the users,

3851
04:23:03,000 --> 04:23:05,200
they they can write any error messages,
right?

3852
04:23:05,960 --> 04:23:07,680
For some of you, they will

3853
04:23:07,680 --> 04:23:11,640
they might make sense for some of you,
they might not make sense.

3854
04:23:11,800 --> 04:23:13,680
So it's not a standard,

3855
04:23:13,680 --> 04:23:17,320
although the added is still saying
we are trying to divide it by zero,

3856
04:23:17,320 --> 04:23:20,520
but now everyone will start
to create its own errors.

3857
04:23:20,920 --> 04:23:22,560
That's not good.

3858
04:23:22,560 --> 04:23:24,840
So we should have standard errors

3859
04:23:26,040 --> 04:23:27,240
so that

3860
04:23:27,240 --> 04:23:31,760
by just looking at the error,
you guys can quickly know what went wrong.

3861
04:23:33,160 --> 04:23:36,040
So that's why we use the trick at blocks

3862
04:23:37,640 --> 04:23:42,720
instead of simply false conditions.

3863
04:23:42,720 --> 04:23:43,800
Here is the

3864
04:23:46,160 --> 04:23:46,840
so let's say

3865
04:23:46,840 --> 04:23:57,600
guys, I have this class

3866
04:23:57,720 --> 04:24:03,960
right?

3867
04:24:03,960 --> 04:24:06,160
Public static.

3868
04:24:06,160 --> 04:24:11,640
Lloyd,

3869
04:24:11,640 --> 04:24:13,920
do something

3870
04:24:23,160 --> 04:24:24,880
and you have another

3871
04:24:26,800 --> 04:24:29,640
public static void

3872
04:24:33,080 --> 04:24:36,600
low math.

3873
04:24:36,600 --> 04:24:39,080
You have another method

3874
04:24:40,000 --> 04:24:43,320
public that ward

3875
04:24:45,560 --> 04:24:49,080
divide.

3876
04:24:49,080 --> 04:24:53,880
And inside this code I am doing something
which is causing the issue

3877
04:24:54,560 --> 04:24:57,240
and I am calling the divider method inside
do not

3878
04:24:57,240 --> 04:24:59,240
matter and I am calling this

3879
04:25:00,360 --> 04:25:01,560
boom at method.

3880
04:25:01,560 --> 04:25:04,400
So I am calling multiple methods
inside each other.

3881
04:25:04,400 --> 04:25:05,000
Okay.

3882
04:25:05,000 --> 04:25:08,800
Or maybe I have.

3883
04:25:08,800 --> 04:25:11,440
We will finish on time today.

3884
04:25:11,440 --> 04:25:12,960
You guys want to live there?

3885
04:25:12,960 --> 04:25:15,680
We still have 6 minutes.

3886
04:25:15,880 --> 04:25:21,400
No, we will continue in the next
from here.

3887
04:25:21,400 --> 04:25:22,320
You're school much

3888
04:25:31,480 --> 04:25:32,200
all right.

3889
04:25:32,200 --> 04:25:34,440
I speak some of rest.
We will start from here.

3890
04:25:34,720 --> 04:25:35,160
Okay.

3891
04:25:35,720 --> 04:25:37,160
Let's finish

3892
04:25:38,280 --> 04:25:40,200
in 5 minutes.

3893
04:25:40,200 --> 04:25:46,000
We can not do much anyway.

3894
04:25:46,000 --> 04:25:48,640
To date was a long blahs.

3895
04:25:49,800 --> 04:25:51,120
All right, guys. Bye bye.

3896
04:25:51,120 --> 04:25:53,800
Date summarized.
