1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,240
All right, guys, let's get started

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,720
with our last class of selenium, right.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,720
How is everybody doing?

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,880
What's going on, guys?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,640
I hope everyone is doing good.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,080
Yeah, I'm good.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,280
Thank you.

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,280
Last class with me, guys.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,520
Then after this,
I think you'll continue with tests

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,720
and you'll start with cucumber.

11
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,200
The homework is in progress.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
You miss me?
I'll miss you too, guys. Okay.

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:04,320
I'll probably be on the mock interviews,
but I doubt it.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,760
I'll see if I can take some interviews

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,120
at the at the end of the course.

16
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,280
No, I don't think I will be teaching
any other subject

17
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:33,600
with you guys.

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,680
And never before.

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,000
Thank you.
Thank you. That's because of Michael.

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,720
That's not because of me.

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,440
Can I interview you?

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,680
Okay.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,760
If I interview you, you'll probably fail,
Michael.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,440
Okay.

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
Now, remember, remember, you need to fire.

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,760
You need to find a job in two
weeks, right?

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,480
So that I can.

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,840
So that I can get you a pizza.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,920
If not you getting everyone
a pizza, right?

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,000
That was a deal, right?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
Okay. All right.

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
This is recording, guys. Okay.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,520
This is recorded one more time.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,840
All right, Michael, I need to check.

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,000
I need to check your graduation date.

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:34,680
Okay.

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,320
Oh, wow. Okay, everyone.

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,960
Everyone is against Michael now.

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
Don't you grab.

40
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,680
Yeah.

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,800
After you pass
the mock interview. Exactly.

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,800
What if I don't take Michael's interview?
Then he'll probably pass.

43
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,160
But we'll see.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
We'll see.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,080
Well, Michael passed the mock interview,
but failed the real one, too.

46
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,400
What?

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:23,240
What's going on, guys?

48
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Good. Okay, so I will prepare the pizza.

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,440
Okay, Mike, just.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,280
Just make sure you don't
send me in the interview, okay?

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,480
That.

52
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:50,240
That's not a good
that's not a good practice.

53
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,960
Or sent creepy voicemail.

54
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,680
Yeah, that.

55
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:02,240
That works too. You.

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,760
I didn't specify
what kind of jobs you're supposed to get.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,520
Okay, well, we'll see
what kind of jobs you'll be applying.

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:17,560
Okay.

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,640
All right.

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,320
All right, guys. So

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,720
let's get started

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
with the last class
of our selenium, right?

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,600
So we'll be going over the page model
today.

64
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,120
I'll show you the initial designs

65
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,400
of the framework that you will be working

66
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
in a real job.

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,240
Okay, So like, I've seen like
80% of the time, I've seen the same design

68
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,360
as I will be showing you right now

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,160
at work.

70
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,920
And we have the same design
at work as well.

71
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,200
So it's pretty popular design
that everybody uses at work.

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,760
So and it's not that difficult. Okay.

73
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:09,240
But before we dive in, let's do a quick
recap of what we've done yesterday.

74
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,600
Okay.

75
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,280
What kind of topics did we

76
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,240
did we cover yesterday,

77
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,760
guys?

78
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,280
All right.

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,680
We we went over the uploading the file.

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,440
All right, So how do we.

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Okay,
so we went over the JavaScript executable

82
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,680
right?

83
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,080
How do we upload the file guys?

84
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,840
See? Okay, it was simply sand keys.

85
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,200
Right.

86
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,960
So what do we take
a look at before we do that?

87
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Guys, whenever we try to choose,

88
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,080
whenever we try to click on the choose
file or upload the file,

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,600
okay, So we

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,880
would need the path of our file, right?

91
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,640
And then we need to take a look
at the input tag.

92
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,760
Right. So once it has that input tag,

93
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,840
then you will be able to send keys to that
element.

94
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,520
Right? Pretty easy.

95
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,080
So what if sand keys doesn't work?
Guys? What?

96
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,440
What are you going to use then?

97
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,480
Actions.

98
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,000
If keys doesn't work, you will be

99
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,200
you should be using the robot class right.

100
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,880
Okay.

101
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,960
All right.

102
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,520
What about a JavaScript execute or guy?

103
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,760
So what do we know?

104
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,480
What what can we do with JavaScript,
execute or guy?

105
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:52,760
So what is JavaScript executed in general?

106
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,560
It's a library, right?

107
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,760
It's a library.

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,040
Okay.

109
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,160
The library that presents
the present is selenium,

110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,280
right?

111
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,680
Okay. It's an interface. Good.

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,160
So we could do scroll up and down right?

113
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,440
It executes different programing.

114
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,840
Languages like Java,

115
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,680
Python, C

116
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,040
sharp, right.

117
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,760
Okay, we can open a new tab.

118
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,400
We can scroll up and down right?

119
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,960
We can highlight that element, right?

120
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,760
We can.

121
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
And then what we can do is

122
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,760
we can scroll to a specific element

123
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:54,600
right?

124
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,040
Okay.

125
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,920
So JavaScript
executed as a little bit of different,

126
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,440
a little bit of a difference script.

127
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,640
You have to downcast it to your driver
and then there is

128
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,800
a built in script that you have to

129
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,360
you have to use in order to perform
some actions.

130
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,960
Right? So what about the click guys?

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,320
When are we going to use the JavaScript,
click JavaScript, execute

132
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,240
or click

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,480
when regular click doesn't work, right?

134
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,640
So how many ways
of clicking on the element did we learn?

135
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,000
Guys? Three. Right.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,840
So we have JavaScript executed, clicked,
we have a regular click and then

137
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,760
what was the third one

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,880
from the actions class.

139
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,280
Right. Okay, there we go.

140
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,240
Oh, right.

141
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,560
Okay, guys.

142
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,480
Yep. And we have
what's what's the correct answer?

143
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:10,520
What kind of functions you can handle.

144
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,880
So that question.

145
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,240
Okay, so you can answer that question,

146
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,840
execute script and execute
async script, right?

147
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,040
Because

148
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,160
we talked about JavaScript,
Execute is saying that it

149
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
has only two different methods, right?

150
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,760
But if the interviewer is talking
about the actual actions as functions,

151
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,600
then you need to tell them
what kind of actions you can perform.

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,400
Okay, So you have to
you have to create a conversation

153
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,960
between you and your interviewer, right?

154
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,560
It's not just you answering questions
that are being asked, right?

155
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,080
So you have to sometimes
you have to ask them clarifying questions

156
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,120
so that you know what to actually

157
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,920
tell them.

158
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,440
Okay.

159
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,880
All right.

160
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Any other questions, guys?

161
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,280
Okay.

162
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,840
If no other questions,
then we can get started

163
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,960
with page object model.

164
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,240
Okay.

165
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,080
So did anyone do a research on page
object model

166
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,240
guys, what is the page object model?

167
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,520
Why we need a page object model

168
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,960
and what does it help us to do?

169
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,040
Yeah, well, not yet, right? Not.

170
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,200
Not yet.

171
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,680
No. Hands on the keyboard and hand.

172
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,320
Focus on the slack.

173
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,480
Right.

174
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,120
Okay,
so we're creating an object of every page.

175
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Okay, good.

176
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,720
It's a design principle.

177
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,840
Okay, What else?

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:17,440
What else?

179
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:28,720
It's a design pattern. Yes.

180
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,720
All right, well, Page,
there should be a separate page class.

181
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Okay, very good One.

182
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,360
An application from one place to another.

183
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Okay.

184
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,840
Writing are elements
where I using page factor.

185
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,240
Okay. Very good.

186
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,080
All right.

187
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,760
So page object model. Right.

188
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,120
So it's a design pattern.

189
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,120
All right.

190
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,440
So basically, we will be designing
our project by using this model.

191
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,200
Okay.

192
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Page object
model is a pattern for enhancing

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,560
test maintenance
and reducing your code duplication.

194
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,720
Okay.

195
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,600
So it's going to help us to

196
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,720
to make a lot of things reusable.

197
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,320
And you don't have to duplicate them
every time you are starting

198
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,080
or you're performing any actions
or you're executing it.

199
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,280
Test case. Okay.

200
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,200
So, so
basically what we will be doing right now,

201
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,120
we will be dividing our project
into four different packages.

202
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,800
Okay.
So the four different packages will be

203
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,880
it's going to be your

204
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,560
base class,
it will be your common utilities,

205
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,600
it's going to be your pages
and it's going to be your tests.

206
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,640
Okay.

207
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,680
These four.

208
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,160
So let me actually open

209
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,240
this thing

210
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,080
and see.

211
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:28,680
ia0, all right.

212
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,360
So four packages, right?

213
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,200
So let's check my art skills in here.

214
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,640
So we're going to be having four packages
in here

215
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,160
in our project. Go.

216
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,560
Okay.

217
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,960
So basically, guys,
what what's happening in the page

218
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,440
object model is
we will be having a separate class

219
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,000
for each and every page
that we will be working on.

220
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,440
Okay. So let's say in here,

221
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,400
let's go back here.

222
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,600
Let's refresh 12.

223
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,480
That's right.

224
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
So whenever we navigate to this page,
we already know that

225
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,840
this is a web page, right?

226
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,120
This is a log in page that we need
to enter our username password,

227
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,240
and we need to click on log in so
that we can we're able to log in, right?

228
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,400
So anything that is any elements

229
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,680
that we will be interacting on this page,

230
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,680
we will be storing it in a separate class.

231
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,280
Okay,
So everything will be checked separately

232
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,480
so that it is organized
and you will not be able to

233
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,280
you it's going to make your life easier
so that you don't duplicate anything.

234
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,360
Okay.

235
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,440
And we'll go one by one in here.

236
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,600
So first of all, let's use this one.

237
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,040
Okay, In here.

238
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,280
First of all, let's go over the

239
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,800
test.

240
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,480
This package.

241
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,280
All right,
What can be the base of our tests?

242
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,560
So what are we actually doing?

243
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,040
Every time, whenever
we start our execution or whenever

244
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:29,760
we start our test case.

245
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,160
So we're actually opening the browser,
right?

246
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,200
So we're launching the browser.

247
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,840
So basically what we're doing is

248
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,600
we are initializing our web driver, right?

249
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,080
So here what we can do,

250
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,320
we can put

251
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,640
open the browser, right?

252
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Or the launch the browser in here,
what else?

253
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,520
So we open the browser.

254
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,280
So every time in the test case, so we open
the browser, we performed an action.

255
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,600
What's going to happen next?

256
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:09,960
No, no, no.

257
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,680
We already perform actions, guys. Okay?

258
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,240
We we open the browser,
we navigate it to the URL, right?

259
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,480
We performed a lot of actions.

260
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,920
And then what's
going to happen in the end?

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,800
We simply quit the browser, right?

262
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,760
So we open the browser and quit.

263
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,320
The browser is going to be our phase
based thing to do.

264
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:33,960
Okay?

265
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,560
This is going to be our baseline, right?

266
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,160
So quit the

267
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,720
browser

268
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,240
here and within three sit here.

269
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,680
Right. Okay.

270
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,280
So this is going to be our base test base

271
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,280
package. Okay.

272
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,840
So we will be adding something else
in the test phase.

273
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,440
You guys going to be doing it later on?

274
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,360
Okay.

275
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,280
Because you will be taking screenshots,
you will be taking some

276
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,280
you will be doing some other actions
before you open

277
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,400
and after
or before you close your browsers.

278
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,800
Okay.
But so now let's keep it very simple.

279
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,920
Opening the browser and closing
the browser is going to be our baseline

280
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,560
of our pattern and design.

281
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,080
Okay, So the second one in here

282
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,960
is going to be our util.

283
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:38,120
Okay, so utility
utility package, utility package.

284
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,720
And here,

285
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
let's take this over here.

286
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:41,760
Okay.

287
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,920
So what do we have inside
our utility packages, guys?

288
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,320
So what can be the

289
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,360
the common things that we can add in here?

290
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,400
So first of all, the common
methods, right?

291
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,480
The common methods are

292
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,280
drivers will be initialized
in here, right, guys, don't forget.

293
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,080
So whenever you are opening
and closing the browser,

294
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,840
your driver is going to be initialized
in here.

295
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,560
Okay, But
are you talking about the actual chrome

296
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,760
driver and Firefox driver

297
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,280
libraries?

298
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,360
Okay, so first of all, we're
going to have common methods.

299
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,880
All right.

300
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,640
What else can we have in here? So

301
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,440
so common methods are like

302
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,080
the really using

303
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,000
are we using methods that you can perform
some actions on the web page?

304
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,560
Right.

305
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,920
So sometimes whenever you start
guys, whenever you guys start

306
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,840
API's, you will be

307
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,920
having some common methods
for APIs as well.

308
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,240
Okay.

309
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,000
So I'll put here API

310
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,880
common methods, and then after that,

311
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,560
whenever you start with a database,

312
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,920
with a database testing guys,

313
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,680
you will have some common methods
to connect to the database,

314
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,720
to execute some queries
and to close some connections and so on.

315
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,640
And you can also include here

316
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,720
database utils in here as well.

317
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,000
Okay.

318
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So these kind of

319
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,600
common classes

320
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,480
you will be having inside the utilities.

321
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,920
Okay.

322
00:19:46,920 --> 00:20:02,400
Any questions so far, guys.

323
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,760
Constants configures constants they

324
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,760
they will we can actually put them in the
in the utility as well.

325
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,400
Okay.

326
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,640
But constants those

327
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,880
you don't have to have them
in the utility.

328
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,240
Okay but it's up to you guys
how you want to implement it.

329
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,720
But I think whoever is going
to be going over the frameworks,

330
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,080
you guys will be putting this inside
the util class.

331
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,960
Okay.

332
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,800
But configurator, I think

333
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,360
if I'm not mistaken, I'm not sure, guys,
how they're designing right now.

334
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,160
It might be in
the test phase as well. Okay.

335
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,600
But right now, as I said, guys, let's keep
it simple.

336
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,520
Don't rush into config spreaders
and constants right now, but just keep it

337
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,320
simple.

338
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,000
Let's try to understand
how the actual design works.

339
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,880
Okay? All right.

340
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,360
So now utility is fine, test
phase is fine.

341
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,080
So now we will be jumping on the pages.

342
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,480
Okay, So pages is going to be our third

343
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,080
package where we will be

344
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,080
having classes
for each and every web page.

345
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,080
Okay.

346
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,760
So let's say we have a log in page
and here

347
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,720
we will be having a class separately

348
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,920
for this login page. Okay.

349
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,640
And what we will be having in those login
page pages,

350
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,040
we will be only having the web elements.

351
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,840
Okay.

352
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,040
So what we're going to do,
we will be storing all the elements

353
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,720
from one page that we will be interacting

354
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,480
with inside one class.

355
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,000
Okay, so let's say we're interacting
with username, password

356
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,960
and log in and here where is
this located is located in the login page.

357
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,160
So what we're going to do,
we will be creating a login page class

358
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,280
and we will store

359
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,920
all the elements
that we will be interacting with.

360
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,600
Okay, so username element, right?

361
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,880
And then

362
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,560
password element

363
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
and then log in

364
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,440
button element.

365
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,920
Okay. So

366
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,280
and then whenever will log in, Right.

367
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,680
So whenever will log in in here

368
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:48,160
once the password,

369
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,600
I forgot the password
but whenever will log in guys,

370
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,040
whenever we log in
we will be landing on the dashboard page.

371
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,240
Right. So. Okay. Thank you.

372
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,640
Let me put this

373
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,960
see. All right.

374
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,360
So whenever we are logged in, right,
so we will be seeing a dashboard page.

375
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,400
So anything we interact
with on the dashboard page,

376
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,640
we will be storing that elements
inside that dashboard page class.

377
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,240
Okay. Is that clear?

378
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:39,440
Got any questions in here?

379
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,040
Okay, good.

380
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,320
All right, so the last one and here

381
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,160
what we will be doing, we will be

382
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,960
performing an actual tests.

383
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,040
Okay?

384
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,760
So this is going to be our test package
where

385
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,320
we will be performing actual actions.

386
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,320
Okay.

387
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,600
So, so now, guys,
if you look in here, so we have

388
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,720
we already know where we are
opening our browser, right?

389
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,360
We know we have common methods in here.

390
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,600
We already have the elements.

391
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,400
The only thing we have to do
is to actually perform actions.

392
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,360
Okay?

393
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,520
So we have elements.

394
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,320
We have opening the browser.

395
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,840
We even have the common methods or
any methods to perform the actions, right?

396
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,720
So the only thing we need to do
is to implement them

397
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,600
inside this test package.

398
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,320
Okay, so let's say
we're, we're doing a log in page

399
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,200
testing, right?

400
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,400
So what we will be doing in here,

401
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,040
we will have a log in page test
class, okay?

402
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,440
And you will perform actions

403
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,480
if your any if you're working on dashboard
page, Right.

404
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,240
So dashboard

405
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,680
a task class and you will be performing

406
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,840
actions in here as well.

407
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,080
Okay.

408
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:22,320
Any questions, guys?

409
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,640
So pages. Yes.

410
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,120
So pages will only store the elements.

411
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:35,200
Okay.

412
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Any other questions
before we move forward?

413
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,120
All right.

414
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,040
Like no questions. Right?

415
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,800
Okay.

416
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,880
So let me minimize this

417
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,440
and let's open up and you

418
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,520
noting here

419
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,720
with class 12, right.

420
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,640
So page object model of this.

421
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:29,440
So yes, seems
kind of unnecessary right now.

422
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,000
Yeah, I guess so.

423
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,120
It will
you'll see how it's going to reduce

424
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,960
your duplication
and it will keep everything organized.

425
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,760
Okay.

426
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,640
So Page object modeler, right

427
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,240
in here.

428
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,320
So basically in here, page
object model is what?

429
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,400
It's a design pattern, right?

430
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,320
Which allows us to

431
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,680
maintain our tests
and reduce the code duplication.

432
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,600
Right.

433
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,040
Is a design

434
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,480
pattern

435
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,920
which allows us to

436
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,080
enhance

437
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,920
maintenance

438
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,280
and reduce

439
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,880
our code duplication.

440
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,520
Okay.

441
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,160
All right.

442
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,600
So the main advantages of the page

443
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:50,520
object model guys are here
as let's put the

444
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,840
Vantage's

445
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,000
page object model in here

446
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,200
first of all, it is code reusability.

447
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,640
Okay, So basically code reusability.

448
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
So let's go back.

449
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,280
Or is that art that I created in here?

450
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,240
Okay.

451
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,840
That basically all the elements, let's say
we have ten,

452
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,080
ten page classes in here.

453
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,080
So basically,
if you identified one element

454
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,800
that can be reusable in different,
different test cases,

455
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,880
you don't have to create
that element again, right? So

456
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,400
in our previous

457
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,800
executions, you can see that, right?

458
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:48,680
So let's see, this is the thing.

459
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,880
But in our previous executions, guys,
if you remember, whenever I am performing

460
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,600
any actions on this web page,
I have to create a main method.

461
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,560
Again, what I have to do, I have to locate
the username and password elements.

462
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,120
Again, I have to launch the browser again.

463
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,480
So everything we're doing again and again

464
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,840
in order to perform
some action later on, right.

465
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
In this case, you won't be doing

466
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,640
you won't be creating your elements
over over again, and you won't be

467
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,040
launching and initializing
your web driver again and again.

468
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,360
Okay.

469
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,200
So the second one is going to be code

470
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,120
maintainability, right?

471
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,600
So this is going to be very easy for you

472
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,080
maintainability.

473
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,880
So this is going to be easier
for you to actually maintain your code

474
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,040
because everything is going
to be organized in separate packages.

475
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,840
So you will be knowing
what's going on and where.

476
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,520
Right.

477
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,320
So if you look in your errors, let's

478
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:13,280
say your no such element exception,
you know what elements is failing

479
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,440
and you already know what page you need
to go and take a look at that element.

480
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,480
Okay.

481
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,680
The other one is the object repository.

482
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,640
Okay. So

483
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,320
as I said, guys, each page will be defined
as a Java class, right?

484
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,640
So we will be keeping each and every page
inside the separate classes.

485
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,920
So so

486
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,320
we will be storing all the elements
inside those

487
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,680
repositories.

488
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,440
So one class for one page

489
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,000
is going to be called repository
in this case.

490
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,440
Okay.

491
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,920
And of course,

492
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,440
the last
one is going to be your readability

493
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,880
where it's going to be really easy
to read your code, really easy

494
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,040
to follow your code, what is going on
and where everything is coming from.

495
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,800
Okay.

496
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,280
But if you look in any of these
so this seems like

497
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,800
everything is a little bit of a spaghetti
in here, right?

498
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,280
So if I'm not, I don't remember
which one we've done.

499
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:31,800
It was pretty.

500
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,880
The thing was this one.

501
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,160
Yeah.

502
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,240
So anything we've done like this guy,

503
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,080
so it looks like it's
a little bit of a spaghetti in here.

504
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,440
So a lot of different code,
a lot of different variables and

505
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,720
a lot of different initial.

506
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,640
These stations again and again.

507
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,320
Right? So.

508
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,520
All right.

509
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:02,880
Okay.

510
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,080
So now, guys, so now how to

511
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,520
actually design, right? So

512
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,240
page object model guys

513
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,840
in order to design the page output model,
there's two ways to do this.

514
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,560
Okay.

515
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,120
So there one way is the page object model.

516
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,280
Without the page factory,
and the other way

517
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,960
is the page object model
with the page factors.

518
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,560
Okay.

519
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,800
And I'm going to go over what page factory
is, how we're going to implement that.

520
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,480
Okay. So

521
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,720
how to

522
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,560
implement, okay,

523
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
a object model

524
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,320
without

525
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,120
page Factory
and the second one page object

526
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,960
model with page 50.

527
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,680
Okay.

528
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,160
All right, guys.

529
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,360
So so

530
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,960
basically,
let me actually put this in here as well.

531
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,200
Page Factory Guys is a simple class

532
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,080
which gives us an opportunity
to interact with

533
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,520
with our stored elements inside
each class.

534
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,160
Okay, So page Factory

535
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,080
is a class

536
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,960
which allows us

537
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,880
to interact with

538
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:45,600
store elements in each class.

539
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,960
Okay, so let's put this in here.

540
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,000
We'll see how this is actually implemented
a little bit later.

541
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,640
Okay? All right.

542
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,240
So now, guys,
what I am going to do, I'm going to start

543
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,320
creating

544
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,720
the packages that

545
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:12,440
I just mentioned in orders
that I think is behind this.

546
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,920
So let's see. Yeah,
I just mentioned in here.

547
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,200
So we will be going over these one by one.

548
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,400
Okay.

549
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,960
So what I am going to do in here,

550
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,080
I'm going to go ahead and

551
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:29,120
create a new package or

552
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,120
that's fine, can have inside the syntax.

553
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,200
So what I will do or create a pages
package.

554
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,600
Okay, then

555
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,280
create a test package.

556
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,720
And what I'm going to do is

557
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,200
utils package

558
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,200
and then

559
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,200
I will do a taste test base package.

560
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,760
Okay. So

561
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,240
now just, just listen for now.

562
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,880
Okay guys,
because I will be jumping all over

563
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,840
all of these packages that I just created
and you will,

564
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,280
you might get confused
whenever I'm doing that.

565
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,360
Okay. All right, guys.

566
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,840
So remember what?

567
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,800
Remember
I told you guys to create two functions

568
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,520
to open and close the browser, Right?

569
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,840
So I hope you guys did this
because we will be using that right now.

570
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,920
Okay,
So what I am going to do in here, I'm

571
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,800
going to I'm going to create a new class

572
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,520
inside my test place.

573
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,720
Okay.

574
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,280
So what I will do and here

575
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,960
I will create a base class

576
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,800
in here.

577
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,680
So this is going to be our baseline.

578
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,800
Okay.

579
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,440
So what I will do, I'll quickly

580
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,480
create to two functions

581
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,560
to open and close the browsers.

582
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,720
Okay?

583
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,600
So what I'm going to do in
here, I'll do let's do public

584
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,760
void right.

585
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
And say open with

586
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,320
specific your.

587
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,120
All right.

588
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:44,200
So if we want to open with specific URL,
where do we want to specify

589
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,360
that URL guys

590
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
as a parameter?

591
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,920
Right. Easy. Right guys.

592
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,160
So what we can do and here we can

593
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,480
have a parameter as a string data
type, right?

594
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,240
Euro. There we go.

595
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,560
So now what I want to do.

596
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,880
So in order for me to open up
a browser, guys,

597
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:36,200
what do I need to do?

598
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,200
So we need to set properties first, right?

599
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,640
So we'll let's go back to any class,
I guess, in here.

600
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,840
Okay, guys.

601
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,160
So we're setting up the properties, right?

602
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,960
So what we're doing,
we open up the browser in here,

603
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,880
we're navigating to the euro.

604
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,120
So these are the three lines of code
that I need here, right?

605
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,160
So I'm setting up the property.

606
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,960
I am initially launching the browser

607
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,520
and I am navigating to the euro, right?

608
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:15,000
So what we can also do, any time
we open up the browser and navigate

609
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,840
to the euro, what we can also do is
we can set an implicit weight

610
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,600
and we can also maximize our window.

611
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,320
Okay, so what I'm going
to do in here, Driver Dot

612
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,080
manage the windows and

613
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,480
maximize this, Okay?

614
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,720
And what I can do, I don't need this
because if I do this, it's

615
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,440
going to open up on the net on this screen
right now.

616
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,840
So and then what we can also do is

617
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,600
driver, let's manage

618
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:58,200
the timeouts right?

619
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,800
Implicit wait for 20 seconds in here.

620
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,720
Right? And

621
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,000
let's go kind of

622
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,800
seconds, Right.

623
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,440
Okay.

624
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,920
So we set up the property, we have the

625
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,600
drivers set up and we have

626
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,080
we maximize our window
and navigate to the URL

627
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,760
and we set the implicit way, right?

628
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,800
So this is how we open
with a specific URL.

629
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,680
So now let's go ahead and

630
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,680
create another method

631
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,120
to tear everything down.

632
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,680
Right?

633
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,640
Okay.

634
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,080
So now, guys,
I want to tear down everything.

635
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,040
You also put this outside the method
that is vertical.

636
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,560
Yeah.

637
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,000
So that's that was my next question, guys.

638
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,880
Since I don't have to write,

639
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,960
I don't want to initialize
my web driver again and again.

640
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,040
What we can do, we can simply go ahead

641
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,760
and put that outside of our methods.

642
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,240
Right.

643
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,200
So public static, right.

644
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,320
Let's try for

645
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,720
driver and here

646
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,080
and what we want to do,
we want to initialize

647
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,520
inside

648
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,560
inside our open was specific zero method

649
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,480
and now in here guys so

650
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,920
in here what I want to do is simply write.

651
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,360
I want to quit my browser.

652
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,040
Right.

653
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,000
But what if guys sometimes

654
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,360
in between our execution

655
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,520
or after we open up the URL
and we initialize our web driver,

656
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,960
sometimes something happens
and our driver gets to.

657
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,400
And now guys, what's going to happen then?

658
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,080
So what if we get another pointer
exception from our driver?

659
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,160
Guys?

660
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,000
Exactly.

661
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,360
So we need to make sure
we need to put a condition

662
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,960
where we check that our driver not null.

663
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,680
Right? So

664
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,400
in here, only when my driver

665
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:41,160
is not now, only

666
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,160
then what I'm going to do,
I'm going to go ahead and

667
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,840
quit my browser.

668
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,600
Okay?

669
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,160
All right.

670
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,320
And let's actually put these

671
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,920
methods as

672
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,720
static methods.

673
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,760
That's fine.

674
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,720
Okay. So now, guys,

675
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,880
does anybody know what this one code

676
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,440
I want to leave a description

677
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,920
of what my my method will do in here.

678
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,520
Okay.

679
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,080
So what I'll what I can put in here.

680
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,040
This method will navigate

681
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,760
to a website

682
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,880
by the given zero.

683
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,120
Right.

684
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,360
Does anybody know what this one is
called? Yes,

685
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,880
it is a comment, but in tech world,

686
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:59,680
you won't be calling this as a comment.

687
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:09,920
It's not an annotation right.

688
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,240
Or let me leave this in here as well.

689
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,640
So this method

690
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,920
will quit

691
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,400
and open

692
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,400
browser right.

693
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,000
Okay, guys.

694
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,560
So this description in here

695
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,800
on top of the methods
that you will be creating

696
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,680
in the future, guys,
it is called a job at the

697
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,160
do not forget this

698
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,040
because you will be using this term a lot
when you find a job.

699
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,880
Okay.

700
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,200
Yep. Java.

701
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,600
Exactly.

702
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,040
Let's put it in here.

703
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,400
Actually it is a window.

704
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay.

705
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:06,960
All right.

706
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:16,240
So any questions on these methods, guys?

707
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,840
Okay, Everything is clear.
All good. Right.

708
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,320
So now what I am going to do

709
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,400
inside my utils package,
I'm going to create another class.

710
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,840
Okay?

711
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:34,600
To create another class in here,
and I will name it as common

712
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,080
methods.

713
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,640
Okay, so this is common methods.

714
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,440
This class will
have all the common methods

715
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,560
that that are reusable for us.

716
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,680
Okay. So

717
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,360
if we have time today, we will be creating

718
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,360
we can create couple of common methods

719
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,560
that we that are reusable in the future.

720
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,200
Okay, So

721
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,680
now, guys in here.

722
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,400
So let's say I have a method and I want to

723
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,800
I want to have an access to the web
driver.

724
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:25,840
Guys, how would I do this in here?

725
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,280
So I am in the common methods.

726
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,760
So what I want to do,
I want to have an access to the web driver

727
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,080
that we initialize interface plus

728
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,480
exactly what we need to do.

729
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,800
We simply need to extend that
class, right?

730
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,360
So what I am going to do extends

731
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,160
space class, right?

732
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,680
So this is the base class
that we have inside our test base, right?

733
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,920
So now whenever we create methods,
if we want to use the driver right inside

734
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,960
our common methods, we already have it
initialized inside the base class.

735
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,480
Okay, so you only initialize
your web driver once in here.

736
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,280
Okay.

737
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:15,720
So you already see in here, guys, that
we are we using the same code already?

738
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,480
So this line of code in here will help us

739
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,920
to initialize the driver in here

740
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,160
and you can reuse this inside our common
methods.

741
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,400
Okay.

742
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:42,320
Any questions on this, guys?

743
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,280
Okay, cool.

744
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,560
All right.

745
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,200
So the point

746
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,640
because okay, so

747
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,560
because common methods
they are considered the methods

748
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,240
on on actual actions on the web elements

749
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,800
in the base class.

750
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,480
You're opening and closing the browser.

751
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Do not performing any actions
on this specific element.

752
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,800
Okay.

753
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:20,360
So, so
your baseline is going to be opening

754
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,680
and closing and your common methods
will indicate the actions

755
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,920
towards the elements on the web page.

756
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,840
Okay.

757
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,640
All right, cool.

758
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,440
Okay, So now let's move to the pages
package.

759
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,280
Okay.

760
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,240
So what I will do in here,
I'll create a new class

761
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,640
and name it as a log in page.

762
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:55,400
Okay, so we have a log in page and here.

763
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,400
Right.

764
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,960
So what I will do.

765
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:03,360
So as I said before,
so all the elements that are

766
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,240
that we
will be interacting on a specific page,

767
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,160
we will be storing them inside

768
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,320
each and each separate class, right?

769
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,080
So right now I need the elements

770
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,080
that I will be interacting
on the log in page.

771
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,000
Okay.

772
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,400
So if I go back in here and let's look out

773
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,720
from here.

774
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,080
So this is my login page.

775
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,200
So there's three different elements
that I want to interact with, right?

776
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,600
So first of all,
what I want to show you in here, guys,

777
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,960
I want to show you the page object model
without the page practice.

778
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,200
Okay?

779
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,800
So what I will be doing in here,
we already know that

780
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,440
we will be interacting with three elements
username, password and log in button.

781
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,320
Right?

782
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,520
So what I will do,
I will start creating those web elements.

783
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,680
Okay, so I'm going to do public

784
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,400
web element

785
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,200
username field is equal to

786
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,440
driver.

787
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,800
Okay, so if I do driver in here guys,
I don't have access to driver.

788
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,800
How would I get access to driver Guys

789
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,320
in here?

790
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:26,680
Okay.

791
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:38,520
Extent What are we extending guys?

792
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,720
Are we extended common methods or we,
we can extend the paste class.

793
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,320
Why common methods and not base class

794
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,440
based class?

795
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,480
Exactly right.

796
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,920
Common methods
have the base class driver as well.

797
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,680
Right.

798
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,440
So if we extend right,
so we if we extend the common methods,

799
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,600
we will have access to web driver
and we will have access to common methods

800
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,040
which we will be performing
throughout the execution.

801
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,520
Right.

802
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,800
So if I go ahead in here, extends

803
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,200
common methods.

804
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,640
We're having access to the base class
and we're having access

805
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,480
to all the common functions
that we will be creating

806
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,760
inside the common methods.

807
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,000
Okay.

808
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,880
Is that clear, guys?

809
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,080
All right, So we have a base class.

810
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,360
We have common methods.

811
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,560
So now we have a page class, right?

812
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,000
So what kind of inheritance am I having in

813
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:04,040
here?

814
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,080
We're having a multi level inheritance.

815
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,560
Right? Exactly.

816
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,440
Very good.

817
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,560
Okay, so how can you achieve
the multiple inheritance guys

818
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,680
with an interface?

819
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,280
Good.

820
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,760
Okay, beautiful.

821
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,680
All right, so let's go back in here.

822
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,560
So now we have an access to driver, right?

823
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,440
So a driver that

824
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,160
find element, right?

825
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,800
So let's inspect

826
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:45,320
this.

827
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,560
We have an idea in here.

828
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:53,440
So grab this idea real quick. I

829
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,400
So this is my this my first element.

830
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,160
So public

831
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,120
web element

832
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,040
password field

833
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,120
is equal to the driver

834
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,280
assigned element by

835
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,920
let's see if we have an idea.

836
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,560
Okay. So

837
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,360
yeah.

838
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,000
Okay.

839
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,880
Then the last element that we need to
have is

840
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,000
logged in button

841
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,720
is equal to driver thought find element.

842
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:49,800
Let's see what we got in here.

843
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,480
We have an ID, so the fact

844
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,680
and pasted into.

845
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,280
Okay, so now guys what we did in
here we stored that elements

846
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,680
only corresponding to the log in page.

847
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,640
Okay so we have a login page class.

848
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,040
We have login page elements

849
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,960
stored inside our login page plus.

850
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,320
Is that clear?

851
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:29,640
Guys, any questions on this?

852
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:36,280
Okay.

853
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,600
All right, good.

854
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,560
Okay, guys.

855
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,880
So now let's go ahead.

856
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,760
No, no, no. For now.

857
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,000
You're still listening, guys.

858
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,920
No, no typing.

859
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,840
Okay, So now, guys, what
I will do in here, So I have a base class.

860
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,240
I have common
methods, and I have the log in page.

861
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,800
So the only thing left for me
is to go ahead

862
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,400
and actually execute

863
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,400
some actions or execute some test case.

864
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,000
Right.

865
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:20,880
So what I will do, I'll create a new class
inside the test package.

866
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,560
Okay.

867
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,240
And I will say log in.

868
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,120
Test.

869
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,800
Okay.

870
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,160
So this is going to be my class in here.

871
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:38,800
So for now, what I'll do,
I will create a main main method in here.

872
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,160
In here
so that we have an execution point.

873
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,440
All right. Okay.

874
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,680
So now, guys, in here,

875
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,800
how do I start my execution?

876
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,640
Guys,

877
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,200
how will I be able to have an access

878
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,560
to the setup
method that we created inside the base

879
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,520
class?

880
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,160
Except
without extending the login page? Guys

881
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,440
create an object.

882
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,840
Do I have to create an object?

883
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,360
And here does

884
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,960
it static. Right?

885
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,920
So since it is a static, what we can do,

886
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,680
you can simply call that method
by the class name.

887
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,520
Right?

888
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,600
So what I will do in here,
I'll go base class

889
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,160
that open with specific URL

890
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,760
and inside this is

891
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,440
what I will do.

892
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,160
Where is that?

893
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,240
You are located right here

894
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,120
and inside the parameters

895
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,320
it's going to accept one argument.

896
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,440
So one line of code where

897
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,440
we're setting up the properties, we're
launching the browser

898
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,400
and we're navigating to this specific URL
that we just mentioned in here.

899
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,600
Right? Okay.

900
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:18,880
So now what I want to do,
I want to perform some actions, right?

901
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,880
In order for me to perform some actions,

902
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,120
I need access to the elements.

903
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,680
Right?

904
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,720
So how do I have an access
to an element in here? Guys

905
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,080
passing books in alphabetical order.

906
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,840
Yeah.

907
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,320
So it's basically we're keeping everything
organized as much as possible, right?

908
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:53,000
So extending common methods,
I need access to my elements, guys.

909
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,640
So to the elements
that I will be performing actions

910
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,160
call.

911
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,160
We don't have methods, right?

912
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,720
I just need access to these elements.

913
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,960
Guys, how do I have access
to these elements from this page

914
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:26,640
for from this log in text,
we simply need to create an object, right?

915
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,320
So in into test
actually guys, in test page

916
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:37,080
in test classes, guys,
you won't be extending anything.

917
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,760
Okay.

918
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,480
So you will need to create an object

919
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,520
of a certain page, page class

920
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,920
so that you can use it
inside your actions.

921
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:49,920
Okay.

922
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,960
So what I will do in here, log in page.

923
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,920
Right. Log in

924
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,920
page is equal to new

925
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,440
log in page. Right.

926
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,520
So we created an object of that class.

927
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,960
So now we have access
to those elements, Right?

928
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,480
So what can do in here?

929
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,120
Login page that username field

930
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,000
that send keys

931
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,120
and I will be sending my

932
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,560
username right.

933
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,200
The second thing we want to do
is log in page

934
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,440
dot password field,

935
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,520
send keys and I'll be sending my password,

936
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,240
which is this weird thing in here right?

937
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:42,840
And the last thing we want to do in here
is to access my log

938
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,080
in button and simply
go ahead and click this.

939
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,000
Okay.

940
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
And after we click right.

941
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,400
So we won't be verifying anything for now.

942
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,320
But what we can do will be simply

943
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,200
closing that browser.

944
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,920
Pretty cool, right, guys?

945
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,480
So six line of codes in here
and you have access, you are opening

946
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,040
the browser, you are performing
a lot of actions in here

947
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,560
and you're closing everything, right?

948
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,560
Pretty clean
and pretty organized in here, right?

949
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,480
So you have four different classes
and you can perform a lot of actions,

950
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,120
right?

951
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:29,280
So let's now run this and see if

952
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,920
if we can have some good

953
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:46,800
outcome in here.

954
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,360
All right.

955
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,200
Opened there.

956
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,360
So you happened very, very fast. Right?

957
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,480
So it inserted the username and password.

958
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:01,240
It clicked on log in
and then it quit the browser right.

959
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,600
All right, guys, any questions on this?

960
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,640
Any questions on the on the design?

961
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,160
Any questions on any of what we've done

962
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:23,160
on the first half guys?

963
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:29,120
Why do we have these separate packages
to keep everything organized nice, right?

964
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,280
So you keep everything organized
so that you don't duplicate,

965
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:38,520
okay, You don't duplicate
and you won't be reusing a lot of stuff.

966
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,600
All right?

967
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,600
So if you can see in keep here,
you initialize your web driver

968
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,000
only once in base class
and you can use this in logging task.

969
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,880
You can use this
in common methods in the future

970
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,840
and you can use this in log
in page a class.

971
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,480
Right. So

972
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,600
this is very useful for you

973
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:03,960
to reduce the duplication and

974
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:11,560
to keep everything organized.

975
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,880
Look at different test cases.

976
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,040
We keep adding them to the same package
and different class.

977
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,800
Absolutely right. Yes.

978
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,240
So if you're working on a different page,
Right.

979
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,040
So you're going to add
a different page in here

980
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,520
and you're going to add the different page
test in here.

981
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:38,480
Okay.

982
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,960
So if we could keep that organized.

983
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,560
So you need to know the basics
of that action

984
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,880
with selenium
right after this, your you will be

985
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,640
you will be good to go
with creating everything.

986
01:01:53,040 --> 01:02:00,080
Okay.

987
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,840
I'll show you guys how to do this
with Page Factory, and I'll show

988
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,240
you guys how to have different

989
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
classes in here as well.

990
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:20,480
Okay.

991
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,320
Yes, we we'll have more examples.

992
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,600
We will have more examples for now, guys.

993
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:39,960
Any questions?

994
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,600
Yeah, if if no questions.

995
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,400
I'm planning to give a break, guys.

996
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:52,440
So let's see.

997
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,160
This seems like no other
questions so far, right?

998
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,680
So if no questions,

999
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,360
let's have a break until 825.

1000
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,320
All right.

1001
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:07,720
So it's 808 right now.

1002
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,680
So let's have a like 17 minute break.

1003
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,400
Yeah, that's

1004
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,160
sharp.

1005
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,840
You can type in your question in here.

1006
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,160
That's fine.

1007
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,200
Common methods class.

1008
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:35,160
It's empty right now.

1009
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:35,520
All right.

1010
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,200
Guess I will see you at 825.

1011
01:03:40,320 --> 01:20:10,520
Okay.

1012
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,320
All right, guys.

1013
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:47,160
So let's get back.

1014
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:51,400
Yes, that's good advice from from Zambia.

1015
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:54,960
Try, try and catch in that case
because that

1016
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,040
that's

1017
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,480
that's a random website, right?

1018
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,560
It's not going to happen every time.

1019
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,320
I think

1020
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,400
try, try, try and catch

1021
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:10,080
and see if you will be able to handle the

1022
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,200
right.

1023
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:30,720
All right, guys.

1024
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:34,320
So let's get back to the page
object model now.

1025
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,160
Right. Okay.

1026
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,800
So we went over the packages,

1027
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,000
the pages task test phase and utils

1028
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,400
and went over the page

1029
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,160
object model without the factory.

1030
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,480
Okay, so now what

1031
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,520
I will do, I'll show you the

1032
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,560
what page factory is
and how to implement the page

1033
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,640
object model with page factory.

1034
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,480
Okay.

1035
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:11,960
So what

1036
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:17,000
I am going to do right now,
I'm going to create a new Java class

1037
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,480
inside the pages, okay?

1038
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,640
And I'll name it as

1039
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,920
log in page

1040
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:33,160
with a factory.

1041
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:33,680
Okay.

1042
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,800
And for us,

1043
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:42,600
in order to get to the access to,
the driver, what we need to do,

1044
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,000
we need to extend the common methods

1045
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:53,160
right.

1046
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:56,040
Okay. So

1047
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:02,320
let's see.

1048
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:02,560
All right.

1049
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:03,960
I guess so.

1050
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:07,240
For the page factor, you guys.

1051
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,200
So it's going to be a little bit

1052
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,240
of a different syntax in here
that we would've seen before.

1053
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,600
Okay.

1054
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:18,200
So what we are going to be doing in here,

1055
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,920
So we're going to be using a page factory
class,

1056
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,680
which is an invoice
built page object model concept, okay.

1057
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,800
For for the web
Java that we're using right now.

1058
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,160
But it is very, very opt.

1059
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:35,680
Okay.

1060
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:39,560
So for us,
in order to use a page factory class,

1061
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:43,320
we will be using annotations at find

1062
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,480
by okay to locate the elements.

1063
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,560
So at sign by annotation

1064
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,840
will help us to locate
and identify the elements.

1065
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:59,440
And before guys,
if if you see in here what we used to do,

1066
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,720
we used to have driver
that find element, right?

1067
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:08,520
And then we were specifying
what we're identifying that element by.

1068
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,960
Right. So instead of doing this

1069
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:17,200
in page Factory
we will be using sign by annotation.

1070
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,000
Okay.

1071
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,920
And I will show you how this is done.

1072
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:27,000
Okay, so let's say we are automating

1073
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,240
the same page
as we have done in the previous example.

1074
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:36,120
But right now I will be identify, find
those elements and no bit of a different.

1075
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,960
Okay, so what I will do in here,
I will start

1076
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,320
by my annotation of find by.

1077
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:49,520
Okay, I'll put a sign by
so I'll open and close the parentheses.

1078
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:50,320
Okay.

1079
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,600
So what I am doing
and here I am trying to,

1080
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:58,640
I'm trying to locate
my username, my username

1081
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,320
textbox in here. So

1082
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,240
what I will do.

1083
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:10,080
So signed by annotation,
I open and close the parentheses.

1084
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:16,320
So now inside the parentheses I need
to specify the locator that I am using.

1085
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,960
Okay. So for the username.

1086
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,760
For the username textbox
we were using ID right.

1087
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,440
Which was equal to the

1088
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:30,440
let me get this

1089
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:33,600
here, which was equal to this.

1090
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:34,560
Okay.

1091
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,800
So once we've done this,
so now what we need to do,

1092
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,840
we need to simply have web element
variable.

1093
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,480
Okay, So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to do public

1094
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:52,680
web element.

1095
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,320
Okay.

1096
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,960
And I will do

1097
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,240
username.

1098
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,960
Thank you. Okay.

1099
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,360
So this is how we will be

1100
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,280
locating the elements from now on.

1101
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,160
Okay.

1102
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,160
So find by annotation your

1103
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:12,160
your locator, the value of the locator,

1104
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:17,600
and then you need to come up with a name
for your variable.

1105
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,760
Okay. Is that clear? Guys?

1106
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:26,160
Any questions?

1107
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:31,800
This is how we will be storing it.

1108
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,800
Yes. All the all the locators work too.

1109
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,920
I will be showing them one by.

1110
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:49,200
Okay.

1111
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,560
By username I.D..

1112
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:58,680
I haven't seen that one before.

1113
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,920
Okay. All right.

1114
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:06,440
So, okay,
so identify the username textbox.

1115
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,840
Okay, so what I am going to do now,

1116
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:14,040
I will be identifying my password.

1117
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,600
TextBox. Okay.

1118
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:20,760
So again, find by annotation
in here, open and close parentheses.

1119
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,080
So this time, instead of using that ID,
let's use the Exfat.

1120
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,680
Okay, so I'll put the Xbox in here.

1121
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,800
Equal sign

1122
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:36,800
and I will need to insert
that Xbox in here.

1123
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,920
Okay, so let me grab

1124
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,120
let's see.

1125
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,600
Okay, so the input tag in here.

1126
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,400
So let's come up with the x path.

1127
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,360
One input tag

1128
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:54,560
and use an ID here

1129
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,280
equal to

1130
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:02,160
this.

1131
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,720
Okay. There we go.

1132
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:07,840
So we can copy this
and I'll paste it in here.

1133
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,360
Okay.

1134
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:13,040
So once pasted in here,
what you need to do,

1135
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:17,680
you need to come up with
just the variable.

1136
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:21,720
Okay.

1137
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,840
All right. Any questions on this? Guess

1138
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:33,400
no questions.

1139
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:33,720
Yeah.

1140
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:38,560
So this one, this one seems more clean
and organized, right?

1141
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:41,960
Instead of doing this

1142
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,720
every time driver find alignment.

1143
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,760
This kind of looks
like a spaghetti as well.

1144
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:51,120
But if you look at this one, it's
a little bit different

1145
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,760
and a bit organized, right?

1146
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,360
So let's identify our

1147
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,400
last element in here.

1148
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,640
So again, signed by annotation,
open and close parentheses.

1149
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:12,640
So now this time, let's see
if we can generate a CSF selector in here.

1150
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:17,160
Okay, so let me delete this

1151
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:20,840
for the log in button.

1152
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:24,520
We have an idea
what was the shortcut for IDE for CSS

1153
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,240
Selectric us

1154
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:35,760
tag the pound.

1155
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:36,680
Right?

1156
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,480
And then the value of the idea.

1157
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,600
So we have input this and this one.

1158
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:46,560
There we go.

1159
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,920
So we found this. So this is our success.

1160
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:51,400
So now let's go back in here.

1161
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:56,080
The simply and here
I need to specify my locator

1162
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:01,120
what I am going to do instead of typing
in that whole system, select a thing.

1163
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:04,280
What I'll do, I'll just do
CCed is equal to

1164
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:09,480
and then I'll just paste
in here and I'll save public

1165
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,960
web element

1166
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,240
log in button

1167
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:21,280
right.

1168
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:21,840
Okay.

1169
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,320
So this is how we will be

1170
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,720
storing our web elements from now on.

1171
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,560
Okay.

1172
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,560
So we won't be doing any drive
or find element.

1173
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,520
We won't be doing any find elements.

1174
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:39,640
We will be using ET
find by annotate options.

1175
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:41,160
Okay.

1176
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:51,120
Is that clear, guys, Any questions?

1177
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,520
Driver It is ne.

1178
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:57,280
Eat it. Okay.

1179
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,200
So I'm coming to that point right now
with this driver.

1180
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:12,400
We will need.

1181
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:17,520
Okay, so now, guys, this is

1182
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,520
this is the required way.

1183
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,920
Okay,
so this is not a preferred way, guys.

1184
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:23,560
Okay?

1185
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:27,160
So whenever you have,

1186
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:30,600
whenever you have a framework in place,

1187
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,880
you will be using this

1188
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,800
this format of locating the elements.

1189
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,120
Okay.

1190
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,680
So now, guys,
what I am going to do in here.

1191
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,880
So what we did in here?

1192
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,120
We just located the elements.

1193
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:58,200
Okay, So what we didn't do in here,
what if it's a dropdown?

1194
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,000
The dropdown is still an element, right?

1195
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,640
So you can, you can simply identify
an element with this.

1196
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:10,800
Right guys.

1197
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,840
So dropdown is still an element.

1198
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,280
So you have to, you have to locate that

1199
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,680
element first in order to interact
with a dropdown.

1200
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:33,480
Right.

1201
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,400
Okay.

1202
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,000
All right guys.

1203
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,040
So what we are doing in here guys,

1204
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:42,120
we're just creating third.

1205
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:45,200
But what we need to do in here,

1206
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:48,600
we need to initialize these variables.

1207
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:50,720
Okay? So

1208
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:53,400
if you look in here,

1209
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:57,200
this driver find element
what it's going to do, it's

1210
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,960
going to initialize your element
automatically.

1211
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:01,680
Okay?

1212
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:05,200
But when we're using the find
by annotation,

1213
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,120
you will have to use page factory class

1214
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,120
to initialize those elements.

1215
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:14,800
Okay. So how we're going to be doing this?

1216
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:21,120
So in Java guys, what do you use
to initialize the the variables?

1217
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:24,520
Guys in your class

1218
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,160
Now what do you use
in order to initialize?

1219
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:45,720
What is the thing
that helps us to initialize

1220
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:51,920
the variables?

1221
01:33:51,920 --> 01:34:07,040
Any variable guys in in Java?

1222
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,800
What concept would I say?

1223
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,320
Not not equal sign or anything.

1224
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:14,520
What, what concept?

1225
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:18,040
So let's say
I have a private variables in my class.

1226
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:23,680
Okay, so how would I initialize those

1227
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,600
encapsulation closer.

1228
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:40,200
Okay.

1229
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,960
My constructor. There we go.

1230
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,080
Absolutely right. We

1231
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:47,640
constructor to

1232
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,600
initiate initialize our variables.

1233
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:52,400
Right.

1234
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,520
So now what I am going to do

1235
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:00,520
guys, I am going to create a default
constructor in here.

1236
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:06,240
I hope you guys remember
what constructor is right in Java.

1237
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,320
So what I'll do and here I'll do public

1238
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,160
log in with Page Factory, right?

1239
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:19,080
And now this is my constructor.

1240
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:24,000
So inside my constructor,
in order for me to initialize

1241
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,080
all the variables inside this class,
I will be using Page Factory.

1242
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,200
Okay, so what? I will.

1243
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:35,360
I'll simply go type in page Factory dot

1244
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:41,280
and you can see that
there are some overloaded methods.

1245
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:45,000
Okay, so I'll use this method

1246
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:48,680
which is which is X expecting us

1247
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,640
to different arguments.

1248
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:53,800
Okay.

1249
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:57,000
So the first argument is

1250
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:00,120
we need to specify what

1251
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,360
is the object that we we will

1252
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,840
initializing everything.

1253
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:09,160
Okay, so what is the object that will

1254
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:11,400
initialize all our elements? Guys

1255
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:22,560
in selenium, it's a driver, right?

1256
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:27,000
So what I will do,
I'll simply put a driver in here.

1257
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:30,040
So the second argument that we need to

1258
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,120
pass is which

1259
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:38,120
what variables
we want to initialize, right?

1260
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,680
Or which page of the

1261
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:46,640
which variables
and which page we want to initialize.

1262
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,400
Right. So

1263
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:51,960
and in the second argument,

1264
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:55,720
we can simply pass this.

1265
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:59,120
Okay, so what we're doing
and here we're initializing

1266
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:02,160
the elements
by the given work driver in here

1267
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:05,440
and we're initializing the elements

1268
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,560
of this specific page.

1269
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,600
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

1270
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:30,440
Any questions?

1271
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:33,720
Okay, good.

1272
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:38,480
All right. So.

1273
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,040
So now we initialized everything.

1274
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:44,080
So now let's go ahead and

1275
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,840
start the actual testing.

1276
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,960
Right.

1277
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,200
So let me.

1278
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,400
So what I am going to do, let me open up

1279
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,680
a new Java class right

1280
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:03,840
in Java class and say

1281
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:09,440
log in, log in, Test where?

1282
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:20,320
Page two.

1283
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,400
Okay. Main method in here.

1284
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:33,480
So what do we need to do in here
now, guys?

1285
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,880
So I have my main method.

1286
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,920
What is my next step

1287
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:42,960
constructor?

1288
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:46,240
So any
I want to start a test guys in here.

1289
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:49,080
Okay, so we need.

1290
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,720
Okay, so we need to call

1291
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,120
the setting up the method, right?

1292
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:59,160
So what I will do

1293
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,760
based class, the set up

1294
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,560
or was that open.

1295
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,920
Right, open, open
with specific URL in here

1296
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:13,040
and what we are going to do

1297
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,640
is going to be using the same URL

1298
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,800
paste this in here.

1299
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,080
Right?

1300
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:27,920
So now how am I getting access to the

1301
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:34,080
to the elements inside this log
in page with page factor, You guys

1302
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,720
create an object, right?

1303
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,720
Okay, so let's create an object login page

1304
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:54,680
and we can say,

1305
01:39:54,680 --> 01:39:58,440
okay, that's fine is equal to new

1306
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,200
log in page session.

1307
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,560
Right? Okay.

1308
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:04,200
All right. So we have an object.

1309
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:07,560
We have access to all the

1310
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,520
all the elements,
which is in that specific page.

1311
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:15,120
So now what I need to do in here,

1312
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,120
I need to simply

1313
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,120
go ahead and perform my actions. Right.

1314
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:26,040
So this is admin.

1315
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:28,800
This is going to be the password

1316
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,200
right?

1317
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:43,320
And here what I need to do,

1318
01:40:45,160 --> 01:40:48,480
I need to simply click okay.

1319
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:52,480
The now we clicked with perform action we

1320
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:58,400
we we entered username password
we clicked on log in button.

1321
01:40:58,680 --> 01:40:59,000
Right.

1322
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:06,600
So what I want to do now
I want to go ahead and take a screenshot.

1323
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:07,200
Okay.

1324
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:12,440
So I want to take a screenshot in here
and then what I want to do.

1325
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:28,760
So let's actually log in here quick.

1326
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:35,440
Now, is this the password

1327
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:39,040
should be the

1328
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:43,800
password right?

1329
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:47,720
And then.

1330
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:50,720
Okay. All right.

1331
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:54,880
So what I want to do,
I want to get this text in here.

1332
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,760
I want to print it out in my console

1333
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,160
and then I want

1334
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:02,800
close the browser.

1335
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,600
Okay.

1336
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:06,640
So now, guys,

1337
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,400
what screenshots

1338
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,520
you will be doing that later on

1339
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:17,280
when you start with an framework,
guys, you will be doing that later on,

1340
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:23,120
but we'll see if we can create a method
for some other actions today.

1341
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:24,480
If have time.

1342
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:27,720
Okay.

1343
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,160
All right, guys.

1344
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,800
So here
I want to take a screenshot in here.

1345
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,360
What do I need to do?

1346
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,800
What do we use
in order to take a screenshot?

1347
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:51,560
Guys?

1348
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:54,400
Okay. Creating take screenshot. Okay.

1349
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:55,320
What is it?

1350
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:56,760
Is it a class or what?

1351
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,040
What is it,
guys? It's an interface, right.

1352
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,080
So we need to downcast it to driver.

1353
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,600
Okay, very good. Okay.

1354
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:09,560
So take screenshots this is equal to so

1355
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:14,360
take screenshot. So

1356
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,200
there we go.

1357
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,360
So how do I access that driver.

1358
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:19,680
Guys in here

1359
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:31,600
we can simply go with base class, right?

1360
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:37,960
Race class driver
because this driver is a static variable

1361
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:41,360
so we don't have to create an object
of that class.

1362
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,160
Right. Any questions on this, guys?

1363
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:50,640
Is everyone clear on this?

1364
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,080
Okay, good.

1365
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,200
All right, so now what

1366
01:43:55,200 --> 01:44:01,440
we need to do, need to get the screenshot
and we need to have a file on hand.

1367
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:02,120
Right?

1368
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:05,960
So get screenshot as

1369
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:11,400
the output of a file.

1370
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:11,800
Right.

1371
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:15,920
And then what we're going to have,
we will actually have

1372
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:19,800
a source file on hand for you.

1373
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:23,320
So let's import this class.

1374
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,120
Okay.

1375
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:32,040
So now, guys, what we need to do,
we need to simply copy and paste

1376
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:34,840
right.

1377
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,920
Let me take a look at the screenshots.
Okay?

1378
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,520
So we've got them in here.

1379
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,520
So what I am going to do is file

1380
01:44:44,440 --> 01:44:46,320
utils, right?

1381
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,280
I'm going to copy

1382
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:50,600
copy the file.

1383
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:51,160
Right.

1384
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:56,360
So what is the file that I'm copying
is the source file.

1385
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:57,560
Right.

1386
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,240
And I'm going to make a new file in here

1387
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:05,400
and I will specify the destination.

1388
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:05,880
Right.

1389
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:10,480
So this destination
is going to be our screenshots folder.

1390
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:14,360
So let's create another folder here,

1391
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:18,640
which is our mass,
which is our project name, right?

1392
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:22,440
And then what we can say

1393
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:27,400
we can name it as Dashboard dot PNG

1394
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,680
and then we can surround this

1395
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:34,480
with try and catch

1396
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,280
more actions.

1397
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:40,760
Okay, So okay,

1398
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:45,440
so we're going to surround this with

1399
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,240
try and catch, right?

1400
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:50,760
So now guys, what I want to do,

1401
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,520
I want to once with logged in

1402
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,120
once we took this screenshot,

1403
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:00,080
what I need to do is I need to go ahead

1404
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:04,520
and get this text in here
and print it out in my console.

1405
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:20,280
How would I do this
now, what would be my next step

1406
01:46:25,880 --> 01:46:26,800
exactly?

1407
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,840
We need to create a dashboard page
class first.

1408
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:34,360
Why Are we doing this guys?

1409
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:37,360
Why do we need to create a dashboard page

1410
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:41,400
class?

1411
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:43,680
Organize? Okay,

1412
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:47,160
so we can sort the elements

1413
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:47,840
but can't?

1414
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,200
Can we just store them inside
login page guys

1415
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,680
because it's a different page?

1416
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:57,760
Absolutely. Right.

1417
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:01,240
So we are locating a different pages

1418
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,320
element right now, Right?

1419
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:08,520
So what I am going to do in here
inside the pages

1420
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,600
package, I will create a new class

1421
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:15,280
which is called a

1422
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,480
dashboard page.

1423
01:47:19,480 --> 01:47:22,360
Okay, so

1424
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,920
let's refactored this

1425
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:35,000
dashboard page in here.

1426
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:35,880
Right.

1427
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:40,120
So now I need to locate that element.

1428
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:44,240
So let's go back in here
and start inspecting this page.

1429
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,240
Okay, So let's go in here.

1430
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:52,200
Let's see what we got.

1431
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:56,880
So we have an ID in here,
so we might as well use this, Right?

1432
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,480
So go back and again, guys.

1433
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,680
Now, Driver, find elements in here.

1434
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:07,160
What we're starting with,
we starting with find by annotation

1435
01:48:07,640 --> 01:48:11,080
open and close parentheses I.D locator

1436
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:13,240
and then

1437
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:20,320
the pasted value
and we just create a variable here, right?

1438
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:24,240
So you say, well I'm

1439
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:29,560
so now once I did this class,
what is my next step?

1440
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:43,880
What am I missing in here right now?

1441
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:45,480
Okay, that's a good point.

1442
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:48,480
We're missing a s we're

1443
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,600
missing
two extra and the common methods, right?

1444
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,120
Because we need

1445
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,600
we need access to the work driver.

1446
01:48:58,480 --> 01:48:58,840
Right.

1447
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:07,800
What else, guys?

1448
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,280
We're missing a constructor, right?

1449
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:13,080
We need to initialize those elements.

1450
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,040
Right.

1451
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:17,520
Okay, So let's create a

1452
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:23,360
constructor in here.

1453
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:23,720
Okay?

1454
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:32,120
And then let's use the page factory,

1455
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:35,520
initialize the elements with our driver

1456
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:40,080
and that elements from this specific page.

1457
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:41,480
Right.

1458
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,920
Any questions, guys?

1459
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,040
I hope all clear
everything is going organize

1460
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:50,560
right.

1461
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,320
Okay, so
now we have this element stored in here.

1462
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:59,040
So now what I need to do,
I need to go back to my actual tests.

1463
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,400
Right? So

1464
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:03,040
for me,

1465
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:08,360
in order for me to have access
to that specific element, what

1466
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:14,400
what do I need to do?

1467
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:18,960
I need to create an object
of the dashboard page, right?

1468
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:22,680
So I'm going to create here just in case.

1469
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:26,160
Right. Dashboard page.

1470
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:33,200
You can see dashboard page in here,
new dashboard page.

1471
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:34,200
All right.

1472
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:38,040
So after we take the screenshot,
what I want to do,

1473
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:43,600
I want to get the text

1474
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:48,840
and it's going to give me a strange value,
right?

1475
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:53,040
So text is equal to this.

1476
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:55,000
And then

1477
01:50:55,520 --> 01:51:00,480
what I'm going to do,
I'm going to print that out.

1478
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:04,320
And once I did this, what I will do,

1479
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:09,040
I will simply go ahead and

1480
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,360
tear down the browser.

1481
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,960
Okay.

1482
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:23,920
Any questions
before I run this, guys? Yes.

1483
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:26,640
That's why I said guys don't type, right?

1484
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:27,840
Because I told you guys

1485
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:30,480
I'm going to be creating a lot of packages
and a lot of classes.

1486
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,240
So I'll be moving inside of that.

1487
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:37,840
Okay, So let me run

1488
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:42,720
and let's see if we have printed

1489
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,440
they welcome text
and we have the screenshots.

1490
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,880
Oh, why is this event happening in here?

1491
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:54,000
Okay, so it happened on this train, guys.

1492
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,320
Okay, so we can see this
welcome admin in here.

1493
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,120
Okay.

1494
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:04,560
And let me expand this.

1495
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:05,280
Okay.

1496
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,720
So if I expand my screenshots,

1497
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:11,760
you can see that
I have two different folders.

1498
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,320
One of them is our maps,
which we just created.

1499
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:19,120
And if I expand this
you can see the dashboard PNG.

1500
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,080
If I click on this, you can see

1501
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:24,720
the screenshot in here.

1502
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:31,040
Okay, any questions, guys?

1503
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,720
Who was having any confusion is guys

1504
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:41,520
okay?

1505
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,080
Pretty cool. Yeah. Right.

1506
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:44,760
So everything is organized.

1507
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:49,680
Everything has its own place,
guys, so you don't have to

1508
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,240
make everything mix

1509
01:52:52,240 --> 01:53:01,320
right? Yes.

1510
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:05,880
So from now on, guys, from now on,
I think you guys covered

1511
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:09,760
how many classes of tests You guys

1512
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:12,320
two. Right.

1513
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:12,720
Okay.

1514
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:16,480
So I think I'm not sure how many tests
and classes you're going to have,

1515
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:21,360
but you will you will be using this object
model through

1516
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:24,720
the end of the course.

1517
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:25,840
Okay.

1518
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:28,560
Words, APIs with

1519
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:31,400
with test engine,
with Cucumber, with sequel.

1520
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:33,080
Everything

1521
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:36,480
okay.

1522
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,760
Just one class
remaining for theoretical part.

1523
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:39,720
Okay, good.

1524
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:42,160
So after that, you start developing.

1525
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,640
After that
I think you will be covering Maven

1526
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:47,520
and then you start building
your framework.

1527
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:48,920
Okay?

1528
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:52,560
So once you build your framework,
you will have this page

1529
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:57,600
object model design,
You will have MAVEN included in there.

1530
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:59,640
So it's going to be pretty cool guys.

1531
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:04,560
Okay.

1532
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:08,440
And then at the very end
you will have a very, very solid,

1533
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:25,280
solid framework on hand.

1534
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:36,480
All right, guys, any questions on this?

1535
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:39,200
Any questions on how to implement,

1536
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,480
implement page object model?

1537
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:45,440
Any questions on what it is?

1538
01:54:45,440 --> 01:55:16,680
Any confusion, guys?

1539
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:18,280
Well, you just need to practice. Okay.

1540
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:22,440
If it's if it's confusing at first, it's
okay, guys.

1541
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:26,400
You just need to take a look at the code
and everything and all the packages.

1542
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,680
One more time when I push the code.

1543
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:35,200
Okay,
So that's going to be more clear for you.

1544
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:40,920
Lines 2025 228 Oh, here.

1545
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:46,080
Okay, So once we take the screenshot,
we'll have a file on hand.

1546
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,040
Right.

1547
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:51,080
So what I need to do with this file,
I need to copy that file

1548
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:54,400
and I need to store it somewhere.

1549
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,040
Okay.

1550
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:59,800
So basically what I'm doing,
I'm copying this file and storing

1551
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:04,200
this as PNG g inside the mess folder.

1552
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:15,240
Okay, test for dashboard page.

1553
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:21,280
We need to repeat all code for log in.

1554
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,800
Oh, for now. For now.

1555
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,600
You have to repeat that. Yes.

1556
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:28,360
So now you have to repeat the log in page

1557
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:34,080
what's called log in test
or what you can do.

1558
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,240
You can create a method which logs in

1559
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:40,640
so you can create a method which logs

1560
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:43,560
in to this specific your row

1561
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:47,640
and then after that, perform that perform
any other actions you want.

1562
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:54,320
Okay, so the exception.

1563
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,760
So basically
when you copy the file, right.

1564
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:03,000
So it it might throw you
an input output exception

1565
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,800
because what you're doing
you taking the screenshot, you grabbing it

1566
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,920
and you're
pasting this inside your project.

1567
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:13,600
Right. So it might throw you an exception.

1568
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:17,600
So that's why we are,

1569
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:20,760
that's why we are surrounding it
by try and catch

1570
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,920
our common methods.

1571
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,600
Class is empty, guys.

1572
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:47,000
We don't have anything in here.

1573
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,480
Oh, y it might.

1574
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:50,960
Okay, so it might throw an exception.

1575
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:56,520
Okay, so let's open this.

1576
01:57:56,520 --> 01:58:01,040
What?

1577
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:01,440
Okay,

1578
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,120
so it might.

1579
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:06,800
So you can see that in here, right?

1580
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:10,640
So you can see
it might throw an input output exception.

1581
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:13,800
So what we are doing in here, you're

1582
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:20,320
you're trying to get a new file
and, you're trying to input it

1583
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,840
inside your project.

1584
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:25,800
So if something goes wrong, Right.

1585
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:30,840
So if you can't copy
or if you can't create that file

1586
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:33,800
or if you can't get the screenshot

1587
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:39,240
and you're trying to copy
non-existing resistant thing,

1588
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:42,520
only then it will throw you
in an exception.

1589
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:43,600
Okay?

1590
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:46,320
So that's why you have to surround that.

1591
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:59,760
You have to surround that
with try and catch.

1592
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:00,240
All right.

1593
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:10,760
Any other questions, guys?

1594
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:12,840
Okay. Seems like no other questions.

1595
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:17,280
So what we can do
now, guys, we can go to our common methods

1596
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:22,200
and we can create couple of common methods
that you guys

1597
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:29,600
can reuse, reuse
during your project or during

1598
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,000
what's called after you

1599
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:40,640
build the framework.

1600
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:43,640
Okay. So

1601
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:53,040
the whole process of what

1602
01:59:58,040 --> 01:59:58,800
which process

1603
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:03,800
do you want me to repeat?

1604
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,880
Oh, page object model.

1605
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:08,640
Okay, sure.

1606
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:11,160
So let's see in here.

1607
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:14,680
Okay, so as I said, page object model is

1608
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,520
is a design pattern, right?

1609
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:21,360
So it helps you to

1610
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:25,360
to enhance the taste test maintenance

1611
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:29,280
and the

1612
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,720
code, the application,

1613
02:00:32,120 --> 02:00:34,800
the whole process, the example

1614
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:39,600
you're talking about,

1615
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:44,080
the last example, this one.

1616
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:46,560
Okay. Okay, sure.

1617
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:47,360
All right.

1618
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,160
So in here, what we're doing first, guys,

1619
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:54,720
whenever you start automating
and you have a page

1620
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:58,400
object model, you have a base class,
you have common methods, right?

1621
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:04,320
So what you need to do is
you need to create a page class, right?

1622
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:06,320
Because you need
to store everything in there.

1623
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:08,400
You need to store all

1624
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:12,240
the elements in here by

1625
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:14,200
by annotation of find, by,

1626
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:19,360
and by having a constructor to initialize
all the elements.

1627
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:21,840
Right? By using the page practice.

1628
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:24,920
So once you have done this,
what you need to do

1629
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:27,360
is you need to create a

1630
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:33,240
test class widget which is going to be
under your test package, right?

1631
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:36,720
So and then you will start
to perform actions.

1632
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:40,800
So right now we have this opening
with that specific URL

1633
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:43,320
and then what we have in here,

1634
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:46,920
we create the object

1635
02:01:46,920 --> 02:01:50,520
of that class
that we have created for pages, right?

1636
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:53,400
And we stored all our elements in there.

1637
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:56,680
So now we have access to all the elements.

1638
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,040
We can perform actions by sending keys

1639
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:03,280
and then by clicking on the log in button.

1640
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:04,480
Right?

1641
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:10,320
So after we're logged, then what happens
is we want to take a screenshot right?

1642
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,400
So we take a screenshot.

1643
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:16,960
So now what I want to do,
I want to interact with the welcome

1644
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,320
element, but

1645
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:23,160
this element is on the dashboard
page, right?

1646
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:29,200
So now since this element
is on a different page, what I need to do,

1647
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:34,320
I need to go ahead and create another page
class, okay?

1648
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:38,120
So that I can store that element
in that class separately.

1649
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:41,640
So I started this by ADD
signed by annotation.

1650
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:45,720
Again, I have my constructor

1651
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:51,120
and then what I need to do,
I need to go back to my task class.

1652
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:52,160
Okay?

1653
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:55,640
So in order
for me to have access for that,

1654
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:59,600
I need to create an object again
for that dashboard page.

1655
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:02,360
So I have access.

1656
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:06,120
I get the text in here
and I store it in a string,

1657
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:10,160
I print it out,
and then I close the browser, make

1658
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:18,240
sure.

1659
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:18,760
All right.

1660
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:26,040
Any other questions, guys?

1661
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:48,760
The paint.

1662
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:52,000
All right, let's see
if there are any other questions before

1663
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,520
we move to to developing

1664
02:03:57,440 --> 02:03:59,640
some common

1665
02:03:59,640 --> 02:04:11,160
methods.

1666
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:13,240
Open the dashboard

1667
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:52,360
or guess.

1668
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:53,120
All right, guys.

1669
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:57,240
So let's go ahead to our let's
go to the common methods.

1670
02:04:58,080 --> 02:04:59,400
Okay.

1671
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:03,720
And let's develop
a couple of methods that we will be

1672
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,720
reusing in the future.

1673
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:08,400
Okay.

1674
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:11,640
So what would be

1675
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:14,240
So let's develop a function

1676
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:18,840
which will send some text.

1677
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:19,760
Okay.

1678
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:25,760
So let's develop a function
which will send some text

1679
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:30,000
to a specific element
and a specified text.

1680
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:35,640
Okay.

1681
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:37,440
Well,
you can follow now. Yeah, that's fine.

1682
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:41,680
Guess I mean, you can, you can type in
now, but I need you to be active.

1683
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:42,200
Well, right.

1684
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:46,800
So that we can build these functions.

1685
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:49,760
Okay, so what?

1686
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:54,440
So if I want to send some text guys,
am I getting anything in return?

1687
02:05:54,720 --> 02:06:02,400
If I send text on the on the textbooks.

1688
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:03,280
No. Right.

1689
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:06,120
So if I want to create a function in here

1690
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:10,520
or if I want to create a common
method, is this going to be

1691
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:12,960
what's called

1692
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:19,680
what is my what is going to be my return
type thing here?

1693
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:22,560
Void, Right. Because
we're not getting anything in return.

1694
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,960
So what I can do public void.

1695
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:29,400
Let's do send text

1696
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:39,280
right.

1697
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:39,840
Okay.

1698
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:42,600
So you can type it in after after this.

1699
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:44,200
After the class. Guys, it's okay.

1700
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,160
I'll push the code. Right.

1701
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:48,600
Okay, guys. So I'm sending the.

1702
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:53,880
So now I want to know which element
I'm sending the text to

1703
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:57,960
and what is the text that I am sending to

1704
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:00,160
that I'm just sending.

1705
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:06,880
Okay, so where do I put those?

1706
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:11,560
Where do I specify the element
that I wanted to interact with?

1707
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:12,880
There we go.

1708
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,520
So we have parameter. Right?

1709
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:18,240
So I can say that

1710
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:20,400
web element.

1711
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,840
Element, right.

1712
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:27,400
And then here
my text is going to be as string.

1713
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,800
So now guys, what I am going to do,

1714
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:35,160
the element that I passed in here,
send keys.

1715
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:35,520
Right?

1716
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:39,840
And the value in here is going to be text,

1717
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:41,560
right.

1718
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:46,640
But so once I do this right, once
I do this.

1719
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:50,520
So what if the text books
that I'm trying to interact with

1720
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:55,120
has already the text guys,

1721
02:07:55,120 --> 02:08:06,040
what do we need to do?

1722
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:11,160
Make if condition not really right,
we can simply go ahead and clear

1723
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:14,440
our text box right?

1724
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:17,280
We can simply go ahead and not

1725
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:22,960
clear our text box and then enter

1726
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:27,600
and then enter the text

1727
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:30,000
that we specified inside our friend.

1728
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:31,600
Right.

1729
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:34,360
And what I going to do with that?

1730
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:36,480
Leave a Java doc in here.

1731
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:37,360
Okay.

1732
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:42,520
Saying that this method, this method

1733
02:08:44,280 --> 02:08:46,400
sends

1734
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:50,400
sense text to a given

1735
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:57,360
web element.

1736
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:57,920
Right?

1737
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:03,320
Okay.

1738
02:09:03,320 --> 02:09:05,160
How do I add a job with that? Okay.

1739
02:09:05,160 --> 02:09:10,120
So what you need to do
you need to do is slash double star

1740
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:16,640
and press enter.

1741
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:19,800
Okay, forward,

1742
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:28,960
slash.

1743
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:34,760
Okay, first slash double star
and then enter.

1744
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:37,080
Okay, so you have to parameters in here.

1745
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:37,800
So this

1746
02:09:40,120 --> 02:09:42,000
this what's

1747
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,680
called
this method will send text to any element.

1748
02:09:45,880 --> 02:09:49,680
With any text you need to select,
you want to specify

1749
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:52,720
right?

1750
02:09:52,720 --> 02:09:56,560
Yes, it will work,
but it won't give you the parameters.

1751
02:09:57,480 --> 02:09:57,800
Okay.

1752
02:09:57,800 --> 02:10:02,280
So if you do it without double SA,
it will work, but it will not give you

1753
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:09,600
the parameters in here.

1754
02:10:09,600 --> 02:10:14,760
Okay.

1755
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:20,640
All right.

1756
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:21,640
Oh yeah.

1757
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:26,800
Those are the parameters that you can
you can also add in here.

1758
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,320
I think you can also
add the author in here.

1759
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:31,720
I'm not sure if this is going to pop up
right now.

1760
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:35,400
Okay.
Seems like this is not built in here.

1761
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:43,880
That's fine.

1762
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:45,000
All right.

1763
02:10:45,000 --> 02:11:01,640
Let's see what else we can add in here.

1764
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:12,360
Yeah, it should be a little bit different.

1765
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:15,280
Okay, guys, so let's do this.

1766
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:16,200
Let's

1767
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:26,880
see. Okay, So

1768
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:31,560
how many way did we say
we can switch to the frame?

1769
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:34,760
Guys? Three.

1770
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:36,840
Right. What?

1771
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:43,840
What are those ways?

1772
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,840
Idea or name?

1773
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:49,920
Right.

1774
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:50,200
Okay.

1775
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:54,080
By index and

1776
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:03,360
and by the web element.

1777
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:04,320
Right.

1778
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:09,680
So let's let's create
a method which switches to the

1779
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:13,040
to the frame by the given web elements.

1780
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:14,080
Okay.

1781
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:16,240
Or let's do it by the index guys.

1782
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:19,200
Okay.

1783
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:22,400
So if I switch to a frame,

1784
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:26,720
am I getting anything in return? Does

1785
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:29,120
no right.

1786
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:34,080
So the method we will be creating right
now will be void as well, right?

1787
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:37,080
So public void.

1788
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:38,320
Let's do

1789
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:42,600
a switch to

1790
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:46,280
frame in here. So

1791
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:51,160
in here guys,
since we are switching by index,

1792
02:12:51,280 --> 02:13:07,080
where do I need to make the change?

1793
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:10,880
So we need to add the index inside

1794
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,120
the parameter.

1795
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:16,560
Right. So integer

1796
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:18,880
index in here.

1797
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:24,560
So what I need to do driver
that switch to the frame

1798
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:28,680
and we need to paste the index in here.

1799
02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:29,600
Right.

1800
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:35,320
But so we need to be very cautious in

1801
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:39,000
whenever we these kind of common methods.

1802
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:40,480
Okay guys.

1803
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:42,600
So what is

1804
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:46,760
what if there's no frame with
think there is a frame.

1805
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:48,960
There's no frame guys on the page.

1806
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:53,480
So in that case,
we need to take some action.

1807
02:13:54,200 --> 02:13:55,040
Okay.

1808
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:59,640
So if there's no if there's no frame,
you will get an exception.

1809
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:00,920
Right.

1810
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:05,600
So what you can do in this case,
whenever you're using this method

1811
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:08,360
and if there's no frame or

1812
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:11,800
you're using this method right now,
everything is fine.

1813
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:12,600
There is a frame.

1814
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:16,920
But in the future, developers
remove that frame, right?

1815
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:23,680
So your your your step is going to fail
when you when you switch to the frame.

1816
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:24,720
Right.

1817
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:30,720
So in that case what we can do
we can wrap this up with a try and catch.

1818
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:34,280
Right. So what I'm going to do in here

1819
02:14:36,280 --> 02:14:39,560
I'm going to do try

1820
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:42,240
right and

1821
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:45,440
copy this right

1822
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,560
and what am I catching in here?

1823
02:14:48,560 --> 02:15:00,440
What kind of exception am I catching?

1824
02:15:00,440 --> 02:15:03,560
No such frame exception, right?

1825
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:05,120
Absolutely right.

1826
02:15:05,120 --> 02:15:08,960
So what I am going to do is simply

1827
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:12,280
put in here no such frame exception.

1828
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:13,840
E Right.

1829
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:18,760
And what I will do
will print the stack trace.

1830
02:15:18,760 --> 02:15:19,560
Okay.

1831
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:21,720
Is this clear, guys?

1832
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:24,000
Any questions

1833
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:32,600
for frames? Yes.

1834
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:34,840
You need to switch back
to default content.

1835
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:42,360
Correct. Why?

1836
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,080
Oh okay.

1837
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:45,320
So why we okay here.

1838
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:51,000
So this switch to frame method
that we are creating

1839
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:54,240
is for for the test cases

1840
02:15:54,240 --> 02:15:58,680
where you switch to the frame
and you perform

1841
02:15:58,680 --> 02:16:02,040
all the rest of the action
inside the frame.

1842
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:05,640
Okay, so this one.

1843
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:08,920
So you can also create a method
to to get back

1844
02:16:08,920 --> 02:16:12,160
to the default content
and we use that in your actions.

1845
02:16:12,520 --> 02:16:13,240
Right?

1846
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:16,560
So you want to so if you

1847
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:18,800
you can't really

1848
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:23,760
go back right now in here,
you can't really do default content right.

1849
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:27,720
Because everything should be in a small
chunks, right.

1850
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:32,760
If you build a big chunk right now,
you can't really add anything

1851
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:34,200
in between, Right?

1852
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:37,600
So in your common methods, try to divide

1853
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:40,880
everything in small,
small chunks as possible.

1854
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:42,000
Okay?

1855
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,760
So that your future executions,

1856
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:49,360
they don't get interrupted by your common
methods.

1857
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:53,080
Okay.

1858
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:54,080
All right.

1859
02:16:54,080 --> 02:16:57,240
So here, guys, what you can do,

1860
02:16:57,560 --> 02:17:01,080
what you can do as your homework
or in your free time

1861
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:07,040
whenever you want to do it,
you can create a the same method in here.

1862
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:11,400
But having with different, different ways

1863
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:14,840
of switching, different.

1864
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:15,720
Exactly.

1865
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:19,720
This is what you need to do
if you want to have switch to frame

1866
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:25,080
by web element
and switch the frame by ID or name right.

1867
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:30,000
So you need to overload this
method and change a little bit inside.

1868
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:32,440
Okay. Keep the same name guys.

1869
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:36,640
Keep the same name,
but just overload these methods.

1870
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:43,120
Okay.

1871
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:46,280
So now you can see how we are,

1872
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:50,520
how we're using an inherited multilevel
inheritance, right?

1873
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:54,280
How we using overloading right now?

1874
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:58,400
You see that
old concepts are coming around right now

1875
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:05,800
now? Yes.

1876
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:10,360
So you should be adding
Java doc for each method.

1877
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:14,840
Okay, Get this in the habit, guys,
because when you start working,

1878
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:19,080
you will see Java Docs on each

1879
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:21,920
and every method in the framework.

1880
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:22,840
Okay.

1881
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:26,400
Because sometimes
whenever a new person comes in

1882
02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:30,960
and they try to look at the framework,
they might not know

1883
02:18:31,080 --> 02:18:34,760
what that method does or what
function is performing.

1884
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:35,320
Right?

1885
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:40,040
So that's why you need these Java docs
in order to give the description

1886
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:43,920
so so that other people can understand

1887
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:46,520
what is going on.

1888
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:48,520
So in here, let's put this

1889
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:54,440
so this method

1890
02:18:54,520 --> 02:18:58,560
will switch to frame

1891
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:04,800
by index.

1892
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:05,520
Okay.

1893
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:22,240
Any questions, guys?

1894
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:25,960
You can also guys
go ahead and create methods for selecting

1895
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:31,440
from the dropdown right.

1896
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:34,920
Or switching to the to the child window

1897
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:44,040
question.

1898
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:46,000
Okay. Yeah, that's okay. That's okay.

1899
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:46,320
All right.

1900
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:48,760
You just need a little bit practice. Okay.

1901
02:19:48,760 --> 02:19:54,320
So if you're confused, if you're confused
in some topics, it's okay.

1902
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:56,480
Just practice a little more.

1903
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:07,120
It's all going to get along okay.

1904
02:20:07,120 --> 02:20:10,640
So once implementations often,
I mean, do you.

1905
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:14,760
Yes, I read I read Java Docs.

1906
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:19,840
Yes, sometimes not always,
but sometimes I read Java Docs

1907
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:22,600
if I don't know what is going on
with a method.

1908
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:23,560
Okay.

1909
02:20:23,560 --> 02:20:29,040
Because we all have we have in our
framework pretty big methods,

1910
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:32,600
not only the common methods but

1911
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:36,560
in different implementation classes.

1912
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:41,760
You will be going on, you will be going
over those in, in framework building.

1913
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:42,440
Okay.

1914
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:46,440
So if you especially
when you have long methods

1915
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:50,360
and big implementation in one method, it's
it's useful.

1916
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:52,800
It's really useful
to have those Java docs.

1917
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:57,280
Okay.

1918
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:59,320
Why read the file that is created?

1919
02:20:59,320 --> 02:21:18,960
No, no, not really.

1920
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:21,760
All right, guys, we have 30 more minutes.

1921
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:25,520
If you guys have any questions.

1922
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:28,840
It doesn't have to be regarding
the selenium.

1923
02:21:29,200 --> 02:21:33,160
You can ask me regarding the jobs
or anything like this.

1924
02:21:33,160 --> 02:21:34,720
I'll be happy to answer.

1925
02:21:34,720 --> 02:21:36,400
If not, we can finish.

1926
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:42,000
Finished today's class.

1927
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,880
Yes. There is one more slide
that I will be uploading.

1928
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:54,000
Okay. Wish

1929
02:21:55,680 --> 02:21:58,720
so. At that time
we didn't have these common methods.

1930
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:01,760
You should start. You should start with

1931
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:05,880
with Java docs in in Java classes guys.

1932
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:10,160
Okay.

1933
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:14,880
What was,
what was the hardest part of starting

1934
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:19,480
my first job.

1935
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:22,920
The thing that the meetings
I think the meetings, guys okay.

1936
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:28,600
The meetings are the hardest
because you didn't really attend those,

1937
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:34,440
so you just keep quiet at first
and then you observe everything.

1938
02:22:34,440 --> 02:22:36,600
You don't have any.

1939
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:41,240
No, no, I didn't have any
previous experience with coding guys.

1940
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:41,760
Okay.

1941
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:45,200
Syntax is the only
is the only experience that I got.

1942
02:22:46,920 --> 02:22:48,560
I remembering all the steps.

1943
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:49,400
Okay.

1944
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:52,960
So in the interview, guys,

1945
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:56,120
in the interview,
you might forget something.

1946
02:22:56,320 --> 02:22:58,000
It's. It's okay, guys.

1947
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:58,920
Okay. It's.

1948
02:22:58,920 --> 02:22:59,840
It's normal.

1949
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,680
We're all human beings.

1950
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:03,680
You will you will forget stuff.

1951
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:08,800
I forget stuff and it's not don't
really worry about this.

1952
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:10,040
Okay?

1953
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:12,800
So when it comes to interview
preparation, guys,

1954
02:23:12,920 --> 02:23:17,000
you will have more, more information and

1955
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:21,520
and we'll give you a lot of stuff, too,
and we will support you.

1956
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:23,680
Okay. So give you interview questions.

1957
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:25,480
You will be going over those.

1958
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:26,960
We'll have mock interviews.

1959
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:30,880
So that's all going to be
that's going to work out very well.

1960
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:31,840
Okay.

1961
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:36,560
So don't be too worried right now
about the interviews.

1962
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:38,560
It will be for real interviews.

1963
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:40,280
Okay.

1964
02:23:40,280 --> 02:23:42,840
From my own experience. Okay.

1965
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:46,200
How well you're going to be prepared
if you study.

1966
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:48,680
You will be prepared. Very good.

1967
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:49,560
Okay.

1968
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:57,280
So from my own experience in syntax,
so a lot of my friends in my group,

1969
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:00,640
we all found jobs within the three weeks.

1970
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:01,360
Okay.

1971
02:24:01,360 --> 02:24:06,440
So it was like seven people
or eight people.

1972
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:07,320
Okay.

1973
02:24:08,840 --> 02:24:12,360
So the more you study, the more you share

1974
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:16,200
with your teammates, okay, the better
you get.

1975
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:20,040
Okay, guys, So try to work with teams.

1976
02:24:21,480 --> 02:24:23,640
That's going to give you a lot

1977
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:27,440
more information than even
I am giving you.

1978
02:24:27,880 --> 02:24:32,280
Okay.

1979
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:34,680
You study for like 5 hours a day.

1980
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:39,520
So in my situation,
we were in class students, right?

1981
02:24:39,600 --> 02:24:41,520
So we were there every day.

1982
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:46,040
We were we were at syntax every day,
guys, seven days a week.

1983
02:24:46,400 --> 02:24:48,360
We used to go there like 2 p.m.

1984
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:52,080
and would finished like 8 p.m..

1985
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:55,200
And then we just I used to do Uber at that

1986
02:24:55,200 --> 02:25:02,160
time.

1987
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:04,320
Which states has more jobs available?

1988
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:07,680
I'm not really sure about that, guys,
but I am sure that D.C.

1989
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:11,440
area has more government jobs than other

1990
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:17,280
states.

1991
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:19,400
Is the last classes of Java.

1992
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:20,160
Okay.

1993
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:23,240
If you have some
some difficulties with Java

1994
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:28,240
guys, as I said, practice or talk to your

1995
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:33,960
talk to your teammates
guys share with with each other.

1996
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:37,680
That way you will have more practice

1997
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:40,920
and that way you explain something,
you get

1998
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:47,280
you got something from your teammate
that's going to be very good for us.

1999
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:52,160
How many interviews I got until I until
I got the job.

2000
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:55,200
I think I got my my offer on the second

2001
02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:02,240
or third interview.

2002
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:03,360
You do?

2003
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:09,520
Did you take the first offer
just to get in?

2004
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:12,200
I was going to take an offer.

2005
02:26:12,680 --> 02:26:14,200
Just the first offer.

2006
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:16,280
But then after that I got another offer.

2007
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:19,000
It was better. So I the second one

2008
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:26,840
already conference a

2009
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:33,600
Is it competitive in the market right now?

2010
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:35,840
Is that what you asking price

2011
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:55,800
How long did I stay?

2012
02:26:55,800 --> 02:27:01,480
I stayed for about five months
because I was forced to leave.

2013
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:06,880
So I was a contractor
and all the contractors got laid off.

2014
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:07,960
Okay.

2015
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:14,560
At my first job, it's not that they didn't

2016
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:17,960
renew. They

2017
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:20,040
the budget got cut

2018
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:23,600
so they had to lay everything
everyone else.

2019
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:24,480
Okay.

2020
02:27:24,480 --> 02:27:28,880
So like, I think they laid off
like more than 100 people

2021
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:38,440
at the at the same time.

2022
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:40,800
How fast did I find a new job?

2023
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:44,240
So it was it was December, guys.

2024
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:48,800
So I went back home for a month
and came back. So

2025
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:52,520
so I started applying in January

2026
02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:56,840
at the second half of the January
and I just got in in, in February.

2027
02:27:56,840 --> 02:27:57,280
You guys

2028
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:01,880
Okay.

2029
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:05,000
So probably two or three weeks

2030
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:10,880
work and stuff is very similar guys.

2031
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:11,680
Okay.

2032
02:28:11,680 --> 02:28:18,200
So once you dive into the framework,
that is exactly the same.

2033
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:22,160
Well, the the process is the same. The

2034
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:27,360
what's called the page object model
that I explained is the same.

2035
02:28:27,480 --> 02:28:30,280
So it might be different tools, Okay.

2036
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:34,000
Which you need to which you need to learn
and it's fine guys.

2037
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,160
You will have time to learn, but
everything else should be the same guys.

2038
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:47,640
Okay, I would need another month

2039
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:51,000
or two to prepare myself
for interview after completing.

2040
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,040
If you ask me, don't do that.

2041
02:28:53,040 --> 02:29:06,160
If you ask me, apply right away.

2042
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:08,880
What if we have passing
the mock interview?

2043
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:12,800
What if you have trouble
passing the mock interview? You

2044
02:29:14,040 --> 02:29:15,200
If you study, you won't.

2045
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:19,280
Guys,

2046
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:22,200
how long did it take
for me to feel comfortable at the job?

2047
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:24,840
What I'm doing right now,

2048
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:27,360
depending on the difficulty
of your framework

2049
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:30,160
okay, some frameworks are really easy.

2050
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:34,880
Some frameworks, as I have right now,
it's pretty complicated.

2051
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:39,720
Okay, so we're using different tools
on top of selenium

2052
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:43,360
cucumber Java, we using some other tools

2053
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:46,080
and it's it's a little bit complicated.

2054
02:29:46,440 --> 02:29:48,720
It's a for me probably 2 to 3 months.

2055
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,800
There's a short period of time
between jobs.

2056
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:54,280
That's me.

2057
02:29:54,400 --> 02:29:57,200
I'm no they don't.

2058
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:02,200
I mean, if it's, if it's like a year
then they will ask you what's going on.

2059
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:05,440
But if it's like a month, then now

2060
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:08,720
you could just tell them
you had a vacation or some

2061
02:30:11,720 --> 02:30:13,120
half cheese, half pepperoni.

2062
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:15,200
Okay, Just a heads up.

2063
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:17,400
All right, All

2064
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:20,720
good.

2065
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:25,040
Okay, I'll note that down.

2066
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:27,240
Maybe I should put it in the notes

2067
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:29,320
in here

2068
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:38,440
and find.

2069
02:30:38,440 --> 02:30:39,240
Oh, okay.

2070
02:30:39,240 --> 02:30:41,600
Well,
you can explain the situation, right?

2071
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:44,760
If you find the new job,
like two months ago.

2072
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:45,600
And now you look

2073
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:50,960
and you can explain the situation
in my situation, I mean, it is what it is.

2074
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:54,480
I mean, I got laid off
because the budget got cut, right?

2075
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:59,280
And they don't really look at this
like, hey, something is wrong now.

2076
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:02,960
They will look more at you. It's okay.

2077
02:31:02,960 --> 02:31:03,360
So what?

2078
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:06,960
You know, if you know, then it's
they will hire you.

2079
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:14,040
Okay.

2080
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:15,960
I saw something about a program

2081
02:31:15,960 --> 02:31:19,520
that we've been covering
and what would be our answer program.

2082
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:21,840
What do you mean by program?

2083
02:31:21,840 --> 02:31:27,040
Are you talking about
the programing language?

2084
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:28,000
Oh, tools.

2085
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:32,240
Okay, So if you're asked to do something
with your tool, with with

2086
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:36,760
the different tools, you can tell them
that you never use those because.

2087
02:31:36,760 --> 02:31:38,600
They will look at your resume.

2088
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:41,120
You have Java, you have Selenium,

2089
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:45,640
you have Maven,
you have cucumber test and G, right?

2090
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:48,640
And you're going to come at
you and ask you JavaScript,

2091
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:50,520
right?

2092
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:53,520
And you can say that I am willing to learn
absolutely

2093
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:58,400
right.

2094
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:06,120
Okay, you're a fast learner.

2095
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:07,160
Okay,

2096
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:10,360
let's see if you fast find a job

2097
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:19,120
in the years you suggest.

2098
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:21,960
If we need not more

2099
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:25,680
that I would

2100
02:32:25,880 --> 02:32:27,160
for the experience

2101
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:30,360
guys, that I would leave it to Samir

2102
02:32:30,360 --> 02:32:33,640
and A so they would suggest to you
the better way.

2103
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:47,200
Okay.

2104
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:49,160
Like extra tools.

2105
02:32:49,160 --> 02:32:54,240
You want me to mention the extra tools?

2106
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:57,600
Extra tools like Serenity
is getting really popular right now.

2107
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:01,560
You can take a look at that

2108
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:02,160
tool.

2109
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:05,640
There's catalogs studio, which I hate.

2110
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:10,680
There is also task complete,
which is really, really outdated.

2111
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:14,160
It's using really government.

2112
02:33:14,160 --> 02:33:20,200
Okay, no

2113
02:33:20,200 --> 02:33:23,760
more selenium classes guys.

2114
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:24,640
It's all done.

2115
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:31,440
This is everything you need to know
in selenium.

2116
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:33,040
Hey, it means no more me.

2117
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:37,320
Yeah, absolutely right, guys.

2118
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:37,800
No, no, no.

2119
02:33:37,800 --> 02:33:40,960
We do a virtual hag when you find a job,
Michael Okay?

2120
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,960
Otherwise, otherwise, it's

2121
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:50,120
where we can dance the night away as well.

2122
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:51,240
If you find a job. Yeah.

2123
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:55,600
If all of you find jobs
really, really fast.

2124
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:56,360
Anything, guys?

2125
02:33:56,360 --> 02:34:04,000
Okay.

2126
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Lots of good deals. There you go.

2127
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:09,120
See what

2128
02:34:10,960 --> 02:34:13,200
what I am willing to do for you guys

2129
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:28,920
so that you guys can find a job.

2130
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:32,000
These students have left since the start.

2131
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:35,080
I'm not sure about that, guys.

2132
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:44,320
I don't really keep track of that.

2133
02:34:44,320 --> 02:35:08,720
All right, guys, any other questions?

2134
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:09,360
All right.

2135
02:35:09,360 --> 02:35:12,720
If there's no questions, guys, good luck.

2136
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:18,080
Okay, I'll take on the VA system.

2137
02:35:18,200 --> 02:35:24,000
Okay,
But luck, guys, there's a little bit left.

2138
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Okay, Let's push it a little bit more.

2139
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,320
So two months left right now
and you will be on the market.

2140
02:35:29,320 --> 02:35:33,120
It's going to be a lot of fun when you
start looking for a job, guys, it's

2141
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:35,440
going to be a little stressful,

2142
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:40,800
but it's going to be a lot of fun
when you start taking interviews.

2143
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:41,640
Okay.

2144
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:45,040
So thanks, everybody, guys.

2145
02:35:45,040 --> 02:35:45,960
Good luck.

2146
02:35:45,960 --> 02:35:48,920
And I hope you guys find jobs
really, really fast

2147
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:52,760
because they
the market is really hot right now.

2148
02:35:53,680 --> 02:35:57,560
I'm getting emails every day even though
I haven't applied for like two years.

2149
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:05,480
So yes, I'll push the code guys.

2150
02:36:05,480 --> 02:36:08,240
You'll have everything updated in
canvas as well

2151
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:13,040
and I will probably see some of you
on the mock interviews, but I doubt it.

2152
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:18,960
So if I don't guys, then good luck.

2153
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:21,480
Second
half of the January is going to be good

2154
02:36:22,640 --> 02:36:23,520
the market wise.

2155
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:32,600
Okay.

2156
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:35,600
All right, guys. So have a good night.

2157
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:38,720
Good luck again, guys,
And I'll probably see

2158
02:36:38,720 --> 02:36:42,560
you, some of you in the mock interviews.

2159
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:43,720
If not, have a good one.

2160
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:46,480
And I hope you guys find jobs really fast.

2161
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:48,160
Okay. Thanks, everybody.

2162
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:52,560
Have a good night and stay safe.

2163
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:55,000
Thank you, guys.
