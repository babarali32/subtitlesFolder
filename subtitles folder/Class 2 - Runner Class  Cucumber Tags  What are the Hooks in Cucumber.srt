1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,560
So let me

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,320
begin quickly three topics
which we studied

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,080
yesterday.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,240
We are using now in Studio

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,880
Java Project
one dictation Project Guide 11 Project.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,080
What is this

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,240
legal practice here?

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,160
What is method

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,920
right

10
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,520
moment is the be the management
tool, right

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,560
brand management tool.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,840
Fine.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,640
Noticing our libraries trade,

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,040
it captures the dreams, all the libraries.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,720
And what are the libraries
we need to fix? 100.

16
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,280
Excellent. Or do not.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,480
If we talk about then
this moment is a brilliant management tool

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,200
which will be used to create a complete

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,640
folder structure right?

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,880
So basically we need a very
organized structure to work upon, right?

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,360
We need a to work upon.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,240
It was we had this had a key there
we define which set of good

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
we have to write in
which particular portion of

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,360
the framework correct.

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,080
So it's that simple.

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,440
You can understand
grade and framework is from a library

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,160
in library for you goes there
there is a separate section alphabetically

28
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,120
so all the book starts with a one
shelf books

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,920
starts would later be available in bishop
and so on.

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,600
High city rainy days there.

31
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,320
So we generally find all the books that
the library, these books are segregated,

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,240
so we don't need to search every book
one by one.

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,600
Right.
If we know book is rich Deadpool two.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,920
So I believe the Dominican

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,400
Republic Street
as simply go in the shelves

36
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,920
and then I guess it is reached
reject order book.

37
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,120
So it is very easy to understand
if we have an organized structure,

38
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,320
if we have agreement.

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,560
Similarly,
we observe this need encoding is what

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,240
that is what we came up with

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,240
the management do that can do it
as bestowed upon the structure.

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,560
And now that

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,000
we have this organized structure,
we are using it for a coding perspective.

44
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,920
So the first thing is management tool,

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,880
which we are using is fine in Mandarin

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,440
right in moment.

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,520
What are the advantages we have?

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,720
So the first advantage is
we don't need to add

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
any jobs manually

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,000
right?

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,840
Mebane says.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,120
I will link to it
all the dependencies that you were

53
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,880
taking here in the form of chart.

54
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,840
Now we just need to edit two
or three lines of code.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,160
Then once you add this code
in one of my configuration files

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,840
from this file
and is going to the central repository

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,760
and I will page

58
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,880
all the important information
in the libraries from there that you will

59
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,920
when you do it in your project
and have it provide you most advantage.

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,480
You don't need to add any jobs manually.

61
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,040
So that had deep processes.

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,040
Second thing is uniform.

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,720
State uniform is the same kind of origin

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,000
is using by every other team member.

65
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,320
So there is no conflicts in using
their different version of the same to

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,240
if I am using 73.14,

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
then everyone else in my team
is also using synonyms with one

68
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,120
or because I added responder fire rate

69
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,000
and they just need to split, upload
the project in their machine, then state

70
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,160
and provide all the dependencies
related to this medium.

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,200
And so on other tools. This

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:27,440
relates.

73
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,320
Now imagine we got both folders
in this RC, we got two.

74
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,080
Former is the first is mail
and the second is the best.

75
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,040
If they have a different version
of selenium, then that's good.

76
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,120
It is against the standard
and the one with the culprit he has.

77
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,520
He has to change technology.

78
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,040
So that's why when we created
the only one person who's responsible

79
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,320
to edit all these things

80
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,040
and then that person completes
the code in the repository and others has

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,760
two others have to take this code
from the repository and use the same code.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,640
Agreed.

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,720
So it can't be like I'm

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,120
using different version of the study
using different version.

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,360
They can't do that.

86
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,880
Good evening.

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,000
City Noise User Motions

88
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,720
Main is for developers
and best is for testing environment.

89
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,800
So which folder we will going to use case

90
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,440
visual computers.

91
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,160
Best of all, it's that simple.

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,120
Great. Fine.

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
So now here

94
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,520
we will use test for

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,720
all is

96
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,400
inside test we have java

97
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,400
and inside this to be had

98
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,560
would be which is source just

99
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,000
the ability to mean already.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,880
Yes most would be to determine already
because we don't need to

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,360
find in Java we don't what

102
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,120
a one sprints squeak

103
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,360
coding part

104
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
for things

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,080
and in resources we don't what

106
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,040
non-coding stuff

107
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,960
only good and then we'll just correct.

108
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,800
Excellent. Yep. Just do it quickly.

109
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,880
Get right like 8 minutes to get
and then we'll go further right

110
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,160
then.

111
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,880
I explained one example of could do right,

112
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,520
how it increases the collaboration,

113
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,840
how it and this is a business
that I would encourages

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,600
more communication in between developers
and testers and length right

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
raises.

116
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,880
Remember
the example If there is a new user,

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,840
then we can provide 10% of discount rate.

118
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,720
I give the example of two people or more
than 400 phones to explain the code.

119
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,280
The blade will not have to spend anything.

120
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,040
A man was the guy with
whom was the owner of the right company.

121
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,680
Right?

122
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,520
And then instead of providing the code
in the how for a month

123
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,600
and for the way to manual
in terms of language,

124
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,720
you can just put everything
in that example.

125
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,160
So now

126
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,080
here,
because we have some miscommunication

127
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,920
or communication gap, I would say right,
because of using testing

128
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,680
or any other dude, we came up with Google.

129
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,360
We didn't generally write the language.

130
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,160
What does it mean with this
written language?

131
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,080
The language simply means plain English
text, right?

132
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,200
So make a converse.

133
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,880
Suppose
we read behavioral driven development.

134
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
What is behavior driven development?

135
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,520
It means writing your scenario or discuses

136
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,360
in terms of functionality,
but it's in terms of behavior to divide.

137
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,320
And you write those and use
to rate the behavior of their discourses.

138
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,880
We use grouping language

139
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,560
now in 39, which we studied,

140
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,040
for example, restricted for keywords

141
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,880
given when and then rate.

142
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,280
I explained all this for current whatever
the precondition, we will be very good.

143
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,960
Whatever the precondition,
we will be happy.

144
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,920
We reiterate that precondition
and the given keyword,

145
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,680
whatever the actions we will provide,

146
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,960
whatever the actions
such as click completion

147
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,880
or send gives operation
or selecting their dropdown operation,

148
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,440
every single thing we will provide with
when word,

149
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,040
when key word,
and if we have multiple operations

150
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,400
to perform, multiple actions to perform
right then instead of using when,

151
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,760
when when other names with use
one supporting keyword and that supported

152
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,640
keyword is and if we have similar
similarly to preconditions,

153
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,840
then I will use end with given
as one given and given like this.

154
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,960
Similarly
for expected output for expected condition

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,560
for reasons for verification
when it should not be used then,

156
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,800
but it isn't to be used then.

157
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,360
Right.

158
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,560
And if we have multiple verification
validation values

159
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,600
and we've been honest

160
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,160
so far, so

161
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,120
think

162
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,360
now under is another keyword.

163
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,960
Here it is another keyword

164
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,160
we concretize

165
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,880
under the keyword core feature.

166
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,000
It's what is the key words?

167
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
Region

168
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,640
What does it mean as a feature?

169
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,040
So remember one thing

170
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,640
that we deserve to be will write great.

171
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,080
We will trade all of our best guesses
based on their behavior.

172
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,440
Correct? That's what we said.

173
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,640
Wherever we create this test

174
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,080
guesses in this test
consistent on a device.

175
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,440
So this scenario was disingenuous,
which we would write.

176
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,400
I will write them in feature by.

177
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,520
Right.

178
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,320
So the extension of my find

179
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,480
is the heart feature.

180
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,640
The extension of by is not feature
in which I will write

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,160
plain English text directly
meaning which and understood to

182
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,960
indisputably one

183
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,240
great

184
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,840
the rates and menu

185
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,680
we use

186
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,680
something

187
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,440
like this.

188
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,920
So my feature find this simple
the way we provide don't be exported

189
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,840
text file
we will provide note feature for feature.

190
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,800
Okay.

191
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Is this clear to everyone?

192
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,600
It's nice.

193
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,520
Let's proceed further

194
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,560
off feature up to

195
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,280
which of that is another
you would go to menu.

196
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,440
So what this scenario scenario

197
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,320
simply means this to case rate.

198
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
We are once in a few moments
you'll one best case.

199
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,240
So for example,
there is a user's tool that you

200
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,800
it is a user story number 123458.

201
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,760
So in this user story I am seeing a woman

202
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,800
should be able to search and

203
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,080
in it demos.

204
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,600
Now see now understood one now understand

205
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,360
this admin should be able
to search and employ in a chat

206
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,840
and application what does it mean
if I open the application is

207
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,920
and I should be able to search it
employs agreed.

208
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,120
Now let's see this functionality
first manually.

209
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,440
Always remember

210
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,680
when you test any application rate,
you should use this functionality.

211
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,360
You should check the functionality
first when you need.

212
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,320
Make sure the functionality is working
in the non to implement

213
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,160
in your understood.

214
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,960
And that's what everyone

215
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,640
Nancy,

216
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,280
I am on this page

217
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,920
employing permission
which can everyone see this page

218
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:23,320
as of no, no I need to search
I need to search.

219
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,840
Employee Right.

220
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,040
So you see here make search option vacancy
and here I get

221
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,800
see to the page
search by name and search of

222
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,600
I can you see this

223
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,840
right

224
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,160
so to this I have here I have do is here

225
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,280
search by me and search mine and it is

226
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,760
categories

227
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
and now it could take any from here.

228
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,360
Let's take this idea to search.

229
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,720
So I'm providing this idea
and basically construction.

230
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,680
Correct.

231
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,640
So this is my valid employed 80

232
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,680
and it provides me this particular data.

233
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,760
It provides me this particular data.

234
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,320
Can everyone see employing permission

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
directly on search?

236
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,680
There is another way.

237
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,960
There is another way to find employee via

238
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,880
name by a name, right?

239
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,720
So we had to wait in Myanmar
and so I would be able to find this

240
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,400
to check.

241
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,960
I don't know who created but see

242
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,160
a lot of local

243
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,560
listing this X, y, z.

244
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,280
This is the name.

245
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,480
I'm going to take this as a name

246
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,560
search.

247
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,040
It's giving with this data with X, Y, Z.

248
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,000
You also

249
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,520
reason.

250
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,080
So now I have to do
is I have two ways to find any employment.

251
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,360
One is search my

252
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,040
lady and secondly, search by

253
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,640
name. Right.

254
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,920
So let me go here on the note
and I I'm going to think

255
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,800
let me go to the node and here I'm going
to read one important thing

256
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,720
I'm seeing.

257
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,000
Everyone knows, right,
how to read user stories.

258
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:14,320
Everyone knows how to read visitors
to this base in menu.

259
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,360
So great.

260
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,480
So now I'm talking about expedience
criteria.

261
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:30,240
Hooray to the study, by the way,
he delayed

262
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,880
be rated of study.

263
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:44,040
Who defines acceptance criteria? You.

264
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,360
Do you tolerate

265
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,280
any person losing

266
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,280
its product

267
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
or rate
which defines the acceptance criteria.

268
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,320
Right?

269
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,320
If it is an individual person
indefinitely, developers

270
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,520
can define anything

271
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,480
and that's what it is
in the product owner response

272
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,760
and the responsibility rates
that can define the acceptance quality.

273
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,800
So now here acceptance criteria,
which I see right,

274
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,600
is first search by IED

275
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,280
and the second this search

276
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,560
by name

277
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,960
is entering the exit acceptance criteria
we have on this particular

278
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,520
district street.

279
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:31,760
Right

280
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,040
When I would consider this acceptance,

281
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,640
it is complete
when I can apply to search rate,

282
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,880
when I'm able to search by, I'll be

283
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,320
or may mean this predictive improvement

284
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,360
from now.

285
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,840
See, the moment I see in the acceptance

286
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,560
criteria I have to
be is to apply in the employee.

287
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,480
Right.

288
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,040
So I have to write the code for two this

289
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,120
and then we have to do is this is nothing
but my scenario.

290
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,440
This is my scenario.

291
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,280
It means I have two scenarios
which I need to implement

292
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,040
and this one,

293
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,200
it means I'm having almost scenarios
to implement race

294
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,840
those in areas to implement trade.

295
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:32,600
So let's go ahead and do it first,
I'm going to read you the scenario.

296
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,440
One even given means precondition, correct

297
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,760
categories.

298
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,720
So in given I'm going to write here

299
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,880
right as a precondition
for searching of employment first,

300
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:57,040
I should be able to log
into application of.

301
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,880
Correct.

302
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,960
So let me give a user

303
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,240
opens a browser, and

304
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,560
then maybe get it to a post

305
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,520
first

306
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,240
thing, then end

307
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,520
user is

308
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,120
logged in is an admin

309
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,720
I used and given
also because I have two preconditions

310
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,040
in this case, given user opens browser

311
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,240
and then the user is logged in to me.

312
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,520
These are preconditions right now.

313
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,680
And again,

314
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,360
one more precondition user is on is all

315
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,480
employee needs to reach, right?

316
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,640
Because the actual best guest starts

317
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,960
from searching an employee right now.

318
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,360
Here went my own employee list page
when I am on this page,

319
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,920
this is my employee list,
which everyone can see it.

320
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,280
Everyone can see you create

321
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,800
clean

322
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,640
next. Right.

323
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,880
So now here when I see given user opens
browser and immediately to

324
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,200
and any user is logged in as an admin,

325
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,880
any user is an employee list page.

326
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,400
This is my brief. In addition.

327
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,560
Now the activation starts when user

328
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,480
interface ready employ a team.

329
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,840
The first action I'm going to
provide is in three valid

330
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,840
employee ready and user

331
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,800
clicks on

332
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,680
search option

333
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,000
or search

334
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,840
addict.

335
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,000
This is what we are doing right
and then means now

336
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,640
when and

337
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,760
for how to revive use and

338
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,960
clicking not.

339
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,680
And I'm asking what did

340
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
not and not start.

341
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,680
It's not that there's full time scene
for that

342
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,960
there's what I'm saying
it essentially discussed

343
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,720
this this and a day can come with every
and that a keyword trade

344
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,080
if we're performing multiple operation
right

345
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,840
so if I'm having two actions back to back
I cannot use when two times

346
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,360
when use it in an employee only in venues

347
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,360
or placed on certain no
because you have one supporting keyword.

348
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,000
This time we're using and here

349
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,600
supporting advocacy developers to

350
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,880
is to remember like like

351
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,480
then user see

352
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,880
cutting Jimmy we can use it.

353
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,800
We have multiple verification
so we can use that more than one

354
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:25,880
already.

355
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,480
So it is very easy for you to understand.

356
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,360
Now here you'll see then users see

357
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,680
employee

358
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,120
in the role to

359
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,600
be confronted.

360
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,800
Is this scenario correct?

361
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,160
What I'm seeing generates

362
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
quite similarly.

363
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,920
Let's talk about the seconds and then

364
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,400
so in the second scenario.

365
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,240
All right, I'm
going to copy this completes interview.

366
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,160
But the only thing I'm going to change
is instead of going use

367
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,640
that interest will employ
only I'm going to use it

368
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,800
in terms.

369
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,320
And then and

370
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,800
lastly, I'll

371
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,480
write

372
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,240
all groups, groups

373
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,800
nice use.

374
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,040
Proceed from there. Now.

375
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,280
Now you'll see
we have to read all of this stuff.

376
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,480
All of this stuff in our actual framework.

377
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,080
Correct.

378
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,200
So still, we have to keep our framework

379
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,600
ready to exit all these things. Okay,

380
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,800
Now let's

381
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,840
add one by one couple of things
in agreement.

382
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,600
Point

383
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,320
fine guys.

384
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,400
Let's think let's think
from from technical perspective,

385
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,680
from a Q automation engineer perspective,
we need selenium.

386
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,600
It's at any rate,

387
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,440
we need Java

388
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,240
based, we need to Google, we need.

389
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,680
But also, like

390
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,680
I told you, that we will learn
how to parse data from the pixel.

391
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,320
So we need Excel Final eight browser data.

392
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,080
So jobs, for example.

393
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,760
Also we would need

394
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,560
in longer run, we need all these things

395
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,120
or not any

396
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,320
Greek.

397
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,280
So now,
now when we need all of this things, how

398
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,440
we will get all this things right.

399
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,280
Let's take Selenium in Java.

400
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,760
We already have in our project.

401
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,360
One question
can you it again to work feature.

402
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,080
Yeah, you'll get that.

403
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
I'm going to explain the feature. Ready.

404
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,600
So like I said, these two scenarios
I can you see you get them.

405
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,640
Okay I need to write this to

406
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,960
and menus in my
project also in my work also

407
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,320
so the place where I have to write

408
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,240
all of this to not use made
this is what we call feature

409
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,080
feature point.

410
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,960
Okay.

411
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,520
I need one place
to read all of this, this fun.

412
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,880
So now first let's make our project
predicated on this mega-project.

413
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,920
Really selenium java we have.

414
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,680
Let's knock them out.

415
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,320
We need cucumber and fine.

416
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,520
So we have one place from the region.

417
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,920
Really? A lot of these things. No,
we don't need to add jobs.

418
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,200
What is that place from where we can get
all of these things based

419
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,560
simple memory repository.

420
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,280
Right.

421
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,400
Let's go to one deposit.

422
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,720
There you go.

423
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,480
So what?

424
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,440
I said, what we need.

425
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,560
First, we need to convert

426
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:51,000
address.

427
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,760
Let me write cucumber here.
So many great cucumber.

428
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,640
I search for Google in my memory
repository

429
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,760
I got to do to merge
Java and Google merger.

430
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,160
You need in everyone's interest

431
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,480
to convert Java and to merge you you need

432
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,520
how many of you guys can see

433
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,560
now end of

434
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,280
and we can talk with

435
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,680
a lot of

436
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,400
weird guys.

437
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,720
We could

438
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,360
date I'm I'm coming I'm coming later.

439
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,360
Why not should be blossomed further
and this

440
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,320
pretty

441
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,000
nasty case I can see a lot of cucumber
files gives me a lot of cucumber

442
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,160
related definitions See it Make your top
dependencies available here.

443
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,240
Right. So we might get

444
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,840
mistook or I would see confused

445
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,520
which one to use which would be correct.

446
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,280
But when you see all this things feed

447
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,360
you see here it says I could remember.

448
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,600
Can you see this?

449
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,720
Everyone could convert GBM Java.

450
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,440
I go to the U.S.

451
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,720
Google GBM unit in folks.

452
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,160
If you were JVM Java,
but it invokes great differences here.

453
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,800
So we really to do a lot
of JVM Java with I go to the

454
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,080
end similarly

455
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,560
Gutenberg BMG unique with you with Google

456
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,360
these two starting ones we need
but I do work with

457
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,560
I wanted to put the Google unit
Java into Google

458
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,040
and restore

459
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,440
these two dependencies.

460
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,600
We need wasn't created by a mighty well.

461
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,080
I need to ask. And it was.

462
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,160
I'm not sure.

463
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,640
Basically sometimes what happens is of

464
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,160
the higher tools engineers trade

465
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,560
would actually develop
and they provide the need.

466
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,080
It's like there, it happens.

467
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,040
Also.

468
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,120
That's what I'm saying.

469
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,840
They're exporting.

470
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,360
For example, today
you are starting with syntax, right?

471
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,440
Tomorrow,
if you go to job of, let's say $100,000

472
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,240
right there, definitely a lot of companies
will try to contact you.

473
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,160
A lot of teachers will come to you
and then give you money

474
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,920
and take a photograph with you
and use the your program.

475
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,000
The other day we thought this is truly

476
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,680
the genius of our student automotive
that is very like this.

477
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,960
This is what good marketing outreach.

478
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,200
Similarly, they do all of this top three
if they see already.

479
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,920
Ziad is very useful, give him some money
and then we use our local

480
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,120
session.

481
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,760
Would

482
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,920
already so now we would use first Kimber

483
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,440
GBM java OpenID

484
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,520
open it

485
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,040
now. See the most number of downloads
here?

486
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,120
The most number of downloads.

487
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,480
I would always prefer this most groups

488
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,800
4 to 6 6.9.13

489
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,680
because a lot of people,
a lot of people, right.

490
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,520
Showing faith here in this 6.9.1.

491
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,240
Let's use
the same Let's go with the 6.9.1.

492
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,520
Can everyone see this extraordinary one

493
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,160
opening?

494
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,040
If you can see it, then open it.

495
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,920
Simple.

496
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,960
Everyone knows how to copy
the dependance from here

497
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,800
and how to add a dependency

498
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,920
symbol.

499
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,040
Make sure you're adding these
under your dependencies.

500
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,480
Take. Right.

501
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,040
So here, let's add this.

502
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,720
The first dependency we add is cucumber.

503
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,080
Joel Understood.

504
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:36,120
And this one, the one from yesterday,
one from Rudy.

505
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,440
Now let's go back and take
another one is to merge our record.

506
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,600
We need to merge unit is one correct.

507
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,520
We need to convert.

508
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,680
The unit is one.

509
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,960
So now remember I could convert again.

510
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,360
It should also be I google

511
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,760
for month where you want me to go back

512
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,320
here.

513
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,480
So selenium dependency must do with this.

514
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,560
That's what I'm seeing.

515
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,320
One is from yesterday when you spoke today
we need all these

516
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,360
dependencies right

517
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,720
now we need this Gutenberg.

518
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,000
All right, let's open it

519
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,760
again.

520
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,040
Again. You see, you can do it also. Right?

521
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,120
Uh, let's take a virgin.

522
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,480
You starting today.

523
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,520
What? Your state 6.9.1.

524
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,120
This one Also Jimmy Castro
could add folders to

525
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,000
which one?

526
00:32:49,200 --> 00:33:02,520
But is it 2.4.0?

527
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,920
Now, when I got a look.

528
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,920
So now you see in this part of the
can we use a virgin 6.9.1.

529
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,600
Right.

530
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,120
So we try to keep the same virgin
for the complete cucumber one

531
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,880
one more dependency we need to add.

532
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,000
Right.

533
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,560
So the another dependency we're going to
add is for the tumor unit and Google data.

534
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,400
Do we have 6.9.1?

535
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,600
Yes, we have 6.9.1.

536
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,080
So either we can go with this
most number of downloads, six

537
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,120
total industry or to match that uniform.

538
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,600
This we can go with 6.9.1 s,
but it's up to you which one you're using.

539
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,520
I would prefer 6.9.1
because the same dependency

540
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,440
the virgin I am using for
make it to go to Java.

541
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,880
So let's copy this logic.

542
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,120
It's copy this.

543
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,800
Great.

544
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,680
Let's copy this 6.9.1

545
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,360
without any good
because we didn't update the project.

546
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,880
Yesterday's problem only three read.

547
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,120
Now again,
just copy and paste this to Do you

548
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,840
copy this

549
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:21,560
administrative. Uh.

550
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,920
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

551
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,120
Hold your horses.

552
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,320
Wait.

553
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,760
I will tell you to upload the project.

554
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,720
I will tell you when to click on this.

555
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,280
Believe everything. Right.

556
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,760
Let me be the instructor
for two and a half hour trade

557
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,080
and then read everything

558
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,880
for Bombarding symbol.

559
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,120
Next.

560
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,200
We don't copy the code, write it create

561
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,080
and we created the project
it generates automatically.

562
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,920
We don't write anything here

563
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,440
the memo is read.

564
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,280
I know it is read,
but still task is not done yet.

565
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,720
Once we are done with the task,
it becomes blank.

566
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,560
Okay.

567
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,160
Now see, guys, I told you right.

568
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,080
We got to remember also Selenium.

569
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,680
We have no Java.

570
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,920
We now the do we have no correct.

571
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,720
No, no, no, no.

572
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,880
Wait.

573
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,960
Ease grade, please. Wait.

574
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,600
Why you always go two steps further?

575
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,360
What I'm explaining read.

576
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,080
Let's not do so now.

577
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,560
Still we need to add four. Excellent.

578
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,080
Correct.

579
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,120
We have to add the dependencies
for Excel point also.

580
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,160
Right?

581
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,880
Because in future we will use Excel.

582
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,440
Also getting.

583
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,920
But we one

584
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,560
nice nice next year

585
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,240
for next grade we will add two jars.

586
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,040
How many years?

587
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,320
Two years.

588
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,120
The first one is a budget.

589
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,960
Boy create a budget boy

590
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,680
this is the dependency
be used this Apache point common right?

591
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,280
And the another one is simple Apache boy
these are there.

592
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,040
Do we need to read our data or right

593
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,160
or replace

594
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,480
you see access to Microsoft Forward files.

595
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,440
So let's open this

596
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,760
open this and the Virgin

597
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,480
let's see 304.14.1.2.

598
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,080
Can you see everyone?

599
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,720
4.1.2304.

600
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,880
Open it.

601
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,440
Let's see this one copied

602
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,160
from Evan or did a bunch of dot boy, boy

603
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,480
I depicted this
boy Virgin is 4.1.2 copy copied

604
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,480
and this dependency is one

605
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,720
has everyone added this dependency

606
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:34,200
so is everyone with me.

607
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,360
Nice.

608
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,680
Nice.

609
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:46,400
Let's go back Go back into the word again.

610
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,160
Now another we need
Is this a budget boy or big semi

611
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,920
made Apache boy or executed

612
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,440
from here?

613
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,720
Also you see 397 downloads
right for $1 two

614
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,800
Let me click on this 4.1.24 Apache boy

615
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,320
seven schema open

616
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,400
open it

617
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,240
and copy this dependency also right

618
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,840
copy this dependency on entity.

619
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,640
So now you see the only difference

620
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,200
in between these two is just to add

621
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,520
instead of boy just write boy hyphen or x.

622
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,600
And can you see this
not only differences instead of boy

623
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,600
you're writing here boy hyper and

624
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,520
correct

625
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,000
is this correct place

626
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,920
nice nice.

627
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,120
Now now here search for

628
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,720
commons

629
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,040
common or are you

630
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,000
right so

631
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,000
commons I know

632
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,200
this is the Apache John State
Library contains utility classes

633
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,000
it's implementation find filters
competitors everything grade common

634
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,520
Apache common or simple commons title.

635
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
I'll read.
So let's take this Apache Commons.

636
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,360
I forced from here

637
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,000
to read the file
and everything in the word and we will use

638
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,720
C 2531 Most embodied on groups 2.8.0

639
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,680
so open this 2.8.0.

640
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,040
Copy this.

641
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,560
Copy this.

642
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,720
Dependency 2.8.0 Commons
by with this dependency

643
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,480
and paste it in the project

644
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
pasted in the project.

645
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,840
Nasty guys how many dependency it to us

646
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,280
so far?

647
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,400
How many dependencies we have mixed

648
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,400
lot six

649
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,320
right?

650
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,400
Today we have added five all together.

651
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:31,080
We have six correct?

652
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,200
Correct.

653
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,760
Now, now
when we have all these dependencies,

654
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,120
it means we have Java in that project,
we have Selenium in our project,

655
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,080
we have timber in our project,
we have Exxon in our project.

656
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,120
We have file later called Commons.

657
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,120
In our project,
all the libraries related to the sector

658
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,080
that we need to work on our framework.

659
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,160
We have all these things here are not

660
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,360
so 2.8.0 and

661
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,160
right, but Nason,

662
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,480
isn't it very convenient instead of adding
this much of jobs, right?

663
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,880
Because if the project increases, right,
you have to wait one for destiny,

664
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,280
two for exclude for commons 24.7
for selenium, maybe some more other jobs.

665
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,160
Enjoy it.

666
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,600
Not only increase
your project size, makes your code

667
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,520
bulkier, also makes it grade.

668
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:40,640
So it is very easy
to just add simple dependencies right now.

669
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,840
Click on this report icon everyone.

670
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,320
So you see it's reading all the files
and try to get the data right.

671
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,640
Can not connect

672
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,200
on it, which

673
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,840
I'm sure my internet is working fine

674
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,040
again.

675
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:18,840
Someone please let go of dependencies
here in the chain.

676
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,800
No, that's fine.

677
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
You see this big icon?

678
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,000
No problems on we go to trade.

679
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,880
Just try once again loading it
and then it should work.

680
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:34,360
Sometimes it happens
in creating the connection.

681
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,520
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

682
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:43,280
Enough, enough jobs in every dependencies
available in the check.

683
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,560
Think

684
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,000
your grades are very much sentimentally
based.

685
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,960
It's something you always want
to blindly like.

686
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,720
Really? Voters.

687
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,320
I say this is too one okay to still break.

688
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:12,680
Normally it's not okay to still visit.

689
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,960
I wouldn't mind. Typical.

690
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,400
But again,

691
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,000
these are there to fill in issues

692
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,440
for the Apache right?

693
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,560
So for a bunch of what we have to do with
is the reload

694
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,640
are just right click right.

695
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,480
You see this member option
inside this member option

696
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,120
you see reload project option, no problem.

697
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,320
That's great.

698
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,000
Sometimes you get it,

699
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,360
but you're able to copy best. Here it is.

700
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,920
It's already here.

701
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
That's what I'm saying.
That it should be go upgrade.

702
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,000
Did you see this apache related

703
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,200
dependencies already there
five six is bested the code in the chat.

704
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,880
If you check it.

705
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,480
Can someone please send the

706
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,360
specific dependencies this to finish this
to opportunity dependency.

707
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,720
Only one.

708
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:18,040
Only one.

709
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,960
Most of you that's always there.

710
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,360
So even if you copied, keep it with you.

711
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,280
Right when I needed.

712
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,720
I will ask

713
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:06,760
can you see one

714
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,160
dialog box coming
right on your bottom right corner? Read

715
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,240
silver bottom
right on record says Configure

716
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,000
plugin click on upgrade available.

717
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,280
Upgrade available.

718
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,400
We don't want to upgrade anything
right now.

719
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,960
It's not a problem, right?

720
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,440
This is just a warning.

721
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,880
This is six.

722
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,920
Warning means that bleep it is giving you.

723
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,400
The problem is actually
this is not a warning.

724
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,960
This is information, but they provide
information in terms of warning.

725
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,880
We're also having,
you know, Einstein brain like you was

726
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,880
experienced, always get confused.

727
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,280
Why are we having so much warning?
This is not warning.

728
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,800
This is just an update.

729
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,400
We don't really get it for Windows.

730
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,120
But on similarly, these are the updates.

731
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,040
All right.

732
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,480
If you're using the order jars
or the dependencies

733
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,280
view of the neighborhood,
so we don't click on configure plug ins.

734
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,160
If you're getting the adoption rate
for configure plugins right,

735
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,960
you have to click on that,
but for which one you're clicking.

736
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,400
So later still what it says Recommended
plugin available for Java I hope come back

737
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,240
Java. Great.

738
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,280
So it means that there's a problem
with adding that you here

739
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,720
in her dependency.

740
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,520
The problem is not with the comments,
the problem is with the one

741
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:26,000
that she added.

742
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,840
All right

743
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,400
Maryam

744
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,560
is to redirect.

745
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,960
So what needs to be done your data is

746
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,480
your is still the rate

747
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,840
then what needs to be done

748
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,960
where everybody's working their note that

749
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,120
it is yours is also all right.

750
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:51,880
Do you try this?

751
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,240
What I said right click on your project.

752
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,640
Go into Maven and reload your project

753
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,040
config plug ins.

754
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,880
Not if it is that. Yes, I did.

755
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,040
You did. Fine.

756
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,840
Then please
close your intelligent and open it again.

757
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,840
Sometimes you need to refreshed.

758
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,240
Yeah, it is just an advice.

759
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,960
If your code is working fine then
you can ignore that kind of notification.

760
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,240
All the more issues are done right.

761
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,000
There is still if it is did

762
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,120
not restart computer just

763
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:32,040
closed intelligent and open it again.

764
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,640
It was just his old effort

765
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:44,240
for work.

766
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,120
Okay.

767
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,720
Well versed is just click on this
crossword

768
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:57,760
and index it.

769
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,600
Fine. Nice.

770
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,040
Let's take one more minute.

771
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,480
So did you know she can not read anymore?

772
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,440
Thanks. That's great, William.

773
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,640
Nice. It is for
you also close, intelligent.

774
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,400
Open it again.

775
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,800
It works.

776
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,760
I'm good.

777
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:26,640
It doesn't like mine or work similar.

778
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,240
Can you do it?

779
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,160
Trade now Silva This commons

780
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,920
this commons version
you visited this particular

781
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,080
dependency

782
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,560
links.

783
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,240
See all of them is more important.

784
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,520
You what should we so does
I put it in the race

785
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,480
just to soak the moisture it amazing

786
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,960
you madam beauty straight

787
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,200
discussing each
of the how to discover radium

788
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,680
Nice.

789
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:22,400
Yes, you are correct.

790
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,040
What do we click on here?

791
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:37,000
Oh my math is still great for you.

792
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,880
It is started.

793
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,200
Then what do we click on here?

794
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,160
You don't need to click.

795
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,560
Just open your ability.

796
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,760
Just open your intelligent
and it is still very, very good.

797
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,520
It will

798
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,200
nice.

799
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,320
Now, guys, let's proceed for a bit.

800
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,400
Remember we ended for best in the exam
and we want called create Best in Geeks.

801
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,400
And how many of you guys remember

802
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,000
we edit create this exhibit date

803
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,960
from where we added that.

804
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,960
Let's run Nora

805
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,360
plugins. Great.

806
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,320
Good moment.

807
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,520
We added in the plugin. Right?

808
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,720
So to go into the plugin,
I gave you two options.

809
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:39,720
Either click on search and search
for no idea run config, no business.

810
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,520
It configuration would be a really strong
embeddable reporter plugin.

811
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,440
We are going to click on file

812
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,680
inside by will click on Settings.

813
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:56,480
Inside settings will see plugins
and inside plugins.

814
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,960
We will search here right now what
we have to search here, we have to search

815
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:07,240
timber for java.

816
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,120
Don't use your brain

817
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,320
and use this key to mcclusky
timber for scale or something.

818
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,520
Just see this option for Java.

819
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:27,720
How many of you guys can see this option?

820
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,120
Everyone can see this option. Everyone.

821
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,760
If it is not installed in your
can you be sure

822
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,680
click on file.

823
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:45,120
Click on Buy, click on Settings.

824
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,680
And then are you with me?

825
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,760
Click on Settings.

826
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,920
Invite Click on the Settings Option.

827
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,720
Inside settings
you'll see this plugins option.

828
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,480
I don't know.

829
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,560
Certainly

830
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,560
if you have a mac, just search it.

831
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,240
Then in the MAC raid
you must be having this particular version

832
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,600
in Mac,
you must be having this search option rate

833
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,000
or simply perform double shift.

834
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,440
Right.

835
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,960
Double shift.

836
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,800
So in this double shift
you will search here for plugins,

837
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,360
these are the plugins
and when you open the plugins,

838
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,680
you see this option here, correct.

839
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,720
Now here, right,
for the timber, timber for Java

840
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,200
eight

841
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:39,960
here,

842
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,080
it should be in market place.

843
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,200
Yeah it should be in market based,
not on installed,

844
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,880
it should be in market place here.

845
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,960
Simply
when you write could Google for Java

846
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,680
it ask you to click on install option
like this based on this particular part

847
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:01,480
is will click on that install it will ask
you for another option called guarantee.

848
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,320
And also I need to download.

849
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,560
There's four times
the medium just I repeated

850
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,880
don't be on installed click on contact
place.

851
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,080
Yours is uninstall.

852
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,400
Please click on market place. Yes.

853
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,040
Yes moment.

854
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,320
That's
what I'm saying when you try to install to

855
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,480
but it will ask you
to install the routine as well.

856
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,120
So yes, click yes on going again. Yes.

857
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,600
We need that also to install as well

858
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,360
and then click here on installs
is to restart do read.

859
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,680
Yes. Yes.

860
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,440
We have to.

861
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,960
What if it is already installed?

862
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,640
Then it's good. Congratulations.

863
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,240
We start to yes, yes to amendment.

864
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,760
It's fine if it is already installed
that it is fine.

865
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,000
What could be better than this
without any pain?

866
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:01,560
You already have good Google.

867
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:06,680
What I can see here is basically because
of getting a lot of errors in your Java

868
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,560
and the new selenium, you guys are
so much attached to the error.

869
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,360
So when even if your code is working
fine that they get shocked

870
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,280
by not getting the error. Yeah.

871
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:24,120
Restart 80, click, restart 80

872
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:24,840
and then

873
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,560
everyone is different experience
90 people younger.

874
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,040
I completely understand
we should install, but I do understand.

875
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,840
That's why I'm going slow.

876
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,400
Do you think I'm going fast?

877
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,080
Oliver

878
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,760
All right,

879
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,200
so everyone, everyone restart 80

880
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,720
and when you open it, read
and user identically Google.

881
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,640
I would be honest with started that

882
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:12,000
uh, if it is installed it was going
to finish already and start a moment.

883
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,160
Right? Is there already looking?

884
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,360
Because when you try to install this,

885
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,160
when you just try to install this right,
or even if you type

886
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,440
in right, it gives you
this part going to get so it didn't start.

887
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,520
Can you see

888
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,240
when you select
that it will always give you installed

889
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,200
because you already installed it
with to convert part.

890
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,480
Okay.

891
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,400
Yeah.

892
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,360
Already installed
there's automatically installed

893
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,160
also you will see
it is going to be version one.

894
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,800
No it doesn't.

895
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,400
It just type did it then you

896
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,800
are here or here.

897
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,800
Nice.

898
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,560
Nice.

899
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,480
So now no doorways.

900
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,600
I am ready right.

901
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,360
So always I am ready.

902
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,680
Now let's talk about folder structure

903
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,720
Also install it.

904
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,160
All right Nicole, do it.

905
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,600
No issues.

906
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,720
We should simply it is just a metro one.

907
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,920
Be great.

908
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:28,080
So do it.

909
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,640
Not everyone with me this

910
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,160
great.

911
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,960
Now tell me one thing.

912
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,360
In our previous project.

913
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,520
In our previous project, remember

914
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,600
we were reading the properties
using switch cases technique.

915
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:59,720
How many of you remember that?

916
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,840
So we added all those properties
in configure

917
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,560
properties by correct

918
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,240
and we added one

919
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,800
class called Configurator Class
to read those properties.

920
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:18,000
Correct.

921
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,480
Now see the same thing we needed here
as with the same thing we needed,

922
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:29,800
we're also not done.

923
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,840
We need entry. So can I copy that?

924
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:37,200
My units order and my config folder
from the previous project.

925
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,880
Can I do that

926
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,040
again?

927
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,480
Every building
otherwise can be created user

928
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,400
for heart.

929
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,640
If we created again,
then it will take a lot of time.

930
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,640
Right? So we already have that part.

931
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,560
We can use it
and then I will, I will probably basically

932
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,640
I will definitely
give you the overview of that

933
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,520
again

934
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,560
and everything we have configured ready.

935
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,720
They're going to properties by

936
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,960
we have a function to read the properties
straight

937
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,720
from the config file in configurator
I think created

938
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,600
so that if we keep repeating
the same point three or four times, then

939
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,000
believe me
we will not be able to compete on best.

940
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,160
Right.

941
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,320
So please try to understand
this is the part of your revision rate.

942
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,120
This is not the part of taking
another class for the same topic rate.

943
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,040
So please cooperate.

944
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,080
We have already
I have already got this one week back.

945
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,920
Right. So you should.

946
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,960
I was expecting this answer from you
that already we have revised school here

947
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,440
and the of of of current code

948
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:55,720
or the next level could follow

949
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,000
so now now here here

950
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,800
we have this two part
common methods and configure it

951
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,400
guys can you see

952
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,640
can anyone see this here

953
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,880
now let's see what

954
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,920
what are the things
what are the things we can take from here?

955
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,480
First we need to configurator
or first we need to consider properties

956
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,400
what we need first and

957
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,600
first we need configured properties

958
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,600
or configurator

959
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,080
first.

960
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,920
We need our properties plain.

961
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,160
Right Then we have the start properties
by then only we can read it.

962
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,280
Correct.

963
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,000
Now let me copy this config folder
from here.

964
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,840
Configuration
related part is in concrete folder.

965
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm going to copy this.

966
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,280
Copy the Florida not in me

967
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,960
one D is confident properties

968
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,240
having in this contract
for this job on one job

969
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,800
a yaml that you have to click on restart
week, week, week week.

970
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,600
We are already ahead

971
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,880
week one.

972
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,880
This is non java great.
This is not normal.

973
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,800
So now when I open my project,
which part I have

974
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,360
for non java

975
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,400
resources.

976
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,040
Correct.

977
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,880
So this time my config will go to java

978
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,040
already sources

979
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,400
and the resources.

980
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,520
Simple.

981
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,880
Let's paste it into resources.

982
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,520
Now you'll see insert resources.

983
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,960
I have config inside config.

984
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,440
I have confident properties, but

985
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,480
is this clear to everyone?

986
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,280
Is this clear to everyone?

987
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,880
What if you don't have to by Jimmy?

988
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,000
How is it possible that we don't have

989
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,240
we have to create this file date?

990
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:11,360
We created this file in an earlier project
so we already have this by.

991
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,720
Yes, correct. Correct.

992
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,720
We add this config under resources
and we copied this medium

993
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,240
from our last project
Saving computer Properties.

994
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,080
Find there.

995
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:24,560
Jimmy.

996
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:26,400
Jimmy.

997
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,680
Remember we added this
configure properties in the last project

998
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:40,760
from a stingy entry
because I missed the most class.

999
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,680
But this is not the first class Jimmy did.

1000
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:54,640
Was the last class of custody.

1001
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,440
I missed that too.

1002
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,720
Then do you mean
you have to rewatch the video?

1003
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,360
Right?

1004
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,080
Then you have to watch the video
and then you would understand

1005
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:05,200
how we did it.

1006
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,760
Now, Now
for reading this properties. Fine.

1007
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,400
Let me go to you.

1008
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,160
Which class
we are using to redo these properties.

1009
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,600
Pre nice

1010
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,120
configurator.

1011
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,120
Correct.

1012
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,280
So you see under
you have configurator I think

1013
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,360
any one thing
when we are working on one big application

1014
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:40,120
on one big application though
we need common methods

1015
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:48,960
to remodel them or not.

1016
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,640
We need common methods but it

1017
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,320
we should so can be copied.

1018
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:01,480
Is you disposed of completely or not.

1019
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,480
We can copy.

1020
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,960
Okay, so let's copy this.

1021
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,600
You this package from me.

1022
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,240
Now tell me now.

1023
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,160
Tell me this have having common methods
to configure.

1024
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,000
This is your non java

1025
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,040
And is this your

1026
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,400
So let's come here

1027
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,880
and where I have to it now
under Java three.

1028
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,440
So simply paste under Java

1029
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:35,760
simply paste it in the java.

1030
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,520
So now we have got these units job.

1031
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:44,080
See my is structure is getting a shape
now is getting ship started

1032
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,000
getting shipped first thing put under Java

1033
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,080
the very first thing we got utilities

1034
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,720
great days we got utilities here

1035
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,640
and everyone seemed

1036
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,480
to be built I'm going there.

1037
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,440
And so now if you open this,

1038
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,880
if you open

1039
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:16,520
this door, we need to change the port
in the common method.

1040
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,040
I'm. I'm coming.
I'm coming to their monitor.

1041
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:20,280
Don't worry.

1042
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:20,840
Don't worry.

1043
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,320
I'm going to give you permanent solution
for this

1044
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:24,920
boatman

1045
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,640
ordering.

1046
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,120
So now, now, wait.

1047
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,320
You see here we are getting this before
my third agreed by this before.

1048
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,760
But it is in red as of now. I'm

1049
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,560
because it is from my

1050
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,360
it is from my best engine.

1051
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:09,920
The when it is I could convert.

1052
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,720
When we are working with this dingy

1053
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,920
we don't have to double it
working with to do it.

1054
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,400
We don't have to add this dingy.

1055
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,360
So you're still in this line?

1056
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,320
Did it this line? No, don't ask me.
Why are we deleting?

1057
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:27,360
Because we don't need that.

1058
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:31,240
It disappears with your intelligence
name should be

1059
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,440
the magic,
intelligent, magical, intelligent point.

1060
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,240
It's deleted.

1061
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,080
We don't need it. So stupid. Stupid.

1062
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:39,760
I deleted

1063
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,200
similarly after method.

1064
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,480
Do we need after method?

1065
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:53,520
No, it's deleted,

1066
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,240
looks deleted also

1067
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,600
plain so from import

1068
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,360
one we destroy important

1069
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,280
So far so good everyone

1070
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:20,480
nice.

1071
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,360
All right Jimmy, if you are missing
the cluster, this is not my fault.

1072
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,040
You need to understand this.

1073
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:30,280
And even if you missed the class,
you had Monday, you had Tuesday, right?

1074
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,120
You could have voiced all of those videos
for this dingy, Right?

1075
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,880
And then we came here because this is not
the part of good Googler.

1076
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,240
This is just a part of framework
that we already did in Destiny as a don't.

1077
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,320
Right? So please try to cope with it.

1078
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,840
If I keep spending time for one student
on teaching the same again and again

1079
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,120
indefinitely, I'm doing nothing.

1080
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,960
But risking others means time
and at the same time I would do it.

1081
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,960
I have to complete our syllabus on time,

1082
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,040
right, And to make everyone understood
what I'm teaching.

1083
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:01,680
Right.

1084
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,160
So please try to complete
after this 3 hours

1085
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:09,240
you have complete 21 hours
to watch the videos and everything.

1086
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,680
Please try to do it.

1087
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,240
I am here
not only for you but also for everyone,

1088
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:14,800
right?

1089
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:19,200
So I am very much bullied, very much
cooperating with every one of you.

1090
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,160
Please try to be the same with me also.

1091
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:33,160
So there's

1092
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:35,520
there's script.

1093
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,920
Alex, There's Craig.

1094
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,320
Now then change the board to configure.

1095
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,440
What now?

1096
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,320
It's fine.

1097
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:46,320
It's fine. See,
let's talk about permanent.

1098
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,360
An dinging.

1099
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,040
The bottom of config properties
is it's a temporary solution rate.

1100
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,000
Today it is in my machine blade, so I am
waiting the bus according to my machine.

1101
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,560
Like the model,
the code will be Alex machine.

1102
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,520
So what Alex will do,

1103
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,840
Alex will provide the part
of his machine here for config properties.

1104
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,000
Correct. Alex

1105
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,160
After that day.

1106
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,000
Let's see with Alex for one,
join the company.

1107
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,840
Right. So I won't join the company.

1108
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,800
So what would happen?

1109
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,080
So one will also take the mark
in his machine.

1110
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:24,240
So again and again
we are changing this thing constantly

1111
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,960
cutting, cutting days.

1112
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:28,800
That's what we are doing.

1113
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:34,320
We are just keep changing the things

1114
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,360
fine.

1115
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,440
Well, we don't need to do it.

1116
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,400
The framework says
you have to provide a common path.

1117
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,600
That bug will be fine in every once

1118
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:48,920
machine automatically
we are going to define that.

1119
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,960
But not

1120
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,960
only the but

1121
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,680
we will define there
the beauty of three inputs.

1122
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,440
Now just understand one thing.

1123
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,160
Everyone will be having the same project
in everyone's machine, correct?

1124
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:05,040
No, no, no data repository.

1125
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,240
But that's what I'm saying moment right

1126
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,840
now. See,

1127
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,560
here we are having this particular
framework

1128
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,880
can see it.

1129
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,320
Inside this framework
we have is RC folder.

1130
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,080
Everyone can see

1131
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,320
inside is start.

1132
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,400
See we have these resources,

1133
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,520
inside resources, we have config in

1134
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,240
inside config
we have considered properties.

1135
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,800
This structure is seen across
everyone's machine

1136
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:48,440
or not. See,

1137
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,480
see, maybe users

1138
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,880
maybe saw an

1139
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,080
idea projects. Right.

1140
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,960
And then my project which is then is CRC,

1141
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,360
then resources,

1142
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,080
then config
then can be stored properties right.

1143
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:15,000
This is the
but now you see from here from this part

1144
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,520
each item is is our series
sources config config properties.

1145
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,800
This bob is seen right this

1146
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,720
this particular part is similar

1147
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,400
for everyone

1148
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,400
that is getting my point.

1149
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
This part this common for everyone.

1150
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,200
The problem is with this.

1151
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,600
But the problem is this part right?

1152
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,440
What is this part?

1153
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,080
This bar defines video
project is available

1154
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,640
where your project is available.

1155
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,880
Can you see inside your project?

1156
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,640
Once you come inside your project,
then things are common for everyone

1157
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,640
in the root path.

1158
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,360
So you see we are about
we are bothered about this part

1159
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,240
till this part, right in this part.

1160
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,280
Fine.

1161
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:08,200
So do we have any functionality
through which we can this path?

1162
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,440
So the answer is yes,
we do have this functionality.

1163
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,560
We do have this functionality.

1164
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,360
Now let me show you how this functionality
works.

1165
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,040
Great.
Let me up somewhere. Maybe somewhere

1166
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,600
in a simple

1167
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,480
John normal Java class street.

1168
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,680
Maybe in my Java projects
it we open my normal

1169
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,520
Java project.

1170
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,160
I'm just trying to show you something.

1171
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,280
I don't do anything. This

1172
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,040
is this my main method, right?

1173
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:05,080
This.

1174
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,640
I'm going to bring something.

1175
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,880
See what I'm going to bring to here.
Right?

1176
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,680
I'm going to write system Dark

1177
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,520
hit property, right?

1178
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,520
And here I'm going to write is to see

1179
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,480
first user d

1180
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,000
I user directory system dot

1181
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,240
the property
is the command of system, right?

1182
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,520
It is the command of the stock.

1183
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,800
Whether you are using your Mac machine
or you're using your windows machine.

1184
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,360
Right.

1185
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,600
If I write this particular command,

1186
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,160
identify, try to predict, see what it is,

1187
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:53,320
what it prints.

1188
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:53,880
Can you see?

1189
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:57,200
It gives me one, but it returns one part

1190
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,000
and you see everyone.

1191
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,120
Students

1192
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,440
What is this book?

1193
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,640
What is this one?

1194
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,040
This board is the root
part of your project.

1195
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,400
You see, my project name is as Dick Matt.

1196
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,040
11 Java. Right? So it rebuilds the path.

1197
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,280
It returns
the part where my project is available

1198
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,040
in the current machine.

1199
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,040
When my project is available
in the current machine

1200
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,800
right
now, let's go back here to this point.

1201
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:35,440
See, this was the problem.

1202
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,680
This was the problem for us.

1203
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,840
So this part is seen.

1204
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,880
So my favorite one right
I'm going to put is system

1205
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,160
dark gate property user data.

1206
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,720
Now, if it is running in a machine,
it will does

1207
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,240
the path of recovering the machine input
is running in Lumos machine.

1208
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:56,880
It will it?

1209
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,440
Does the model knows
machine input is running in this machine.

1210
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:05,560
It will return the path of this machine
plus by two, which is my project.

1211
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,920
So that is already same
for all the machine.

1212
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,120
Correct.

1213
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:15,000
Now when we add both these parts together,
part one and by two it means the part

1214
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,800
of what all of my files,
the files defined in my framework

1215
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,680
becomes common.

1216
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,880
It becomes common No one

1217
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,560
is indeed the permanent solution.

1218
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,320
Tell me

1219
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:47,760
so one, let's go ahead and do it.

1220
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:51,360
So now, in future.

1221
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,680
In future, tell me you just picked

1222
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,680
this particular part from you.

1223
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,800
It would close this project.

1224
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,640
Now tell me in my project,

1225
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:09,800
will this project location will despite
location configured properties, be seen?

1226
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:15,680
It will change.

1227
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,240
The fine
location will be same forever. Right?

1228
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:21,680
We cannot change schema with schema

1229
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,520
policy.

1230
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:30,400
Just kidding.

1231
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,200
All right.

1232
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:35,680
So now the location of this file
would be seen correctly.

1233
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,760
So there is this general framework
we can change the by location.

1234
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,320
Okay. It will be in this place.

1235
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:49,160
Now, the box,
the back of this file will be constant.

1236
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:55,040
The part of this vitamin
B constraint, correct?

1237
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:59,280
Is this could case similarly
if we are going to pass

1238
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,280
some does data from Excel
find it from any of the file?

1239
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,160
The part of that file
also will be construed

1240
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:08,120
right now
you'll get to your favorite topic

1241
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:13,240
if we are going to see the screenshot
summary of all the execution rate,

1242
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,520
we will always see the screenshots
of the execution in one place.

1243
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,760
So there will also be constant rate.

1244
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,960
Just thing from a wider perspective.

1245
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,240
Case.

1246
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,800
If you're using this framework
for a longer run, we have to use

1247
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,880
all of this part, correct?

1248
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:35,400
Correct.

1249
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:39,880
So now when we have to add
all of this part which had a constraint,

1250
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:44,000
it's create a new find new class going

1251
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,960
constraints class.

1252
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,960
I'm going to create a new class called
Constants Class.

1253
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,920
So in constant class,
what I'm going to do right

1254
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:00,600
this constants
classes is still under my utilities right?

1255
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,720
Because this is also not my main
part of code.

1256
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,720
The things which I need in my code,
I will write code for that

1257
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:13,520
particular part, which is coming under
the category of utilities right.

1258
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,840
So now here
the first thing, the first thing,

1259
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:21,120
if my port is not going to change,
it means or despite the

1260
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,880
end to make

1261
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,760
any entity or anything,
find them in the Java

1262
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,280
which would be used

1263
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:32,680
by making it

1264
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:35,280
read,
it means it's menu cannot be changed.

1265
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,960
So I want to use it.

1266
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,240
I want to use this part in one package.

1267
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:49,600
In one goes on in the complete project.

1268
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,360
In complete project.
I need to use this one.

1269
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,520
Replace the big project.

1270
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:56,640
We need select related public

1271
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,240
static. Why static?

1272
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,440
You know everyone right?

1273
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,120
Extending because we already

1274
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,080
wrote a couple of methods
in common methods and made them static.

1275
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,240
If anyone has any confusion,
go ahead and check these methods.

1276
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,240
We already have this method sticking it.

1277
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,040
You it

1278
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,880
so public static.

1279
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,480
I'm making it

1280
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,080
public stating and create

1281
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,600
and then I'm providing it my

1282
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,600
configuration underscore file. But

1283
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,720
this is my file.

1284
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:41,000
But I'll read. This is my file.

1285
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,960
But now remember guys,
whenever you provide any

1286
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,640
variables, whenever you provide
any variables are finding

1287
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,280
it is the standards in constants.

1288
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:56,960
In your framework,
you put those variable names in code

1289
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:02,320
gets the providing here, right
So configuration file import

1290
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:09,680
configuration from mark
and destroyed everyone.

1291
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,640
Now see how we define the path.

1292
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:14,240
I will define the path for just one grade.

1293
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,760
I will end up on
just for one C system dot good property.

1294
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:19,920
Right?

1295
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,640
So it returns the path to my project.

1296
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,080
Initialize it.

1297
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,640
It does the path in my project.

1298
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,080
Each item is virtually remember every one,

1299
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,720
but after each item is batch
what I have to do,

1300
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,760
I have to add the path of my project

1301
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,200
inside my project, the hierarchy. See?

1302
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:45,800
So what I'm going to write here, my
project in each item is batch 11, right?

1303
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,840
I got this block,

1304
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:51,680
but in this job in this batch
11 very small country property 16 minutes

1305
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,400
in a Jardim
is batch 11 under each item as batch 11

1306
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,600
Should I go

1307
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,160
first?

1308
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,320
I have to go render SAIC

1309
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,160
correct

1310
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,160
first, I should go
this RC then under is RC.

1311
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,800
I should go

1312
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,000
under

1313
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:14,560
under test.

1314
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,120
Come on here.

1315
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,840
What we have best first in is we have test

1316
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,240
under test.

1317
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,520
We have our

1318
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,040
resources.

1319
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:31,080
Under resources we have on config,

1320
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,760
under config we have our config told

1321
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,080
these point.

1322
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:44,160
Is this clear to everyone?

1323
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,760
Is this clear to everyone?

1324
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,000
No. Now we need this,

1325
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,880
but in terms of string
because it returns the string.

1326
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:54,600
Why I'm seeing the string.

1327
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,320
You go in your common
methods, you see your passing.

1328
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,760
This file partner
dumps of the string or not. Then

1329
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,760
it is returning the bottom of a string.

1330
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,040
So now, now try to match this.

1331
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:12,240
Is this the part of your project Slash?

1332
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,080
This is the part of the hierarchy
of folder in your project,

1333
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,000
Correct.

1334
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,920
So this
part we got was this term property.

1335
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,600
This block
and this part were defined, right?

1336
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,520
This pathway defined.

1337
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:31,840
But here, here you see when I use RAID,
just add one keyword called the string.

1338
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,880
So now you see the moment you add string,

1339
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,440
it will return the bottom
string of one week.

1340
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:42,320
Now this is the absolute part,
but even the absolute part,

1341
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:46,480
which is providing you the value,
it is completely customizable

1342
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:51,280
and it is common to all machines,
it is common to all the machines.

1343
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,960
So now this part clear to everyone,
one Mark

1344
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,800
and me, this post

1345
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:05,960
this, but clear to everyone.

1346
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:06,960
Nice.

1347
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:11,200
Let's come to our common methods
now Let's come to our common methods

1348
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,440
and see how things
are going to change. Now

1349
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:18,040
in my common methods.

1350
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,080
In my common methods,

1351
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:24,000
I don't need this particular
but let me put this part.

1352
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,000
I don't need this part. Now

1353
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,480
then what else I have to do

1354
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:34,680
is I can simply call my constant class
dark.

1355
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,880
It's this configuration file.

1356
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:39,760
That's it,

1357
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,240
That's it.

1358
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:45,360
Now this is
this is something great common to everyone

1359
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,240
days.

1360
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,520
Even if machine is changing.

1361
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,480
Even if people are changing.

1362
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:56,160
Even if you're not in line with this
changing this code is not going to change.

1363
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,840
And if this code is not going to change,
right, it will always return the path.

1364
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,360
Wherever
my code is running on that machine.

1365
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,200
Correct.

1366
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:07,000
So that's how we will always find this

1367
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,160
properties irrespective of big form.

1368
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:15,720
It was but the of machine it is your team
member understood we made it global

1369
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:20,200
according to every single
machine using constants plus

1370
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,600
this part we want

1371
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,640
is getting

1372
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,920
rid of this

1373
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,360
so far

1374
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,960
is there anyone who has any question
about this particular part?

1375
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,080
What we did

1376
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:57,440
is that anyone who has any question,
somebody expert,

1377
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,360
great man, nice.

1378
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:02,520
Good to hear.

1379
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:06,280
So after break, I'm

1380
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:10,440
going to give you a very good,
you know, surprise in this project.

1381
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,880
We didn't do anything it maybe
we don't need to carry glue carrying.

1382
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,920
I will give you a very good thing

1383
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,000
straight after the big raid

1384
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,960
or six gigs I got from my students

1385
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:43,160
and my friend just put.

1386
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,120
But it's the U.S.

1387
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:48,480
idea to see its user.

1388
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,520
Don't be afraid

1389
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,640
that you can check

1390
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,040
your user data.

1391
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:58,840
Correct.

1392
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,200
I didn't really get about so user directly

1393
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:05,600
or this is a command trade
instead of user territory.

1394
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:10,000
If you the user dot or is that it
returns on which operating system

1395
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,440
your device is working,
which operating system you have.

1396
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:14,720
Right.

1397
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,040
Similarly here for user,

1398
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,600
if you provide the does
the root part of the project

1399
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,240
in which project
you are executing this command already.

1400
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,000
That's why we're using this command.

1401
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,680
So against the path of your current
project in every machine now in just

1402
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:39,960
here, we need to create

1403
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:43,320
this class which this class

1404
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,800
I didn't create any test class anywhere.

1405
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:51,800
If we are using main,
then we should always be a no, no, no, no.

1406
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:55,800
We have to use only user to the same,
the same for

1407
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,720
the one between no matter what.

1408
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,680
Like I said, I showed that to you.

1409
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:04,280
I brought you not to do anything
just to show you the output.

1410
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:06,520
I use that project.

1411
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:10,320
It just uses computing constants
on these common methods.

1412
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:19,800
This is your common method.

1413
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,880
This is just only line. We it.

1414
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:24,880
You'll see not even the complete line be

1415
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,880
just this, but

1416
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:45,160
fine.

1417
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,320
All right, guys.

1418
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,120
So far, so good.

1419
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:52,360
Everyone.

1420
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:52,920
Great.

1421
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,200
Let's take a break for maybe 10 minutes.

1422
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,960
23, not much break, 20 minutes
and let's connect it.

1423
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:09,000
715 once again,
I think 12 minutes to 11 minutes.

1424
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,160
But you can manage eight
because the important things to do

1425
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:18,440
and I'm hungry I don't want and then find
and then take a break for 15 minutes.

1426
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,320
You give the reason why

1427
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:25,240
I can't see anything in that you have to

1428
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:29,120
explain.

1429
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,680
No, I mean, it is weird.

1430
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,800
We think we're doing it very quick.

1431
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,920
In my companies,
you go, you have to spend.

1432
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,280
It is two weeks,
three weeks to create a framework.

1433
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:41,920
It takes time because it's
not only about writing the book.

1434
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,240
It's all about
understanding the 15 minutes.

1435
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:48,280
And from seven five
we are going to start the break break.

1436
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,560
So I meant, yes, it's normal.

1437
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,000
Everyone takes this much of time
because this is one time activity.

1438
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,880
You have to do it with full concentration.

1439
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:57,440
Great.

1440
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,440
Everything you have to plan,
you have to add because

1441
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:05,480
things are going to be saved today.

1442
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:09,240
But this is the very quick
and we're doing it very quickly

1443
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:12,040
because in my company,
when I created the framework

1444
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,360
already is
we are on day four of a big minutes.

1445
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,240
You guys can go for a big commendation

1446
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,120
or it can ensure constant speech.

1447
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:26,800
He doesn't start training this group,

1448
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,640
constant speech that you

1449
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:38,240
so this can suit.

1450
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:38,760
You know what?

1451
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,200
I started the record I started already

1452
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,400
think so.

1453
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,480
Now, first

1454
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:49,440
let me commit this code in the repository
because people are asking for this.

1455
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:52,240
Okay, so let me do it

1456
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:37,200
now. You'll see the code is available.

1457
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:37,920
Alright.

1458
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,520
Many of you were asking the code
what is available in the repository.

1459
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,800
And this is the
you are right so let me copy this.

1460
01:30:45,800 --> 01:31:19,040
You want to do is give me a moment.

1461
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,600
All right.
Let me shared the repository with you.

1462
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,320
So there
you guys can also have the same thing

1463
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:35,080
do to guys

1464
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:45,120
getting my great

1465
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:50,360
So now so far
right so far what we did right

1466
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:55,920
we did are common methods right
in the common methods we added my bot

1467
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:01,080
which is constant but right I did one path
which is constraint path from here.

1468
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,240
This path is not going change.

1469
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:04,640
Even my machine changes

1470
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:09,240
or everything will change,
but it will always return me the same path

1471
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:13,000
because the location of my vine
is not going to change.

1472
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:20,320
Is this clear?

1473
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:20,760
Great.

1474
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,240
Now, now let's talk about another problem.

1475
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,640
Great. Let's about another problem.

1476
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:30,440
And now see,
this is another magical time, right?

1477
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:34,400
Under the mitigation
when we talk about this call driver

1478
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:39,360
easy bar or Google Driver easy bar
or better driver or the exit battery.

1479
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,040
The problem

1480
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,320
with this the problem with this is

1481
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,520
sometimes get that Google

1482
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:49,680
driver executable does not exist, Right?

1483
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,160
The Chrome executable does not exist.

1484
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:53,440
Correct.

1485
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,120
This kind of problem, we get, isn't it?

1486
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,680
This type of problem we get students

1487
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:04,800
Sometimes

1488
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,760
what happens is the copy and paste it.

1489
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:11,120
We copy and paste this particular drivers
folder here

1490
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:11,880
in this

1491
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:15,760
correct.

1492
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:19,560
Sometimes we provide here and there,
so the path is not available.

1493
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,880
Sometimes what happens if you are?

1494
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:25,000
Did your Chrome browser from 95 to 90

1495
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,360
6 to 97, 98 or any other one? Right.

1496
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:32,400
And if your browser is not compatible
with your driver,

1497
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:36,000
then it gets screwed every time
you have to update your browser.

1498
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,920
Correct? Correct.

1499
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,280
These are the problems
you guys have been facing or not.

1500
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:43,280
Tell me now.

1501
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,640
No. Five people.

1502
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:48,240
Let's see if five people
are working in your team and.

1503
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:51,080
Five people are having obviously five
different machines.

1504
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:51,920
Right?

1505
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,040
So if I people are I think I have
different which it's maybe possible,

1506
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:59,400
then I shall go to the updated version
of the groups and 495

1507
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:03,480
But the another people like I'm around in
Hasim are they're still using virgin

1508
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,840
86 thromboembolism. Right.

1509
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:10,280
So the other driver driver
and you guys are using

1510
01:34:10,440 --> 01:35:04,840
just a wide.

1511
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,840
All right so now

1512
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:11,880
now here see because of this problem
what happened

1513
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:16,120
some time is your driver is not compatible
with your web browser.

1514
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,000
Every other team
member is using the different part

1515
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,560
rate,
different versions of the browser. Right.

1516
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,960
Everyone can use a different folder
structure for keeping their driver.

1517
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:30,960
And if you keep chrome driver,
the good driver or better driver

1518
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:34,040
supported driver rate on each driver

1519
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:37,560
in your one particular folder,
read one particular project.

1520
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,640
It makes your code bulkier.

1521
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,680
It increases the stability of the
increases the size of your project grade.

1522
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,200
This all problems we would be having
if we aid this particular part

1523
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,760
of our industrial

1524
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:52,920
industry.

1525
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:54,720
We are having all of these problems.

1526
01:35:54,720 --> 01:36:00,000
So now, now in our framework, right,
we have one functionality

1527
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:04,520
through which we can still launch the
browser without the driver

1528
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:08,720
getting my point.

1529
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:11,040
This is the catch guys in the framework.

1530
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,160
Remember,
we don't need to add a new drivers folder.

1531
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,400
We don't need to add anybody except right.

1532
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:22,280
We don't need to provide all of this box
system property with driver cool driver.

1533
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,480
We don't need to provide anything
like this.

1534
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:25,480
Getting my point.

1535
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,960
What I'm trying to explain here

1536
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,760
students Right.

1537
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,400
Then the question is
if we don't need drivers folder,

1538
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:39,280
if we don't need call driver
or to exceed or any driver or be exist

1539
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:43,720
and if we don't, is the standard set
property driver not called driver.

1540
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,880
If we don't need all of these things,
then what else do we need?

1541
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,160
So the answer is we need one simple

1542
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,800
dependency from our memory repository.

1543
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:59,840
This is what we call bad driver manager.

1544
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:05,400
What we need to do is we need one
simple dependency from memory repository.

1545
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:08,880
Go there, driver, manage it right.

1546
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,840
Just be the web driver
manager, rate it as a single word.

1547
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,400
Web driver manage it.

1548
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,360
Got it

1549
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:20,840
Correct

1550
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:28,400
yaml Why you always ask question
one is don't for that I'm coming to

1551
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:33,240
that point rate if you see what happens
is your good your intelligent.

1552
01:37:33,240 --> 01:37:34,840
I totally respect that.

1553
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:38,320
But others are getting confused.

1554
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:41,200
Please try to take care
of all of your teammates and colleagues.

1555
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:41,440
Right.

1556
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:46,440
I'm going to that point this driver
manager dependency we need to end now.

1557
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:47,440
You see here

1558
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:51,720
also we are having the driver manager yet
also we are having a driver manager.

1559
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:54,480
What we need with this bony Garcia.

1560
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,520
We need this bony Garcia.

1561
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,680
Alright, I want Andy Garcia and everyone

1562
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:06,840
see this.

1563
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,280
Can everyone see this? Whatever.

1564
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:11,640
Manager You have got Bony Garcia Right.

1565
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:12,960
Open word.

1566
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,120
Driver Manager
Open this driver manager guys.

1567
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:22,000
Everyone, everyone

1568
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:25,040
open it or not.

1569
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:31,440
Now we see 3.8.1
is having the most number of downloads.

1570
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,520
68 3.8.

1571
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:37,800
right. Just take this 3.8.1

1572
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,240
Just take this 3.8.1

1573
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:46,640
Copy this dependency and now you know
better than me how to build in

1574
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:50,520
senior project
just to go under your dependency rate

1575
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:54,000
in this dependency and the here

1576
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:59,480
at this point and see here

1577
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:01,600
I got this web driver manager to

1578
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,160
go to

1579
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,160
as everyone

1580
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:20,160
is dependency driver manager.

1581
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:24,080
Let's click on this one project
and you'll see this VM

1582
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:30,000
driver
manager is available in your project.

1583
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,040
Is there anyone who's getting the error

1584
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:37,720
here?

1585
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,960
I remember expecting that.

1586
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:43,280
Great.

1587
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:47,280
And you can close with Intelligent Train
now see now

1588
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:50,840
see the use use of this particular driver
manager.

1589
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:51,720
Very important point.

1590
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,800
I see

1591
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:57,640
if I open this, if I open this common
metrics first, like I said,

1592
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:01,960
we don't need this path
related stuff anymore.

1593
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:07,840
We don't need this part related stop
any more ability.

1594
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,760
See what I deleted
the system not set proper DB driver

1595
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,640
or group load driver is RC driver or DC.

1596
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:19,440
I deleted this point why I deleted this

1597
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:23,000
because I am going to use here
one very good thing called

1598
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,920
bad driver

1599
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:38,040
manager.

1600
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,840
It's asking for import class.

1601
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,520
Let's import this class driver manager not

1602
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:47,120
can you see it is giving me chrome driver

1603
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:50,160
edge driver Firefox driver

1604
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,640
either driver or beta driver.

1605
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:55,400
Can you see I use all of these drivers.

1606
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:59,360
It is giving me.

1607
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,880
Just click on chrome driver here
and then don't

1608
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:06,960
send up is the command we have right now.

1609
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,320
What this one line does right
this particular one line them

1610
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:18,280
driver manager big skip of your browser
whatever the browser you're using

1611
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:24,440
it will give you the compatible version
of web driver which is compatible

1612
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:28,920
with your current browser,
and it executes your script every time.

1613
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:31,920
So now
you don't need to go through the drivers

1614
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,040
folder, you don't need to take care of it
or the exit point.

1615
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,000
You don't need to be concerned
about your compatibility of your web

1616
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,280
driver,
nor the acceleration or rate one symbol.

1617
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:44,080
Come on.

1618
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,640
Similarly here also you can change this

1619
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:51,520
to web driver
manager dot Firefox driver door setup.

1620
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:51,920
Come on.

1621
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:54,000
Right.

1622
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,600
So if it
is chrome it will use the chrome driver.

1623
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,800
It will be inspired folks,
it will use the Firefox branch

1624
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,080
is an easy to use

1625
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:09,000
is now no more hardcoded for any better.

1626
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:11,760
No more hardcoded part.

1627
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:15,920
Right case

1628
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:31,920
when the new browser of

1629
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,080
what browser has to do with dependencies.

1630
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:35,360
One month

1631
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:40,600
Omron Omron.

1632
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:43,080
Can you be stable driver manager
like this?

1633
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,240
Did you take like this web
driver manager take

1634
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,440
spending

1635
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:54,560
or not went see

1636
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:58,680
driver
manager is the one that had to be used for

1637
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:02,680
chrome driver Firefox driver Everybody
except by what's the name.

1638
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:04,680
The driver is still selenium driver.

1639
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:05,400
Okay,

1640
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:08,080
we don't need to change this driver.

1641
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,760
This driver is the interpreter.

1642
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,160
Goodwin to implement.

1643
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,440
So these are two different things.

1644
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:14,000
Don't get confused with this.

1645
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,960
Okay?

1646
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:20,880
You see you are getting the web driver
from selenium

1647
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:24,640
and you see.

1648
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,520
No, no, no.

1649
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:27,480
There's what I'm saying.

1650
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,920
It has nothing to do with the ability.
There's nothing to do.

1651
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:34,040
It is automatically connected
to the central deposit rate.

1652
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:36,240
So based on your browser. Right.

1653
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:41,520
It will give you the new one.

1654
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,560
You don't need to get a new web driver
dependency code.

1655
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,200
The same one will work.

1656
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:51,120
Don't worry about it.

1657
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:53,160
In between work, I'm sure. Sure.

1658
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,200
So now you see this web driver manager it.

1659
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,480
Why we using this web driver manager

1660
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:04,720
part Alex Because we had a lot of issues
with control or directly

1661
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:08,600
to manage for these drivers
compatibility part.

1662
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:12,840
If my web driver is compatible
with my web browser or the bodies,

1663
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:16,440
correct or not, if the party's
not going to do a lot of visuals, fonts

1664
01:44:16,440 --> 01:44:20,360
are going to change according to the file,
every single thing, right?

1665
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:24,240
So to get rid of this problem,
we came up with a solution called web

1666
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,920
driver manager.

1667
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,640
The first thing is you'll see
in my project there is no not the driver,

1668
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:34,400
no Chrome primary, zero five or nothing.

1669
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,040
I hope you Why?

1670
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:38,760
Because driver manager itself

1671
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:41,880
provide the instance itself.

1672
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:45,960
Provide the instance of the driver
which is compatible to your web browser

1673
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,440
and attitude

1674
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:53,400
and the students.

1675
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:56,560
And that's why we're using this MLC.

1676
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:00,120
What I work Driver, manager,
Darkroom driver Don't skip.

1677
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:05,280
So it will set up the browser for you,
the driver manager or Firefox Driver.

1678
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:05,840
Don't set them.

1679
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:10,000
It will set up the driver for you
and then you can simply initialize

1680
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,560
your Firefox chamber
using your this particular part.

1681
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:16,440
Is it good?

1682
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:29,520
So far what everyone is required.

1683
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,120
Great. Great.

1684
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:35,160
Now time to do that insulin.

1685
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,120
You want to, uh,

1686
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:40,720
to do all of those things in selenium
and you need to have a big management boot

1687
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:45,440
such as you can see
straight into a dependency.

1688
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,400
We should this type of tool
where we can make all of these things

1689
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:51,960
and that is just a
project, this is a frame and

1690
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,840
please do I, please.

1691
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,200
Do you see the driver spinning is wrong
in your web driver manager.

1692
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,880
The spinning of your driver is wrong.

1693
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:10,200
Your right to date.

1694
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:14,240
Whenever you do this,
I always tell you to copy this part.

1695
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,560
When you type trade,
you get to see the driver.

1696
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:18,880
So it is giving you their job.

1697
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,240
Don't press. Enter and use this.

1698
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:24,960
If you're naked,
then definitely gives you a few mistakes.

1699
01:46:25,120 --> 01:46:27,520
Please take look this me

1700
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:37,640
copy.

1701
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:38,280
Fine.

1702
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,160
So for any question this

1703
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:54,920
use of principles and success.

1704
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:56,120
Correct?

1705
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,480
Correct.

1706
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,520
So now, now let's go ahead

1707
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:04,840
and write one very basic feature.

1708
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,880
Like Come here, Come here

1709
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:10,560
flows to great for
makes it also we just not

1710
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:14,520
know if you'll see right If you see

1711
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:20,640
what I'm seeing,
I need to take just one thing.

1712
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:25,560
This is given user is open browser
and to each item is

1713
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,280
correct and user logged in is an element.

1714
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:32,160
So to simplify
this particular is to generate

1715
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,840
user interface by username and password.

1716
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:38,120
When user enters username and password
and user clicks

1717
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:41,160
on login, it
all of these things we can do.

1718
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:46,040
So let's do one very basic scenario, one
very basic scenario

1719
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:53,600
and ridiculous.

1720
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:57,280
What I'm going to explain is here
see for logging part

1721
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,920
now tell me now

1722
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:02,840
if I'm going to write in this scenario
like this in feature find it is just one

1723
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:03,400
on Java

1724
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,440
it is non Java.

1725
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,280
Okay.

1726
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:12,520
And how
many feature I can have in one project,

1727
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:17,040
how many feature I can name in one project

1728
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:20,520
multiple features.

1729
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:23,160
Right. Correctly multiple features
like in here.

1730
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:26,640
So what I will do
the way I created config,

1731
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:31,240
I will create another folder here under
it will go feature.

1732
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:32,440
Right.

1733
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:35,280
So all the features made only

1734
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:38,760
I'm going to provide under this features

1735
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,640
database.

1736
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,160
So let's talk about a very simple feature
first

1737
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,720
and talking about logging
regional logging feature.

1738
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,840
So like I said, to create any feature
by what is the extension

1739
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,440
we have deployed

1740
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:00,040
guys to create any pie.

1741
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:07,080
What is the extension
you have to provide for me to find on log?

1742
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:10,560
I know where this is
different from property.

1743
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:15,440
We create features under resources
just connect by election data resources

1744
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:18,440
because feature is a known double
bar plate.

1745
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:21,760
This is simple. Like this. Correct?

1746
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,120
So this is what plain simple text.

1747
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:26,240
It has nothing to do with Java.

1748
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:29,960
That's why you're creating everything
which is non Java resources.

1749
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,640
This is the meaning of our framework.

1750
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,400
So now let me right click on the features

1751
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:38,120
folder, go on to new,

1752
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:43,320
click on file again in my building
and I click on Features Order.

1753
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:48,440
Go to new, click on file, click on file
and here I am waiting logging

1754
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,240
dot feature.

1755
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:54,080
Remember loading dot feature not features

1756
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,640
feature with small if not completely live

1757
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:58,080
great

1758
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:00,680
click.

1759
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:03,200
Can you see one
beautiful gloss created here

1760
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,800
with the green icon

1761
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:09,120
to decompress of timber?

1762
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:20,480
Can everyone see this?

1763
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,840
Get it.

1764
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,640
Got it.

1765
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,680
So now.

1766
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:28,480
Now there are
some rules need to get updates

1767
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:33,240
first because this is my feature,
I have to provide the name of my feature.

1768
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,480
So see the moment.

1769
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:39,600
I think if this should be the first line
of your feature, always remember

1770
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:43,200
this should be the first night
of your feature you have to provide.

1771
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:47,120
So it is my future.

1772
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:49,800
What you did about what you are saying.

1773
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:53,720
Sorry.

1774
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:54,560
Okay.

1775
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:57,480
Right click on Features Related.

1776
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:02,560
Right Click on Features
Going to new Click on file

1777
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,600
and here type logging dot feature.

1778
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:10,800
The only logging or feature press enter
and you will see this right

1779
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:18,800
now. Understood.

1780
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,680
Now see the moment I press beta.

1781
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:23,040
It's not taking me
here, it's taking me here.

1782
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:26,240
It means whatever the things
and when you write, these

1783
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,640
things will be in my feature all.

1784
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:31,880
Now tell me,
when we were writing this part,

1785
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:35,400
I told you
this are two different scenario.

1786
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:36,120
Correct?

1787
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:39,440
I told you guys
these are two different scenario or not.

1788
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:46,160
And now when I say two different scenario,

1789
01:51:46,160 --> 01:51:49,360
right now I'm talking about only log
in feature, right?

1790
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:54,560
So let me write exists scenario
scenario outlines scenario template.

1791
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,200
We will use simple scenario as of now.

1792
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:00,520
So again because the way I provided

1793
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:04,120
name to feature, I will provide the name
to scenario visible.

1794
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:07,440
So the name to scenario
is there see embedded

1795
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:09,360
in me

1796
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:12,720
correct.

1797
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:13,680
There is.

1798
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,360
Is this correct?

1799
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:16,400
So what I'm doing

1800
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,120
the name of the scenario I provided,

1801
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,760
it's valid me logging

1802
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:26,720
now here.

1803
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:29,080
Here let me write first precondition.

1804
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:34,200
So my precondition is given
user is connected

1805
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:41,280
to picture and this.

1806
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,040
Correct? Correct.

1807
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:46,720
And this is my precondition
for logging in case

1808
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:50,520
I have opened my application,
I have to open my application.

1809
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:53,800
This should be my first precondition.

1810
01:52:54,240 --> 01:53:01,600
Is this correct?

1811
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:05,200
Now, after this been

1812
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:10,400
on when a user enters

1813
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:14,280
prelude to me.

1814
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:17,120
So and the password

1815
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:21,280
and user

1816
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:25,320
takes on

1817
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:28,400
log input and then

1818
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:33,400
the main user is

1819
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,560
successfully

1820
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:42,560
is this the correct this in any

1821
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,520
given is a precondition when in

1822
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:50,720
and are the actions in then is the bar
then is the part right.

1823
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:52,560
Which is my expectation.

1824
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:53,920
Then I can

1825
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,120
provide some verification or whatever
I want from

1826
01:53:57,400 --> 01:53:59,640
the same thing
we were doing in this dingy.

1827
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:04,120
But with the code now the same thing
that we do here with this fight.

1828
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:10,320
So remember the example of playing
this time with Jane comes, you see, right.

1829
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:12,840
You have to show this particular
feature to them.

1830
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:16,360
I before everyone prefers this,
that's what I am.

1831
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:17,240
The question for you.

1832
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:17,800
Please go ahead.

1833
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:34,040
So this is good.

1834
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:42,200
So the question for me.

1835
01:54:42,200 --> 01:54:43,440
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

1836
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:44,880
I'm coming to that point.

1837
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,200
I'm going to explain point dude. Okay.

1838
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:52,000
So now the next point
explains the explain.

1839
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:56,160
So now you see here, right
when I'm writing

1840
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:59,640
this feature, find
my steps are highlighted.

1841
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:03,200
Can you see my steps are highlighted.

1842
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:05,800
There's the keyword of Katoomba.

1843
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:06,360
No, no, no.

1844
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:10,280
The keyword of to do what is given when
and then my steps are highlighted.

1845
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,680
That's what I'm seeing.

1846
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:13,960
Who is this

1847
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,360
loophole?

1848
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:18,200
Great, great.

1849
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,880
But don't believe the date.

1850
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:23,960
Why? Because see the steps
I have written over here.

1851
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:27,360
Write this on your unimplemented steps.

1852
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:29,840
But is it unimplemented steps?

1853
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,000
It means the code base.

1854
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,040
Please focus here.

1855
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,120
Please focus here the code.

1856
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:42,040
Read the code which I need to write
related to this particular steps.

1857
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:43,040
Right.

1858
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:45,960
That code
I need to rage at one particular place.

1859
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,760
So from there, before going,
before going there,

1860
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:55,520
what I have to do,
I have to actually implement the steps.

1861
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:00,360
This is what we call this step
definition, what we call it grace

1862
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:03,720
days.

1863
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:06,120
This is your steps declaration.

1864
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:08,520
Now we need the step definition.

1865
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:11,280
Remember the example of step
as I told you straight.

1866
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:13,920
So this is a step declaration.

1867
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,320
We need steps definition.

1868
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:19,720
Okay, so now for all the steps.

1869
01:56:19,720 --> 01:56:21,880
For all the steps which we Right.

1870
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:24,000
This is your Java code, right?

1871
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,320
This is your Java code.

1872
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:27,880
So the Java could be right under
which folder

1873
01:56:30,920 --> 01:56:32,880
Denmark would be entering the Java.

1874
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:35,400
So let's create one package in this Java.

1875
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,760
It's create one package in this Java trade

1876
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:41,920
and this package name should be your steps

1877
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:46,120
should be read and then we'll create
multiple classes or steps.

1878
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,760
But for now, this is your steps.

1879
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:51,920
So for my log in religion steps,

1880
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:55,040
I will write in which steps
in log into steps.

1881
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:55,840
Correct.

1882
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:59,640
So let me right here
we create normal Java class

1883
01:57:00,240 --> 01:57:03,480
for this particular step
because my log in pages there.

1884
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:06,800
So I will try to, you know, get this text.

1885
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:10,400
This is my new plus.

1886
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:16,320
This is my new class, which I did
so that when I create all of the steps

1887
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:19,240
from here, I will keep all this

1888
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:21,840
steps here inside this class.

1889
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:25,720
So now see,
how segregated is this related to log in.

1890
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:27,720
All the scenarios will be log in feature

1891
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:30,480
related to this feature.

1892
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,680
Whatever steps I have, I will wait.

1893
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:36,480
I can find it in log in two steps,
say one place for one thing.

1894
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:39,360
Now come here again.

1895
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,520
Can you see this particular option?

1896
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:42,840
Can you see this particular option?

1897
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:45,240
It says that I'm based in features, right?

1898
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:50,160
How many of you guys can have this option?

1899
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:52,320
Everyone is having great.

1900
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:57,120
Or or, you know, one more thing to right
click and it gives you the feature

1901
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:00,840
logging in there, feature file
you can delete from here,

1902
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:04,080
you can delete it from here,
you can read from here

1903
01:58:04,360 --> 01:58:06,120
or you can run it from here as well.

1904
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:07,920
Just ready to and feature logging.

1905
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:09,440
So when you

1906
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:13,200
actually run your feature,
actually run your feature,

1907
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:20,560
it gives you pre-made automated code,
it gives you this particular code, right?

1908
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:25,920
You see it says you can implement
the missing steps with this back below.

1909
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:29,520
So you don't need the code you want,
it gives you the code as well.

1910
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:32,400
See the complete code it is keeping you.

1911
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:33,680
Can you see

1912
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:37,920
it is giving you the complete code

1913
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:42,440
to see.

1914
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:44,800
Now just going through the log in steps.

1915
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:45,920
Right.

1916
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:47,240
Just go into the log in.

1917
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:49,920
This is I'm doing good to the log in.

1918
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:54,440
Two steps in here
simply based this particular code

1919
01:58:56,240 --> 01:58:58,200
base to this particular code here

1920
01:58:58,200 --> 01:59:02,160
and then see just import
all of this keyword.

1921
01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:05,920
It is giving you this keyword
when and import it.

1922
01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:15,280
Just input all this keywords.

1923
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:21,480
If you guys done it,
everybody's done it every month.

1924
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:22,760
So far so good. Everyone

1925
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:28,440
through the

1926
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:44,400
what happened.

1927
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:47,000
Can you go back to the logging feature
for a second.

1928
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,200
Yes, sure.

1929
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,480
This is logged into a feature now.

1930
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:54,760
You'll see the moment implemented
all the steps

1931
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,760
right

1932
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:03,120
veterans in and you will now my x element

1933
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:06,880
different because different providers

1934
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:19,360
in it please post
those are big support right?

1935
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:21,960
One must be there to help you other ways.

1936
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:24,320
Can you you

1937
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:27,360
right

1938
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:30,480
and even still,
if you're not able to solve your issues

1939
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:41,400
then do let me know.

1940
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:55,000
But sort of in book classes

1941
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,960
because it should root for a given
when then we don't need to import classes,

1942
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,280
so we need to import this particular
keywords,

1943
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:06,120
these particular keywords.

1944
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:10,000
We need to import all of this keywords.

1945
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,280
I'm coming to that

1946
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:13,400
one, Rick

1947
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:15,560
So we have to import it.

1948
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:17,080
The moment you mouse over, right?

1949
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:20,120
It asks you amendment, it asks to do this.

1950
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:20,960
All right.

1951
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:25,320
So far, so far,
everyone is with me here at this point.

1952
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:27,360
Is everyone with me in this point

1953
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,160
nice?

1954
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:40,000
No. Now I'm going to right here expands

1955
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:45,320
is which class I have to extend here
for my unique web browser Web driver.

1956
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:48,480
Which class where I'm having

1957
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,040
common methods.

1958
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:56,040
Config configurator is the one
that I'm reading the properties.

1959
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:59,200
The. Yes,
I'm going to use my common methods.

1960
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:02,880
Now you see you guys know very well
what is framework

1961
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,920
Common methods.

1962
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:06,840
No, no.

1963
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:09,560
See how easy it is now?
See how easy it is.

1964
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:13,560
It says user is navigating to a job
in this application.

1965
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:17,600
It means launching browser
and providing that you

1966
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:20,960
what do we have anything to boot
this particular action?

1967
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:31,280
Do we have anything to perform
this particular action?

1968
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:31,720
There is.

1969
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:33,720
We have it.

1970
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:34,800
What we had.

1971
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:39,240
If you see in my common methods,
in my common methods, we have this

1972
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:42,560
particular method called Browse open
browser launch application,

1973
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:46,000
read.

1974
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,760
We have all this pertinent.

1975
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:52,320
So now see what I do

1976
02:02:53,480 --> 02:02:57,600
in my in my log in a step it it's easy.

1977
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,080
It's not only giving you the audacity,
but it also gives you instruction.

1978
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:05,280
It says right good here
that runs the phrase big

1979
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:09,440
does the phrase above
and to concrete actions it means

1980
02:03:09,720 --> 02:03:12,440
this is just explanation, right

1981
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:15,760
good here
to implement this particular step.

1982
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:21,360
So how we can implement this particular
is to simply remove both this claim

1983
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:26,200
from here boot this line from here
and read the name of your method.

1984
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:27,680
That's it.

1985
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:32,080
Since your method is the static rate,
you can directly it automatic and you see

1986
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:34,040
can you see

1987
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:47,160
here now.

1988
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,600
Now here.

1989
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:53,880
Alexi, you like it?

1990
02:03:53,880 --> 02:04:00,040
Great.

1991
02:04:00,040 --> 02:04:01,920
I'm exception.

1992
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:04,320
Just remove this line Remove this line

1993
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:07,440
Also remove this line
then you'll be okay when you

1994
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:09,280
remove this line.

1995
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:12,200
But for straight.

1996
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:13,320
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1997
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:18,280
But if you only will want this lines
from here then it will not give you any or

1998
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:27,160
it will not give you any.

1999
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:27,880
Fine.

2000
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:31,440
So guys, tell me, do we have
we have a good to enter

2001
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,880
username password,

2002
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,480
but we have a code to enter username

2003
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:42,360
and password.

2004
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,880
Yes. One.

2005
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:45,920
We have a code right in this dingy

2006
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:49,040
and talking about the basic login rate.

2007
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:52,120
We have a good in this to detect

2008
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:56,960
properties that are.

2009
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,400
No, no, no.

2010
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:59,200
You're not using this driver.

2011
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,800
Don't find element like this driver

2012
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:05,640
but don't use the same keys.

2013
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:08,880
Similarly, let me show you

2014
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:09,160
here.

2015
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:11,760
In my instant, if I go in, my log in is

2016
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:21,080
do we had this code here or not?

2017
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,320
We have this code, right?

2018
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,600
So can I copy this? Three lines from you?

2019
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:25,720
Can I copy?

2020
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:31,040
This relates from your base.

2021
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,240
Let copy these three things and see

2022
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:37,680
here I'm writing forced

2023
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:41,400
web and the user name

2024
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:45,360
is equals to

2025
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:00,520
demand

2026
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:10,560
password.

2027
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:11,760
Right, guys?

2028
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:13,040
And you see

2029
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:17,520
I write username and password
invalid username password ID here it says

2030
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:21,840
user clicks on login, but to put a log in
related code, I'm going to write

2031
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:24,120
database.

2032
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:26,760
So I'm going to write here

2033
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:31,000
my logging

2034
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:39,640
wants to log in.

2035
02:06:39,640 --> 02:06:40,040
Which

2036
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,560
is this code correct or not any

2037
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:48,160
is this code correct?

2038
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:50,280
Let's see it.

2039
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:54,120
This user is navigating
to a job in this application.

2040
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:57,760
So here I'm writing open
browser launch application.

2041
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:03,040
Whatever I'm seeing here,
I'm implementing here.

2042
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:05,800
It seemed they were not same thing

2043
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:10,120
anyways.

2044
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:15,040
Then my line says user enters
a username and password.

2045
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:26,640
So here I'm
seeing the same thing on not me.

2046
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:28,920
Here I see user clicks on log in button.

2047
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:31,800
So here my code is clicking on log
in, done or not.

2048
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:32,880
And he

2049
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:40,240
right.

2050
02:07:40,280 --> 02:07:42,760
Forget about this particular
part of code is off. Now

2051
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:46,680
I'm simply printing 128

2052
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:50,280
next one

2053
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:52,040
looks

2054
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:55,800
like now see how clean my code looks.

2055
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,080
Right. See my code?

2056
02:07:58,080 --> 02:08:02,840
It starts here
you see highlight is also one by

2057
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:05,880
because now I have concrete steps.

2058
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:07,760
I have concrete steps.

2059
02:08:07,760 --> 02:08:10,360
And if you want to check they'd work good.

2060
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:12,080
You have linked to the code steps.

2061
02:08:12,080 --> 02:08:14,160
Simply do just one thing.

2062
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:16,080
Simply do just one thing.

2063
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:18,280
Right click on your method.

2064
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:20,040
Right click on your step.

2065
02:08:20,040 --> 02:08:23,320
Right click on Go to declaration.

2066
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:25,440
Yes, yes.

2067
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:26,160
I'm going there.

2068
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:28,680
I'm going there. Right click on the step.

2069
02:08:28,840 --> 02:08:31,080
Click on Go to Add Declaration.

2070
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:34,840
When you click on Declaration
or Usages three,

2071
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:37,720
it will take you to this particular part.

2072
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:39,000
Can you see

2073
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:44,600
it will take you to this particular part.

2074
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:45,600
So you guys,

2075
02:08:46,520 --> 02:08:48,120
so here you can check directly

2076
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:54,600
the linking of your method.

2077
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:57,800
Now Nicolas See,
I did the same thing right?

2078
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:02,280
I put Semicolon here,
I exploited same gives in the next to me.

2079
02:09:02,520 --> 02:09:03,760
Can you see?

2080
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,480
I just changed this Angelica.

2081
02:09:06,480 --> 02:09:09,640
I think she showed the code, but again,

2082
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:12,160
can you show one more time?

2083
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:13,600
Yeah.

2084
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,680
Go into any of the step.

2085
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:18,280
Right click.

2086
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:20,520
Go to go to option

2087
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:22,560
and then declaration or usage

2088
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:30,240
because see, there is a problem

2089
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:34,560
in method coding is copy the correct
the name of the method module from the

2090
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:36,520
declaration of uses.

2091
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:38,080
So you will come here.

2092
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:40,400
Please take the correct method, need grade

2093
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:44,200
from the common methods
and then it will work.

2094
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:47,280
Because I see
the method is not correct method.

2095
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:49,640
The one you have in your common method.

2096
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:52,560
See, we have this method here in common
method.

2097
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:55,120
Great. We have this method here.

2098
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:57,440
So open browser

2099
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:02,280
yet and break rate.

2100
02:10:03,680 --> 02:10:06,000
So now, now we have this.

2101
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,280
Or maybe do one thing
right after the class.

2102
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:13,200
Connect once again people who have
any problem rate and then we'll see.

2103
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:16,200
We will try to resolve all of your queries
as early as possible.

2104
02:10:17,600 --> 02:10:21,320
But don't worry, just give me like,
you know, five, 10 minutes straight,

2105
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:24,280
because I know it's a lot of things
we have weekly we are doing.

2106
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:29,120
So I only do that the class a bit early
and then maybe up to that we connect

2107
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:36,120
which you the link here you can connect
and I will resolve the issue for you.

2108
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:36,840
So far so good.

2109
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:42,000
Great.

2110
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,120
So far so good.

2111
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:45,840
Now see

2112
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:48,920
this time this time

2113
02:10:48,920 --> 02:10:52,320
when I run this log in feature

2114
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:04,200
it, open my browser,

2115
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:08,320
launches my
You are really into username password.

2116
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:11,040
Click on log in button and then explain

2117
02:11:12,720 --> 02:11:13,800
why it's not closing.

2118
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:17,000
Because we didn't add any code
for closing the browser.

2119
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,760
You noticed that right now.

2120
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:21,480
Come here.

2121
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:22,880
You see this report?

2122
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:27,720
It says One scenario passed for is steps
four passed.

2123
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:31,200
Total time is 13 seconds start nine 9

2124
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:35,040
milliseconds.

2125
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:44,160
See very simple report nothing much.

2126
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:45,880
So far so good everyone.

2127
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:48,200
Mine was this I have seen

2128
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:51,760
So you need to implement distance.

2129
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:53,640
You need to implement the steps strongly.

2130
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:56,520
I will tell you how to do this with mine
closed.

2131
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:04,240
Why? No, no, nobody.

2132
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:06,400
But we should not add any exception.

2133
02:12:06,600 --> 02:12:09,440
We should not give the problem
in longer run.

2134
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:13,720
Okay, Do just one thing.

2135
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:14,880
Go straight.

2136
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:17,080
The code which I just added.

2137
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:18,520
The code which I just added.

2138
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:19,920
You see all of this code?

2139
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:22,640
I'm going to commit
that it was really big.

2140
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:25,440
The updated code from my machine, right?

2141
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:28,320
Digit code from the repository

2142
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:30,520
and then try to run that code
in your machine

2143
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:49,680
again, the same thing, right?

2144
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:53,400
I just explained I changed this part.

2145
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:54,960
If you see

2146
02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:01,800
if you see in log in this step straight,
I change this bar.

2147
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:04,440
I deleted it to Mark.

2148
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:07,080
You're not doing this

2149
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:11,760
I didn't do or what you're using
is still the same name, right?

2150
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,360
It will work for you if you do this

2151
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:18,120
loophole.

2152
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:26,080
So far, so good.

2153
02:13:26,080 --> 02:13:26,800
Please remove those.

2154
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:27,560
Are you exception?

2155
02:13:27,560 --> 02:13:34,760
We don't need to the exception. Yes,

2156
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:36,960
yes, yes.

2157
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:37,240
That's.

2158
02:13:37,240 --> 02:13:38,120
That's what I'm saying.

2159
02:13:38,120 --> 02:13:41,040
To let anybody will connect up the station
board.

2160
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,560
Yeah, no worries.

2161
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:49,600
All right.

2162
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:53,840
It's completely fine.

2163
02:13:53,840 --> 02:14:20,280
There is any questions or for anyone?

2164
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:21,040
No, nothing.

2165
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:23,800
You don't have to change your want
anything for the common mistakes?

2166
02:14:23,800 --> 02:14:27,040
Rate is removed before
and after my third grade.

2167
02:14:27,600 --> 02:14:29,360
And just take my code now.

2168
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:33,880
From now onwards, whatever the code
you are getting from my repository.

2169
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:34,480
Right.

2170
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:37,080
You don't need to change anything
from which are fine.

2171
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,640
We will run the course. Mm.

2172
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:40,120
This is just a starting of.

2173
02:14:40,120 --> 02:14:41,720
But like I said,

2174
02:14:41,720 --> 02:14:45,320
even if you have multiple digital files,
multiple steps, everything make it.

2175
02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:48,160
We use one single execution
point for all of this things.

2176
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:51,480
Okay.

2177
02:14:51,480 --> 02:14:57,760
Okay.

2178
02:14:57,760 --> 02:14:58,840
So guys, now

2179
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:00,960
so far,

2180
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:04,960
whatever the things we did right,
I know a lot of things we covered today.

2181
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:08,560
We have travel manager, we covered
constant class, we covered rates,

2182
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:12,000
config properties,
we covered log in features, we covered

2183
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:15,240
steps, we covered initial constraints
on your screen.

2184
02:15:15,240 --> 02:15:17,360
Yet this is just one night on constitutes

2185
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:21,680
this data of digit code from my repository
I just added the code rate

2186
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:25,560
you will be having all this
in your machine then.

2187
02:15:25,560 --> 02:15:27,800
Now what what is happening now?

2188
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:31,280
Write a lot of details,
but easy to understand.

2189
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,800
It is not rocket things, right?

2190
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:36,440
We are trying.

2191
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:38,480
We are trying to simplify the things.

2192
02:15:38,480 --> 02:15:40,960
We are here to make our job very easy.

2193
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:44,920
But it So I'm not here
to make your job complicated.

2194
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:48,520
We are working on all these parts
so that you guys

2195
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:51,960
can understand how easy this job is.

2196
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:55,760
As long as you know how to implement
the functionality in your job,

2197
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:59,520
how to work on the automation part,
how smart you can create

2198
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:03,440
and play with your framework and
with your application and provide more.

2199
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:05,400
Automation is great.

2200
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,960
Your job would be super easy.

2201
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:11,320
That's why I'm here to explain
all of this things.

2202
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:14,160
Guys.

2203
02:16:14,160 --> 02:16:15,560
So I think I'm done for my crew.

2204
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:18,240
This class made the topics
we were supposed to covered.

2205
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:20,040
I covered all of those topics.

2206
02:16:20,040 --> 02:16:25,680
If you have any questions you can ask,
or maybe we can of decision now, but.
