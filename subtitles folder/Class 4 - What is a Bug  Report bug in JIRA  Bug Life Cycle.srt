broke So long to mine and decided

31
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,400

for hard.

37
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
So guys, it looks like

38
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,120
it looks like we're ready right
August here.

39
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,680
Now leave this here.

40
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,720
No, Bill is here.

41
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,240
Christine is here

for holidays.

43
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,920
Is here as well.

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,200
All right, guys,

45
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,000
it's good to see you again,

46
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,320
or at least good to read your messages.

47
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,720
Am I going to vacation that well?

48
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,120
No, I wish.

49
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:31,960
I wish I was going to vacation.

50
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,800
Would go to the.

51
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,720
How are you guys? How's Java treating you?

52
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,640
This is your what is this your first week?

53
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,360
Right.

54
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,920
I think you're your fifth

55
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,520
week.

56
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,960
It's fourth week on syntax.

57
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,320
Really?

58
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,720
This can be the fourth week

59
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,880
because this is
the third week of teaching.

60
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,400
How can it be the fourth week

61
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,320
we were starting to love

62
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,440
Java.

63
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,120
Okay,

64
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,360
cool, cool, cool.

65
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
Don't you know, don't.

66
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,760
Don't be discouraged. You can't do,

67
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,960
you know, a

68
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,720
a problem.

69
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,760
Don't be discouraged.

70
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,760
And for some of you that understand
the material, congratulations.

71
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,240
But if you really want to

72
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,360
if you if you really want to confirm
with yourself that you understand

73
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,200
that or not try to help your classmates
who are struggling

74
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,760
and try to teach them the material,
you know, it's going to be a good way

75
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,280
for you to retain the information
that that you're you know,

76
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,760
is are solving this stuff.

77
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,080
The dream team.

78
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,280
The dream dream team.

79
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,800
Ah, Ladies and gentlemen,
gentlemen, ladies, good

80
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
people of the North,
the South, the west and the east.

81
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,960
Today marks

82
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,720
class four,

83
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,520
Class four.

84
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:31,920
We go.

85
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,080
Absolutely. Have you done research, Alex?

86
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,280
Have you Google there?
Have you watched YouTube videos?

87
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,080
Has anyone here done
any Google research, YouTube

88
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,360
videos on anything that we've learned?

89
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,720
Absolutely anything.

90
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,600
Right.

91
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Good, good, good, good,

92
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,000
good.

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,240
You doing research? That's very good.

94
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,920
Go. All right, so let's start off with

95
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,400
let's go over.

96
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,800
Well, let's talk about

97
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
and I know you guys

98
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,680
have had a long week and stuff,
but let's talk about what we talk about.

99
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,360
Last US class, we basically discussed

100
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,040
the types of testing.

101
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,840
Right.

102
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,640
How many types are there?

103
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,320
Right. Two types.

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,520
Right?

105
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,880
Only two types. Okay.

106
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,520
And what are they guys?

107
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,800
What are they

108
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,280
on? Automation,

109
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,680
Functional and

110
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,000
and nonfunctional, right.

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,600
Well,

112
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320
we also talked about other
and I'm going to read Tendra.

113
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,880
I'm glad you said that because I'm
going to clarify some things today. So

114
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,360
so we have functional, nonfunctional and

115
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,280
undeclared.

116
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,520
These two categories are what can anyone

117
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,640
just start
saying different types of testing.

118
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,880
We have ad hoc right at home,

119
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,440
we have small, we have
what else have fibroid.

120
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,200
Very good by the way.

121
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,920
White box, right.

122
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,320
Some sort of black box.

123
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,960
Seems that regression right.

124
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,600
Regression. Sure.

125
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,520
Let's throw in retesting And there's one

126
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,080
system. Yes.

127
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,960
Very good. Yeah.

128
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,840
We the hacker is here.

129
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,520
API performance.

130
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes. Okay, good.

131
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,120
We didn't say anything about regressed.

132
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,000
Very good. I show from Florida.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,440
She's new class guys.

134
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,360
I show Florida days in class. Right.

135
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,680
And integration.

136
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,400
Oh, man, that PRC.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,840
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

138
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,640
What do we call people like priority guys?

139
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,240
You guys remember we call people like PRC.

140
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,760
What do we call

141
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,240
people like parents?

142
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,960
Does anyone remember bag of money?

143
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,680
Exactly.

144
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,240
Ad hoc.

145
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,120
We said that ad Hoc is also known
as exploratory testing.

146
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,520
Right.

147
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,840
Cool. And so forth.

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,000
All right. So

149
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,200
white box versus

150
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,040
black box testing.

151
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,600
What do we say?

152
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,280
Those are the testers.

153
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,920
That's that's a good way to think about it
if it helps you.

154
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,680
White box is done by developers white box.

155
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,720
You need to know the code.

156
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,000
You need to know
the internal structure. Right?

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,480
And only the people that develop
the application

158
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,120
are the ones that internally know
the system right?

159
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,120
It only makes sense. Right, guys?

160
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:21,480
What about black box?

161
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,080
Very good.

162
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,600
Black box doesn't
black box is functional, right?

163
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,240
Exactly. Mean. That's right.

164
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,280
It's functional.

165
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,080
It is functional testing. Right.

166
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,480
Okay. Very good. Okay.

167
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,760
Can someone can
we talk more about the difference between

168
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,720
small

169
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,800
testing?

170
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,600
Smoke is quick, Lightweight.

171
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,720
Very good. Smoke is quick.

172
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,920
Yes, that is true. Yes.

173
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,880
Like lightweight light testing. Right.

174
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,600
But it's it's testing
the most important functionalities. Right.

175
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,120
Okay.

176
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,800
Yes, exactly.

177
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,480
But good done by testers.

178
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,720
The most important thing since the test.

179
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,640
What about regression then?

180
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,800
Once that regression is testing
of two coaches of this or improvement?

181
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,160
Mohammad That is very well said.

182
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,280
Yes, exactly.

183
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,920
Angelica Very good.

184
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,040
Sorbonne Very good.

185
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,360
Second priority test.

186
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,520
That's a very good way to put it.

187
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,400
So one, that's awesome.

188
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,160
Regression is one of the most
or is more of the overall stability

189
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,880
and functionality.

190
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,520
Okay. So

191
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,040
can you give me
an example of a smoke test case?

192
00:12:52,040 --> 00:13:04,720
And they give me an example
of a regression test case.

193
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,640
Smokers log in
When you're not testing the log in button,

194
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,760
what are you testing
The log in functionality?

195
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,240
Right.

196
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,760
You want to make sure
that the users can log in,

197
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,120
but that's essentially

198
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,080
what you're testing, right?

199
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,920
Exactly. I should. From Fairfax
Spelling regression.

200
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:34,800
That's right.

201
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:47,360
But very, very, very good.

202
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,600
Okay. Very, very good.

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,040
Let's see, what else do we talk about?

204
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,000
We talked about the different types
of testing.

205
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,280
What is ad hoc testing of exploratory

206
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,560
testing, random testing,

207
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,960
Very good.

208
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,400
Without documenting.

209
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,120
Okay, testing, Improvised stuff, informal,
not documented.

210
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,920
Okay.

211
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:31,880
What is, by the way, testing?

212
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,760
What is 508 testing?

213
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,080
Yes. No, that's that's true.

214
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,280
Extra testing, disability do.

215
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,400
What do you mean disabilities is.

216
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,800
How are you going to answer that
interview question of they ask you what is

217
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,120
what is five eight tests?

218
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,680
You're going to say disability, right?

219
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,680
So it's exactly right.

220
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,760
And this is a different type of person
that you want,

221
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,840
you know, you won't really be doing.

222
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,000
This is a different type of testing,
obviously requires different tools.

223
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,280
I in my project,

224
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,960
I do all of these by the way.

225
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,280
I do at Ad Hoc.

226
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,120
You know, obviously everyone does it.

227
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,400
I do small, I do fibroids, I do

228
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,080
white box, I do

229
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,080
I do black box

230
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,280
regression.

231
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,080
You know, obviously we retest

232
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,720
performance testing as well.

233
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,800
You wait.

234
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,440
You sure I'll hire all of you? Absolutely.

235
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,640
Requirement tools and websites for people.

236
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,320
Exactly. Very good Sorbonne.

237
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,800
That is true. Yeah

238
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,280
they're very good is testing them.

239
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,760
Make sure you know you don't.

240
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,200
It's just that

241
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,560
I'm actually an architect,

242
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,920
so I know like the internal structures
of some applications

243
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,000
and I actually have to run
some unit tests myself.

244
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,320
But you guys won't have to do it.

245
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah, So?

246
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,240
So, but this is, you know, I'm doing
you based on experience.

247
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
You don't really
have you don't have to know this right.

248
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,600
And most projects

249
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,400
yes ad hoc testing but everyone does it
You all do a lot of smoke.

250
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,720
You do a lot of regression. Okay.

251
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,120
That's the type of black box
testing right?

252
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,280
You'll do system testing both your testing
as part of system testing.

253
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Remember, we talked about that last time.

254
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,320
You will do API testing.

255
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,000
You will learn that in class.

256
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,040
I actually teach all the API classes here,

257
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,320
but I think you guys
will have another instructor this time

258
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,160
you as well as to assist with that.

259
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,440
But I want to clarify some things

260
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,040
than I would like
for everyone to to pay attention.

261
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,520
So okay,

262
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,440
everyone looking at my page

263
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,240
and actually
I want to talk about this test case.

264
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,280
You guys remember this test case?

265
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,760
We we wrote like Sorbonne wrote it.

266
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,040
We just went and fixed it and everything.

267
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,280
Okay. So this right here it

268
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,080
is testing
to verify that a user can log in

269
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:20,840
with valid credentials
right from the home page.

270
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,400
When we do this test case, we're actually
physically we're actually, you know,

271
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,280
interacting with the functionalities
of the application, right.

272
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,480
Where we're navigating to Netflix icon,
we're clicking on a button, we're entering

273
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,720
text and text boxes, we're
clicking on buttons, and that's it, right?

274
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,800
So this right here, guys, this right here

275
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,920
is an example of a functional test case.

276
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,200
Okay, Does that make sense?

277
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,080
Functional test is
this is an example of functional test case

278
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,440
because at some point

279
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,440
here we are testing the functionality
of this application, right?

280
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,160
We're clicking buttons,
we're entering text and text boxes.

281
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:57,720
Right?

282
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,360
And that's those are the functionalities
that we want to look for

283
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,280
it that we want to test.

284
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,040
This is a type of functional test case.

285
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,160
Now, someone said there are two types of
testing, which is manual and automation.

286
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
So let me clarify that.

287
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,520
So this is a test case, right?

288
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,200
You either manually write,

289
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,720
execute this test case,
meaning you open the browser,

290
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,400
you type in Netflix dot com, you're moving
with your mouse and everything, right?

291
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,400
You're entering you're
actually typing data with your keyboard or

292
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,320
or you automate this functional test case.

293
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,120
Does that make sense guys over

294
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,200
you guys understand
where I'm going with this, right?

295
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,920
Or you automate this functional test case?

296
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,920
Do you guys remember when I showed you
a demo of like one of the forms

297
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,680
for one of my projects? Right?

298
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,240
And I told you

299
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,160
I could either manually execute that
and which is a functional test case.

300
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,760
Do you guys remember

301
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,800
how it was like entering
data, clicking buttons and all that stuff?

302
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,160
Right? That's all functional testing.

303
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,960
So I had the option to manually
fill out the form and submit it

304
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
or I can automate that functional test
case.

305
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,760
Okay. Does
that make sense to everyone, by the way?

306
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,160
Right.

307
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,440
Is that clear to everyone?

308
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,920
So when you say manual and automation
with the type of testing that we're doing,

309
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,600
we're basically talking
about functional testing, right?

310
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,160
You either execute
those functional test cases manually

311
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,920
or you can automate them right at the end.

312
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,040
It's still functional testing.

313
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,880
Does that make sense?

314
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,160
Does that does that make sense to

315
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,880
Alex Gray Box testing.

316
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,640
We can talk about that later.

317
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,440
You know, you can kind of it's
kind of self-explanatory, right?

318
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,920
If white is white and black is black,
then there's great.

319
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,520
What do you think that means? Right?

320
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,240
It means that you do both,

321
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,600
but it's mixed.

322
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,320
At the end class,
we will know how to write and run the same

323
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,960
right, and run the same
like you did the other day.

324
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,800
The one. Exactly. Yes.
You will be able to do that.

325
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,840
But I want everyone to understand that

326
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,480
when we do, you in testing,
what do you mean by UI?

327
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,640
We do UI testing.

328
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,880
UI testing means
we're just testing the user interface

329
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,760
and we're actually going to the website
right?

330
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,240
These are

331
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,400
you guys are going to be automating
a lot of functional test cases

332
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,280
throughout the class.

333
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,480
Does that make sense to everyone?

334
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,080
But I want you guys to,
to like really understand

335
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,160
that you are automating functional test
cases.

336
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,480
Okay.

337
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,000
Or you can manually execute
those functional test cases.

338
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,320
Now, there are different types
of automation that we can do right?

339
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,320
We're not just going to automate
functional test cases in this class.

340
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,200
Later in class,
you guys will learn about API testing,

341
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,200
you guys will learn about SQL testing,
you guys will learn how to manually do

342
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,640
that, and you guys will also learn
how to automate those test cases as well.

343
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,480
However, those test cases because
they're considered nonfunctional, right?

344
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,320
That means you are automating
nonfunctional test cases.

345
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,280
Okay, So but that will make more sense
towards the end.

346
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,560
Okay.

347
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,960
But for right now,
I just want you to focus that, you know,

348
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,240
this is a functional test case
and stuff, right?

349
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,680
So I'll show you. Right.

350
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,480
I'm going to go to expedia.com, right?

351
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,480
So to

352
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,960
expedia.com, I'll come here and let's say
I'm searching something, right?

353
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,280
I have a test case to look up a trip
somewhere.

354
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,920
So I'm already clicking right.

355
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,840
I'm clicking on this, on this off.

356
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,520
So I have to click on flights as a user.

357
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
I expect this flights, right?

358
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,280
This flight's link or button to work.
Right.

359
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,080
If I if I have cars here
and I click on it, I expect it to work.

360
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,760
You know, if I click on flights,
I fly to work in this textbox here

361
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,880
leaving from if I click on it as a user,
I expect for something to happen, right?

362
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,200
And I can enter,

363
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,760
you know, whatever,
I can answer this right?

364
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,280
And if I click on this,
I expect for something to happen, right?

365
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,760
So maybe the test case can be

366
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,160
to, you know,

367
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,280
as a user, as an Expedia public user,

368
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,640
I should be able to look up
a roundtrip flight,

369
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,520
leaving from Washington to

370
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,760
to Vegas.

371
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,440
Right.

372
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,160
To Las Vegas, right.

373
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,200
And search right.

374
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,520
And I should be able to see results.

375
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,320
Okay.

376
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,360
So and this is going to I'm going to
kind of throw something at you right now.

377
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,080
Okay.

378
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,520
And so this is Expedia,
and we're using a website, right?

379
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,640
And I'm entering information
and I'm searching information.

380
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,680
Okay.

381
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,920
When I search this information,
I get a lot of different options, right?

382
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,960
I get a lot of different options
from different airlines.

383
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,640
But let me ask you this.

384
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,920
Where do you think
this information is coming from?

385
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,040
What do you think
this information is coming from

386
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,440
databases, from those airlines?

387
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,040
Exactly.

388
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,560
Exactly.

389
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,840
Very good databases from those airlines.

390
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,440
So the thing is that now
in order to test that, the data

391
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,720
that is being retrieved
from those databases are correct.

392
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,640
That is a different type of testing
that we're going to have to do,

393
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,800
which is back in testing.

394
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,040
Okay.

395
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,840
Because this is frontend testing right
front to front end testing is everything.

396
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,400
The user can see the public website read
everything we are doing here, this UI

397
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,080
testing, right, the clicking by clicking
this, you know, clicking the checkbox.

398
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,720
All of this is front end, right?

399
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,280
We can see it.

400
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,400
But then there's also backend
testing and back in testing is basically

401
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,600
nonfunctional testing API testing,
equal testing, where we're going to test,

402
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,920
we're going to verify data
from the databases differently.

403
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Okay. Does that make sense

404
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,280
that you will learn later in class?

405
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,800
Okay.

406
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
And don't don't stress about it right now,

407
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,840
but I want you to understand what we mean
by functional testing.

408
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,240
You're actually testing the
functionalities of the application, right?

409
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,440
So entering data, clicking

410
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,080
buttons, dropdowns, checkboxes,
radio buttons and so forth.

411
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,200
Okay.
So is that clear with everyone? Right.

412
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,360
So and this is why I asked you this.

413
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,880
Remember when we talked about I asked you
what is what does automation mean?

414
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,360
And some of you guys automatically started
saying, Oh, Joel, so let him do cover.

415
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,960
No, I basically asked, just what does
automation mean in general, right?

416
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,360
It means to automate a process
for something to be done quickly,

417
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
you know, to be more efficient.

418
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,520
We gave different life
examples right, Like emails.

419
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,040
Right.

420
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,440
And, you know,

421
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,920
and different like, for example,
you're out of the office,

422
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,480
someone can send you an email

423
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,360
and an email gets sent back right away
saying, Hi, I'm out of the office

424
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,560
until this, this, this.

425
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,200
Right, exactly.

426
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,360
So so always think about that
when you hear the word automation.

427
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,560
Cool.

428
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,200
All right.

429
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,800
So we've clarified that.

430
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,760
And we also talked about smart regression.

431
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,960
You will learn about API lit later.

432
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,880
We talked about environments, right?

433
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,680
I hope you do.

434
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,480
So tomorrow, guys.

435
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,200
Tomorrow after class. Okay.

436
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
We're going to have

437
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,160
a big you guys know what code is.

438
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,240
Have you guys done? That's over.

439
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,720
So tomorrow we're going to have
a big cohort quiz at the end.

440
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,040
All right, guys.

441
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,920
It's going to be exciting, right?

442
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,240
It's going to be really, really good.

443
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,400
Guys, the winner of this whole game
is going to get a real prize.

444
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,440
A real, real prize.

445
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:16,800
All right.

446
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,200
Like it's it's going to be good, right?

447
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,720
You should attend tomorrow because

448
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,440
because you'll have a good idea
as to where you are.

449
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,840
Okay, cool, Because that makes sense.

450
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,080
So tomorrow
and the winner gets a real, real prize.

451
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,040
I won't say what the prizes,
but it's not a sticker.

452
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,960
It's not a sticker. Right.

453
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,880
It's going to be a good one.

454
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,000
So, Sebastian,
you got to do a lot more than 1 to 4 for

455
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,200
for a job.

456
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,240
Okay, cool.

457
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,200
I see.

458
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,920
Cool, cool, cool.

459
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,200
So all of these keywords, guys,
I just want to say everything

460
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,960
we've learned, all these keywords,
performance, integration,

461
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,200
if you were to understand it,
that's good for you.

462
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,680
But as the course goes on,
you're going to understand it even more.

463
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,920
And at the end, recap all of this.

464
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,480
Everything is going
to make a lot of sense. But

465
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,920
so if you're right now

466
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,560
doubting yourself, saying,
you know what, I don't understand this.

467
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,160
It doesn't make sense.

468
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,200
It's going to make sense
as of course, goes on.

469
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,520
Okay, cool.

470
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,240
All right.

471
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,760
There's a reason
why our success rate is very high,

472
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,920
but you guys know that our success rate
for students getting jobs is very,

473
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,840
very, very high
compared to other schools in the area

474
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,240
compared to other schools in the area.

475
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,320
I would be lying to you

476
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,760
if I told you that 100% of our students
get jobs on porches.

477
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
There are students
that have some issues like

478
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,760
they just quit,
have went through or they don't, you know.

479
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,280
No, it's much higher than 70%.

480
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,520
Much higher than 70%.

481
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,640
So. All right, guys, Today

482
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,400
we're going to discuss a new topic, right?

483
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,200
It's going to be a very good
and we're going to discuss what is 050000.

484
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,840
So where you guys able to log in?

485
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,000
Everyone should have been able to log in.

486
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
You guys were given.

487
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,400
Oh, and I just want to say something.

488
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,800
You know, guys, it's like 83 of you
guys, right?

489
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,320
So, you know, when I ask you a question
or when I say, hey, you know,

490
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,360
do you guys understand and stuff
or you guys ask a question, guys, right?

491
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,160
I get a lot of message.

492
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,120
Like my my Slack channel is just going up,
right, with all your messages

493
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,240
and I may miss a message or two.

494
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,640
Okay.

495
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,280
I may.

496
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,560
I don't have the ability to reach
super, super, super fast, unfortunately.

497
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,360
I'm sorry to break it to you. Right.

498
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,680
So if I miss a question, just let me know.

499
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,440
Right. Let me know.

500
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,320
I ask it again,
and and and we'll see from there.

501
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,720
Okay, cool. Just ask again.

502
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,840
Make sure to to pay attention.
I don't miss.

503
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,960
I don't mean to miss your questions.

504
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,640
Right. Just ask again.

505
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,160
Okay.

506
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,320
Cool. Yes.

507
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,520
Everything was in course.

508
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,120
Announcements.

509
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,440
So everyone is there.

510
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,240
Anybody that does not have

511
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,280
the JIRA information,

512
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:44,440
anyone?

513
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:44,880
Okay.

514
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,440
You don't have your JIRA information.

515
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,760
We asked you guys to log in last week

516
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,640
as a member.

517
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,280
Nope. You didn't get an email.

518
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,960
We specif.

519
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,880
We specifically told you
that we're not sending an email. Right.

520
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,160
Thank you very much.

521
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,080
So, so guys trying to stay on top of this.

522
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,400
Okay, Try to stay on top of this stuff.

523
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,080
Okay.

524
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,920
So how many people have not logged

525
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,080
in two zero.

526
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,960
How many people have you have
in the instructions?

527
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,280
All right.

528
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,240
There you.

529
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,600
Okay,

530
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,520
Cool.

531
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,880
Now, for those of you,
open up your browser and let's go on zero.

532
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,920
Go. Let's go to zero

533
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,840
and let's go to zero.

534
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,120
And you'll see this.

535
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,120
I have different credentials,

00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,400
We have anybody

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,640
So what Cause broad Stop man.

Dude, he just made my name.

551
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,840
He just made my name
because somebody are you.

552
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,840
So that is up.

553
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,440
So guys, if you have problems, you know,

554
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,280
reach out to
to a positive support channel.

555
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,200
All right.

556
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,880
All right.

557
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,560
So if you log in,
you should see something like this.

558
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,720
You should see something like this.

559
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,760
Who doesn't see something?

560
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,480
And if you log, then you're logged in
to see something different.

561
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,440
And if you see something different,
then take a screenshot

562
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,760
and kindly share it
so I can see where you are.

563
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Regardless,
we'll end up in the same place.

564
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,000
Okay, that's fine.

565
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,400
That's complete. Okay, Miriam,
That's fine.

566
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,280
That's okay.

567
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,960
That's screenshots.

568
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,920
Good, but that screenshot is fine.

569
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,200
Okay, very good.

570
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,000
So do me a favor, guys.

571
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,120
For those of you that see that screenshot,
can you click on or

572
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,560
can you click on Explore Current?

573
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,200
The current projects

574
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,600
And then
and then let me know what you guys

575
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,480
would you guys see

576
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
you're in awesome.

577
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,400
I'm a good job.

578
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,280
Yeah, very good.

579
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,520
Perfect. Wonderful.

580
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,560
You guys are there, but

581
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,320
there's not much going on here.

582
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,040
It's just logging in and making sure just,
you know, if you don't see what I see,

583
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,520
that you should see what everyone else is
seeing. Right.

584
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,480
And if you see a different screenshot
like the ones that are above,

585
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
click on, explore current projects,

586
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,160
go cool.

587
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:38,920
All right.

588
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,840
Now is everyone on board with this?

589
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,280
Yeah, that's fine.

590
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,000
No more management.

591
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,240
That's cool. Is everyone on board?

592
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,080
I don't like to leave anyone behind.

593
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,160
I don't like to be in you.

594
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,120
And you guys are,

595
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,400
you know, please don't be shy and say,
hey, like I'm stuck or I'm behind.

596
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,640
Say something, please,
so that we can help you.

597
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,240
Geralt's like, yeah, might

598
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,160
just are cool.

599
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,720
All right, all right.

600
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,280
Nice, nice, nice. Right.

601
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,120
So let's talk about what year is first?

602
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,440
Why not to me now?

603
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:30,120
What do you see?

604
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,480
You know, just reach out to support
and will

605
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,000
help you out.

606
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Okay, So anyway, here's

607
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,160
the thing.

608
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,360
All right?
So all I did to see this, right?

609
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,400
If you guys see these menus here, right.

610
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Just I just clicked on our boards

611
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,440
and I went and I went to the bottom
and I click view all boards.

612
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,360
Okay, click view all boards.

613
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,440
And then it took me to this page,
but you guys see that.

614
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,560
So I went to boards, I went to the bottom

615
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,040
and I clicked on view
all boards and I'm here.

616
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:11,240
Okay, cool.

617
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,720
All right, now what I'm going to do
is let's talk about what year it is first.

618
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,400
So everyone hands off your laptop
and let's talk about what

619
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,720
what is Jericho working?

620
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,200
So you think it's just going to start
making a lot of sense?

621
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,920
So JIRA is a project

622
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,760
management tool

623
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,440
and this is a project management tool.

624
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:43,520
So JIRA is not the only tool that, you
know, that is out there that's popular.

625
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,600
There's different ones.

626
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,880
There's really
there's IBM tools like HP, LMC, Alarm.

627
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,880
A lot of what you will know about
JIRA is actually

628
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,160
the most popular.

629
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,600
So guys, JIRA is a project management
tool, right?

630
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,360
If you saw, we'd access
basically a website, right?

631
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,240
This is a website that's JIRA
and we logged in with credentials.

632
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,160
Right?

633
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,200
But this software, this application
is where we can manage the project.

634
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,560
We mean everything, right?

635
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,440
And when we meet everything,
we're talking about

636
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,680
documents, which is what?

637
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,400
Which are what documents?

638
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,200
Which are
what an agile environment, right.

639
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,160
Which are what guys do you guys remember
artifacts, Right.

640
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,520
We can have our backlogs.

641
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,840
Here are user stories, our tasks, our test

642
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,920
cases, everything, everything,
everything we can have here in JIRA.

643
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,440
This is how we can manage the project.

644
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,400
This is where you can see your progress
on day to day basis with your team.

645
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,400
Okay?

646
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,560
This is the tool that and it's just
think of it like a ticketing software.

647
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,720
It's a very, very easy ticketing software.

648
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,280
A lot of companies use JIRA
for a lot of different, different project.

649
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,840
They use it differently.

650
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:06,120
We're going to use it in the way that
that, you know, we use it for testing.

651
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,320
Okay, So this is
this is zero and don't do anything yet.

652
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,320
Just follow it.

653
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,360
I'm like, don't touch your laptop.

654
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,000
Just watch me.

655
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,000
Okay? We created a project.

656
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,680
Please don't click on anything.

657
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,520
Just please watch the screen. Okay.

658
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,200
Before you start seeing what I do,
I mess with the camera repeater.

659
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,680
Just watch the screen right?

660
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,480
So we have our mess. Batch 11.

661
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,960
I want to click on this project
here. Okay.

662
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,760
So now this is
this is how the activity board looks like.

663
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,120
Okay.

664
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,640
And all right, now it's like what this

665
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,520
you know,
I don't understand anything of this.

666
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,920
On the left hand side, if you look at
my screen, there's different options.

667
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,840
Okay. Different options.
We have a backlog.

668
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,400
We have active sprints, we have releases,
we have reports, issues, more.

669
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,040
Morecambe. Okay, cool.

670
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,960
And I don't want you to do anything,
but I'm going to click on the backlog.

671
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,640
Okay?

672
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,160
So the backlog,
this is how the backlog looks like.

673
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,360
Okay.
And let me let me repeat myself again.

674
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,640
Please do anything.

675
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,000
Okay?

676
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,080
Because with JIRA, now that you logged in
with your credentials, I can see

677
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,680
absolutely everything.

678
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,520
What everyone does if Tomana comes here
and moves this up here like this,

679
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,560
I will be able to see that she moved that

680
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,680
ticket like, you know, somewhere.

681
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,440
Okay, So please don't do anything
you're not supposed to do, or you're going

682
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,600
to ruin the flow of the class.

683
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,840
Okay, that makes sense to everyone.

684
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,400
Can we can we follow instructions?

685
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:35,960
Right.

686
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,520
Okay, cool. Right.

687
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,600
So this right here is the backlog.

688
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,960
Okay, I just went here.

689
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,520
I clicked on
and you're watching my screen, right?

690
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,560
And here I have what we call issues. Care

691
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,800
issues are also known

692
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,840
as tickets issues a.k.a tickets.

693
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,560
Right. But we have to describe

694
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,800
what type of issue,
what type of ticket goes in JIRA.

695
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,600
And this is the way that JIRA works
everything in JIRA.

696
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,840
Okay, is an issue.

697
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,280
A test case is an issue.

698
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
A user story is an issue.

699
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,960
A task is an issue.

700
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,600
Everything that you create is an issue,
and that's just what they called it.

701
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,200
Does that make sense?

702
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,680
Is this just what they call it? It's just,
you know what it is?

703
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,800
It's their thing.

704
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,160
Okay? It's it's gross thing.

705
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,680
Don't ask me why they call it
that. It's their thing, you know?

706
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,280
So it's called an issue now
and other project management tools.

707
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,120
They don't.

708
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,600
That's funny.

709
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,720
Mohammed In other project management
tools, they don't call these issues.

710
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,320
They may call them tickets,
They may call them something else.

711
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,320
I don't really recall right.

712
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,360
But that's why you see here
like four issues.

713
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,040
But in reality,
what we see here is like for tickets,

714
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,320
I want you guys to think of it like that
because it's going to be easier.

715
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,480
So we see one, two, three, four, right?

716
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,360
And these are movable.

717
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,160
You can move this.

718
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,440
Oh, and by the way,
this is the backlog read.

719
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,040
And we said that a backlog is an artifact,
which is a document.

720
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,400
But is this in the form of like a word
documents?

721
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,280
Is this an a form of word document
or Excel

722
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,040
or PowerPoint slide or anything like that?

723
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,800
No. Right.

724
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,400
This is just here. This is in JIRA.

725
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,480
This is considered a document.

726
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,520
This is considered,
you know, a document here.

727
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,840
And with projects,
this is always, you know,

728
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,640
like highly maintained and everything.

729
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,520
So there's four tickets here. Right.

730
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,520
And another thing I want to say is
I want you guys to look at this right.

731
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,320
So when I clicked on this, okay, right now
you see this right?

732
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,720
When you click on any of these,

733
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,840
you're going to see a preview
that's going to open up here.

734
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,280
Okay. You're going to see a preview here.

735
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,640
Okay. The the tidbit issue i.d.

736
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,200
is h.r. Mass b11 hyphen four.

737
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,640
Right. Okay.

738
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,560
What is the issue
id for this one for a search employee.

739
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,640
What is the what is the issue id

740
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,040
or the ticket id for search

741
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,520
an employee. h.R.

742
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,200
Must be level three. Exactly.

743
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,040
Very good.

744
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,440
Right now, when i click on this,

745
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,720
okay, i see a of that ticket.

746
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,120
You see how it opens on the right
side, right?

747
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,160
I can see a preview of this ticket here.

748
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,680
Right?

749
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,480
I can tell that, you know,
it says invalid user login.

750
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,400
There's an acceptance criteria here.

751
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:36,240
Okay,
so this is because this is a user story.

752
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,880
Okay.

753
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,280
Do you guys understand that
this right here is is a user story, right?

754
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,680
And you will learn the signs
and how user stories look like.

755
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,840
Okay, so this is a user story.

756
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,440
We have an acceptance criteria.

757
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,440
Okay, we have some comments here,
but this is just a preview of the ticket.

758
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,360
So what we can do is when we click on it,
we see the preview.

759
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,920
But you have to right
click it and open the link in a new tab.

760
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:02,800
Okay?

761
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,880
And when you do that,
you see the full ticket.

762
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,480
Does that make sense?

763
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,120
Did you guys just see what I did there?

764
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,880
So let me go back. Right?

765
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,440
So if you click on any ticket right
here, you're going to see a preview of

766
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,320
it, right?

767
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,440
If you want to see the full ticket,
just right click,

768
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,240
Open link and new tab,
not open link in New window.

769
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,560
Open link and new tab.

770
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,920
Okay, so when you do that, I get to see
like the full ticket here the way it is.

771
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,480
Right?

772
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,320
So this is a user story.

773
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:38,320
How do I know this is a user story?

774
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:38,880
How do you know this?

775
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:46,640
A user story?

776
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,760
Because it says story, right?

777
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,200
Mean you guys are so smart.

778
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,120
This is really you know Exactly.

779
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,280
This is a this is a story.

780
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,680
It says it's a story.
It's labeled story. Right.

781
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,600
That's what it is. Okay.

782
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,960
So very, very good.

783
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,360
Right.

784
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,160
So let's get familiar with the tool
and then we see the acceptance criteria.

785
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,160
Right?

786
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,000
You remember
I told you acceptance criteria

787
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,080
will be written in user stories.

788
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,040
Does that make sense now?

789
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,680
Like, is that the is it is it clear?

790
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,880
Now, remember when I told you

791
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,200
when we started learning this,
I said, your boys are going to write

792
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,680
the acceptance criteria
as in the user stories.

793
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,080
Okay. Right. So this is what I meant.

794
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,320
This is a user story
and this is the acceptance criteria here.

795
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,480
Okay.

796
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,680
Is the report of the VA
the reporter Can the reporter in

797
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,360
JIRA is the person that created the ticket
Okay.

798
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,280
So when you create test cases
and you guys will create your tasks here,

799
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,680
you're going to see that the reporter
is going to say your name.

800
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,640
Okay. That's a very good question.

801
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,160
So the reporter means
the person that created the ticket,

802
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,880
the assigned me is the person
that this ticket is assigned to.

803
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,600
Right now, it's unassigned.

804
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,680
I haven't assigned the tickets to anybody.

805
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,320
Okay. I'm cool.

806
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,280
And the comments are here, right.

807
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,200
And you can see all the activity
and you can see the history of everything.

808
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,400
I can see everything a cell did here.

809
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,920
I can see when she deleted something,
When she changed something,

810
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,640
when she moved something.

811
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,920
I can see that she
she changed the ranking of the tickets.

812
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,680
You can see everything.

813
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,280
And with every single project management
tool, like in your organization, whichever

814
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,360
one you're going to work
with, historical data

815
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,520
that is saved
can never be fully believe it.

816
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,480
Okay,

817
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,200
Does that make sense, guys?

818
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,120
So when you use JIRA or whatever project
management tool you're going to use,

819
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:50,040
make sure that that you're professional
with your comments.

820
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,840
Okay?

821
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,520
Make sure that you're
you know, you're going to

822
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,560
make sure you use don't
be careless with it.

823
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,360
And stuff. Okay?

824
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,120
So just be professional
with your comments, with your labeling

825
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,800
everything, and I'll show you
how to do that kind of cool.

826
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,160
All right.

827
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,720
So Far you guys are doing good.

828
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,120
You guys are following instructions.
Last batch.

829
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,480
When I told them not to do anything,
they started moving tickets around.

830
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,200
They started moving things.
They disrupted the flow of the class.

831
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,760
Everything like that on campus.

832
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,800
All right, so we have a backlog go.

833
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,640
And on the left side, we have
another option that's got active sprints.

834
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,160
If I click on it, we see a board.

835
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,320
Okay?

836
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,520
And there's three columns
to do in progress and done right.

837
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,560
Obviously, right here,

838
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,360
you don't see any tickets yet
because we haven't started the sprint.

839
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,800
This is just an empty board right
now. Okay.

840
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,680
Once we start the sprint,
you're going to see that

841
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,720
you're going to see the information here.

842
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,480
And there's other stuff
that we'll talk about later.

843
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,720
But don't worry about this other options
right now.

844
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:53,640
We need that.

845
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,920
So okay, so why do we use this tool?

846
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,040
You're going to you're going to see why
to keep our day to day

847
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,200
progress, to report our progress.

848
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,480
Like, for example, we talked about
your daily startup meetings, right?

849
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,280
You guys know what those are every single
morning and agile environment.

850
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,480
You basically say what you did yesterday,
what you're going to do today.

851
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,800
And if you had any blockers.

852
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,040
So when you're saying

853
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,040
when you're saying that you basically
give an update on your work.

854
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,040
Right.

855
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,160
But we just don't talk and say it,
we have to show it somewhere.

856
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,120
Okay.

857
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,760
So JIRA is going to be
where everyone will be able

858
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,520
to see your progress of whatever it is
you're doing.

859
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,200
Okay.

860
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,040
Right here
we have four user stories right here.

861
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,080
Okay. They are in the backlog.

862
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,480
All right.

863
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,760
So lentils,
let's we're going to basically,

864
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,120
you know, practice
everything from scratch.

865
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,480
So don't do anything just yet.

866
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,920
I promise you will be able
to play with JIRA and every way possible.

867
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,000
Okay.

868
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,320
But here what we're going to do
is let's pretend we're in a team, okay?

869
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm the business analyst.

870
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You guys are developers and testers.

871
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,000
Okay, So what we're going to do

872
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
so then that's true.

873
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,040
So what we're going to do is the sprint
hasn't started yet.

874
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,800
Let's have a

875
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,080
a sprint planning session. Right.

876
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,240
But you guys ready?

877
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,200
You guys want to have a sprint
planning session?

878
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,840
This is how it's going to work.

879
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,760
You're going to have a meeting
you're going to meet and the the B

880
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,400
and the Bay or Scrum Master
is going to pull up the backlog game.

881
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,200
And you guys are on the call.

882
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,840
We're on the call. Right.

883
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,440
And what we're going to do
is we're going to say

884
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,800
we're going to create a sprint, okay?

885
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,560
We're going to create a sprint.

886
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,680
Now, this is not something
you're going to do.

887
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,640
This is only done once

888
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,520
again, the PR or the Scrum
Master will do it in your project.

889
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,240
So they'll create the sprint again.

890
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,160
And it looks like
we're going into Sprint to

891
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,800
okay, we're going into Sprint two
and then that's fine.

892
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,000
Sprint one.

893
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,400
I have to find out why I didn't
start in Sprint one, but there it is.

894
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,800
Right? So check this out.

895
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,720
This now's the backlog.

896
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,680
And now this right here is

897
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,920
what we're going to call the sprint
backlog.

898
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:11,640
Right?

899
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,880
So right here
you only see one, two, three, four.

900
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,000
You see four tickets, right.
For user stories.

901
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,800
But in a real project,
your backlog will be much larger

902
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,520
because you're going to have a list
of like a lot of tickets,

903
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,920
a lot of requirements,
a lot of user stories. Okay.

904
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,520
And now we're going to start Sprint, too.

905
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,040
So this is a sprint planning session

906
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,080
where or ceremony where I'm going to say,
okay, invalid user log in.

907
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,320
We have this test, we're going to open it.

908
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,240
I'm going to open a new tab.

909
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,360
Let's see on the a scrum, as I want to
say, okay, this is the acceptance

910
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,440
criteria.

911
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,680
Okay, Farhad, you're the developer.

912
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,440
How long is this going to take you? Right.

913
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,720
And then you give your estimate,
we're going to say

914
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,880
this is what the client wants us to work
this sprint, right?

915
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,760
They want us to complete this
in the sprint so far.

916
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,920
But can you give
like an estimate to how long

917
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,680
this would take you?

918
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,400
Right.

919
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,680
And our sprints are going to be two weeks
long, right?

920
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,880
That's fine.

921
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,520
But I think you guys already learned
about user story points, right?

922
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,680
Like assigning that level of effort,

923
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,200
the time that it's
going to take you to complete this, Right.

924
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,680
No, we're not talking about burn down
chart right now.

925
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,160
Right.

926
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,520
So we're talking about user story
points, right?

927
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,400
And in every single project,

928
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,560
every every project assigns
user story points differently.

929
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,200
Okay?

930
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,760
That is a topic that we can
we can assign to we can talk about later.

931
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,400
Okay. So I'm opening this ticket.

932
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,360
I opened it.

933
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,960
This is what we have to work on, right?

934
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,560
Let's just assume
that these are the tickets

935
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,840
that the client wants us
to work on this sprint.

936
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,600
So for how long will it take you right.

937
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,960
He can say two days, right?

938
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,920
He can say 8 hours.

939
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,600
6 hours. Right. Whatever it is. Okay.

940
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,160
Right.

941
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,800
He's saying 6 hours. Right.

942
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,280
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to edit this ticket.

943
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,360
Give me one second.

944
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:16,640
What I'm going to do is I'm going to add
this just to for reference to help us,

945
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:22,560
I'm going to click on
Let's See labels Best Solution Story.

946
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,200
Okay, I'm going to click on edits.

947
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,280
Right When I click on edit,
I'm able to edit the ticket.

948
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,760
Okay, I'm going to comment something here.

949
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,880
I'm going to say low level of effort,
right, guys?

950
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,560
Right. Level of effort.

951
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,080
Right.

952
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,920
Amount of effort

953
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,880
to complete the story.

954
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,560
He's saying 6 hours, right?

955
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,240
So 6 hours. Cool.

956
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,480
And want to update this ticket.

957
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,600
And let's see, it should be displayed

958
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,760
here. Okay. Right here. Right.

959
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,840
I added this right here. So

960
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,600
Catalina, right.

961
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,960
It looks like Catalina is doing something

962
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,280
right and Catalina,
you're supposed to be seeing my screen

963
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,600
and not doing exact like, just everyone's
observing what I'm doing right now.

964
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,240
You're not doing,
you know, hands off keyboard, basically.

965
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,480
Right?

966
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,120
So, you know, so

967
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,200
if you could, you know, that's fine.

968
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,400
Just please don't disrupt the flow of

969
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,560
the class. Right.

970
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,960
So so here it is. Right?

971
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,080
So I enter a level of effort, 6 hours.

972
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,440
But what we can also do is we can add it
to the description right here.

973
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,280
And again, don't do this.
I'm just going to do it.

974
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,320
I'm going to say L-O-V-E, All right?

975
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:46,720
Actually, I'm going to put it
under the acceptance criteria.

976
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,200
I'm going to put it right here.

977
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,680
I'm going to say hello.

978
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,560
6 hours, right?

979
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,840
6 hours.

980
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,560
Okay. There you go.

981
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,400
It's in the description. Okay.

982
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,720
So I went ahead.

983
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,080
I had it as a comment, but I'm going to
add it to the description instead.

984
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,600
Right.

985
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,840
So far,
what is going to work on this? Right.

986
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,840
So now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to click on this.

987
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,960
And Farhad, what is your job?

988
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,400
What is your email?

989
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,560
But then you guys use the email ideas.

990
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,160
What is

991
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,120
what what is what is the email?

992
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,960
Sakata Is it

993
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,040
this one

994
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,960
that you are looking at?

995
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,320
You have to. Okay, I'm going to send it
here. Okay. Right. Look.

996
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,080
So I'm selecting for hot and there you go.

997
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,520
I assigned it. Right?

998
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,800
So the business analysts or the Scrum
master in this case it was a cell.

999
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,600
Okay.

1000
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,440
And we assigned to take ticket
to Farhad, the developer.

1001
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:44,640
Right.

1002
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,000
In this case, we're seeing
that Farhad was a developer. Right.

1003
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,920
So now if I go back to the previous tab,

1004
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,800
right, this ticket,
if I go ahead and refresh it,

1005
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,680
this ticket has not has not been updated.

1006
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,040
So we have a sprint
one over here. That's fine.

1007
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,160
So we're going to skip Sprint two and
we're actually going to use Sprint one.

1008
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,360
So what we're going to do is

1009
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,640
you see
how his little avatar here as well.

1010
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:11,320
There's no picture displays because we
assign him the ticket, so it'll show that.

1011
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,960
Now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to grab this ticket

1012
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,280
and I'm going to move it to Sprint one.

1013
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,640
Okay, Now
we have a ticket in our sprint backlog.

1014
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,640
And yes, it's not in the form of word
document, it's not in an Excel sheet.

1015
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,280
Literally,
this right here is the Sprint backlog.

1016
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,800
What is the Sprint backlog?

1017
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,760
It's a document of the tickets

1018
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,280
or the tasks that we're going to work
on the current sprint.

1019
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:38,880
Right.

1020
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,400
What is the backlog in general?

1021
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,400
It's a list of task of user stories,
right.

1022
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,720
That we need to complete for the project
at some point.

1023
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,440
Right.

1024
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,320
So all we're doing and watch these guys,
all we're doing is we're getting items

1025
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,440
from the backlog and we're moving them
to the sprint backlog.

1026
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,720
Does that make sense?

1027
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:03,120
So the backlog will in most cases
be pretty long.

1028
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:04,240
They'll be huge.

1029
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,080
Like right now we have
for which you will see a lot of tickets.

1030
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,680
Right.

1031
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,800
And every single sprint,
we cannot complete every single ticket.

1032
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,600
We have to choose based on priority
with the client chooses to move

1033
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,280
whichever tickets we want to work,
they want us to work on in that sprint.

1034
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,520
Okay, Does that make sense?

1035
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,480
In this case,
I just move that ticket to Sprint one.

1036
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,360
Can I just move it to Sprint one?

1037
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,720
So now let's go to the second one, okay?

1038
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,520
And please everyone,
just keep your hands off your laptop.

1039
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,720
I promise you guys will touch you
as much as you can, but just wait and pay

1040
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,800
attention, please,
so I can cause this other ticket.

1041
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,760
Right? I don't need it.

1042
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,400
So I want to see the full ticket.

1043
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,120
What am I going to do?

1044
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,520
What am I going to do if I want to see the
full ticket for him as be 11?

1045
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,160
What?

1046
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:50,480
What?

1047
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,960
What are you going to do?

1048
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,600
Right click
and you're going to open link in new tab.

1049
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,840
Right? Exactly.

1050
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,320
So now we have this other user story.

1051
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,400
Go. What is the problem
with this user story?

1052
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,040
What is the problem here?

1053
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,000
Come on, guys pointed out,
I'll give you a hint.

1054
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,880
It's in the description.

1055
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,200
What is it? Missing something.

1056
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:14,920
Give you a hint.

1057
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,200
We're missing two words.

1058
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,120
Very good.

1059
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,440
We're missing the acceptance
criteria. Right.

1060
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,880
So we're going to go in here
and say acceptance

1061
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,640
and material.

1062
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,600
Right?

1063
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,760
And I'm going to go ahead and say that.
All right.

1064
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,840
So next person in line,
We're still in the meeting.

1065
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,720
Okay.

1066
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,040
Add an employee. Right.

1067
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,080
And we read the acceptance criteria.

1068
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,120
Okay, cool.

1069
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,640
So I'm going to say,
who's the next developer?

1070
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,680
Joseph. Joseph. Gabriel.

1071
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,160
Joseph Gabriel.
You're the developer, right?

1072
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,840
Joseph, can you please
give us an estimate for this

1073
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,760
for this ticket?

1074
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,960
Right. Can you please give us an estimate
for this ticket?

1075
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,480
Please write on the salary.

1076
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,880
And now let's wait to see what Joseph
says.

1077
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,760
God, Joseph says 5 hours.

1078
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,240
All right, So 5 hours to complete.

1079
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,960
Joseph, what is your email I.D.?

1080
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,160
What? What is it?

1081
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,160
Or the idea you used to log in?

1082
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,000
Okay. Get real, Joe.

1083
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,360
Yeah, there you go.

1084
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,280
So now we've signed it to him, right?

1085
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,920
So now I'm
going to go back to the backlog.

1086
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,240
And what I'm going to do is I can refresh
the page because it hasn't been updated.

1087
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,440
So refresh it.

1088
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,480
And now you see his avatar here. Okay.

1089
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,360
So I'm going to grab this.

1090
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,760
And what am I going to do next?

1091
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,760
You're still in the backlog.

1092
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,600
What am I going to do next?

1093
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,320
Guys?

1094
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,600
I'm going to move this to the Sprint
backlog, which Sprint Sprint Tour.

1095
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,200
Sprint one,

1096
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:54,640
Sprint one.

1097
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,200
Exactly. Because we're only working Sprint
one right now.

1098
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,040
Right, Exactly. All right.

1099
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,640
Very good.

1100
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,160
So we have two items on our sprint
backlog.

1101
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,280
Right.
So let me go back to the backlog here.

1102
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,000
Okay.

1103
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,800
So to open this ticket, add a new

1104
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,880
to view the full ticket, right click, open
link in the tab.

1105
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,560
All right.

1106
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:16,160
Who's the next developer,
let's say Roque Solano.

1107
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,520
All right. Roque Solano, Right.

1108
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,320
Rogue Solana.

1109
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,280
This is the acceptance criteria.

1110
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,760
This is what it is. Looks Roque.

1111
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,440
So I'm sorry. What is name?

1112
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:26,720
Looks.

1113
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,400
Elena Roque Solana What is
what is the level of effort?

1114
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,240
How many?

1115
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:36,760
How much time do you estimate to complete
complete this, to develop this future?

1116
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,400
Right.

1117
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,600
So let's wait to see what Roxanna says.

1118
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,520
So Rosalina says 7 hours are 7 hours.

1119
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,720
So we go and we give 7 hours.

1120
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,880
We say, okay, Roxana, can you please

1121
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,280
leave?

1122
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,400
You're funny, man.

1123
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:55,720
All right.

1124
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,200
So, Roxanna, can you please

1125
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,400
tell me your your email address

1126
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,880
or your ID so I can assign this ticket?

1127
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,400
Right.

1128
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,960
Roll over.

1129
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,880
There you go.

1130
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,360
So there it is. Right? Sign it to her.

1131
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,920
Okay.
Now I'm going to go back to the backlog.

1132
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,400
I'm going to refresh this and I'm going to
now we see this in the backlog.

1133
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,120
What Do we do next?

1134
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,560
What do we do next?

1135
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,720
Oh, let's stop right there. Hold on.

1136
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,720
Marvin asked a very good question.

1137
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,120
He said, How much time is too much
and how much time is too little?

1138
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,000
Okay, So

1139
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,560
when we start projects, right,
you kind of read it.

1140
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,720
And so here's what happens.

1141
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,320
So when a project starts, scratch

1142
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,440
in theory, you don't know how long
something is going to take you, right?

1143
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,720
Imagine
the project is just starting from scratch.

1144
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,600
A lot of things need to happen, right?

1145
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,040
A lot of you know, you don't know
how long something is going to take you.

1146
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,720
So the hours or the estimates
are usually little longer.

1147
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,360
Right?
And it's like this for the first couple.

1148
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,360
For the first few sprints,

1149
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,880
you start to realize how long something
is going to take you.

1150
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,520
Right.

1151
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,360
And then you finally get the hang of it.

1152
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:18,920
Okay.

1153
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:23,920
So once you once the project has been
established, you need to work on a story.

1154
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:24,960
Okay?

1155
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,640
For example, we do our test automation.

1156
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,480
Well, let's focus on what we're doing.

1157
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,720
We need to give an estimate of how long
something is going to take to test, right?

1158
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,600
We need to take into consideration
a few things.

1159
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,960
We need to make the time
to write the test case.

1160
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,440
We need to take the time

1161
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,320
to automate the test case
and with automation comes a lot of stuff.

1162
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,480
You have to do a lot of your selenium
and stuff and you'll learn that later.

1163
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,560
But we have to take into account

1164
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,240
that time, right, Writing the test case,
automating it and so forth.

1165
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,880
We don't just give the time
that it's going to take for us

1166
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,640
to actually test this
because more needs to go into this.

1167
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,240
We need to create a test case.

1168
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,480
We need to,
you know, automate this and so forth.

1169
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,840
So at some point
you will know how much time to get.

1170
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:15,840
For example, let's say this friend,
you gave 6 hours, right, to test.

1171
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,480
But you realize, right,
that it's going to take you much longer.

1172
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,000
This is why we have daily
standard meetings,

1173
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,560
because just because
we're giving this estimate right now

1174
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:32,520
doesn't mean that, like that
said, it's locked in and that's for sure.

1175
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:32,800
Right.

1176
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,320
A lot of the

1177
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,560
times developers can't finish their work
on time.

1178
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:39,800
Testing can't be done in the same sprint.

1179
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:44,080
So what happens
is they actually move these items

1180
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,160
to the next sprint time.

1181
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,720
Does that make sense? Right.

1182
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,000
So let's say developers working on this
and you can't finish this right?

1183
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,800
It needs more time.

1184
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,920
He didn't know
he was going to need more time

1185
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,160
then it's going to be moved over
to the next sprint.

1186
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,360
Okay. Exactly.

1187
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,360
There are times, though, where

1188
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,640
and we always have to keep the client
updated with this.

1189
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,200
Right.

1190
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,800
And so and a lot of times
it doesn't look good. Right.

1191
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,680
So let's say Roman said, okay,
this is going to take me 6 hours

1192
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,760
or this is going to take me like a week

1193
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,840
and a half or whatever,
but he still can't finish it.

1194
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,880
And then we go to the client and say, Hey,

1195
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,880
I'm sorry we won't be able to finish this
this sprint.

1196
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,520
It needs to carry on to the next sprint.

1197
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,880
Right?
And the client's going to be like, what?

1198
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,080
I thought you guys were going to be able
to finish this, right?

1199
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,160
But now you can't.

1200
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:38,280
And then they're like,
okay, fine, move to the next sprint.

1201
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,760
But what happens is next, Sprint,
the same thing happens again.

1202
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,120
What happens next?

1203
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:47,280
Sprint Roman gives an estimate
and he can't deliver, right?

1204
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,000
So then we have to go
to the client and say, Hey,

1205
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:52,440
you know,

1206
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:57,200
we can't we're not going to be able
to finish our our, our task this sprint.

1207
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:57,800
Right?

1208
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,040
So they're not going to fire you.

1209
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,880
But then it starts to get annoying
for the client. Right.

1210
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,200
And it certainly won't look good for us.

1211
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,840
It won't look good for us.

1212
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,040
It is not clear.

1213
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,440
So when you give time estimates, Right.

1214
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,480
And you will eventually learn
how to give time, estimate and so forth,

1215
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:21,040
you always want to give yourself more
than enough time to complete your task.

1216
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,920
For example, if you know 100% sure

1217
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,960
that you can finish something in one hour,
just give yourself another hour.

1218
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,600
Do 2 hours, right?

1219
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,040
If you're for sure that you can finish

1220
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,520
something in 6 hours, like 100%
sure you can finish in 6 hours.

1221
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,680
Give yourself another couple hours
instead of six.

1222
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,400
Say eight. Right.

1223
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,600
Give yourself
some extra, extra time. Cool.

1224
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,360
All right.

1225
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,840
So I'm going to move this back to this.

1226
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,840
I'm going to move this to the Sprint one.

1227
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,040
Okay.

1228
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,720
Now we have this last one,
certain employee who wants to be

1229
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:57,120
a developer for this.

1230
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,080
And by the way,
this is our sprint planning session.

1231
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,360
Again,
this is their spring planning session.

1232
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:02,280
Cool.

1233
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:03,760
All right.

1234
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,960
So there's an employee here.

1235
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,240
We're going to have to delete this.

1236
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:11,160
This is from last.

1237
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:16,240
So did we say Sheriff?

1238
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,320
Sheriff?

1239
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,680
Sheriff is developer.

1240
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:24,480
Sheriff, give an estimate, please.

1241
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,800
Like how long, as a developer,
what this takes to develop.

1242
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,600
Good.

1243
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,280
You say 9 hours. Okay.

1244
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:34,800
9 hours.

1245
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,720
It is right there.

1246
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,280
It is 9 hours. Now,

1247
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,280
I want to show you guys something, right.

1248
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,840
So we give 9 hours.

1249
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:53,240
Sheriff, what is your user ID?

1250
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,640
What is your Sharia

1251
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,080
position?

1252
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,400
Of course.

1253
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:00,320
Okay, cool.

1254
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,720
So I'm going to take this issue right now.

1255
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,800
Now, I forgot one step. Right?

1256
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,400
I forgot.

1257
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,720
And I'm sorry, I forgot,
but let's go back to the first.

1258
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,320
Take it. Right.
So I'm going to grab this ticket.

1259
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,840
I'm going to move it to the sprint. Okay.
We have a sprint backlog.

1260
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,080
It looks nice.

1261
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,720
Okay.

1262
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,680
And I'm going to refresh this,
but I forgot one thing and I'm sorry.

1263
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,120
Let's go back to the first one.

1264
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,120
Let's say a valid user log
in, the one with Farhad.

1265
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:23,960
Right.

1266
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,760
So here's the thing, right?

1267
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,280
Farhad gave his employees, right.

1268
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,640
And in this sprint,

1269
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:35,160
this Sprint grooming session
sprint backlog,

1270
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,160
we sprint planning.

1271
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,560
This is just development hours, right?

1272
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:41,440
So we can say

1273
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,120
developments

1274
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,200
LLC and then we need testing, right?

1275
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,560
So let's say we have the testers.

1276
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:56,760
Silva Silva you're the tester,
you're the Silva.

1277
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,560
You know, it's going to take
four hot 6 hours to complete this.

1278
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,880
How long will it take you to test this

1279
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,520
use user story?

1280
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,000
So is is Silva there?

1281
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,880
Yeah, she's there.

1282
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,040
She says 5 hours.

1283
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,480
5 hours. Right.

1284
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,320
So now we've also measured that.

1285
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,480
So in total.

1286
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,040
In total,
how long is it going to take the team

1287
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:27,120
to complete this user story?

1288
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,400
11 hours.

1289
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,240
Exactly. Right.

1290
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,280
Very, very good. Right.

1291
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,400
So let's go back
and let's update the other tickets.

1292
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,520
So we have our developers already gave the
the estimate.

1293
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,000
Let's go to this one.

1294
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,560
Get Gabriel gave leave for 5 hours.

1295
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,520
And Eris, you're secure for this, right?

1296
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,240
So hours,

1297
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,600
how long is it going to take you to

1298
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,600
to test is three

1299
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,480
pieces, 4 hours.

1300
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,640
4 hours. Right. That's what he's saying.

1301
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,280
So now, how long is it
going to take us to complete?

1302
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,560
Exactly.

1303
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,240
9 hours. Right?

1304
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:10,760
Very good.

1305
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,680
As did you guys are doing really good
for your first sprint planning session.

1306
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,120
Very, very good.

1307
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:22,240
I told you I would hire all of you
if I could immediately, right away.

1308
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,480
Skip interview that thing. Right.

1309
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,240
So here

1310
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,320
we have development and then we have

1311
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,200
Roxana gave 7 hours for development.

1312
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,760
Okay? And now we need a cure for this.

1313
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,800
The cure for this will be

1314
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,000
to monitor you, if you like.

1315
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,760
Do you feel like working tomorrow?

1316
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,920
Tomorrow? Give us an estimate, please.

1317
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:50,680
Give us an A.

1318
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,760
How long is it going to take you to test
this user story?

1319
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,440
She's is 3 hours old. Yikes.

1320
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,400
That's a little concerning, right?
Why is that little concerning? Does

1321
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,160
That's a little concerning, right.

1322
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,640
Rog is going to step in and say tomorrow,

1323
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:09,280
wait a minute,
what is it going to take me 7 hours?

1324
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,720
Oh, you're going to test it in 3 hours,
right.

1325
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,600
And tomorrow going to say, yeah, probably.

1326
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,040
And she's probably right.

1327
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,320
So let's leave it at 3 hours. Okay.

1328
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,720
So how long is it going to take us
to complete this ticket?

1329
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,920
The team?

1330
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,280
10 hours, Right.

1331
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,280
Okay. Very, very good.

1332
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,480
All right. Let's come back here.

1333
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:35,640
This refresh it, and then we're going
to open this link in a new tab and then.

1334
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,400
All right?

1335
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:37,640
Sure.

1336
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,840
Sure. Of cancer.

1337
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:43,640
We gave the privacy,

1338
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,640
so we need to.

1339
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,040
That's going to

1340
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,080
lead.

1341
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,600
All right. So

1342
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,320
let's say.

1343
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,360
Oh, sorry, did you
who is red tendrils something?

1344
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,240
Are we just giving ours by assuming
we're making our best assumptions

1345
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,400
to how long it's going to take us.

1346
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,280
Yes, that's Andrew.

1347
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:06,680
Very good.

1348
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,640
But we need to be careful
with this estimate.

1349
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,240
Okay.

1350
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,440
So, no, you want to be the cure for this.

1351
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,160
So no.

1352
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:18,840
How long is it going to take you to test
as user story,

1353
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:25,560
how long it's going to take you?

1354
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,520
24 hours.

1355
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,600
Right now, this is also concerning, right?

1356
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,320
Because now Sharif is going to step
in and say, wait a minute,

1357
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,080
what are you going to do?

1358
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,200
Right. But then maybe,

1359
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,160
maybe what?

1360
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:42,720
Who give that?

1361
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:47,160
No, Maybe all the smart is probably
saying, okay, it's going to take 9 hours

1362
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:51,240
to develop this, but
I know that I have to create a test cases.

1363
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:51,800
I know that

1364
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:56,240
I have to write an automation script
and that's going to take me some time.

1365
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,240
This pregnancy.

1366
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,920
I've never tested this feature before,

1367
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,080
so I think this is how long it's
going to take me, right?

1368
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,160
So we'll say, okay, fine.

1369
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,640
Right. That's
probably what he thought about.

1370
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,520
Okay, that's fine. Cool. Right.

1371
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,680
So let's go back because that.

1372
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,240
All right, cool.

1373
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:13,920
Are we there, guys? Are we there?

1374
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,320
Are we listening? Right.

1375
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,600
So now there's nothing
on our backlog right now,

1376
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:18,920
but in

1377
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:22,000
your project, there
will be a lot of items on your backlog.

1378
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,920
And every single time more
items are being added.

1379
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,720
So now for Sprint one, are you guys ready,
guys to start the sprint?

1380
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:33,360
Are you ready or are you ready? Right.

1381
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,240
Another question. Do we always use ours?

1382
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,880
No, I show from Fairfax,
we use a user points.

1383
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,120
Right.

1384
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,600
And but guys, I want to say it
varies from project to project.

1385
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,520
We either use user story points

1386
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,560
or in some projects you use ours.

1387
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,360
Your projects will have.

1388
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,480
It's very traditional
to calculate by user story points,

1389
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,960
but your projects will have
their own thing, they'll have their own,

1390
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,920
you know, their own little,
little thing going on to go,

1391
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:05,280
and they'll obviously tell you
how it's working, you know, not not,

1392
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,960
not just going to expect it to jump in

1393
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,440
and be like,
oh, you don't know how to do this.

1394
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,880
No, don't tell you.
They'll show you. You know, it's fine.

1395
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,280
So are you guys ready?

1396
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,560
We just had our spring planning session.

1397
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,080
It was ours.

1398
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:17,880
The same as points.

1399
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,200
No It's not. It changes

1400
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,880
because the sprint is to be long,
so we make our testing based on that.

1401
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:26,640
Yes, You have to write.

1402
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,440
Oh, and by the way,
there's four tickets here, right?

1403
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,000
And we gave like very little hours. Right.

1404
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:35,840
But any real project,
there will be a lot more tickets.

1405
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,840
There will be a lot tickets.

1406
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,880
Who is going to be like a lot more?

1407
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,360
And you're obviously going to be testing
more than one ticket.

1408
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:45,960
Okay.

1409
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:49,640
Like, obviously, there's than 7 hours
in a sprint, so they'll give you more.

1410
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:51,440
Don't wait. You will be busy.

1411
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,360
So. All right, Ready?

1412
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,120
We're going to start the sprint.

1413
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,240
Okay, hold on.

1414
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:01,360
If I don't click start Sprint and if I go
to active sprints, there is nothing here.

1415
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,440
This is the Sprint board.

1416
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,880
Okay, This is the Sprint board.

1417
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,240
There's nothing here.

1418
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,320
So I need to actually start the sprint.

1419
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,680
I'm a quick start sprint. Okay.

1420
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,280
And I get to make some configurations
here.

1421
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,480
I want to say two weeks start date.

1422
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:22,560
It's going to start on October 20th,
which is tomorrow at 12:12 a.m.

1423
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,280
I'm actually going to move this to today.

1424
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,520
Okay.

1425
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,160
So it will start and we'll go to,
you know, November 2nd.

1426
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,000
Okay.

1427
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,080
So that's two weeks, guys.

1428
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:33,880
So I'm going to start

1429
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,320
from one and bam, let's jump.

1430
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,560
So now, look,
you still if you click on backlog,

1431
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,840
you will still see the items here.

1432
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,240
Okay.

1433
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,240
And then at sprints.

1434
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,840
Now, what do we see now?

1435
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,280
We see the tickets on the board,
we see the issues on the board,

1436
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,640
we see the stories on the board. Right?

1437
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,400
We had X is a successful
sprint planning session.

1438
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,480
Guys, give yourselves around.

1439
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,680
Plus, that was very good.

1440
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,480
How did you guys like it?
That was good, right?

1441
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:03,120
That was good.

1442
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,280
We met up, we read the acceptance
criteria, we gave Eloise,

1443
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,400
we gave development hours,
We gave testing hours.

1444
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,960
Right.
This is how it will work in the project.

1445
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,720
This is exactly how it's going to work
right.

1446
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,920
They're very, very good. Right.

1447
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,680
So that.

1448
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,360
How do you guys feel?

1449
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,240
It feels good, right? That's it was hard.

1450
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,160
It was pretty easy, right?

1451
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,120
There's nothing hard about this.

1452
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:26,640
Right?

1453
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,600
So how long is our sprint
if you're paying attention?

1454
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,400
How long is our sprint?

1455
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,000
Two weeks.

1456
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,840
Exactly They vary, but others

1457
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,080
do it with some systems and

1458
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,520
others a sprint planning session.

1459
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,800
You take guys?
That is a very good question.

1460
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,680
The question was
how does a sprint planning session usually

1461
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,760
take a sprint planning session?

1462
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,800
The meeting, the ceremony we just had?

1463
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,520
It depends.

1464
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,800
Sometimes they take like an hour,
sometimes it could take 2 hours.

1465
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,080
Sometimes I've been some quick ones
that take like 30 minutes.

1466
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,200
You know, it all depends.

1467
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:09,760
So it varies from but sometimes they like
to just limited to one hour.

1468
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,400
It all depends on your project. Go, Go.

1469
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,600
All right, cool.

1470
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,040
So anyway, this is the board,
so not everyone log in and everyone go.

1471
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,400
Listen to this. Listen to this.

1472
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,960
Click on a project
okay, click on projects.

1473
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:29,200
And if you don't see them as batch 11.

1474
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,600
Okay, First of all,
let me know if you see this.

1475
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,960
And if you see this, click on it.

1476
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,640
If you don't see this, let me know. Yeah.

1477
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,400
Okay.

1478
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:41,520
If you don't see this, okay, then do this.

1479
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,320
Do what I'm going to do.

1480
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,680
Okay, look, when you click on projects
first, click on projects.

1481
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,200
Are you then give a thumbs up.

1482
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:53,840
If you did that, like Skip
give there's like a thumbs up emoji there.

1483
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,000
Some thumbs up.

1484
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,720
Okay. So,

1485
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,440
all right,

1486
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,680
then go to the bottom where it says view
all projects.

1487
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,040
You guys should all have
that option, right?

1488
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,160
So click on the all projects

1489
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,400
and when you click on your projects,
you're going to see like a list

1490
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,600
of projects here.

1491
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,840
Yes. And by the way, no,
we don't take pictures anymore.

1492
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,160
Right. You are an i.t.

1493
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,400
Professional, right?

1494
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,640
We take screenshots, right?

1495
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:23,960
If you don't know how to do it,
what do you do.

1496
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,240
You don't know how to do what you do.

1497
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,240
You wouldn't know what to do, right?

1498
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,920
You know what to do. So.

1499
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,760
So do you guys see this for those of you
that you guys see this, right?

1500
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,320
You guys should see something.
That is right.

1501
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,320
Go, go, go.

1502
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,000
Right.
So now we have to look for our project.

1503
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,840
These are a lot of projects
from different guys.

1504
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,880
Don't click on them.

1505
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,320
Please do not click on
any of these other projects.

1506
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,000
Then please don't do that.

1507
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,080
So scroll down until you see our mess.

1508
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,240
Batch 11. That's your project.

1509
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,400
So click on this HMS Batch 11.

1510
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,800
Okay, HMS Batch 11.

1511
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,640
Okay.

1512
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:07,040
Once you click on it right,
you will see the Sprint board.

1513
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,160
Okay, Do not move the tickets again.

1514
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,720
I will be able to see
just like we were able to see Catalina's,

1515
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,560
you know, actions on the board.

1516
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,840
I'll be able to see what you're doing.

1517
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,360
Okay, cool.

1518
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:25,120
So. Right.

1519
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,120
So are we here?

1520
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:29,440
Are we on the sprint board?

1521
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,480
Are we on the springboard?

1522
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:34,720
Very good. Very good.

1523
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,840
All right, so now what we're going to do
and I want you to see this.

1524
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,760
Right? Hands off.

1525
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,600
Hands off, gyro!

1526
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:40,920
Hands off gyro!

1527
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:43,720
Okay, Just fantastic. Right?

1528
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,440
These tickets.

1529
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,840
Watch. And please,
just watch. Watch me. Right.

1530
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,800
Don't do what I'm going to do again.

1531
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,960
Don't do what I'm going to do because
you're going to ruin a lot of things.

1532
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,280
I want
to see if anyone's when we be already.

1533
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,200
Okay, good balance.

1534
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:57,680
Moving stuff.

1535
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,240
You guys are doing much better
than the last batch. Last batch?

1536
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,560
We had some kids in class.

1537
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:05,080
I had to tell them, like,
you kind of have to look up some stuff.

1538
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,840
So here's the thing, right?

1539
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:09,480
So these tickets. Right.

1540
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,520
These tickets right.

1541
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,560
They can be moved.

1542
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,240
Okay.

1543
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,600
Now, let me tell you something.

1544
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,880
In projects, this is a big deal.

1545
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,120
If you're going to grab a ticket from the
to do column two in progress,

1546
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,680
this means that
now this ticket is in progress.

1547
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,720
Okay? It means that has been developed.

1548
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,000
It means that is currently being worked
on. Right.

1549
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,560
Whenever it's complete.

1550
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,360
Where do you think
this is going to be moved to

1551
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:37,200
tomorrow?

1552
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,960
You are like, you know what
we call people like you tomorrow.

1553
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,880
What do we call
people like tomorrow, guys?

1554
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:44,600
What do we call people like tomorrow?

1555
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,000
Years, right?

1556
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,400
A bag of money.

1557
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,280
That's exactly
kind of the best we can lose, right?

1558
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,640
A bag of money right now.

1559
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:53,800
Look at this. Right?

1560
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,960
As soon as they move this is done,
there's a line that kind of goes over the

1561
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:58,600
the link here.

1562
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,360
You guys see,
this is like scratched means.

1563
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,480
It's like done, right?

1564
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,640
So anyway, I'm just trying to tell you
that we can move these tickets

1565
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,200
in according to our progress.

1566
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,360
So in our daily stand up meetings. Right.

1567
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,560
We'll move the tickets. Right.

1568
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,720
Let's say we have two tickets on hold
and two more.

1569
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:15,720
You get the progress,
right? You're going to say

1570
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:17,560
Emily is

1571
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,600
going to be like, Yeah,
I'm still working on MSB.

1572
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,080
11 04i wrote some test for this.

1573
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,200
I'm still working on it.

1574
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,360
I hope to finish
by the end of the day, right?

1575
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,480
And then there you go.

1576
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,800
Right. So like, okay, cool.

1577
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:35,400
Next person to money
says, you know what, Last week I was

1578
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,280
I mean, yesterday

1579
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:39,160
I was out of the office,
but today I'm going to start working on it

1580
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:40,560
and that kind of thing.

1581
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,280
Okay, then Marianne from Maryland
come says.

1582
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,640
Yep, I'm working on that.

1583
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:48,840
I should be done next couple
hours, I'll pick up on another task.

1584
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:53,040
You know, Mikkel comes in and says,
I don't have anything assigned to me.

1585
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,680
Can I pick up a ticket? Okay.

1586
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:56,600
You know, and so forth. Right.

1587
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,400
And that is what it is.

1588
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,400
Okay, cool.

1589
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,920
Yes or yes, you I understand

1590
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,920
the school.

1591
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:08,640
All right.

1592
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,240
So cool, cool, cool.

1593
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,360
All right. So

1594
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,240
let's continue doing this.

1595
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,240
So don't move any tickets, okay?

1596
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:24,840
Don't move any tickets.

1597
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,800
Yes, it can.

1598
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,560
But we shouldn't do that. It's really bad.

1599
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,920
Practice is bad practice.

1600
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,760
Cool.

1601
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,600
But this page for developers or testers.

1602
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,040
No, this is the board for the whole team.

1603
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,480
That is a good question.

1604
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:41,640
Okay.

1605
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:45,480
This is the board for the whole team.

1606
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,320
Okay. The whole team.

1607
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,160
The BAS,
the product managers, the program owners,

1608
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:53,440
the product I'll be able to see
as a client if they're on the call.

1609
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,920
This is everyone, developers, right?

1610
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,000
Everyone gets on that call and discusses
what's on the board.

1611
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:00,600
Right.

1612
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,080
And it everyone is on the same thing. Come

1613
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,000
at the pens PRC That's a good question.

1614
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,800
Who can move it?

1615
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,840
Actually, anyone can move it, right?

1616
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:16,280
Anyone can move these tickets,
but you shouldn't move them

1617
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,880
because you will change the process
so you shouldn't move them

1618
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,680
unless you are trying
to indicate the progress by.

1619
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:25,360
Let's go. Cool. So.

1620
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,240
All right, now, everyone,
before we go on break,

1621
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,320
I want to discuss something else
because this is what we're going to do.

1622
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,720
I am actually

1623
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,880
to move these tickets to in progress,
all of them,

1624
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:41,000
because we're working on them. But

1625
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
again, now let's say they're developed.

1626
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,400
Okay, Let's say they're developed.

1627
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,160
Bam, They're developed.

1628
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,160
Let me move them.

1629
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,120
Let's say they're developed.

1630
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:53,040
Okay, So now all of you guys will test
every single ticket here.

1631
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,120
And this is what you guys are to do.

1632
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,360
First of all, I want you guys
to click on a ticket, see a preview.

1633
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:01,400
I want you guys to right
click and open link and you tap it.

1634
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,960
Not right now. I'm just showing you right.

1635
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,200
And then I want you to read the acceptance
criteria.

1636
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,120
Okay? And

1637
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,400
and I want you to test this.

1638
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,920
After you test it,
I want you to write a test case

1639
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,960
and you're going to write a cucumber
scenario, okay?

1640
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,760
And the way that you're going to do that
is this once you open the ticket, right?

1641
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,560
You're like, okay, I'm testing it. Okay?

1642
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,240
I know what I need to do now.

1643
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,440
I need to write a cucumber
in there for it.

1644
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,960
So what you're going to do
is you're going to create

1645
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,480
you're going to click create, okay?

1646
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,720
And you're going to see that issued,
typed, right?

1647
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:40,800
Because we said that
everything jeera is an issue.

1648
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,640
So when we click on this right,
you have three options.

1649
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,600
You have the option to either
create a story to create a bug

1650
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,840
or to create an epic. Right.

1651
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:54,920
We'll talk more about that later
in this case, we want to leave it at task.

1652
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,840
Okay. Task is already selected. Go.

1653
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,640
And what you're going to do
is it's actually 820

1654
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:05,760
to tell you what we'll do all of this
after break.

1655
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,320
It's 822 because I know
that somebody doesn't want break.

1656
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,920
Let's come back at eight 840.

1657
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,240
That's a good break.
That's a very good break.

1658
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,600
That's a generous break.

1659
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,720
That's too much of a break.

1660
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,800
Don't move the tickets on the board.

1661
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,000
Don't move the tickets on the board.

1662
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,840
Don't move the tickets on the board.

1663
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,480
All right.

1664
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,800
So go and enjoy it.

1665
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,480
This is going to be very easy going.

1666
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:33,320
Enjoy your,
you know, your break or whatever. And

1667
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:36,600
anyone who has questions, as usual

1668
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,680
here,

1669
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,520
if anyone has problems,
anyone struggling to catch up,

1670
01:21:42,880 --> 01:22:25,360
this is your time to catch up.

1671
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,720
Yep. 840

1672
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,640
Gerald, quick

1673
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:54,480
review on what?

1674
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,160
Gerald What do you mean quick review?

1675
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,120
And you'll get it.

1676
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:57,600
No worries.

1677
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,280
We're going to upload all every,
all the slides.

1678
01:22:59,280 --> 01:22:59,840
Okay,

1679
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,480
I'll make sure we do that.

1680
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:03,960
Yeah,

1681
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:21,120
sure, sure, sure.

1682
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,080
But that's

1683
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,960
what they were saying.

1684
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:27,120
I missed it so

1685
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:13,160
a quick review of all I see
it will be tender.

1686
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,520
What do you want? A quick review of

1687
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,080
You were
working on log in when you started.

1688
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,280
What do you mean you were working

1689
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,680
on log in or you missed the first part or

1690
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:57,240
you look confused.

1691
01:24:57,240 --> 01:25:23,240
You want me to start
from the beginning of JIRA?

1692
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:23,560
Yeah.

1693
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:25,720
I'll give a quick review
once we come back,

1694
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:35,360
but please follow along
because it is a lot of information.

1695
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,640
How many takers
can be assigned to one tester?

1696
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,520
And it depends on project to project.

1697
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,640
I mean, I said it depends, depends on

1698
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,960
how big the tickets are.

1699
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,200
Depends.

1700
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,560
I've had up to like 20 or

1701
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,800
30 tickets assigned to me at once.

1702
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,600
Well,

1703
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,400
sometimes as low as two,

1704
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:16,200
maybe one.

1705
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,560
All right, guys, we are back.

1706
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,960
You guys see my screen right now?

1707
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,280
Everything or

1708
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,080
how about now?

1709
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,400
Yes, you see it? Okay, cool.

1710
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,080
All right. So.

1711
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,560
All right, we're back.

1712
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,000
Let's talk someone else
real quick for a quick review of JIRA.

1713
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,400
Okay. So

1714
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,760
let's talk about what JIRA, we basically
discussed a lot about with you.

1715
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,200
But high level, high level,
short overview.

1716
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,280
What is JIRA?

1717
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:53,080
But what is JIRA?

1718
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:55,400
It's a project management tool. Right.

1719
01:26:55,400 --> 01:27:02,360
And what can we essentially do
with this tool?

1720
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:07,680
What can we essentially do with this tool?

1721
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,960
Manage a project, right?

1722
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,640
Create a user story, tasks, bugs.

1723
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,280
You know, so far it's right. Everything.

1724
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,280
We keep track of our work,
what we're working

1725
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,800
on, you know, give updates,

1726
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,440
you know, and so forth.

1727
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:26,840
You got

1728
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:30,120
who sees gyro, you the whole team does.

1729
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:30,960
It's for everyone.

1730
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,240
This is where everything is.

1731
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:35,000
Okay. These are the user stories.

1732
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,800
Do you guys remember when we started class
and I said, Hey, if an acceptance

1733
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,040
criteria needs to be updated, ask
the business analyst to update the ticket.

1734
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:47,040
You guys remember,
this is exactly what I mean.

1735
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:51,040
So if you read this
and an acceptance criteria is unclear,

1736
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:53,600
you would say, Hey, can you clarify this?

1737
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,000
Okay, boom, it's been clarified

1738
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,360
and you're going to say, okay,
can you update the ticket?

1739
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,920
So it reflects that.

1740
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,600
So they'll come here
and they'll update the ticket.

1741
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,760
Does that make sense?

1742
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,360
This is where they do everything. Cool.

1743
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:08,560
All right.

1744
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:12,840
So we manage our tools here.

1745
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,560
We had a a sample of a

1746
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,840
sprint planning ceremony, right?

1747
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,400
We had that sample of Sprint
planning ceremony.

1748
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,360
We did.

1749
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:25,280
And that's how they would go.

1750
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,120
Right.

1751
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:29,120
What do we do in the sprint
planning ceremony?

1752
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:37,440
What do we do?

1753
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,800
We created the sprint.

1754
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,640
We had a meeting, but what do we do?

1755
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:44,520
We assign we assigned level of efforts.

1756
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,320
Right? Exactly.

1757
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,320
Scott said. Assigned to developers.

1758
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,280
Right, exactly.

1759
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:51,720
Very good. Right.

1760
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:54,960
And if you remember,

1761
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,040
we were on the backlog, right?

1762
01:28:57,480 --> 01:28:59,560
And we had the items in the backlog.

1763
01:28:59,560 --> 01:28:59,840
Right.

1764
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,080
And we moved them to the sprint that we're
currently in, which is Sprint one.

1765
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,880
And you can see here that it's active.

1766
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:06,400
Cool.

1767
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:12,480
All right, cool.

1768
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,000
All right.

1769
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,640
So now let's say that the tickets are the
they have been developed,

1770
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,040
okay, have been developed
and they're here.

1771
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:25,000
They're in progress.

1772
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,080
However, we can move it to Don
because testing hasn't been completed yet.

1773
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:32,560
So what we're going to do is this
this is going to be your test and everyone

1774
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:37,080
pay attention to this,
but don't do anything yet on the board.

1775
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:40,160
Please pay very close attention

1776
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,680
so that you don't have to ask
a million questions.

1777
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,120
You're
going to open this ticket in a new tab.

1778
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,720
And when you're here you're
going to read the acceptance criteria.

1779
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,400
Okay, guys, what are you going to do?

1780
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,520
And you're going to
I want you guys to test it first.

1781
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,960
I want you guys to go into the syntax
mass application

1782
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,920
and test this yourself first.

1783
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,280
Go without writing a test case
first. Cool.

1784
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:10,440
Then after that and after you know what
to do and everything like that,

1785
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,960
then what you're going to do
is you're going to create a task.

1786
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,280
You're going to create a task.

1787
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,680
And this is what I want you guys to do.

1788
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:25,760
So let's say that
I am testing this ticket, okay?

1789
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:28,920
Let's say I am testing this ticket.

1790
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:33,240
What I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy the name of this ticket.

1791
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:37,240
When it copy the name of this ticket,

1792
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:41,040
you can copy it somewhere, you know,
whatever I'm going to click create.

1793
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:42,960
And the summary is that name.

1794
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,000
I'm going to put the name here.

1795
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:48,600
But first I want you guys to type A,

1796
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:54,000
a user log in and at the end, type
your name.

1797
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:54,680
Okay?

1798
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:57,920
Type your name.

1799
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,520
Okay.

1800
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,760
This is the naming convention
that we're going to follow with the task

1801
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,200
that we're going to create. Okay.

1802
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,920
Now listen to this. Right?

1803
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,680
I'm going to scroll down and I'm going to

1804
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,080
assign it to myself.

1805
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:17,320
This case, I'm a cell, so I'm going
to send it to myself, assign it to you.

1806
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,160
Assign it to you
right here in the assigning field.

1807
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:21,480
That's going to be you.

1808
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,320
Okay. And here's the thing, right?

1809
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:24,360
I want you to look at this.

1810
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,480
I want you to

1811
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:31,800
click on Sprint and select
the active sprint.

1812
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:32,080
Right.

1813
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:36,760
And we are in
H are a mess and pay very close attention

1814
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:40,960
to which spread you select
out of all of these.

1815
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,480
We are an h r m as b 11.

1816
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:48,600
That's 11 for your for your batch
sprint one and you see at the sprint

1817
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,640
you're not going to click sprint two,
you're not going to click Sprint three,

1818
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,640
you're not going to click on a batch
ten project,

1819
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,200
you're not going to click on anything
else.

1820
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:59,360
You're going to go to HMS B 11 and click
Sprint one read

1821
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,080
as you're active a sprint, Don't
do anything yet, okay?

1822
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:04,800
Don't do anything yet.

1823
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,920
So when I do that,
I get a message on the bottom

1824
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:11,880
that says Sprint scope
will be affected by this action.

1825
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,800
Okay, so I am

1826
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,040
creating a new ticket,
okay, I'm creating a new issue.

1827
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:18,880
What is this issue?

1828
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,640
This is a task.

1829
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:23,320
Okay. This is a task, right?

1830
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:28,960
And I'm set because I'm assigning it
to this sprint, which is already active,

1831
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,240
and I'm adding more work to the
to the sprint

1832
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,760
I'm getting this message right,

1833
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:40,480
saying that the sprint scope
will be affected by this action.

1834
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:46,000
Again, essentially when we add a ticket
on the board or a issue on the board,

1835
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,200
that means that there's more work to do,
meaning more time, Right?

1836
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,000
That's exactly what it means.

1837
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,800
So that's what we're getting the message.

1838
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,560
But honestly, we're just going to use this
to write a test case and stuff.

1839
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:59,320
We've technically already
assigned our employees.

1840
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:03,120
We're testing stock and our test case
creation is part of that employee, right?

1841
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,800
So here what we're going to do
is you're going to click this,

1842
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:09,600
and here

1843
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,600
is I want
you guys to be very close to this one.

1844
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,200
Okay.

1845
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,080
So first of all, let me cancel this.

1846
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,080
Okay. And let's start again.

1847
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:19,440
I want to see
if you guys were paying attention.

1848
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:22,800
So what am I going to do first?

1849
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,400
What am I going to do

1850
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,040
not create?

1851
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,200
What am I going to do before create?

1852
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,400
Copy the name of what?

1853
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,160
Copy the name of what

1854
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,400
I want.

1855
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,640
Copy the name of the ticket
Title of the user story ticket.

1856
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,320
Right this right here.

1857
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,360
So I'm going to copy this. Okay.

1858
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:49,880
And then what am I going to do?

1859
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,480
Create. Yes.

1860
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:56,240
And then what am I going to do here?

1861
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:59,120
I'm going to place it
in the summary. Right?

1862
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,320
And then what am I going to do?

1863
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,000
What am I going to do with the name?

1864
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,880
Tell me, where am I going to write this?

1865
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:08,320
Very, very good. Yes, that's right.

1866
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:13,640
I said from Fairfax things
Q a hyphen about user log in

1867
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,400
right hyphen and your name.

1868
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:19,440
So I can visually see better
because you guys are going to create

1869
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,880
a lot of tickets.

1870
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,800
I want to be able to easily see who it is.

1871
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,640
Okay, so Diego, right?

1872
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:26,040
You're going to write your name.

1873
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,120
Okay, What's next, guys?

1874
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,800
What am I going to do next?

1875
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,800
You're going to scroll down
in the same to myself, right?

1876
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:37,040
In this case, we're going to send it
to cell because I'm a cell right now.

1877
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:37,640
Okay.

1878
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,560
Okay cool.

1879
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,680
All right.
And then what else am I going to do?

1880
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,080
Pick the correct spread?

1881
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:49,080
Yes. So I'm going to click on this
and what Sprint are in.

1882
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:54,640
Which one are you going to click on?

1883
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:55,160
Sprint one.

1884
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:58,000
But which one match 11. Sprint one.

1885
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:59,000
This one.

1886
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,360
Right. HMS B 11. Right.

1887
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,560
So I'm going to click this. Okay. Right.

1888
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,320
Very, very nice.

1889
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,400
Fantastic. Beautifully done.

1890
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:12,160
There is one more important
step that we need to do.

1891
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,160
Okay?

1892
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,640
And this is going to be the step
that I actually want to remember the most.

1893
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,600
Okay.

1894
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,080
So first of all, there's this option here

1895
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:25,920
that says linked issues
a.k.a linked tickets.

1896
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:26,800
Right?

1897
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,440
And we're going to say that this task
that we're creating, right, this task

1898
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:36,360
that we're creating, make sure this is
set to tests with an S right.

1899
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:39,880
This task tests.

1900
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,320
What issue

1901
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:43,840
H are

1902
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,600
a mess B11 for do you guys see this right
here?

1903
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,800
This ticket is going to test
h arm b elapses.

1904
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:55,520
I wanted to have an h r
and that's actually not bromfield.

1905
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:59,080
Sorry, h r that's u C and it comes here.

1906
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,800
So I'm going to select this one
right here.

1907
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:02,520
Okay?

1908
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,000
That's what I'm going to do.

1909
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,040
Okay. Now

1910
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,840
again, we're going to make sure
that this is in test.

1911
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:10,520
If you click on it,

1912
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:13,920
there are other options relates to blocks,
clones, errors like that.

1913
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,360
Now we want to select test
because this task tests

1914
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:22,880
HMS B alone for now.

1915
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,040
What happens
if we don't do this part? Right?

1916
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,280
And I'll tell you what happens.

1917
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:30,320
So what I'm doing right now,
the linking that I'm doing right now,

1918
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,400
the linking that

1919
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:36,800
doing right now
is creating or establishing a relationship

1920
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,520
between this ticket, this task
and the user story.

1921
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:42,360
Okay.

1922
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:45,400
If I don't link it,
there will be no relationship at all.

1923
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,480
And I'm going to show you
how that works, Right.

1924
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,520
So I'm going to link it
No one to anything.

1925
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,080
Once I do this, I'm going to create it.

1926
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,560
Right? Okay. And it's creating red.

1927
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,480
And if I scroll down
and actually if I refresh the page,

1928
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,880
right, you see, I, I,
if I says this ticket is below for

1929
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:09,200
if I scroll down it says it's tested
by the ticket we just created.

1930
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,520
So not as the terminology
that we selected.

1931
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,720
We said tests, right.

1932
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:18,120
And we selected this
and now it kind of changed on its own.

1933
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:22,280
Is it tested by
so this is saying, hey, HMS B 11

1934
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:25,560
four is tested by this ticket, right?

1935
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:30,080
So we're able to open this ticket
and this is the ticket that we created.

1936
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:32,560
There's obviously nothing there.
We didn't add any steps subscript.

1937
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,920
That's that's what we did.

1938
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:40,040
Now, if I didn't do the linking guys,
we wouldn't be able to see this here.

1939
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,760
Look, it would look like this,

1940
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:43,880
but I'm going to delete it.

1941
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:46,160
I'm going to delete this link. Right?

1942
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:46,880
It will look like this.

1943
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,320
Even though we created a task to test
that user story.

1944
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,040
Right.

1945
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,360
There is there will be nothing.

1946
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,080
There will be no relationship, nothing.

1947
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:57,280
So what happens is this.

1948
01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:01,440
Whenever you're trying to tell your team
that you're done testing, right,

1949
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,040
the betas or whatever,
when it's time to see, like

1950
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,720
maybe they found a bug in production
and they're going to ask you,

1951
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,800
Hey, Anna, did you test this right?

1952
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,840
And you going to say, Yeah, I tested this,
This is user story HMS Beloved for

1953
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,320
they're going to come
and open the ticket, right?

1954
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:19,200
They're going to come
open HMS B 11 four right.

1955
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:19,840
And they're going to see

1956
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,880
wait a minute, you said you tested this,
but there is no test case linked to this,

1957
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:25,560
right?

1958
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:28,080
There's no test case linked to this.

1959
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:31,840
When there's not a test case
linked to this, that's automatically

1960
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:35,160
going to give the impression
that you didn't test it correctly.

1961
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:36,840
Okay. Yes.

1962
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,920
There is no proof of being tested
that maybe you just said, yeah, whatever,

1963
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:43,360
and you just move the ticket and you said
it was done without really testing it.

1964
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,040
Right. It's going to give that assumption.

1965
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:49,080
It is part of documentation,
a very good thought.

1966
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,360
My yes, you're right.
Does that make sense to everyone?

1967
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,960
Okay. Does that make sense to everyone?

1968
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:55,520
Yeah.

1969
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:58,240
So we need to create that
relationship now.

1970
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:02,160
Do you guys
remember how I assign the sprint?

1971
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:05,400
You guys remember how
I assigned the sprint?

1972
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,880
Yeah. So because I assigned.

1973
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,840
That ticket, that task to the sprint,
look where it shows now.

1974
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,000
It shows in the sprint

1975
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,880
in the sprint board because I assigned it
to Sprint one, you guys remember.

1976
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,160
So now it's here.

1977
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:24,240
So here's another pointer.

1978
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:27,440
If you don't select a sprint,

1979
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:31,120
this ticket is going to go to the backlog.

1980
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,600
Okay,

1981
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,000
So a lot of you guys are going to say,
Hey, I don't see my ticket on the board.

1982
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:37,680
It's not there.

1983
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,400
I created it.

1984
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,560
Well, you probably didn't link it, right?

1985
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,560
You probably didn't
link it to the correct spread

1986
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:46,760
where you maybe didn't
link it to a sprint at all.

1987
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,840
Therefore, it's probably in the backlog.

1988
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:49,800
Right.

1989
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:55,040
Secondly, you know, you need to make sure
that to link that ticket.

1990
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:55,200
Right.

1991
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:59,400
So I'm going to open this ticket again,
HMS before 11 before it.

1992
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:03,760
So if you forget to add link
when you create it, that's okay.

1993
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,480
There's another way to do it.

1994
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,200
If I open the ticket
and I'll click on more

1995
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,240
when I click on more, see,
we have options.

1996
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,760
As you see, there's an option
that's called link.

1997
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:18,720
Okay, So I'm going to click on this, Okay?

1998
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:23,640
And I'm going to
and this already says this issue tests.

1999
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:29,440
No, this issue now is tested by
and we already created the ticket.

2000
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,000
Right?

2001
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:31,360
So what is the name of the task?

2002
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,080
HMS B11 five. Right.

2003
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,160
So what I'm going to do here
is i'm going to come here.

2004
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,760
I'm going to say h.r. Must be 11 five.

2005
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,800
It's already in there.

2006
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,480
Okay.

2007
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,880
It must be 11.

2008
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:48,040
This will be h.r. Mess

2009
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:52,200
h.r. Mess.

2010
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:53,200
Whoa.

2011
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,960
H or mass.

2012
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,440
B 11 five.

2013
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,240
Okay. They up.

2014
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:02,040
So now i am going to link it.

2015
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:02,960
Okay.

2016
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:05,880
And it's linked right here.

2017
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,200
Okay, cool.

2018
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:09,840
Does that make sense?

2019
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,880
Does that make sense to everyone?

2020
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,320
Right? So the wording change.

2021
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,920
Take a moment to read how the wording is.

2022
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:17,560
Right?

2023
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:21,360
You can do it right right off the bat
if you followed instructions.

2024
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,720
Right. But I also showed you
how to come back and link on it.

2025
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,120
You forgot to link it.

2026
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,640
Okay, so let's recap what we did.

2027
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,000
We created a task.

2028
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,920
Read what I did was I created
I opened a ticket, a ticket

2029
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,960
that went into, let's say, HMS B 11.

2030
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,640
Can I open this ticket in a new tab?

2031
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:39,880
And then I read the acceptance criteria.

2032
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:44,200
I'm going to go and manually do
the testing on my cell first go.

2033
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:48,760
Then I'm going to come to create
wait before clicking create.

2034
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:49,320
What do I

2035
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:53,960
before clicking, Create what I do.

2036
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,480
Copy.

2037
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,240
Copy What?

2038
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:58,800
Copy the title.

2039
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,080
So I'm going to copy this
and I'm going to come here and then

2040
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:09,400
I'm going to paste it.

2041
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,520
Okay? Yup. Exactly.

2042
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:14,040
So there's a Q8 hyphen, right?

2043
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,160
Name your name So there's a gaggle, right?

2044
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:22,320
And then what am I going to do?

2045
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:23,800
Assign it to myself.

2046
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,160
Okay, what else am I going to do?

2047
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,640
Link it, link to issue.

2048
01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:32,880
So I'm going to say, do I say tested by
is this a correct terminology?

2049
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:36,200
We're going to change the tests. Exactly.

2050
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,800
We're going to change it to tests.

2051
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:43,680
And then what do I enter here?

2052
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:44,480
What do I need to

2053
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,400
The ticket must be level one.

2054
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:51,600
Very good.

2055
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,480
Very, very good.

2056
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,160
No, not for one.

2057
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:56,320
Because this ticket right here is one.

2058
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,240
You guys see this HMS B 11 one.

2059
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:00,480
Exactly.

2060
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,200
So I'm going to look this up at this one.

2061
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,000
This one, HMS B 11 one.

2062
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:06,720
Right?

2063
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:07,840
There you go.

2064
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,280
So now I've established that relationship
with this task, Right.

2065
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:14,160
And this user story.

2066
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:16,440
So then the sprint what Sprint,

2067
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:21,960
am I going to select?

2068
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:25,520
Y why would you say to know
you're going to select HMS

2069
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,480
Sprint one, HMS B 11, Sprint one, right?

2070
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:32,040
Because we're going to work on two
disparate work on it right now.

2071
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:34,840
Now what happens
if I forget to like a sprint?

2072
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:36,080
What happens?

2073
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,520
Where will you find it

2074
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,160
if you forget to?

2075
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:46,040
Yes, it's going to be in the backlog
Very, very, very, very good.

2076
01:43:46,040 --> 01:43:47,880
Okay. Very, very good.

2077
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:49,760
And then once you do this, you're going
to. Great.

2078
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,080
Now, I forgot to say something.

2079
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:53,160
Well, actually didn't forget.

2080
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,320
This is going to be the last
ultimatum step.

2081
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,200
These are going to be
your cucumber scenarios or test cases.

2082
01:43:59,240 --> 01:43:59,800
Okay.

2083
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,760
So what you're going to do is you're going
to write your scenario here using given

2084
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:10,440
when that came, you're going to write
your test cases there.

2085
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:13,440
Yes, I saw Fairfax. You're like on Fireman

2086
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,560
on Fire.

2087
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,840
I show unbelievable.

2088
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,080
Unbelievable. Okay.

2089
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:23,720
So do you guys see that you're going
to write your cucumber scenarios here

2090
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:27,440
that's writing this here
bag of money, right.

2091
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,920
So does that make sense?

2092
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:33,360
Right.
You're going to write your test case here.

2093
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,640
Once it's done, guys, click create.

2094
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:41,520
When you guys created,
I will be able to see your test case.

2095
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,480
I'll be able
to give you a feedback on the goal.

2096
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:44,280
Okay,

2097
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:48,080
Ready, set, go, go, go, go.

2098
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,800
You guys know what to do? Let's go.

2099
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,080
You're going to test every single ticket.

2100
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,200
Okay, But actually, hold on. First of all.

2101
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:57,720
First of all,
everyone only work on h.r matters.

2102
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:01,920
Hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on, work on

2103
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:08,440
hms b 11 to okay, hms b 11 to go.

2104
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,480
This is a class activity.

2105
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:14,480
I wanted to work on HRA mass b11 to

2106
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:17,360
do not work on any other ticket
until I tell you to do so again.

2107
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:21,040
So because of that, I'm going to move
the tickets back here so you get confused.

2108
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,760
We're working on HMS level two.

2109
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,840
Okay, so go ahead, open that in a new tab.

2110
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:31,320
Create the task as we discussed
and go for it.

2111
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:33,960
Okay? And go for it.

2112
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:35,600
Let's go, guys.

2113
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:44,920
Let's go.

2114
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:56,320
Right.

2115
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:56,880
Okay.

2116
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:57,400
Let's see.

2117
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:00,280
Someone already created something, right?

2118
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:04,200
We have Aleksander created very one.

2119
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:05,920
He follows the naming conventions.

2120
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,600
Going to see what he did here.

2121
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:10,040
Okay.

2122
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:13,240
He didn't read the cucumber steps,
so he already didn't

2123
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:16,120
follow the instructions
to actually test the scenario.

2124
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:18,880
Okay,
so he didn't write the cucumber stuff.

2125
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,800
So this is already not good. And.

2126
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:23,720
But he did the linking.

2127
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,960
Very good.

2128
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,640
So that's well done.

2129
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,240
But you still need to test guys.

2130
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:30,320
You need to do the testing first, guys.

2131
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:33,960
You need to do the testing first
and then write your cucumber scenario.

2132
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:34,840
Okay.

2133
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,120
So write your scenario there.

2134
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,280
Let's see. Ellen.

2135
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:40,000
Ellen already did this.

2136
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Let's see what's Ellen doing now?

2137
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,320
Alan, you need to write the scenario.

2138
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:50,080
Like, you actually need to read the test
cases, guys, not just given when and then.

2139
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:52,880
So he linked it properly. Very good.

2140
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:55,560
Okay, write the scenario, guys.

2141
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:58,040
Write the cucumber scenario.

2142
01:46:58,040 --> 01:46:59,160
Marvin did it.

2143
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:01,120
I'm pretty sure the same thing, Right?

2144
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:02,880
Write the scenario.

2145
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,840
He linked it properly. Very good.

2146
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,520
Okay, but go and write the cucumbers
in here.

2147
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:12,360
Actually write the scenario
net affect quizzes.

2148
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,640
Ahmed.

2149
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:18,200
Okay, so he like to write, but you need to
go and write the cucumber scenario.

2150
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,440
Okay, All in. Time out.
Time out. Too much.

2151
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:21,240
I'm out to my everyone.

2152
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:24,400
Time up, time up,
someone hold on, hold on.

2153
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:29,400
So when they created ticket,
they made a mistake.

2154
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,320
Okay, hold on, guys. Time out.

2155
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,360
Stop creating tickets.

2156
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:35,640
They made a mistake.

2157
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:38,880
Marvin and Othman. A mistake.

2158
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:39,960
Okay.

2159
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,920
What mistake do you think that is?

2160
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:43,960
Just look at the screen.

2161
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,960
What mistake do you think they made here?

2162
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:48,200
I'm going to close this.

2163
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:48,760
Okay?

2164
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,000
It is not a task.

2165
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,680
They created a user story.

2166
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:54,800
They were not supposed
to create a user story.

2167
01:47:55,080 --> 01:47:58,280
So go back and change it to a test.

2168
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:59,880
Where is the cucumber scenario?

2169
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:03,400
You actually need to write it
yourself in the description area.

2170
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:09,000
Gerald Okay, so look,
if you open my ticket, for example, right,

2171
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,200
it was below, but you did the linking,

2172
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:17,640
but in the description here
you write your, you write your scenario

2173
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:21,600
given, you know, just fill in the blanks
and so forth.

2174
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,160
All right. Just go with it.

2175
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:23,400
Okay.

2176
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:28,240
But, but you need to actually write
real cucumber scenario.

2177
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:28,960
Okay.

2178
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,800
So first of all, you need to test it,
and I'm going to review your work.

2179
01:48:33,400 --> 01:48:33,680
Okay.

2180
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:35,000
So let's see

2181
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:38,880
Marvin,
go back there and change it to a task.

2182
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:39,680
Lots.

2183
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,080
Who's lost a lot?

2184
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:43,200
I didn't write the cucumber scenarios.

2185
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:45,240
They did the linking very well.

2186
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:50,120
Okay Lotto Who's letter?

2187
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:51,360
Whose letter

2188
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:55,440
who's not?

2189
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,600
Someone

2190
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:00,000
that you need to go
and write the cucumbers?

2191
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,840
No, but the linking was very good.

2192
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,120
Okay, You need to write the scenario.
Okay.

2193
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,720
We have

2194
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:08,880
I can see that Alan Right. So

2195
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,880
admin user log in.

2196
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:13,320
Zima.

2197
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:16,000
So Zima didn't
follow the naming convention.

2198
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,040
What is she forgetting here?
Look at the screen.

2199
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:21,840
What is she can what is
what is she forgetting here

2200
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:26,520
in the naming convention?

2201
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:27,840
The hyphen. Exactly.

2202
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,760
After logging right there.

2203
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:30,120
Very good.

2204
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:31,560
So please pick that amazing.

2205
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,720
Emma, you also didn't write the cucumbers.

2206
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:36,160
You just wrote the keywords.

2207
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,640
You need to write the actual test case,
guys.

2208
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:41,520
You need to write the actual test case.

2209
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:42,360
Lewis.

2210
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:44,640
Lewis,
You need to write the actual test case.

2211
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:45,600
The linking was good.

2212
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,720
So in the description
you need to write the actual test case.

2213
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,600
Okay, Jimmy, same thing with you.

2214
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:52,320
You did the linking.

2215
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:56,400
You need to write the actual test case for
the you like write the actual test case.

2216
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:59,280
Okay, let's see. So Jimmy is there.

2217
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:01,120
So guys,
a lot of you guys are creating this

2218
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:04,640
for writing the test
because you need to write the test cases.

2219
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:06,680
Arwa, you did the same mistake.

2220
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:09,240
Go change it to a task instead of a story.

2221
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:12,960
Okay.

2222
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,720
Someone created it without name,
so I can't even say anything about that.

2223
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:18,960
Emily Asia and

2224
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,320
Malaysia in the in the lead
you in Malaysia

2225
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,240
and Malaysia did the linking.

2226
01:50:24,240 --> 01:50:27,520
Well, she did a very good job as a task
but she didn't write

2227
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,720
the cucumber scenario.

2228
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:31,600
She needs to write the cucumber scenario.

2229
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:33,640
She's only writing working keywords.

2230
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:36,400
You need to
you need to write the cucumber scenario.

2231
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,600
Okay. Dominic,

2232
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,360
Dominic, Dominic.

2233
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:46,480
One thing you didn't do, Dominic,
which is a big red flag, you didn't link

2234
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:49,800
your take your task to the user story,
okay?

2235
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:52,520
You need to link
the tasks to the user story.

2236
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:54,320
Yeah.

2237
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,120
Yes, it is a task. It's not.

2238
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,600
I use the story as a test. Okay.

2239
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:02,760
And you also need to write your cucumbers
now as guys come out.

2240
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,960
Come on, please come up.

2241
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:06,200
Hold on, guys. Come on, guys.

2242
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:10,080
You guys
actually have to write the cucumbers?

2243
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,920
No, not just given
when they write the test case

2244
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:16,920
for that user story, go write it.

2245
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:20,320
Okay, So, Ekaterina, same thing.

2246
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:23,160
You it. Well then everything. Well,

2247
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:25,640
you linked it, but you need

2248
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:29,240
to write the cucumber scenario.

2249
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,680
Ahmad Shah.

2250
01:51:31,680 --> 01:51:32,800
Ahmad Shah.

2251
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:36,080
Michelle
Sorry if I didn't say write the delinking.

2252
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,680
Well, you get everything back,
but you didn't write cucumber scenario,

2253
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,840
now did you write the cucumber scenario?

2254
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,920
Did you write the cucumber scenario?

2255
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:47,760
The use read the Q was given one that

2256
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:48,960
you need to write.

2257
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:51,120
The cucumber scenario came

2258
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:56,320
Lenny didn't follow the instructions
on the naming convention.

2259
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,400
So and she also needs the changes
to the tasso.

2260
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:01,240
Lenny, please fix that.

2261
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:03,640
Nikolai
You also didn't follow instructions.

2262
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:09,480
You selected a story instead of a task,

2263
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:13,160
but you wrote the scenario
and I applaud you for that.

2264
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,560
Very, very good.

2265
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,640
So, Nikolai, please go back and change the
user story to a task.

2266
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:18,000
Okay.

2267
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:19,640
Good job.

2268
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:20,640
Nikolai

2269
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:25,840
Sorbonne.

2270
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,120
Sorbonne.

2271
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,320
Once a month.

2272
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,720
So, what are you there? Are you in class?

2273
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:33,640
So, what are you in class?

2274
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:36,040
The Sorbonne here is.

2275
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:40,320
So why are you there?

2276
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,360
So month

2277
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:44,080
to month you're writing a scenario

2278
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:47,920
for a Netflix test case.

2279
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,560
The acceptance criteria
for this is for syntax.

2280
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,120
h.R. Ms..

2281
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,880
You actually need to write
the real scenario

2282
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,280
to test that user story.

2283
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:01,040
Okay, so change it.

2284
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:02,400
Right.

2285
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:05,040
Fatma, are you there?

2286
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,080
Instructor

2287
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,920
Guys, look at this. Look at this test.

2288
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:09,800
Look at look at this.

2289
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:10,440
Look at this in there.

2290
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:12,120
Read the scenarios, read this.

2291
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:13,320
NARRATOR

2292
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:16,400
Look at this.

2293
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:25,080
You can see this is.

2294
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:26,800
I already showed the linking.

2295
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,640
I already showed the linking.
You see the follow through, right?

2296
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:30,840
I told you I should have.

2297
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:33,760
I'll show you right
now. Right, I'll show you. But you got to.

2298
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:34,920
You got to stay on your toes.

2299
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:36,120
This is going to keep you on your toes.

2300
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:38,240
Okay, So here's the thing.

2301
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:41,040
Look, Fatma, this is good.

2302
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:41,960
The linking is good.

2303
01:53:41,960 --> 01:53:46,320
But please write your cucumber scenario
to reflect the acceptance criteria

2304
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:46,920
that you're testing.

2305
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:49,960
Okay? Okay. Don't worry.

2306
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:51,400
I sure will help you.

2307
01:53:51,400 --> 01:53:53,240
I'll help you out. Okay.

2308
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:55,440
I'm just going in order here,
so I'll get to your show.

2309
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:56,280
Alexei,

2310
01:53:57,720 --> 01:53:59,960
you didn't
write the cucumber scenario, Alexei.

2311
01:54:00,640 --> 01:54:02,640
You didn't even do the linking.

2312
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:03,080
Right?

2313
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:06,320
So your test case is like
you have no relationship

2314
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,320
between this task and and that.

2315
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,320
So, Alexei, please fix that.

2316
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,640
Has seen

2317
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:16,360
you didn't write a proper.

2318
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:18,280
Okay, now it's timer time.

2319
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:19,560
Our real quick time.

2320
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:23,160
A timeout timeout timeout timeouts
tenant timer come out.

2321
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,560
Okay turn up okay

2322
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:26,960
Right.

2323
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,640
So look at the screen

2324
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:32,920
I seem is breaking some very important
rules with this cucumber scenario.

2325
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:35,400
What is the number one
rule that we see here?

2326
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:41,800
What is the number one thing?

2327
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:46,480
The first letter of each
key word has to be capitalized.

2328
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,280
Right?

2329
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,560
So he needs to change the lowercase
G to uppercase G.

2330
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:54,800
Same thing with W and A and and these.

2331
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:58,800
Secondly, there is no linking.

2332
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,480
So look, I'm a
keep it 100 with you guys, Right.

2333
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,640
I will keep on I'll keep it 100 with you

2334
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:06,880
if you're not leaking

2335
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,320
that's just show me that you didn't
attention to it and follow through.

2336
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,200
Now some of you guys may be having issues.

2337
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,160
That's fine. I will help you.

2338
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:18,160
But a lot of you guys, I keep saying
the same thing over and over again.

2339
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:22,560
I keep saying write the cucumber scenario
to reflect the acceptance

2340
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:26,640
criteria that you had to test, but
you guys aren't doing that only somewhat.

2341
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:30,280
The only person that paid attention
was Nikolai, Right.

2342
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:32,600
And he's he's following through.

2343
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:35,200
So please, please fix that. Okay, Fix it.

2344
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:36,600
Fix it, Fix it.

2345
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:38,160
All right, let's see.

2346
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:41,600
Lewis.

2347
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:43,520
Lewis linked it

2348
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:45,840
to Yes, Lewis.

2349
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,120
That's right, Lewis.

2350
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:48,200
Right on, man.

2351
01:55:48,200 --> 01:55:50,280
Very good job, Lewis.

2352
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:51,000
Amazing.

2353
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,680
You know, we call people like you, Lewis

2354
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:57,600
Where we call people like Lewis

2355
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,320
Bag of money.

2356
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:01,320
That's right.

2357
01:56:01,400 --> 01:56:07,680
Got a bag of money is right.

2358
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:09,680
Okay, let's see.

2359
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:13,560
So I'm going to go down the list again
to review anyone who's working on that.

2360
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:16,960
Okay, Hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold The hold on, guys.

2361
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,720
Hold on.

2362
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:23,120
Okay, You guys are all you guys are
breaking the rules big time here, right?

2363
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:25,760
You guys are doing things
that you guys weren't to do.

2364
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:28,440
Why are you guys moving the tickets
to the column

2365
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,160
that anyone say, Move the tickets.

2366
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,200
Don't call them Merriam.

2367
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:38,880
Anyone told you to move into the done
column?

2368
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:42,000
Whoever
this is, admin user log in must be 18.

2369
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:42,320
I can.

2370
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:46,200
I know who did this, but
you obviously didn't follow directions.

2371
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,240
Hanukkah, Hanukkah is not you.

2372
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:50,280
You didn't follow instructions, right?

2373
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:53,720
So how to go back and write cucumbers
notes?

2374
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,000
Open the ticket.

2375
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:55,920
Open the ticket.

2376
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:56,680
Your task.

2377
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:59,040
And in the description box right in there.

2378
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:02,000
I'll show you. Okay, look, everyone pass.

2379
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,600
Everyone passed. Pass, pass by surprise.

2380
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:05,640
Plus, as possible.

2381
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:08,000
Look at my screen, please.
Look at my screen.

2382
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,200
Look at my screen.

2383
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:11,240
Okay, Licorice screen.

2384
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:13,320
Okay. First of all, hold on.

2385
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:15,600
Cool.

2386
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:17,760
Move the ticket back to the in progress.

2387
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:21,960
You see, now we have a task
CC moved into in progress.

2388
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:24,320
No one told you to move the ticket
to in progress.

2389
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:24,920
Right.

2390
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:26,880
And where's the user story
that we're working on?

2391
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,120
You see what happens
when you guys start moving stuff.

2392
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:31,920
So now I have to go back and look for it.

2393
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:37,440
Which one was was it user admin login.

2394
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:39,440
This one to log.

2395
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:41,280
Which one was it

2396
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,080
1 to 2.

2397
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:50,240
We for.

2398
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:50,720
Okay.

2399
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,800
Abdul

2400
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:58,640
guys, what happened to our ticket?

2401
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:01,680
Someone messed around, didn't
follow instructions and that's that's

2402
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:02,200
what happened right.

2403
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:05,720
You get lost.

2404
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:07,400
A lot of you guys
aren't following instructions,

2405
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,840
which is why everything's been started.
A backlog.

2406
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,120
Shareef is one of those students, Right.

2407
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:14,840
So what happened to all that?

2408
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:17,440
No one, no one touch anything anymore.

2409
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:20,840
Because some of you guys
obviously messed all of this up.

2410
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,040
All right.

2411
01:58:22,040 --> 01:58:25,040
And in your workplace,
are you going to mess up

2412
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:29,400
like this?

2413
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:32,120
Are you
are you going to mess up like this?

2414
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:34,600
Right. Are you going to. No, you're not.

2415
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:37,640
You guys are moving tickets
when you guys weren't told to do

2416
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:39,360
so, you guys are changing

2417
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,760
the name of the tickets
when you guys weren't told to do so.

2418
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,200
And now it's all a big mess, right?

2419
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:48,280
So like, you know, follow instructions.

2420
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:52,320
No, I can't find that ticket.

2421
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,440
Someone changed the status of it.

2422
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:56,040
And guys, stop creating tickets.

2423
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:58,080
Let me figure this out.

2424
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:00,320
Let me figure this out.

2425
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:02,760
What cause can you log into JIRA board?

2426
01:59:02,840 --> 01:59:08,840
Now we look for this ticket
because I can't find it.

2427
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:09,720
I can't.

2428
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:18,200
I can't find it.

2429
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:19,160
Can't find it.

2430
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:23,320
Policy.

2431
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:26,200
Okay, hold on. No one do anything.

2432
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,840
Please don't stop, stop,
Stop doing what you're doing.

2433
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:30,760
I need to fix this.

2434
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:35,520
I to fix this.

2435
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,720
Oh, I think it was one

2436
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:42,280
shoe.

2437
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:48,080
Was it to hold on?

2438
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:51,520
Was it to see?

2439
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:56,160
Well, on.

2440
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:57,120
Oh, Oh.

02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:11,080
Yes. Who is this?

2447
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,720
We need to find out who this is.

2448
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:19,720
Okay I need to find out who who it is.

Thanks to the history that I can see.

02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:10,560
Someone obviously named CC,

2466
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:11,680
Right.

02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:14,600
And guys, please ask questions

2468
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:17,680

2469
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:19,200
messing things up. Right.

2470
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:21,320
So assign this back.

02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:22,240
Let me see. Hold on, guys.

2472
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:24,480

02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:25,960
Well done.

2474
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,200

02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,720
Hey, get one of those.

2478
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:33,600
Please don't do anything.

2479
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,560
Want to

2480
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,400
hold on?

2481
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:44,800
Look at this.

2482
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,840
Hold on.

2483
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:51,080
Okay, so we have to have one to

2484
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:53,200
talk.

2485
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:56,160
We as

2486
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,880
someone moved it to Sprint two
for some reason.

2487
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:05,040
I don't know what you

2488
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:08,880
made.

2489
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:09,320
Okay.

2490
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:13,720
And we'll just back.

2491
02:02:13,720 --> 02:02:17,680
Go back to that two sprints
bitch on this one.

2492
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,320
All right, guys, can
everyone can everyone just.

2493
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,360
Just stop what you're doing, please?

2494
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:26,120
Which is not what you're doing.

2495
02:02:26,120 --> 02:02:29,760
It is very clear that some of you guys
don't know how to follow instructions.

2496
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:30,080
Right.

2497
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:32,760
And some of you guys like, just like,
You know what I mean?

2498
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:36,320
Like, if you're going to do this at work,
you're going to get fired.

2499
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:37,160
Probably, right?

2500
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:39,840
You should not do this, especially
with the project management tool.

2501
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:42,240
I already told you from beginning, right?

2502
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:44,720
I said, Everything you're doing,
JIRA is recorded.

2503
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,640
I tell you guys what to do
and not to do something.

2504
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:50,960
And so where you guys still went in there
and started moving tickets around.

2505
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:53,280
So What, you guys move things to another
sprint, right?

2506
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:57,360
So like,
I mean, that's how you are that that's a

2507
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:59,480
you are right but don't you know

2508
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:03,360
don't don't ruin the rest of of the course

2509
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:06,080
you know do this for your classmates
who are paying attention to everything.

2510
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:10,560
All right so HMS B 11 two, we found it.

2511
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:11,080
We're good.

2512
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:13,360
We're back on we're back on track.

2513
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:15,840
Okay. So continue what you're doing.

2514
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:18,720
Please do not change any of the user
stories.

2515
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:21,480
Okay? I'm pleased on issue.

2516
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:23,400
I don't see HMS before.

2517
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:27,080
Why do you need to see HMS before HMS
B 11 before?

2518
02:03:27,080 --> 02:03:27,640
It's right here.

2519
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:30,480
But we're not working on that.

2520
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:33,360
We're only working on HMS B11 two.

2521
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:37,120
Right, guys, we are only working on h.r.

2522
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:40,360
Mass. B 11 two and nothing else. Right?

2523
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:45,120
So you shouldn't
even be worried about hms B 11 for that.

2524
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:49,880
We're only working about HMS B 11
two and I need to see

2525
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:52,480
if you guys how to remove move a ticket
from the backlog.

2526
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:54,360
You go to the backlog. Right?

2527
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:59,240
And if you see the ticket here, you have
to click hold and drag it like this.

2528
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:01,240
You will click, hold
and drag it to Sprint one.

2529
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:06,600
Okay, cool.

2530
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:09,240
I hope you found that right.

2531
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:10,920
So let me see.

2532
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:20,480
So HMS B11 two,
that's what we're working on.

2533
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:22,960
My read your comment, Momma,
how's your kid doing?

2534
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:24,320
How's your brother's

2535
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,320
son's name?

2536
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:32,720
Who How is

2537
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:35,880
this done?

2538
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:40,920
Doing good.

2539
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:46,680
Let's see.

2540
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:47,920
That's good. That's good.

2541
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:50,320
That's good. That's a really good.
That's a really nice name.

2542
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:54,720
So. All right,

2543
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:56,800
Thank goodness somebody took a screenshot.

2544
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,520
Thanks. Armored carrier one.

2545
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,800
Just actually pay attention.

2546
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:06,680
I can,
but I don't know about the rest, so.

2547
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:09,240
All right. So

2548
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:15,560
the signee is is

2549
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:17,720
you assign it to yourself, right, Dennis?

2550
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:19,120
You assign it to yourself.

2551
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:22,360
Yes. Okay.

2552
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:25,680
So I'm going to go down and let me look
let me credit.

2553
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:27,000
So first of all, Shareef didn't

2554
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,040
follow the instructions at all,
so I'm going to skip it.

2555
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:30,600
I'm going to go to the next one.

2556
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:33,480
Alexander So let's see what Alexander did.

2557
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:35,200
He linked it.

2558
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,920
Well done.

2559
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:41,680
When the admin attempts
to log in with proper credentials

2560
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:45,640
are Alexander, delete the word attempts.

2561
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:49,080
You'll see when the admin
in with valid credentials.

2562
02:05:49,160 --> 02:05:51,520
Yeah, but everything else is good.

2563
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:51,960
This is good.

2564
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:55,400
This is good. Alexander.

2565
02:05:55,520 --> 02:05:57,400
What you can do is you can help me

2566
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,880
help your classmates.

2567
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,760
Come.

2568
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:06,120
So, Allan, let's see. Allan.

2569
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:06,800
Allan links it.

2570
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:11,400
Well, he runs the cucumber scenarios.

2571
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:13,800
There's inconsistency in your scenario,
Allan.

2572
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:16,360
You have a period in the last statement,

2573
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:18,440
but you don't have a period
in the other ones.

2574
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:21,920
So you decide what this I would do
when the admin

2575
02:06:21,920 --> 02:06:23,760
to log in with proper credentials.

2576
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:25,120
So I'll work on that.

2577
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:28,680
Allan Okay, I'll fix it, fix executive,
fix it, fix it.

2578
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:29,560
It's good.

2579
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:36,880
Marvin.

2580
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:40,360
Marvin So Marvin either is Marvin here?

2581
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:41,320
Marvin

2582
02:06:42,720 --> 02:06:43,320
Marvin there.

2583
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:45,360
Marvin changed the like.

2584
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:48,960
You got to change the key words when
and then it's given one then.

2585
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:51,840
Okay, make it make sense.

2586
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:54,120
Far as that everything was was good. So.

2587
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:55,320
So work on it.

2588
02:06:55,320 --> 02:07:03,560
That's good.

2589
02:07:03,560 --> 02:07:04,680
Okay.

2590
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:05,760
Ahmet, are you there?

2591
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,360
Is Ahmed there?

2592
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:10,520
Okay, hold on.

2593
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:11,160
I might try.

2594
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:13,320
Some of you guys ask Alexa. You mean

2595
02:07:16,040 --> 02:07:18,600
how to fix what exactly?

2596
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:18,960
Alexa?

2597
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:26,800
What do you mean, how to fix what? No,

2598
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:29,880
but I think Alexa ask.

2599
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:40,040
Alexa, what do you make Change it?

2600
02:07:40,040 --> 02:07:46,800
Like, What do you mean, make changes?

2601
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:49,120
Alexa, can you tell me the your ticket ID?

2602
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:53,640
Can you tell me your ticket
ID so I can look it up?

2603
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:57,200
No way I can help you.

2604
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:58,560
Oh, it's right here. Right.

2605
02:07:58,560 --> 02:07:59,600
Okay. There you go. Alexa.

2606
02:07:59,600 --> 02:08:01,280
I found it right here.

2607
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,720
Okay, everyone, pay attention.

2608
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:04,440
I'm going to work on Alexa's ticket.

2609
02:08:04,440 --> 02:08:06,880
And a lot of you guys
are having this issue, so pay attention.

2610
02:08:07,160 --> 02:08:10,000
So, HMS B 1128, I'm going to open it.

2611
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:11,640
This is his ticket.

2612
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:12,880
He followed instructions.

2613
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:15,960
The name is good and he didn't link it.

2614
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:17,600
Right. And I think that's
what you're asking, Right.

2615
02:08:17,600 --> 02:08:20,160
How do you link it again, Alexa? Right.

2616
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:23,920
Is that your question?

2617
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:27,600
Okay, so you need to read the cucumber
scenario, by the way.

2618
02:08:27,600 --> 02:08:30,240
But here's how we link it, Right, guys?
Everyone pay attention.

2619
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:35,760
If you forgot to link it the first time,
if you forgot to link it the first time,

2620
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:39,280
what you do is you open your ticket,
which I did on one Alexei's ticket.

2621
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:40,400
Okay?

2622
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:43,920
And the next thing you're going to do
is you're going to click on more.

2623
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:45,000
Okay, what do you think?

2624
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:50,920
I'm going to click here, Link.

2625
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:53,160
Right. I'm going to go to Link
right there.

2626
02:08:53,160 --> 02:08:54,120
Very good.

2627
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:57,320
And then is this tickets tested by
or does this test

2628
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:00,880
test another ticket?

2629
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:01,600
It tests?

2630
02:09:01,600 --> 02:09:04,440
No, it's not tested by it
tests another ticket.

2631
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:06,600
Right.
So I'm going to change this to tests.

2632
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:10,560
And what is the ticket number
that he's going to test here?

2633
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:13,280
He needs a ticket number. I don't have it.
What is it, guys? Do you guys now

2634
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:16,040
for this one, add me use long.

2635
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:18,480
It must be two. Right?

2636
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:21,360
So age are a must be two right there

2637
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:24,360
and you click on it.

2638
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:27,520
For some reason I have to type it in
and then I have to press enter

2639
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:28,880
and then it works.

2640
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:31,440
Okay, so I must be 11 two.

2641
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,880
Right? And Alexei, did you see that?

2642
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:36,240
That's all you have to do.
I'm not going to do it for you.

2643
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:37,840
I want you to do it. Did you.

2644
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,360
Did you hear that, Alexei?

2645
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:40,160
I want you to do it.

2646
02:09:40,160 --> 02:09:40,440
Okay?

2647
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:43,520
It's very simple,
but I'm going to cancel it.

2648
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:44,480
I'm going to go back.

2649
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:48,920
All right, let's see.

2650
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:52,760
Sharif still hasn't fixed his ticket.

2651
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:56,800
Sharif.

2652
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,200
Sharif, is this your ticket?

2653
02:09:58,200 --> 02:10:02,040
Show it right here.

2654
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:03,160
What do you think the problem is

2655
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:09,720
with The problem is Sharif

2656
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:17,320
right?

2657
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:18,520
The naming convention?

2658
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:22,880
At the same time, you also didn't link
the user story that you had

2659
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:26,160
the test you didn't link and you didn't
establish that relationship.

2660
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:26,760
Right.

2661
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:31,040
We we talked about that.

2662
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:34,080
Okay, guys, hold on.

2663
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:36,040
I need to say something to someone right
now, okay?

2664
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:38,040
I need to make an announcement
to the class.

2665
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:40,000
Can everyone stop? What You're doing.

2666
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,360
Can everyone just stop what you're doing?

2667
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:43,280
We're going to go back to this,
like, in 2 minutes.

2668
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:43,760
Okay?

2669
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:46,560
We're going to go back to this,
like, in 2 minutes.

2670
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:47,920
Okay.

2671
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:48,720
All right.

2672
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:51,000
Just just listen to what I have to say.

2673
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,240
I get it.

2674
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:55,600
So a lot of this
material is new to you, okay?

2675
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:58,320
A lot of this material is new to you.
That's fine.

2676
02:10:58,320 --> 02:11:00,600
I get it. It's
the first time you're doing this.

2677
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:05,000
You may need instructions
to, you know, to be repeated again.

2678
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:05,680
That's fine.

2679
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:07,040
I'm here to help.

2680
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,480
Right.

2681
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:12,560
For those of you that can do this, right,

2682
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:18,320
this is probably 65 to 70%.

2683
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:23,040
The job showing your progress,
knowing how to work with JIRA,

2684
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:26,440
knowing how to how to show your progress,

2685
02:11:26,520 --> 02:11:29,560
how to you know, what ticket to touch,
what take is not to touch.

2686
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:31,440
You know,

2687
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:34,680
if you're able to do this one,
you followed

2688
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:38,040
instructions, you were able to learn it
and now you're able to use it.

2689
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:41,560
And this is a very, very, very big thing

2690
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:44,520
that you guys will use in your projects.

2691
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:45,840
Okay.

2692
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:48,120
Does that make sense to everyone?

2693
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:49,800
Does that make sense?

2694
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:50,400
Yeah.

2695
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:52,640
And at the same time, right.

2696
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:55,680
For those of you look

2697
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:58,440
for those of you,
if we're everyone in this class

2698
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:03,480
and I see this all the time, right,
for everyone in this class,

2699
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:08,720
if you are falling behind
or if you have questions on something,

2700
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:12,480
then you have to ask the questions.

2701
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:15,840
Don't be shy,

2702
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:17,600
okay?

2703
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:19,920
Don't be shy to ask questions.

2704
02:12:19,920 --> 02:12:22,840
You are the ones that are paying
for the class, right?

2705
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:25,200
So get your money's worth, right?

2706
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,760
Ask the questions right.

2707
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:30,240
Put the work in and ask the questions.

2708
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:30,800
Right.

2709
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:34,720
We're not here to deny
someone and like ignore some one or not.

2710
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:37,720
I'm trying my best to address
everyone's questions is just I see this

2711
02:12:37,720 --> 02:12:40,680
like channel
just move up and everything like that.

2712
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:43,240
Okay. Does that make sense? Everyone?

2713
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:46,840
So ask questions because if you don't
get out of this comfort zone

2714
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:49,360
that you're in right now,
if you don't stop to ask questions

2715
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:53,000
and no question is stupid, there's
no such thing as a stupid question.

2716
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:53,840
Okay?

2717
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:56,040
And the thing is that
if you have a question,

2718
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:59,560
there's a very high chance that a lot of
your classmates have the same questions.

2719
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:04,160
Okay, So get out of that comfort zone,

2720
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:09,240
because for the rest of the class
guys, it's going to get very intense.

2721
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:11,680
Okay? It's going to be while.

2722
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:11,880
Right.

2723
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:14,920
It's going to be, you know, in this,
you know, what happens

2724
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:18,040
is in syntax, students, look, I'm lucky
that I'm give it a hundred with you.

2725
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:20,520
A few things happens.

2726
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:25,880
Either students gain a lot of weight gain
or they lose a lot of weight, okay?

2727
02:13:26,280 --> 02:13:28,320
Or they start to smoke cigarets or

2728
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:31,640
something like that,
because that's how intense it gets, right?

2729
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:34,840
So make it easy on yourself.

2730
02:13:34,840 --> 02:13:37,440
Ask the questions, reach out to support.

2731
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:39,280
We're here for that. Right?

2732
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:41,040
But there's a difference.

2733
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:44,840
There's a difference
when you don't ask the questions,

2734
02:13:45,200 --> 02:13:49,600
when you don't ask for clarification,
when you don't stop and say,

2735
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:53,360
Hey, I don't understand this.

2736
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:54,360
Can you please help me?

2737
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:57,720
Guys,
you are responsible for your own progress

2738
02:13:57,720 --> 02:13:59,640
and for falling behind and stuff
like that.

2739
02:13:59,640 --> 02:14:01,680
Does that make sense or one
is that clear to everyone?

2740
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:04,400
Right. This class is going to get hard.

2741
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:05,680
It's going to get complicated.

2742
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:08,720
It's going to get complicated.

2743
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:12,200
But everyone who does, who puts the work
in, who puts the time and effort

2744
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:14,120
in, ends up being successful.

2745
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:17,760
This isn't a get rich quick scheme, guys.

2746
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:19,520
That's what everyone thinks.

2747
02:14:19,520 --> 02:14:21,680
And The beginning of the class, right?

2748
02:14:21,680 --> 02:14:22,320
Like what?

2749
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:22,800
How is that?

2750
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:26,880
You go somewhere for six months and you
come out making this much money, you know?

2751
02:14:26,920 --> 02:14:27,240
Right.

2752
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:28,920
You got to work for it, right?

2753
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:31,320
And this is exactly what we have to do.

2754
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:31,680
Okay.

2755
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:33,640
But it all starts from here.

2756
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:35,160
From the it all starts from here.

2757
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,760
Are you able to follow instructions?

2758
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:38,600
Are you able to pay attention?

2759
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:39,720
Are you able to listen?

2760
02:14:39,720 --> 02:14:40,840
You able to ask for help?

2761
02:14:40,840 --> 02:14:43,680
Are you able to help others? Okay.

2762
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:46,040
These are things that you have to kind of
think to yourself

2763
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:48,920
as you move on in the course.

2764
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:50,520
Does that make okay?

2765
02:14:50,520 --> 02:14:55,560
And all of you guys, I applaud
everyone here for being here and changing

2766
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:56,680
your life.

2767
02:14:56,760 --> 02:15:00,160
A lot of you guys are here
making a big difference in your life.

2768
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:04,920
Some of you may never had a job
that pays the patient this much.

2769
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:07,160
Some of us
are just looking to change fields.

2770
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:11,000
So whatever the case may be, right,
some of you guys are in here

2771
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:15,720
to to, to to better, better your families.

2772
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:18,480
We have students like Eric
who is not listening to what I'm saying.

2773
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:20,080
I was sharing a screenshot right.

2774
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:24,800
So we're here to either for our families,
for ourselves,

2775
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:28,080
to to make our families proud,
to make our name for ourselves.

2776
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:30,200
Something like that. Right Right.

2777
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:32,600
So does that is that clear to everyone?

2778
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:34,120
It all starts from you.

2779
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:36,200
You have to ask questions.

2780
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:39,120
You cannot leave a class saying,
I didn't understand.

2781
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:41,520
This instructor, he's
not good at teaching, right?

2782
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:43,320
If I recall really?

2783
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:47,000
Well, every single instructor here at
Syntax is really good at what they teach.

2784
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,960
Every single one of them.

2785
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:52,200
Okay, If it wasn't it, I promise
you, Samir would not let them teach.

2786
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:54,720
I promise you that. 100% guaranteed. Okay.

2787
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:59,680
And I'm being very, very honest
and same thing like, you know what I mean?

2788
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:01,360
So you need to ask the questions.

2789
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:03,600
You are responsible for your own progress.

2790
02:16:03,600 --> 02:16:05,560
You have to ask the questions. Guys,
we are here.

2791
02:16:05,560 --> 02:16:09,320
And I repeat that
you kind of have to do this for yourself.

2792
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:10,920
Okay. Does that make sense to everyone?

2793
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:13,440
It's kind of like that phrase, right?
Do you want to be happy?

2794
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:16,560
Everyone's responsible for their own
happiness up to a certain extent, right?

2795
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:20,280
The rest is up to God itself, Right?

2796
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:23,640
So are we good with that?

2797
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:25,600
Does everyone understand that? Right?

2798
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:28,240
Does everyone understand

2799
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:30,360
that?

2800
02:16:30,360 --> 02:16:34,760
I'm just because, you know,
I mean, like, you guys can do it.

2801
02:16:35,600 --> 02:16:40,680
We have had Uber drivers,
but I've never opened the laptop before

2802
02:16:40,680 --> 02:16:43,800
and they're like out there successful,
you know, killing it and stuff.

2803
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:44,640
You know what I mean?

2804
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:47,840
We have you know,
we do, you know, Home Alone

2805
02:16:47,840 --> 02:16:51,120
or home moms that do this
and they become successful.

2806
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:53,160
They become the backbones
of their families.

2807
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:55,760
They have
we have different success stories.

2808
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:58,320
We have people
who don't really need a income.

2809
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:00,840
They just want to switch careers
and they still do it.

2810
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:02,520
And that's fine.

2811
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:03,480
I'm all for kids. There you go.

2812
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:05,800
So there's going to be,
you know, a bag of money soon.

2813
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:08,880
And then her kids
are going to be bags of money, right? So.

2814
02:17:08,880 --> 02:17:13,240
Well, because maybe at some point
they'll see how nice it is and so forth.

2815
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:13,760
Right.

2816
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:16,720
And this goes to everyone out there
and everyone who has kids

2817
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:19,120
and families married or whatever
your case may be.

2818
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:25,080
You guys need to, you know, There you go.

2819
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:25,400
All right.

2820
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:27,680
I okay.

2821
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:31,400
I hope that's not you know,
I don't want to smoke cigarets and stuff.

2822
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:34,640
Okay, cool.

2823
02:17:34,640 --> 02:17:35,320
All right.

2824
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:36,040
Are we clear?

2825
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:37,040
Can we move on?

2826
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,800
And again, to those of
you asked the questions.

2827
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:43,160
Okay, ask the questions. Go.

2828
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:45,560
All right, let's move
on. Let's proceed. Right.

2829
02:17:45,680 --> 02:17:49,520
So Lisa says, Can you help me?

2830
02:17:49,520 --> 02:18:11,000
What's wrong?

2831
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,440
All right, so to address a leaflet.

2832
02:18:13,440 --> 02:18:16,080
A leaflet, what do you
I think are trying to link?

2833
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:20,840

02:18:26,400 --> 02:18:29,160
where's your your your ticket?

2836
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,480
What's your ticket number.

2837
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:33,280
Let's a lease.

2838
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:38,400
A lease on the lease the lease.

2839
02:18:38,400 --> 02:18:40,080
The lease.

2840
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:44,600
I don't see your number here

2841
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:49,760
but I don't,

2842
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:54,520
I don't understand
what would your what quit.

2843
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:57,360
Okay. First I try to link OMG

2844
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:03,280
okay.

2845
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:06,240
If are you okay if I move on
to the next question because I find

2846
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:15,040
okay so.

2847
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:16,320
Oh it's probably already linked, right?

2848
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:17,960
It's not what you're saying.

2849
02:19:18,720 --> 02:19:21,200
It it's probably really linked.

2850
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:26,000
Is that what you're trying to say?

2851
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,240
Okay. There you go. Yeah, that happens.

2852
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:29,400
If you already linked it,
you won't be able to really get.

2853
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:30,160
Okay.

2854
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:32,680
Farhad says that was in the question

2855
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:37,920
now says and how and how what I don't know

2856
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:41,240
with notes that I'm going in order.

2857
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:44,480
You guys just bear with me. You

2858
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:48,120
all right?

2859
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:48,600
Okay.

2860
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:50,600
For those of you that have said good job,

2861
02:19:51,360 --> 02:19:54,240
look into the other tickets
and help me help your classmates.

2862
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:56,520
Alright? We're all the team here at See?

2863
02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:00,680
Okay.

2864
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:04,400
Objective now is going to help
is going to be some kind of question. No.

2865
02:20:04,440 --> 02:20:08,520
If you're not typing anything
and I on to the next question.

2866
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:09,040
Okay.

2867
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:13,240
Mom of three of you there's no question.

2868
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:15,560
How do we see the issue of management?
What do you mean?

2869
02:20:15,560 --> 02:20:18,040
How do you see the issue? Like me?

2870
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:24,880
Are you there?

2871
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:25,680
Like what?

2872
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:26,280
What do you mean?

2873
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:30,360
Like, what's the question?

2874
02:20:30,360 --> 02:20:31,320
How do you see it?

2875
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:32,720
Well, it's right here. Right?

2876
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:34,800
So what is the ticket?

2877
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:35,520
What is what?

2878
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:37,120
Where is your ticket? You.

2879
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:48,000
Do you know it or no?

2880
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:48,840
Yeah, that's fine.

2881
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:51,000
But you can do whatever you want.

2882
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:53,040
So let me ask.

2883
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:54,640
It is did you create it or.

2884
02:20:54,640 --> 02:21:01,400
No, you created.

2885
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:33,800
Okay.

2886
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:38,280
Method that you assign it to this Brant,
did you follow the naming convention

2887
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:52,080
that we're supposed to follow?

2888
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:52,960
You didn't follow that.

2889
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:56,040
You didn't follow the naming convention,

2890
02:21:56,040 --> 02:21:57,680
which is why it was difficult to.

2891
02:21:57,680 --> 02:21:59,560
Are you a me no start?

2892
02:21:59,560 --> 02:22:04,600
Because now you or no.

2893
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:07,200
Okay. So you didn't follow the naming
convention, right?

2894
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:09,720
The domain convention
was to distinguish the tickets.

2895
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:11,440
You know, first

2896
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:15,840
you blocked

2897
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:20,000
something here.

2898
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:25,080
Why is to say that someone changes again?

2899
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:45,800
You probably didn't
assign it to the sprint.

2900
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:48,120
So it's right here. I found it. This is.
This is your ticket.

2901
02:22:48,680 --> 02:22:50,320
If this is your ticket. Right.

2902
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:51,640
So What is it? It.

2903
02:22:51,640 --> 02:22:53,240
What was your question?

2904
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:54,560
I thought

2905
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:08,520
I had to see instructions or issue.

2906
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:10,840
I don't understand the question.

2907
02:23:10,840 --> 02:23:12,840
You're saying like what instructions?

2908
02:23:13,720 --> 02:23:14,600
Here is the issue.

2909
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:16,680
Here's the issue. We found it.

2910
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:18,600
So what is the question of what?
What is that?

2911
02:23:18,600 --> 02:23:23,160
I see that you added an incorrect link,
so I'm going to you know,

2912
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:30,720
you can delete it, you can delete the
links, how to see the acceptance criteria.

2913
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:34,200
The acceptance criteria is on the ticket
that you need to test.

2914
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:39,240
So you're testing
them as be to right so as we to

2915
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:42,000

2916
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,160

2918
02:23:48,160 --> 02:23:52,160
why are you moving tickets and secondly,
someone changed this again

2919
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:56,320
I'm going to see who it is
and I'm going to call you out

2920
02:23:57,400 --> 02:24:00,480

there

2925
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:43,680
I hope that I don't have to do this again.

2926
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:46,040
All right. So

2927
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:54,440
let's see.

2928
02:24:54,440 --> 02:25:19,080
People are creating their own
spreads. Who?

2929
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,320
Who's my hand?

2930
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:21,800
My hand.

2931
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:30,040
Nikolic.

2932
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:31,320
They. You.

2933
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:33,360
How did you create your own spread

2934
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:37,320
when you were supposed to

2935
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:41,040
know?

2936
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:42,000
Create a difference? Spread.

2937
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:50,160
Come on, let's.

2938
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:52,200
All right, so I'm going to change this

2939
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:56,360
so have Verona move back to a progress

2940
02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:00,200
and see

2941
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,280
she is

2942
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:14,280
can choose back to a story.

2943
02:26:14,280 --> 02:26:19,360
So that's been updated.

2944
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:19,960
All right.

2945
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:25,320
So let's continue on.

2946
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:27,480
Okay. Let's continue.

2947
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:30,040
I'm going to go back here to Gerald
Gerald Hicks.

2948
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:34,400
You may want to capitalize
on your last name,

2949
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:35,400
Gerald.

2950
02:26:35,520 --> 02:26:43,120
So the gods, you should have copied
and pasted the name instead, Gerald,

2951
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:45,800
because I see that you have lowercase
terminology here.

2952
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:49,480
Okay. And

2953
02:26:49,480 --> 02:26:53,000
giving user
what page went and log in is disabled.

2954
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,680
So we need to write a better cucumber
scenario.

2955
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:57,840
And Gerald, you actually did not link

2956
02:26:58,920 --> 02:27:00,560
the user story.

2957
02:27:00,760 --> 02:27:03,600
Okay, so you need to do that.

2958
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:06,840
Hanoch you linked it,
you have no description.

2959
02:27:07,320 --> 02:27:09,480
77 you have no cucumber scenario.

2960
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:10,800
This is not good.

2961
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:11,560
Okay, I'm

2962
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,840
is that who is who is asking for 77 but

2963
02:27:16,920 --> 02:27:17,760
someone else.

2964
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:20,160
If you created a story, change it please.

2965
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:23,360
It's not a story, okay? It's not a story.

2966
02:27:23,600 --> 02:27:24,120
What is it?

2967
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:24,680
It's a task.

2968
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:31,000
Mustafa 75 Link link. Did.

2969
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,960
So this is okay. Mustafa 75.

2970
02:27:34,440 --> 02:27:35,760
But here's the thing.

2971
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:38,680
Your step one enters
valid credentials, right?

2972
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:41,600
And you can say and logs in right

2973
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:43,720
then the user.

2974
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:46,440
So you're forgetting a step right now
you just entering valid credentials.

2975
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:49,200
They have to do something else
after after log in.

2976
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:51,720
So need to edit that step.

2977
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:54,240
74 Roman remain.

2978
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:56,880
You didn't assign it to yourself,
you linked it well

2979
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:02,040
when admin logs in with no content.

2980
02:28:02,040 --> 02:28:03,120
Okay, good.

2981
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,440
This is good.

2982
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,720
Roman. You understand?

2983
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:09,600
You understood the assignment

2984
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:22,040
so Maher.

2985
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:24,840
Maher, this is okay.
You don't need to have the URL.

2986
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:26,760
You can just say
given users on the syntax.

2987
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:30,480
HMS on page right?

2988
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:31,120
That's fine.

2989
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:33,000
Okay.

2990
02:28:33,960 --> 02:28:40,240
Now we'll.

2991
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:43,080
No, no, no

2992
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:47,760
nos links it.

2993
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:51,320
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2994
02:28:51,360 --> 02:28:52,080
Very good.

2995
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:52,520
Very good.

2996
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:54,840
Not bad. I'll Take it now.

2997
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:55,440
Good job.

2998
02:28:55,440 --> 02:28:58,080
67 all Olga

2999
02:28:59,920 --> 02:29:01,160
on page one user.

3000
02:29:01,160 --> 02:29:03,880
Okay, good logs in the linking is correct.

3001
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:05,360
Olga Not bad.

3002
02:29:05,360 --> 02:29:12,680
Not bad at all.

3003
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:15,080
Eric I will get to you. Okay,
I'll get you.

3004
02:29:15,120 --> 02:29:18,320
Please be patient. I'm going down.

3005
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:20,880
I see. It's fine. I see your mess. Don't
worry about it. Just.

3006
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:23,480
Just wait, okay? Try your best.
That's fine.

3007
02:29:23,480 --> 02:29:23,800
Okay.

3008
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:27,360
So let's see all that good guys.

3009
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:29,280
Let's help
some of our classmates out, please.

3010
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:31,720
Okay, Let's help
some of our classmates up.

3011
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:32,040
All right?

3012
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:35,720
Let's help some of our classmates out.

3013
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:39,000
65, Roman

3014
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,520
Romano, 65.

3015
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:42,720
He links it.

3016
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:47,280
Well, given the websites,
what user enters value and password,

3017
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:51,000
we're forgetting to click on login.

3018
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:54,840
We don't need the URL,
so you may want to rewrite that scenario.

3019
02:29:54,840 --> 02:29:56,400
Roman 65.

3020
02:29:56,400 --> 02:29:58,480
The Lincoln is good, Charlie.
Now let's see.

3021
02:29:58,840 --> 02:30:03,120
Cutting the links at Well,
she didn't write this cucumber scenario.

3022
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:04,520
Catalina, you need to fix that

3023
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:10,240
63 Aisha or I see.

3024
02:30:10,280 --> 02:30:10,960
I Aisha.

3025
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:16,480
I don't know which one
it is for our fun facts, but given a user.

3026
02:30:17,520 --> 02:30:21,680
Yes. Is there a reason
why we have a period in the last statement

3027
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:24,120
but we don't have a period
in the other statements?

3028
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:26,040
So that's inconsistency, right?

3029
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:28,040
So we need to fix that.

3030
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:31,280
71 Michael

3031
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:33,440
Billington Well, yes, right. Good

3032
02:30:36,760 --> 02:30:37,360
Yes, very good.

3033
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:38,040
Where's Michael?

3034
02:30:38,040 --> 02:30:40,040
Michael 71 This is pretty good.

3035
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:42,320
So Michael here

3036
02:30:43,440 --> 02:30:45,480
spoke on the goal of Michael.

3037
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:49,320
Okay, good stuff,
Michael, Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

3038
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:50,240
Dennis

3039
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:52,040
follows naming convention.

3040
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:55,440
Well, hold on, Catalina.

3041
02:30:55,480 --> 02:30:57,960
I just noticed your naming is off.

3042
02:30:57,960 --> 02:30:59,640
It's incorrect.

3043
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:01,480
You're using invalid user luggage.

3044
02:31:01,480 --> 02:31:04,320
That's not the correct user story
that we're testing.

3045
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:08,640
Okay, Catalina.

3046
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:10,920
Yes, you are the assignment, right?

3047
02:31:10,920 --> 02:31:13,120
Fatma, You're going to
be your assigning to yourself

3048
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:17,920
the assign or is
it just you can just assign to yourself?

3049
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:18,760
Assign it to yourself.

3050
02:31:18,760 --> 02:31:19,720
That's fine.

3051
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,480
Dennis You didn't write.

3052
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:25,560
You didn't write the cucumber scenario.

3053
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:27,560
Well, you linked it. You everything else.

3054
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:29,280
Well, but you didn't write the cucumber
scenario.

3055
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,320
Please, I shall.

3056
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:35,320
Fairfax links it.

3057
02:31:35,320 --> 02:31:37,160
Okay. So I shall Fairfax.

3058
02:31:37,160 --> 02:31:38,160
When you enter valid

3059
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:41,080
credentials, we're missing
one step and clicks the login by it.

3060
02:31:41,440 --> 02:31:44,800
Or you can just say when the user log
or when they I'm in logs

3061
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:47,600
in with the credentials, the linking
everything is good.

3062
02:31:49,160 --> 02:31:50,280
Honeyed

3063
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:56,040
giving the user the ability to log in
when two days, 6 hours.

3064
02:31:56,040 --> 02:31:59,280
No very bad cucumber scenario,
but you can fix it.

3065
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:01,440
You also didn't link it.

3066
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:03,640
That's fine.

3067
02:32:03,640 --> 02:32:09,160
Q admin user Silva
you Silva Silva Silva you linked it well.

3068
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:12,120
You want to change the wording.

3069
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:14,600
Silva You don't to use the word attempts.

3070
02:32:15,320 --> 02:32:17,360
Okay.

3071
02:32:17,360 --> 02:32:23,040
So when user logs in with
now the credentials, okay.

3072
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:24,840
Sebastian.

3073
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:27,360
Sebastian Yes, the linking as well.

3074
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:31,920
Why do you have the acceptance
criteria here?

3075
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,840
Why did you copy and paste
the acceptance criteria in the ticket?

3076
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:39,240
No, you were just supposed to put
you're just supposed to enter.

3077
02:32:39,520 --> 02:32:43,520
I know this is not a good to cover.

3078
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:45,880
You say,
given the users on the syntax. h.R.

3079
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:48,600
Resume appears when the user does this
and this happens, right?

3080
02:32:48,960 --> 02:32:50,680
So rewrite your scenario.

3081
02:32:50,680 --> 02:32:54,200
Sebastian to no, it didn't link it.

3082
02:32:54,280 --> 02:32:55,680
I don't see a link to me now.

3083
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:59,760
I don't see a link.

3084
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:03,040
I don't know why we're talking about
facebook when the acceptance criteria has

3085
02:33:03,040 --> 02:33:07,400
there was syntax mess on page
or the syntax is application to me.

3086
02:33:07,520 --> 02:33:09,520
So you definitely to change that pre

3087
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:12,600
RC, you would need to change your story
to a task.

3088
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:14,880
Okay. You did link it well

3089
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:18,840
and your scenario is very well written.

3090
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:21,040
So priority over there. Good job.

3091
02:33:21,040 --> 02:33:23,440
You need to change this to a task.

3092
02:33:23,440 --> 02:33:25,480
Okay. Joseph G.

3093
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:31,160
Gabriel. Joe.

3094
02:33:31,160 --> 02:33:37,200
Oh, given the user log in to,
we may need to change that.

3095
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:38,880
Cucumbers narrow wording a little bit.

3096
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:40,920
It doesn't really make sense.

3097
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:44,200
And Joseph, I don't see a link to the

3098
02:33:44,360 --> 02:33:46,680
to the user story so we need to fix that

3099
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:48,840
Guido

3100
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:51,640
you know you there

3101
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:53,840
you linked in well given user

3102
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:57,240
should be one user

3103
02:33:57,880 --> 02:34:01,360
log in below you don't need the URL. Okay

3104
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:05,480
and is username and password
and clicks on log

3105
02:34:05,480 --> 02:34:06,400
and by

3106
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:11,280
you may want to change this.

3107
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:12,680
This is not

3108
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:17,400
yeah you have you have a lot of different
things here so for example

3109
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:24,000
your Guido you there.

3110
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:24,720
Yeah. Are you

3111
02:34:25,840 --> 02:34:27,280
are you there you here.

3112
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:30,760
Okay so Eugenia is there a reason
why and is all capitalized

3113
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:34,600
but is a given isn't also your test data.

3114
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:35,720
It can go somewhere else.

3115
02:34:35,720 --> 02:34:38,640
Not in the middle of the scenario.

3116
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:40,600
Yeah. So let's.

3117
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:42,120
Let's fix that.

3118
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:44,840
Okay, Let's fix that.

3119
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:46,560
This is fine.

3120
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:47,160
Lewis.

3121
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:49,960
Lewis was good. Angelica

3122
02:34:49,960 --> 02:34:50,320
links.

3123
02:34:50,320 --> 02:34:53,760
It right follows the naming convention.

3124
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:59,000
Yes. Angelica if you're there, not bad.

3125
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,400
Not bad at all. Joseph.

3126
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:04,000
Richard Riker.

3127
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:04,320
Joseph.

3128
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:07,440
Rico.

3129
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:08,640
So you link to.

3130
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:09,760
Well given. Okay.

3131
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:12,520
When the admin clicks
the log in fill with credentials.

3132
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,440
Okay, I'll take it.

3133
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:16,040
We could be better, but it's good.

3134
02:35:16,040 --> 02:35:20,400
The build the build links it.

3135
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:22,000
Okay. Not bad in the bill.

3136
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:22,760
It's fine.

3137
02:35:22,760 --> 02:35:24,840
Very good in the bill.
Are you there? Good, good, good.

3138
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:29,440
Miriam, I'm going in order, guys. 44.

3139
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:31,400
I'm 44 right now.

3140
02:35:31,400 --> 02:35:34,800
It must be two, given the website, so.

3141
02:35:34,920 --> 02:35:35,720
Okay.

3142
02:35:36,360 --> 02:35:38,120
Miriam, are you there?

3143
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:39,680
Miriam, are you there?

3144
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:42,360
So you're saying given the website link.

3145
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:43,720
But what does that mean?

3146
02:35:43,720 --> 02:35:44,560
It was a given.

3147
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:46,920
The user is on this page, right?

3148
02:35:47,360 --> 02:35:48,880
We're talking about the user, right?

3149
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:52,480
When the user enters and you did it right
with the next step, we you have a comma

3150
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:53,880
at the end for some reason

3151
02:35:53,880 --> 02:35:57,240
and then you have a period
at the last statement for some reason.

3152
02:35:57,240 --> 02:35:59,280
So we need consistency right.

3153
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:03,720
Lugo links it Well giving user is giving.

3154
02:36:03,720 --> 02:36:06,920
User is what the URL
we need to reward that

3155
02:36:06,920 --> 02:36:10,200
when user enters username
and password and clicks, log in.

3156
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:13,000
Okay, good.
But you need to fix the first up

3157
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:14,880
loop.

3158
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:16,720
All you need to fix is this.

3159
02:36:16,720 --> 02:36:19,200
Simon Simon links. Well

3160
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:24,360
giving user with valid credentials

3161
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:28,040
that first step doesn't make sense.

3162
02:36:28,040 --> 02:36:30,240
Could you? That doesn't make sense

3163
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:33,240
when admin

3164
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:36,000
when admin user logs in.

3165
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,560
Okay, you need to fix that. Simon.

3166
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:40,000
Simon.

3167
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,320
The linking is good
you to fix your scenario.

3168
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:44,360
Mohamed

3169
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,520
Mohammed I don't see linking.

3170
02:36:47,520 --> 02:36:53,640
You need to fix it.

3171
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:54,000
Okay.

3172
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:55,480
I see what you did with the scenario.

3173
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:57,760
It's okay,

3174
02:36:58,040 --> 02:36:59,440
but you need to fix the linking.

3175
02:36:59,440 --> 02:37:01,880
Okay. And I'm 139

3176
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:06,080
so. And links it.

3177
02:37:07,720 --> 02:37:08,520
And are you there?

3178
02:37:08,520 --> 02:37:09,000
Anna?

3179
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,480
Who's Anna?

3180
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:12,840
Anna Not bad.

3181
02:37:12,840 --> 02:37:15,320
Not bad at all. Not better.

3182
02:37:15,960 --> 02:37:17,280
Then were you with Maria?

3183
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:20,280
Who's free? The Pomona

3184
02:37:20,280 --> 02:37:23,160
oh two Minority link is good.

3185
02:37:23,400 --> 02:37:25,560
Okay. Period.

3186
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:26,960
Period, period, period.

3187
02:37:26,960 --> 02:37:28,920
So she decided to add the periods.

3188
02:37:28,920 --> 02:37:31,120
Okay, but it's okay.

3189
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:33,160
That's fine. This is good.

3190
02:37:33,160 --> 02:37:39,040
I'll take your Solana.

3191
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:42,600
Given user has valid credentials
guys it needs to be given.

3192
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:45,840
User is on the homepage
giving user is on syntax

3193
02:37:46,320 --> 02:37:50,520
as you know
when log in HMS then logged in.

3194
02:37:51,240 --> 02:37:53,840
We need to reward this Roxana

3195
02:37:55,200 --> 02:37:56,640
you linked it well

3196
02:37:56,640 --> 02:38:01,920
Antony, you're saying
when entering the correct

3197
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:04,440
valid credentials, but then something else
needs to happen, right?

3198
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:05,680
You forgot.

3199
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:08,600
If you can write a step like this,
Anthony, you need to specify that.

3200
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:10,520
You need to click on the login button.

3201
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:11,240
Right.

3202
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:13,520
But everything else looks good.

3203
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:15,120
The linking looks good.

3204
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:17,400
Okay, Anthony, I hope you heard that

3205
02:38:19,960 --> 02:38:21,400
survey

3206
02:38:21,720 --> 02:38:22,360
survey.

3207
02:38:22,360 --> 02:38:25,160
The linking is good
given user is on login page

3208
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:28,200
one user is along a page
and then just how it is needed.

3209
02:38:28,200 --> 02:38:30,480
It's a password obviously. So. Hey.

3210
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:35,520
So hey, I have a question for you.

3211
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:37,560
This is actually it's fine.

3212
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:40,200
That's good.

3213
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:41,160
The linking is good.

3214
02:38:41,160 --> 02:38:45,640
Up to linking is good.

3215
02:38:45,640 --> 02:38:50,360
When the admin logs into the site
and the admin logs in with.

3216
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:52,680
Now how how does that make sense?

3217
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:55,080
How can the admin log into site

3218
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:57,200
and then

3219
02:38:57,200 --> 02:38:59,200
how can they log in with potentially

3220
02:39:00,360 --> 02:39:03,280
when they're already logged in.

3221
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:05,720
So we need to we need to reward that.

3222
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,520
We need to reward that and okay,
the linking is good.

3223
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:13,920
I'm in 31 nya 31 given

3224
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:17,200
admin user log in page. Okay

3225
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:21,720
then it should be log then
nya if you're there.

3226
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:24,560
The linking was good.

3227
02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:27,320
1630 the linking is good.

3228
02:39:27,320 --> 02:39:32,480
Given user two HMS we could definitely
write a better cucumber scenario

3229
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:35,360
and admin insert with DC.

3230
02:39:35,600 --> 02:39:37,560
I don't know what that means.

3231
02:39:37,560 --> 02:39:39,960
That would help test case review. Alana.

3232
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:42,480
Okay, you're linking is good

3233
02:39:42,960 --> 02:39:46,840
given the admin user navigates the syntax
with the admin logs.

3234
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:49,560
Okay. Not that alone. Are you there?

3235
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:50,960
There's a lot of there

3236
02:39:51,640 --> 02:39:53,960
were no,
not that. I'll take it along. Okay.

3237
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:56,440
Eight out of ten.
I'll take it. I'll take it. Right.

3238
02:39:57,720 --> 02:40:00,000
The linking is good for HMS 28.

3239
02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:03,040
Given HMS Admin is on.

3240
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:04,800
Okay, log in patient analyzer.

3241
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:06,800
Okay. Alexei

3242
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:09,040
Alexa quizzes you.

3243
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:11,920
Alexis Tableau.

3244
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:12,480
What is this?

3245
02:40:12,480 --> 02:40:13,720
Pretty good job.

3246
02:40:13,720 --> 02:40:16,760
Alexei No, not bad at all. Then.

3247
02:40:17,360 --> 02:40:18,320
Fatma Let's see.

3248
02:40:18,320 --> 02:40:19,400
Fatma there.

3249
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:20,360
Fatma

3250
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:23,520
Okay,

3251
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:26,280
give the user one user
logging in with look.

3252
02:40:26,440 --> 02:40:27,600
Fatma.

3253
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:31,160
Fatma Is there a reason why you have
periods at the ends of these statements?

3254
02:40:31,160 --> 02:40:32,480
Not a period here.

3255
02:40:32,480 --> 02:40:37,040
You can either get rid of all of them
or add it to all of them to be consistent.

3256
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:37,880
Right?

3257
02:40:37,880 --> 02:40:41,760
The linking is good,
so fix that Sorbonne 25

3258
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:46,240
The linking is there good? Yes.

3259
02:40:46,600 --> 02:40:51,480
And then the user admin is logged in
and directed to the okay, I'll take it.

3260
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:52,640
Sorbonne.

3261
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:55,160
Nikolai. Let's see.

3262
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,200
Nikolai. Nikolai.

3263
02:40:56,200 --> 02:41:03,120
Nikolai.

3264
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:06,280
Linking is good with these that aren't so.

3265
02:41:06,280 --> 02:41:06,760
Tell you what

3266
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:09,760
you guys there?

3267
02:41:10,680 --> 02:41:13,920
Okay, so listen, for those of you
that are still waiting for my feedback,

3268
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:15,200
please wait on the call.

3269
02:41:15,200 --> 02:41:17,400
For those of you
who I said you guys are good.

3270
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:20,320
The homework assignment for
this is too, and I'll say

3271
02:41:20,320 --> 02:41:22,520
it, but it's going to be working on
another task,

3272
02:41:23,360 --> 02:41:26,000
another user story,
and doing the same thing again.

3273
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,120
I need you guys to write the cucumbers.

3274
02:41:28,120 --> 02:41:29,280
Mario for that other story.

3275
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:30,720
I'll tell you which one it is.

3276
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:33,000
Maybe it's one, maybe it's four.

3277
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,320
I will. I will.

3278
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:36,000
We will see. Okay, cool.

3279
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:41,280
Guys, tomorrow when you come class, it's
just going to be just pure zero, okay?

3280
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:44,040
Just 0000.

3281
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:48,880
And if I called your name earlier and I
said, Good to go, then you good to go.

3282
02:41:48,880 --> 02:41:51,080
If I did that, please wait.

3283
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:54,000
Okay? Yes.

3284
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:55,760
If I said you're okay, then you got to go.

3285
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:58,080
Okay, cool.

3286
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:58,480
Okay.

3287
02:41:58,480 --> 02:42:01,000
If not, good will be tomorrow. Okay.

3288
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:03,640
But at the end.
Tomorrow? Yeah, I'll yours.

3289
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:08,720
So, Nikolai.

3290
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:11,920
Nikolai, you're good to go as well.

3291
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:13,480
A Lenny.

3292
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:15,920
Lenny. No,

3293
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:19,120
no, but Lenny need to linkage you

3294
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:22,600
to read the cucumber scenario for that

3295
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:28,320
where we can practice.

3296
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:30,240
You can practice with the new task.

3297
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,200
That's fine.

3298
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:35,960
When I'm in logs entering with valid
credential clicks and log in.

3299
02:42:35,960 --> 02:42:37,680
Okay.

3300
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:39,880
Ahmadiyya of March.

3301
02:42:39,880 --> 02:42:41,320
But, Marshall, this is good.

3302
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:42,960
I'll take it. You're good to go? Yes.

3303
02:42:42,960 --> 02:42:45,760
Our posting the work in the course
announcements.

3304
02:42:46,200 --> 02:42:48,040
Ekaterina

3305
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:49,840
Okay.

3306
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:52,400
Ekaterina This is good. You're good to go.

3307
02:42:52,400 --> 02:42:54,440
Dominic You linked it.

3308
02:42:54,480 --> 02:42:57,240
Dominic You're Dominic Need to.

3309
02:42:57,600 --> 02:43:01,160
We need to specify here
after entering with valid

3310
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:03,880
credentials that the user needs
to click on login, right?

3311
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:06,840
So then the homepage can display
but everything else is good.

3312
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:08,760
You fix that, you're good to go.

3313
02:43:10,040 --> 02:43:14,520
In Malaysia, the linking is good.

3314
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:15,840
We're missing a malaysia.

3315
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:18,800
We're missing the step
to click on the log in button.

3316
02:43:19,440 --> 02:43:20,000
Okay?

3317
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:23,520
Because that's the only way
they'll be able to see this in text

3318
02:43:23,640 --> 02:43:29,920
page.

3319
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:33,000
Whoever is doing this,
it looks like Hanoch Hanoch.

3320
02:43:33,560 --> 02:43:36,960
You didn't name the naming convention,
you didn't write the scenario.

3321
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:40,000
Okay. All right.

3322
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,880
Is there anyone else who's waiting on me?

3323
02:43:41,880 --> 02:43:45,480
Marina Alexis, you said,
can you guys give me your ticket ID?

3324
02:43:46,200 --> 02:43:47,800
So 48.

3325
02:43:47,800 --> 02:43:50,040
Let's look at 41st.

3326
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:50,640
Okay.

3327
02:43:50,640 --> 02:43:57,760
48, 4848

3328
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:00,880
The link is good given that,
I mean, actually when the admin

3329
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:04,840
logs in with proper credentials
and we'll be logged in.

3330
02:44:05,160 --> 02:44:09,360
So. 48 Marina, is there a reason
why we have a period here

3331
02:44:09,360 --> 02:44:10,560
and that in the other statements

3332
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:13,440
you could either get rid of them
or do all of them right?

3333
02:44:14,280 --> 02:44:16,920
So, you know, the sign

3334
02:44:18,360 --> 02:44:22,480
this one was 48, right?

3335
02:44:22,480 --> 02:44:24,400
48 way.

3336
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:27,720
Where are we going to order

3337
02:44:29,440 --> 02:44:35,160
that? 48.

3338
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:36,160
Christine, are you there?

3339
02:44:36,160 --> 02:44:39,080
45. You said 45, Christine,

3340
02:44:39,080 --> 02:44:43,560
but 45.

3341
02:44:43,560 --> 02:44:45,720
Yeah. 45.

3342
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:47,120
Okay.

3343
02:44:47,120 --> 02:44:53,760
Christine So the link is good.

3344
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:57,600
When the admin users on the login page,
the HMS application, but

3345
02:44:57,640 --> 02:44:59,080
where are they logging in?

3346
02:44:59,080 --> 02:45:01,680
You're not saying that
like when they enter or what log in,

3347
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,480
they're not just going to be on the
they're not just going to be able

3348
02:45:05,480 --> 02:45:07,800
to be logged in
just by being on the login page.

3349
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:10,400
We need to change this scenario.

3350
02:45:10,400 --> 02:45:15,800
Okay, So next ID 83, Alexis

3351
02:45:17,360 --> 02:45:21,120
Alexis 83.

3352
02:45:21,120 --> 02:45:26,760
Danny is that they think Danny.

3353
02:45:26,760 --> 02:45:31,800
So we need to make this not all uppercase,

3354
02:45:31,800 --> 02:45:36,560
but we need to specify here, Alexis,
that you're logging in right here.

3355
02:45:36,560 --> 02:45:41,160
You're only specifying that you're,
that you're entering the credentials. Okay

3356
02:45:42,680 --> 02:45:43,960
So you need to

3357
02:45:44,640 --> 02:45:47,240
you need to change this so that it says,

3358
02:45:47,240 --> 02:45:50,800
you know, and clicks on login
by and or something like that. Okay

3359
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:56,080
So. 83 and then you say you got to go,

3360
02:45:56,640 --> 02:46:02,160
oh, as you're not, okay.

3361
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:03,480
Given

3362
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:07,240
the users notices that
when the user enters valid credentials

3363
02:46:07,720 --> 02:46:10,760
same thing as your that she's just

3364
02:46:12,760 --> 02:46:14,280
you need to specify guys

3365
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:17,440
you need to specify when they got it
so they're entering valid credentials.

3366
02:46:17,440 --> 02:46:17,920
Right.

3367
02:46:18,600 --> 02:46:20,800
But just by doing that they're not log
then they have to click

3368
02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:22,080
on a log of one right.

3369
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:26,040
So you either create two steps for that
or you just say when the user logs in,

3370
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:28,240
just fit it into one step, right?

3371
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:30,840
So that's fine.

3372
02:46:31,560 --> 02:46:38,760
Let's See, Farhad says he was 17.

3373
02:46:40,080 --> 02:46:40,880
Okay,

3374
02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:43,480
we're 17

3375
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:47,880
and 17.

3376
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,640
Farhad says the linking is good.

3377
02:46:52,200 --> 02:46:54,600
Okay. Nope.

3378
02:46:54,600 --> 02:46:55,080
Same thing.

3379
02:46:55,080 --> 02:46:57,160
Four had the same feedback applies to you.

3380
02:46:57,160 --> 02:46:59,520
You're not clicking on that login button.

3381
02:46:59,520 --> 02:47:00,480
Okay,

3382
02:47:01,560 --> 02:47:05,400
Arwa,

3383
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:08,720
so we're missing the step
to click on the login button.

3384
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:09,720
Okay.

3385
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:11,280
Okay.

3386
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:14,040
For I mean, of Arwa.

3387
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:16,960
Sorry.

3388
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:24,280
Okay.

3389
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:25,320
Okay. In Malaysia.

3390
02:47:25,320 --> 02:47:27,680
I'll address that right now.

3391
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:28,040
All right.

3392
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:32,120
So let's let's not this out.

3393
02:47:32,120 --> 02:47:33,760
Who else is next?

3394
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:35,120
Let's let's do Ladies first.

3395
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:38,920
And you ladies, lovely
ladies, let's let's get there.

3396
02:47:38,920 --> 02:47:42,440
Probably let's let 11.

02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:44,400
Ladies first.

3398
02:47:44,400 --> 02:47:45,560
64. Okay, let's do it.

3399
02:47:45,560 --> 02:47:46,120
Let's do 11.

3400
02:47:46,120 --> 02:47:47,160
First day

02:47:50,240 --> 02:47:52,320
All children.

That's

3404
02:47:54,600 --> 02:47:56,640
of course, I'm going to say 11.

3405
02:47:56,640 --> 02:47:58,480
Where's your typical 11?

3406
02:47:58,480 --> 02:48:01,480
11, 11, 11, 11, 11. Ladies first.

3407
02:48:01,480 --> 02:48:03,640
Got to date. Ladies first.

3408
02:48:03,640 --> 02:48:05,760
All so that we can

3409
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:09,120
just the last two.

3410
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:10,160
I don't see 11.

3411
02:48:10,160 --> 02:48:14,080
Where's 11?

3412
02:48:14,080 --> 02:48:19,600
Where's 11, 11, 11, 11.

3413
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:21,000

there is lot to. Okay,

3415
02:48:23,880 --> 02:48:27,360
the linking is good.

3416
02:48:27,360 --> 02:48:29,000
Yes, good. I'll take it.

3417
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:29,760
That's fine.

3418
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:32,840
But there was no point
of putting the court the colons, the

3419
02:48:33,360 --> 02:48:35,280
the colon here the

3420
02:48:36,040 --> 02:48:37,480
you didn't have to do that.

3421
02:48:37,480 --> 02:48:38,240
Okay.

3422
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:41,560
After 11 was what after 11 was

3423
02:48:44,680 --> 02:48:46,880
Catalina 64.

02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:49,360
Okay. 64.

3425
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:50,400
Guilty.

3427
02:48:53,400 --> 02:48:55,320
Yes. No.

Wrong user story.

3429
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:57,640
Wrong user story.

3430
02:48:57,640 --> 02:48:59,760
Catalina The scenario is good.

3431
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:01,760
The scenario is good.

3432
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:04,120
Catalina you linked the wrong story, okay?

3433
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:10,520

Any more ladies in line 45.

3452
02:49:58,040 --> 02:50:02,400
I've got to really look at 4545

3453
02:50:04,840 --> 02:50:08,600
given when the HMAS is on a login page.

3454
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:12,520
So for Christine,
I really already get feedback on this.

3455
02:50:13,080 --> 02:50:16,760
Okay.

3456
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:20,360
So you're saying given
the user has valid credentials, okay,

3457
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:24,080
when the admin users on the login page,

3458
02:50:24,080 --> 02:50:27,800
so when they're there, then
the admin user should be able to log in.

3459
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:30,640
I don't think that's how it works
when they're on the login page.

3460
02:50:30,680 --> 02:50:34,800
Then what did they have to do to log
in right?

3461
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:36,200
It's not. It's not up there.

3462
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:38,680
Let's see
all you want me to update it? Refresh it.

3463
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:40,040
Okay. See

3464
02:50:41,080 --> 02:50:48,560
45. No, it's the same thing.

3465
02:50:48,840 --> 02:50:50,640
I still see the same thing.

3466
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:55,360
So we have fixed that scenario.

3467
02:50:55,360 --> 02:50:57,760
Okay, Ladies, ladies,
Are we good with ladies?

3468
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:02,520
Is there are there any other ladies
in the call waiting before I continue?

3469
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:04,360
The gentleman.

3470
02:51:05,320 --> 02:51:08,080
We good?

3471
02:51:08,080 --> 02:51:13,600
Okay, So, Mina,
what is your question to me now?

3472
02:51:13,600 --> 02:51:21,720
What is the question to Mina?

3473
02:51:21,720 --> 02:51:26,320
I'm not seeing the batch 11 to link to it.

3474
02:51:26,320 --> 02:51:32,000
You haven't created a task yet.

3475
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:32,880
I did.

3476
02:51:32,880 --> 02:51:39,400
So what is your ticket number?

3477
02:51:39,400 --> 02:51:41,160
Oh, well, cause I have you there.

3478
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:43,160
I'm good, and I'll take care of the rest.

3479
02:51:43,160 --> 02:51:45,720
It's good seeing you again, right?

3480
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:50,760
Being with us again.

3481
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:52,280
So, Mina, words to Mina.

3482
02:51:52,280 --> 02:52:01,440
What is your ticket ID number 47.

3483
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,760
Okay, so 47

3484
02:52:04,760 --> 02:52:08,400
minutes here.

3485
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:11,040
Okay, So to Mina, giving a user

3486
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:15,520
when the user logs
in, then the user should be logged in.

3487
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:19,920
Okay, we can get rid of the period
so you need to link.

3488
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:21,640
Okay, so it's right here.

3489
02:52:21,640 --> 02:52:22,920
This is your ticket. Okay. To me.

3490
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:23,880
Not so.

3491
02:52:23,880 --> 02:52:27,840
In order to link it right,
you need to click more

3492
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:30,840
and you need to click on link.

3493
02:52:30,840 --> 02:52:35,120
When you click on link,
just change this to tests, okay?

3494
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:38,160
And then enter the ticket number
that you're testing.

3495
02:52:38,160 --> 02:52:40,320
Right. So this is a ticket for HMS.

3496
02:52:40,920 --> 02:52:43,560
What is, what is the idea for the ticket?

3497
02:52:43,560 --> 02:52:44,760
B2 Right.

3498
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:49,920
I think HMS B on B 11 and I think it's two

3499
02:52:51,240 --> 02:52:53,000
and someone changed it again.

3500
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,560
So hold on.

3501
02:52:55,560 --> 02:52:59,520
So one of the two done for some reason
and I can find one.

3502
02:53:00,280 --> 02:53:04,200
So I'll open this tab when it chooses to.

3503
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:04,920
A story

3504
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:09,200
Okay, do this

3505
02:53:09,200 --> 02:53:12,120
and then we're going to come here
and then that's how you link it.

3506
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:14,720
Okay, To me now I just show
you I'm not going to do it for you.

3507
02:53:14,720 --> 02:53:15,640
I just show you how to do it.

3508
02:53:15,640 --> 02:53:17,120
Okay, so you do it.

3509
02:53:17,120 --> 02:53:18,720
So again, open your ticket.

3510
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:20,920
Click on more, click on link.

3511
02:53:21,440 --> 02:53:21,920
Right.

3512
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:25,160
Not tested by because this ticket
is going to test ticket.

3513
02:53:25,200 --> 02:53:30,200
So you say this ticket tests
and then you look up the other thing

3514
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:35,480
it's must be 11 and two
and it's the first one.

3515
02:53:35,480 --> 02:53:37,120
So go ahead and link it.

3516
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:38,520
Okay, You can do that.

3517
02:53:38,520 --> 02:53:42,880
And then you should be good to go.

3518
02:53:42,880 --> 02:53:43,160
Okay.

3519
02:53:43,160 --> 02:53:45,280
So next 15 Jimmi.

3520
02:53:47,080 --> 02:53:48,880
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.

3521
02:53:48,880 --> 02:53:53,200
Let's go with the gentleman. 15.

3522
02:53:53,200 --> 02:53:55,560
I'm gonna start with
15. Right, I'll start with 15

3523
02:53:56,640 --> 02:53:58,800
and start with 15.

3524
02:53:59,360 --> 02:54:00,000
Okay.

3525
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,680
The linking is there.

3526
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:03,840
Yes, yes.

3527
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:06,120
Yep. That's good. Gemma.

3528
02:54:06,120 --> 02:54:07,800
You're good to go.

3529
02:54:08,560 --> 02:54:09,480
Goodnight.

3530
02:54:09,480 --> 02:54:11,080
Well, let's see who else.

3531
02:54:11,080 --> 02:54:12,880
Lewis,
You were already good in the first place.

3532
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:15,960
So why are you still asking for

3533
02:54:15,960 --> 02:54:18,120
what you already got?

3534
02:54:18,520 --> 02:54:20,440
What is the difference
between Somali images?

3535
02:54:20,440 --> 02:54:24,880
Says when the admin logs in
with proper credentials. Yes.

3536
02:54:25,480 --> 02:54:28,560
And this when the user logs in with proper
with the provider

3537
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:31,680
username and password.

3538
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:33,760
Emily. Emilia, what's your ticket again?

3539
02:54:33,840 --> 02:54:36,840
Was your ticket number so I can look at it

3540
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:37,200
again.

3541
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:40,280
19 is a good 19. Good.

3542
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:41,320
Let's look at 19.

3543
02:54:41,320 --> 02:54:44,160
So it says given the users and the syntax

3544
02:54:45,200 --> 02:54:48,400
when the user logs in the provider.

3545
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:49,600
Yeah, this is good.

3546
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:51,960
This is good. Then
I say it was bad. No, this is good.

3547
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:54,680
This is good.

3548
02:54:54,680 --> 02:54:55,200
Yeah.

3549
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:58,480
When the user
I thought I read something else

3550
02:55:00,120 --> 02:55:02,720
when the user logs in with the provider
username, but that's good.

3551
02:55:02,920 --> 02:55:04,840
That that makes sense.

3552
02:55:04,840 --> 02:55:06,600
So you're good to go. Emilia.

3553
02:55:06,600 --> 02:55:08,640
Sorry if I said something else that.

3554
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:12,000
But this is good. So.

3555
02:55:13,120 --> 02:55:13,920
No, no, it's fine.

3556
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:16,720
I think I may have read someone else's
ticket by accident or something like that.

3557
02:55:17,440 --> 02:55:20,000
Okay, so let's see.

3558
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:24,320
So Jimmy was good.

3559
02:55:24,320 --> 02:55:27,560
Okay, so

3560
02:55:29,160 --> 02:55:32,120
turn off that

3561
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:36,360
the link is good.

3562
02:55:36,360 --> 02:55:37,360
Okay, So, Ahmed,

3563
02:55:37,360 --> 02:55:40,200
is there a reason why you have a period
at the end of the last statement?

3564
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:41,680
Just delete that and you're good to go.

3565
02:55:41,680 --> 02:55:46,480
Okay, so that's so that said, 70.

3566
02:55:46,760 --> 02:55:48,600
Marzio has been saying 70.

3567
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:52,560
Even when I said
ladies only so I can't find 70 here.

3568
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:56,400
It's not here.

3569
02:55:56,400 --> 02:55:59,320
So the fact that I cannot find 70 in

3570
02:55:59,480 --> 02:56:02,320
the Sprint backlog

3571
02:56:02,760 --> 02:56:05,000
tells me that they are in the sprint

3572
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:08,080
tells me that you didn't
link it to the sprint.

3573
02:56:08,080 --> 02:56:11,640
Okay.

3574
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:13,440
The notes.

3575
02:56:13,440 --> 02:56:16,080
This is for 71, right?

3576
02:56:17,480 --> 02:56:19,160
Who said NASIR so?

3577
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:21,840
I can't again find your ticket.

3578
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:23,960
12. Okay, let's find 12

3579
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:29,040
K 12.

3580
02:56:29,040 --> 02:56:33,320
No, the Y you don't attempt to log in
with all the credentials.

3581
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:35,640
You just log in with your credentials.

3582
02:56:35,640 --> 02:56:39,960
This is a
this is more like a negative test, Z.

3583
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:42,640
Everything else is correct.
We just got to fix this, right?

3584
02:56:42,920 --> 02:56:47,640
So when the admin you just
when the admin right.

3585
02:56:47,640 --> 02:56:50,640
I'll change here for you when the admin

3586
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:52,280
right.

3587
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:55,680
Does change the wording logs
in with the credentials.

3588
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:56,520
There you go. Bam.

3589
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:58,280
You're good to go.

3590
02:56:58,280 --> 02:57:00,520
So let's see who next.

3591
02:57:00,520 --> 02:57:04,160
85. 85.

3592
02:57:04,640 --> 02:57:06,120
I don't see 85 here.

3593
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:09,360
It's not linked to the sprint board,
so if I can't find it, it's not that

3594
02:57:09,440 --> 02:57:10,600
easy to make this report.

3595
02:57:11,640 --> 02:57:12,000
Right.

3596
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,200
I don't see 85.

3597
02:57:14,400 --> 02:57:14,880
Okay.

3598
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:17,360
Don't see 85

3599
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:20,160
then. Could see 88.

3600
02:57:20,160 --> 02:57:21,960
Is there a tendra.

3601
02:57:21,960 --> 02:57:25,200
So the link is there.

3602
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:28,120
When the user logs in with algorithms,
then the user should be logging in.

3603
02:57:28,120 --> 02:57:29,880
Okay, that's good.

3604
02:57:30,240 --> 02:57:31,240
Good stuff.

3605
02:57:31,240 --> 02:57:32,560
But then do a good job.

3606
02:57:32,560 --> 02:57:34,080
Have a good night.

3607
02:57:34,760 --> 02:57:35,680
Let's see.

3608
02:57:35,680 --> 02:57:37,840
35. Anthony.

3609
02:57:37,840 --> 02:57:38,280
Anthony.

3610
02:57:38,280 --> 02:57:42,240
So here, Anthony, this is good.

3611
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:43,480
Very good.

3612
02:57:43,680 --> 02:57:45,680
That's great. Yup.

3613
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:48,520
I already told you what the car was going
to be posted in the course announcement.

3614
02:57:48,520 --> 02:57:51,240
78 for Amar.

3615
02:57:51,920 --> 02:57:52,800
I'm not Amar.

3616
02:57:52,800 --> 02:57:55,240
I don't see it on the springboard,
but we see it in Lincoln.

3617
02:57:55,240 --> 02:57:57,960
Well, 58 for Sebastian.

3618
02:57:58,800 --> 02:57:59,680
Let's see.

3619
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:00,400
The link is good.

3620
02:58:00,400 --> 02:58:05,680
Given the admin has valid
credentials and clicks, log in.

3621
02:58:05,680 --> 02:58:11,760
So this is a weirdly written scenario,
Sebastian, because we want to say,

3622
02:58:12,760 --> 02:58:17,000
given
the users on this, when the user logs

3623
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:21,280
in with valid credentials,
then the syntax home is displayed.

3624
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:23,880
Okay, so we can reward this

3625
02:58:25,160 --> 02:58:28,280
cool 41

3626
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:32,520
and 41 Sherif,

3627
02:58:33,040 --> 02:58:35,920
I'm going to refresh this again,
but you're asking me to check yours

3628
02:58:36,520 --> 02:58:39,840
and I believe I already told you
at the beginning of the class that

3629
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:42,400
you needed to work on yours.

3630
02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:44,720
Look, you still didn't
change the naming convention.

3631
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:48,280
You linked the properly,
you linked it incorrectly.

3632
02:58:48,280 --> 02:58:50,600
You didn't write the cucumber.

3633
02:58:50,600 --> 02:58:52,720
So what exactly do you want me to look at?

3634
02:58:54,520 --> 02:58:56,160
14. Okay.

3635
02:58:56,160 --> 02:59:00,440
I didn't know we had Lewis in class 14.

3636
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:03,120
The link is good.

3637
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:04,560
So, Lewis,

3638
02:59:05,360 --> 02:59:07,280
if you see this case right here,

3639
02:59:07,280 --> 02:59:10,560
the linking is good, right
But you're saying give given.

3640
02:59:10,560 --> 02:59:12,360
I mean, users on the HMS won't page

3641
02:59:12,360 --> 02:59:14,600
as good
when the user logs in with no credentials.

3642
02:59:14,600 --> 02:59:15,840
Okay. This is very good. Yep.

3643
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:19,520
I was reading something else
so that's good.

3644
02:59:19,520 --> 02:59:20,160
Okay.

3645
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:21,240
That's very very good.

3646
02:59:21,240 --> 02:59:22,920
13 that I would check. 13

3647
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:25,080
the mirror.

3648
02:59:25,080 --> 02:59:27,800
13 The link is good
giving users on this one.

3649
02:59:27,800 --> 02:59:30,120
User logs with this and this.

3650
02:59:30,120 --> 02:59:31,480
Okay. Nice.

3651
02:59:31,480 --> 02:59:32,960
Very good. 13 is good.

3652
02:59:32,960 --> 02:59:35,640
The mirrors good was

3653
02:59:36,600 --> 02:59:37,840
a you

3654
02:59:37,840 --> 02:59:41,200
click hold and drag it to the sprint 14.

3655
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:43,240
Someone said 40.

3656
02:59:43,240 --> 02:59:44,240
Okay, so we're set.

3657
02:59:44,240 --> 02:59:47,440
We have the link
given user has valid credentials

3658
02:59:47,440 --> 02:59:50,520
and is on URL and types of username
and password click so again.

3659
02:59:50,520 --> 02:59:52,440
Okay, this is fine. It makes sense.

3660
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:53,760
So you've got to go.

3661
02:59:53,760 --> 02:59:55,840
40 is good.

3662
02:59:55,840 --> 02:59:59,360
81 Is there anyone else guys? 81

3663
03:00:02,560 --> 03:00:03,560
The link is good.

3664
03:00:03,560 --> 03:00:06,080
You don't need to have the acceptance
criteria here

3665
03:00:08,920 --> 03:00:10,440
when the user never gives sufficient.

3666
03:00:10,440 --> 03:00:14,360
When the user logs,
when the user logs into log in section.

3667
03:00:14,360 --> 03:00:19,200
Remember this is the displaced look,
this is okay.

3668
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:21,280
You don't need to accept this criteria.

3669
03:00:21,280 --> 03:00:24,240
Okay.

3670
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:26,360
Well, it checked the backlog.

3671
03:00:26,400 --> 03:00:27,480
We didn't link it. Well,

3672
03:00:28,840 --> 03:00:29,280
yeah.

3673
03:00:29,680 --> 03:00:35,160
So who's not?

3674
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:39,120
Who's next?

3675
03:00:39,120 --> 03:00:41,240
Yours is displayed, but it's not good.

3676
03:00:41,760 --> 03:00:43,760
Look, Hanoch.

3677
03:00:44,160 --> 03:00:46,280
Oh, you created another one.

3678
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:47,400
Well, you linked it.

3679
03:00:47,400 --> 03:00:50,680
Well now, but you didn't write
the cucumber scenario.

3680
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:52,800
That's the whole point.
You need to read the scenario.

3681
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:57,280
Okay, so who else is.

3682
03:00:57,320 --> 03:01:00,440
Who else do I need to review?
