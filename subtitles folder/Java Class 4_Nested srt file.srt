1
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,240
All right, guys.

2
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,120
Can you guys see me?

3
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,760
All right, guys.

4
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,800
Thank you. Thank you.

5
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,120
I hope you guys can hear me.

6
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,320
I probably won't be able to speak
too loud.

7
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:40,920
Thank you.

8
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,840
Thank you, guys. Loud and clear.

9
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,360
That's good for you. It's good.

10
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,800
Okay, I'm getting better.

11
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm not.

12
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,800
I'm not 100% yet, guys, But

13
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
get in there.

14
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,480
So just have some leftovers
from the COVID now.

15
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,880
So I get the, uh, out of breath easily.

16
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,520
So if I'll be coughing to them. I'm sorry.

17
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,600
All right?

18
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
But I'm very, very,
very happy to see today.

19
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,000
You guys.

20
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,760
Yes, I'm happy to be back myself, Guys.

21
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,120
Yeah. Cool.

22
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,360
It is not a it's not a fun thing.

23
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,320
And I don't wish anybody to get it.

24
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:30,480
So is make sure you guys be careful.

25
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,120
All right, guys.
How how did things been going with you?

26
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:43,960
Tell me how the classes are going.

27
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,640
It's been great.

28
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,320
It's good.

29
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:58,840
You guys been having fun. All

30
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,240
right.

31
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,440
I guess I'm I'm I'm happy to hear.

32
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,120
I hope you guys learn a lot.

33
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,880
Okay?

34
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,520
Okay.

35
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,200
Yeah.

36
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,640
All right. I guess. Yeah, I should.
I should be fine.

37
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,520
I should be fine.

38
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,080
Teachers been.

39
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,960
Meanwhile, guys, five days a week.

40
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,200
Yeah, well, Toys Day
and you guys are going to study

41
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,840
almost every day
to prepare yourself for the market.

42
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,280
And that's good.

43
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,240
That I'm very,
very glad that you guys had fun.

44
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,800
And hopefully
you guys get a lot of practice, right?

45
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,520
So now you guys have a homework,

46
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,280
homework to do also.

47
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,920
And there will be more
and more stuff will be coming right?

48
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,200
So what are we going to do?

49
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Oh, I think I think that's not me moving.

50
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,560
The camera thing is
you guys can shove this screen.

51
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,120
All right.

52
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,560
Yeah, I'll I'll fix my camera a little bit
later, too, because once I start,

53
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,800
maybe after after the break,
I'll try to fix it better.

54
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,960
Okay.

55
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,480
But what we will try to do,
guys, let's do a quick recap

56
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,640
on the things that you learned
on the last class.

57
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:29,640
What did you guys learn last class.

58
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,520
Okay. So you guys were
looking into the typecasting,

59
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,360
functional, nonfunctional

60
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,240
test and you guys were probably looking
in the manual testing with Diego.

61
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
Right. Okay.

62
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,600
What can you guys
tell me about the testing

63
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,040
thing?

64
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,560
Less class, you guys you don't typecast in
in the if condition right.

65
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:58,640
So what
what did you guys learn about casting.

66
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,880
So there is in general
we have two type of casting right

67
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,000
so there is a one we have implicit casting

68
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,120
or the other one
we have explicit casting, right?

69
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,000
But when we talk about casting,
what we say casting casting is converting

70
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,480
one data type
into another data type, right?

71
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

72
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,040
So when we talk about the implicit
casting guys,

73
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:33,560
can you give me
an example of the implicit casting?

74
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Implicit right.

75
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,600
Something happens implicitly.

76
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,080
It means something that happens
automatically, right?

77
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,240
In which cases
we can convert something automatically

78
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,080
when we have something small
converting to a bigger type.

79
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,040
Right?

80
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,400
Doing widening when we have something

81
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,600
something in the small box, it's easy
to transfer to the bigger box, right?

82
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,400
So let's say three months, right?

83
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,480
So when we talk about widening, right,

84
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,640
widening or it's an automatic right.

85
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,280
So when we will take an integer, right.

86
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,480
So for example,
if I'll take an integer, which is ten.

87
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,200
Right.

88
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,320
And I'm going to try to store it
inside the bigger type.

89
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,880
Right.

90
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,000
And then if I'm going to do it and around

91
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
that screen line, right,

92
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,880
if I'm going to try to print
D, what will be my output? This

93
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,040
will be 10.0, right?

94
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
So what do we do?

95
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,560
We took a smaller type
and then we place it inside

96
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,480
a bigger box and that things happen
automatically, right?

97
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,000
So that is so here.

98
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Not no problem.

99
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,040
Right in Y meaning it's actually very,
very popular guys

100
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,120
and widening will be used a lot
once you guys start learning more

101
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,960
about the classes in the objects
at that moment, you guys will experience

102
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,880
more process of the one in
just in this one in me

103
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,720
looking into the primitives right because
right now we do focus on primitives.

104
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,400
So we're looking into the primitive
casting and in about,

105
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,800
I don't know, classes, number 15 or 20,

106
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,600
you guys will start doing the casted
or non primitives

107
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,920
of this process with me.

108
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,160
So it happens automatically.

109
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,360
Right. And Mary Right.

110
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,600
Give me example.

111
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,560
Look, I've been there and this

112
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,200
what is the

113
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,960
purpose of the type question You will look
into the purpose of the typecast, right?

114
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,240
So the type question when it comes
to primitive, it will be beneficial,

115
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,000
especially when we have to work
with a lot of

116
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,320
our automatic operations. Right?

117
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,800
You guys saw that, for example.

118
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,920
Right. Well, what was the issue?

119
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,440
Whenever we were
taking the integers, right?

120
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,040
When we were taking integers and tried
to perform the arithmetic operations.

121
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,760
Right.

122
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,640
So here what will be
your output is what will be

123
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:20,360
the output.

124
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,440
Three. Right.

125
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,000
So here will be the output of three,
Right.

126
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,800
So here we are
losing that reminder, right?

127
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,800
So now whenever we'll be working,

128
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,840
right, whenever we'll be working with the

129
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,080
with those operations,
especially if it comes to the division.

130
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,520
Right.

131
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,440
It's always,
always best approach to use double right.

132
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,440
So there will be conversion
that we will have to do right in.

133
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,160
There's a mentioned more popular you guys
will see a lot of a lot of benefits

134
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,640
when it will be coming to the non
primitive casting think so

135
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,880
when when we talk about the nearing right
nearing or something

136
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,480
that happens explicitly right so narrowing

137
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,520
narrowing is when you try
to put something big into the smaller box.

138
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,280
Right.

139
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,960
So now this process doesn't happen
automatically Y

140
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,880
because there's a potential loss
of the information, right?

141
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,560
Potential loss of the information.

142
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,160
So now Java doesn't want to take
the responsibility right here.

143
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,880
Whenever you work, it means the data
are not going to be responsible

144
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,880
if you lose some data. Right.

145
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,360
So but if you still would like to perform
the narrowing, if you would still

146
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,280
try to perform the explicit crossing,
please take your responsibility and do it.

147
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,680
You're all right.

148
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,200
So and therein is going from the bigger
time to the smaller type, right?

149
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,480
So if you're going to take an integer
right by equals, Right.

150
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,960
So how am I going
to do the conversion? This

151
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:01,920
right.

152
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,240
So to whichever type
I want to convert, right to whichever type

153
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,320
I want to find here and here, for example,
if I'll vote and then.

154
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,920
Right.

155
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,120
So then what I'm going to try
to bring my eye right?

156
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,040
So this way when I'm going to put my own
so what I'm going to get,

157
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,400
what will be my output this, that right.

158
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,840
So what happened in this conversion?

159
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,680
Right. We cut out in the change.

160
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
We don't need to do 99
since we just keep in ten.

161
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,080
Right. Potential loss of the information.

162
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,520
Okay.

163
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,200
So while this process won't be very very

164
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,360
not very useful to our special automation

165
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,520
engine, using this,
we are not not going to use it.

166
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,200
However,
the same thing is a widening this.

167
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,240
Once we start learning about objects
in the classes,

168
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,840
then they are
and will play some role in that process.

169
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,640
But when it comes to the very primitive,
it's a very, very rare use concept.

170
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,920
Even developers
don't really use it, but it is there.

171
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,800
It is big

172
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,800
where you there's no right one in Mary.

173
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,640
Okay, okay.

174
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,880
I guess in last class

175
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,000
you'll start learning about the, uh.

176
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,840
It's stable, right?

177
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
What can you guys tell me about the
if statement

178
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,160
decision making?

179
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,360
Right. Okay.

180
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,080
It's one of the conditional statements

181
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,200
when we going to talk about the
if statement.

182
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,200
Right.

183
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,000
It will run as certain commands based on
when we

184
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,320
when we made the condition right

185
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,200
at first.

186
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Right now we do guys
learn a lot of just printing.

187
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,440
Right.

188
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,880
But eventually there will be
some operation that we will prefer right.

189
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,920
For example the real life example,

190
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,760
when we go to the one,
we will start the automation.

191
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,520
So to do that, what is automation?

192
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,120
We will be automating browsers
because we will be running, executing

193
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,960
our code either on Chrome browser
or we can execute our code,

194
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,000
for example, in Safari browser,
or we can execute it on Firefox, right?

195
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,880
So what we will do,
hey, if the browser is equal to Chrome,

196
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,280
then our code will perform
execution on the composer.

197
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,080
If our browser will be equal to safari,
then our test will be executed

198
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
on this safari. Right.

199
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,320
So based on the condition
there's shown in action will be performed.

200
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:40,960
Right?

201
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,360
So now when we talk

202
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,680
about the eve statement of statement
is one of the conditional statement.

203
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,000
Conditional statement.

204
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
Conditional statement
based on the condition.

205
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
Right. Based on the condition

206
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,840
certain action will be performed.

207
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,240
Right.

208
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,120
And the very first one,
there's a two of them right.

209
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,840
If you guys look at the slides,
there's two of them.

210
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,640
Right.

211
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,440
Conditional statement. Right.

212
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,560
So there's a two types that we have.

213
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,440
The first one that we start looking,
we start looking into the eve statement.

214
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,080
And the second one, once

215
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,320
we learn all the things for these people,
we will start looking into the switch.

216
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,160
The right here we have each statement,

217
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,000
we have a switch statement,
right this statement.

218
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:34,120
So now you guys start looking, you guys
start looking of the eve statement, right?

219
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,640
And there's a different variations
of the eve statement that we have.

220
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,360
Right.

221
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,480
So when we look at the variation
on the eve statement, right.

222
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
We can have a simple eve block.

223
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,040
We can have just simple Eve.

224
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,080
And here
we always have a Boolean condition, right?

225
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,440
Condition. And we say, hey,

226
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,080
if the condition in which case

227
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,560
I will execute this code that's in
which is invalid, let's decode eight,

228
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,040
in which case my code will get executed

229
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,320
only normally right?

230
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,720
Only am only
when my boolean condition is true.

231
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,560
Right only and only
when my bowling condition is right.

232
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,520
So this is your symbol
if statement. Right?

233
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,320
This is your simple state.

234
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,200
So let's take a look an example. Right?

235
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,240
So you guys will tell me.

236
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,760
So for example, right.

237
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,120
Today's Saturday, right?

238
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,800
So let me take a variable

239
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,600
Boolean day.

240
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,400
Let's say

241
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,240
window one.

242
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,000
It's actually
okay, let's look me the integer.

243
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,400
You just

244
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,280
started it, right? The number six.

245
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,600
So now when you say, Hey Eve, there

246
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,440
is equals two, right?

247
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,240
In Bayes equals
50, we're going to see that out.

248
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:06,680
Today is Saturday right?

249
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,560
Day is

250
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,360
right.

251
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,320
All right.

252
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,160
So first of all, this
do I have any issues in my code

253
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,800
right now?

254
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,160
Okay.

255
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,320
So what's the difference
between one equal and double

256
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,080
equal

257
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,000
one equals sign?

258
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,080
We are talking about this
assigning right in double equals sign.

259
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,520
We talking about check in their equality.

260
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,360
Right.

261
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,360
So here, if you're going to keep only one
equal sign

262
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,000
and you have a will complete
Java will complain why?

263
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,560
Because for the eve statement, Java always
always looks for the boolean expression.

264
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:56,840
Right?

265
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,400
So now

266
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,600
all day is equals to six.

267
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,160
Right.

268
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,240
Okay, so tell me this in my line
25 is going to get executed.

269
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,560
Yes or no?

270
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,760
When to get it, you get it right. Why?

271
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,200
Because a certain condition
is true, right?

272
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,640
So now if I'm going to change it to seven,
am I going to see the output?

273
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,400
No. Right. So now what are we doing?

274
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,920
Our if statement is
a conditional statement

275
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,440
with the help of the statement
we are doing is select execution.

276
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,000
Right.

277
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,440
So all only know if condition is true,
then the story will execute.

278
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Otherwise it won't execute. Right.

279
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,880
Then you said, Hey, if statement

280
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,960
right
if statement can have else flow right,

281
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,800
it can happen otherwise blah right.

282
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,760
They'll say hey is this is condition
is to execute this could otherwise

283
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,520
right
otherwise execute this right otherwise

284
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,840
let me ask you this

285
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,280
is the ls block
is it must or it's an optional

286
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,040
block.

287
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,080
It's very optional, right.

288
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,480
If we want to provide otherwise condition,
then we'll go for a else.

289
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,920
If they don't want to provide

290
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,200
that otherwise condition,
we don't have to specify.

291
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,840
Right?

292
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,880
We don't have to specify
in the other variation.

293
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,400
Right. You guys, last last time.

294
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,000
Look, what is the other variation of your
if statement?

295
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,040
What can we have This

296
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,640
the other variation.

297
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,680
Right. What do we can, huh?

298
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,600
We can have right.

299
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,800
We can have it work, right.

300
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,800
We can have this as having ls
we can have ls eve.

301
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,320
And for reals it's the same thing.

302
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,520
We will specify
some boolean condition right.

303
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,040
And then here
we can have the ls part right.

304
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,080
And here or

305
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,240
right.

306
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,920
We will go in here. Right.

307
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,640
So in here we're testing.

308
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
Hey, there is a different ways, right?

309
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
We are providing differential condition.

310
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,800
Hey, what if this could be true?

311
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,960
Or this could be true or something
else could be true, right?

312
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,360
Otherwise, if none of the condition
are true, then go look for that else.

313
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,840
BLOCK Right.

314
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:43,840
So how many blocks can we have this?

315
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,480
We can have as many as we need, right?

316
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,800
As many as we require, right?

317
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,160
Based on the based on the action.

318
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,400
Right. Based on the action.

319
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,680
For example, you guys did an example when
you have to compare two numbers, right?

320
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,960
So what is that?

321
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,160
How many how many options we have
when we have to compare

322
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,600
two numbers, two or three

323
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,480
or unlimited, when you have to define,

324
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,720
well, what do you have
when you compare it to numbers? Right.

325
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,720
So first you check number
one can be larger than number two, right?

326
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,200
Then number two
can be larger than the number one.

327
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,840
Or if none of the conditions is true,

328
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,320
then numbers are equal, right?

329
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,640
The numbers are equal.

330
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
So we will check for two true condition.

331
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,600
And if none of the conditions will be
match, we will go for that otherwise.

332
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,320
Right. So here is a three options.

333
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,280
We are needed, but do we have more
or can we have more?

334
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,800
Right.

335
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,680
When you get zero example with days,
how many days are there?

336
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,040
There's a seven days. Are they right?

337
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,520
So then it means you can have

338
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,240
seven times you can provide your else
if else if condition y

339
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,240
because seven times
you can have a true condition right.

340
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,280
And did you guys have any questions
for your

341
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,600
homework. It

342
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,440
was good, right?

343
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
I think it was good. Or was that easy?

344
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,800
So you guys also I saw
you guys were sharing it in your channel,

345
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,440
which is pretty,
pretty good. Oh, that's good, right?

346
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,400
So what was your condition in here, guys?

347
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,760
To check whether the number is positive
or negative?

348
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:39,120
What was the condition?

349
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,920
If it's greater than zero
or less than zero?

350
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,000
Right.
Then the number was positive and negative.

351
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:57,920
And what was the condition in here?

352
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,240
You guys use your modulus
operator, write modulus operator.

353
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,320
Hey, if I'm going to divide in number
using the numbers equal

354
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,320
to divisible by two without any reminder
that the number is even

355
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,960
if not, this is right.

356
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,440
And the last thing I want to see right.

357
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,000
Did you guys do

358
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,840
try to

359
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,440
write your if statement
without the braces?

360
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,880
Did you guys look at that option.

361
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,360
Okay.

362
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,400
So let's do a quick recap and here

363
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,400
we'll do class four right.

364
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,600
The samples

365
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,160
and the lab test

366
00:25:45,160 --> 00:26:03,840
so that.

367
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,280
Okay.

368
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,560
And I'm sure by now
you guys are on the shortcuts, right?

369
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,520
You guys knowing the shortcuts
for your print statement.

370
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:26,000
And did you guys learn this shortcut
for the main method?

371
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,280
Yes. No. No. Yes. All right. Right.

372
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,680
So there's something that we call our
to complete this.

373
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,560
Okay, So there's our complete. Right.

374
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,120
So what is our complete? Our complete.

375
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,960
This is something that is going
to complete your

376
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,760
statement.

377
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,040
Write something
that is going to complete your statement.

378
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,000
So we will be using the letter
of the our completes later out to

379
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:52,720
complete.

380
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,400
Right.

381
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,120
So the way you guys did your print out,
right, what you did,

382
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,200
you did this all and then you did
the control plus space, right.

383
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,840
Central request space.

384
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,120
So when you do control space,
your space out was our completed write it.

385
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,200
Fill up your print statement.

386
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,320
So the same thing for the main method.
Right.

387
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,960
For example now if you forgot your main
method instead of the type in it fool

388
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,600
what you guys can do, you can just type me
and then do the same thing.

389
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,800
Control less space, right?

390
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,960
So control space types.

391
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,120
You worry, we'll do it.

392
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,920
Will our complete your main statement?

393
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,160
I do mean and then control space
and it gives you a suggestion.

394
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,680
I think. Use your suggestion.

395
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,480
You'll just hit enter and if our completes

396
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,400
now you would know how to bring your main

397
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,280
page and the floor
you will have to hit enter.

398
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,720
All right.

399
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,960
And there's the same for Mac users
and for Windows users.

400
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,880
Okay, So this is the things that you guys
were looking at, right?

401
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,960
Let me copy from here

402
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,240
my statements right

403
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,280
away.

404
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,120
Like all

405
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,160
the simple statement,
hey, that is equals to six.

406
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,720
Then we all execute
this block of code, right?

407
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,320
So now you guys will see that
with the help of the curly braces

408
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,880
we are then define the block of code.

409
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,520
BLOCK of code that belongs to your
if condition

410
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,160
block of code that belongs to my main
method.

411
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,080
BLOCK of code that belongs to my class.

412
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,680
Right.

413
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,240
So here.

414
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,840
Hey whenever condition is true, right?

415
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,360
So now I'm opening the block of code.

416
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,320
If the condition will be true,
if I'm going to get a green line,

417
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,520
then I'm able to enter this block of code.

418
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,200
Right?

419
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,120
And then we have the other,
which means we can have the other one

420
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,200
and let's do the same.

421
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:21,000
So today is inside right?

422
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,240
And then based on the condition. Right.

423
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,640
Based on the condition,
one statement will be executed.

424
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,080
Right.

425
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,480
Because the condition is true.

426
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,760
Of course, the code from the from

427
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,600
the block gets executed
whenever the condition will be false.

428
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,960
The code from the else
block is going to get executed.

429
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,560
Right.

430
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,560
Mine didn't work.

431
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:55,880
Or what exactly did not work for

432
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
the are complete

433
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,320
or the shortcut.

434
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,680
So let me just quickly get it out
then I'll bring it back, guys.

435
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,280
So you'll just that main
and then the potential space

436
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,880
and it should are a complete right

437
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,440
let me ask you guys is you'll side works

438
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,520
where I am and who are marked

439
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,720
if you
if you start out or completes then also

440
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,080
okay if you guys some of you who are not

441
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,880
able are complete and most likely you guys
using Mac systems.

442
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,600
Right.

443
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,200
So there's a
you have to change your settings.

444
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,240
There is a preferences.

445
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,040
Myriam,
you have Windows, then it should work.

446
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,080
This does usually happen
only when you guys have Mac it.

447
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
Yeah. Try it again, ma'am. Try it again.

448
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,640
Just do this or main
and then control space

449
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,000
and just keep center, keep.

450
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So let me see this if I'm going to add
more statement in years.

451
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,040
So let's say we are having

452
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,040
we are having

453
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Java.

454
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,320
What I have in general

455
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,400
and let me change it to sex right.

456
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,360
So how many print statements am I going
to see goes how many print statements

457
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,640
from which line from which line

458
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:36,960
you wanted and line in length, Right.

459
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,640
Line ten and line 11. Why?

460
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,240
Because whenever the condition becomes
true, right?

461
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:48,000
Whenever the condition becomes true,
and once you enter the block.

462
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,280
Right.

463
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,080
Once we enter in the eve block,
all the statements,

464
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,000
all the statements inside that you block
will be executed up to the bottom.

465
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,360
They will be executed.

466
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,880
But when only and only
when that condition is true, right?

467
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,200
When the condition is warped.

468
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,760
So now this.

469
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,680
Your currently braces identifies
the block, right?

470
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,880
It identifies that these two statements

471
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,320
belong to you if block Right.

472
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,680
So some sometimes somewhere maybe

473
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,840
what you guys saw
you guys or something like that.

474
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,720
Let me do another exact the same example
what without the curly braces

475
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,080
I saw the same thing.

476
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,040
I'll say if they right

477
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,720
equals equals to six,

478
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,440
then I'm just going to.

479
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,320
Oops, sorry, let me see this.

480
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,600
I will remove this box.

481
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,080
Right.

482
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,600
So now when we look into my code, right

483
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,440
When you look into my code,
Joe is fine, right?

484
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,240
Joe is fine. So it's not complaining.

485
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,720
So it means my syntax is correct
right now.

486
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,760
I can either have my curly braces
or I don't have to have.

487
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,760
Now let's see what will be the issue.

488
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,720
This let me just put
I'll use only one statement.

489
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,840
I'll use only one print out statement.

490
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,040
Today is Saturday, right?

491
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:30,080
Then we more
or more interested in this part.

492
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,840
So now when we look into it, right.

493
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,080
What what, what is it?

494
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,360
Gives me the right output.

495
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,040
Right?

496
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,520
Hey, if these equals two six,
it tells me it's bound to be.

497
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,840
And here I'll have a second statement,
but I will add a layer again.

498
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,280
Here it's execute.

499
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
No problem.

500
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,080
No problem. It executes.

501
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:55,560
But where the issue will come this
Now if I'm going to remove my comment

502
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,880
and now in here, I want to say,
hey, there's a two statements

503
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,640
belong to my eve block and here

504
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,520
I want to say that also two statements
belong to my eve block.

505
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,200
So now

506
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,520
maybe now you know what?

507
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,680
Okay, well, now it looks the same way.

508
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,960
Now it looks the same, right?

509
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,840
Okay.

510
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,960
Here it shows me today's Saturday
and we are having Java clause here.

511
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,920
It's also says to the Saturday
we are having the Java class.

512
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,440
No difference. Right.

513
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,080
But there's actually differences.

514
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,840
So let me change it to seven

515
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,360
and we can move to seven days.

516
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,160
So now let me ask you guys

517
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,760
if this equals to seven, which output

518
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,120
should I see?

519
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,000
I should see the else, right.

520
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,440
I should see the export.

521
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,360
And there's no way there's no way

522
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,000
I should see this line
or there is no way I should see this line.

523
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,360
Right.

524
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,680
I will add the statement in here,
but I want you to look at the output.

525
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,600
So now when I'm going to run in here,
when I'm going to run in here.

526
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,000
So this statement, because
I have curly braces in here, right?

527
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,600
I am.

528
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,760
You find that these lines belong to the
if statement.

529
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,120
These lines
belong to the statement in here.

530
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,280
Even if I'm going to,
I'm going to add else.

531
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,840
But what happens
this statement is getting executed

532
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,920
as in I think that I added for if part

533
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,600
but what happens this
what happens without your braces.

534
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,920
Without the braces, if statement

535
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,000
can able to execute

536
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,800
only one line, only one line.

537
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,600
So now if I'm going to format my code
right, if I'm going to format my code.

538
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,880
So now where I don't have a is

539
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,240
my Java things, okay,
they don't have the braces.

540
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,000
This statement belongs to the eve block.

541
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,160
However, this statement
does not belong to the eve block.

542
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,600
So if you
if there is a two or more statements,

543
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,440
you have to specify inside
if what you always,

544
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,520
always have to make sure you have,
you currently braces this.

545
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,040
If you're not going to have

546
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,840
a curly braces, you might start
having some issues in your code.

547
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,680
Let me add the else part in here goes

548
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,320
of the year.

549
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,080
Right?

550
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,800
And now it's of course
is going to complain to me for a l'espoir

551
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,760
because it takes time.

552
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,520
That's what it stands for.

553
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,800
Okay, let me know.

554
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,760
This is

555
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,520
one moment.

556
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,960
All right?

557
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:11,160
Not once.

558
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,720
Let me underline this statement in here,

559
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:23,720
because it's used

560
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,200
all the way.

561
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,280
And let me add one more statement. Yes.

562
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:34,200
I want to add this line
that I want to be outside of my

563
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,720
if statement right system that out.

564
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,640
All I want to say in of course and

565
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
of course what

566
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,640
let me

567
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,360
now let's let's do it again this right

568
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,640
so these seven condition will be false.

569
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,240
One condition is false.

570
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,760
I cannot go inside my eve statement
where I will end that I'm going,

571
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,080
I will end that I'm going to my else block
right inside my work.

572
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,880
I have two statements, right?

573
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,280
So this statement will execute
and this statement will indicate, right.

574
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,120
Why? Because I have my curly braces in

575
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,320
When it comes of

576
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,040
having Eve without the curly braces,
what happens?

577
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,560
Your Java is not going to complain
of your syntax.

578
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,680
Syntax.

579
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,200
It means your if statement is allowed
to be without the currently braces.

580
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,600
But when you don't have a curly braces,
your your java will assume

581
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,240
or this statement belongs to the eve.

582
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,200
This statement belongs to the else.

583
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,480
This statement is not belong
to the else blog.

584
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,440
This statement will be treated as
a regular code without the curly braces.

585
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,520
Java is able to read only one
line of code, only one layer of statement.

586
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,640
It will think, okay,
this belongs to the eve.

587
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,200
This will belong to the.

588
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,120
That's right.

589
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,480
So now let's take a look at this. Right.

590
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,000
So today's day seven.

591
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,400
I should have this output

592
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,120
and I should, of course,
is going to treat it as a11 moment. This

593
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,680
full brain

594
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,400
function.

595
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,840
Let me do six now again.

596
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,640
Let me do six.

597
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,520
Let me leave this statement
because I want to show you this.

598
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,760
Let me it's up to me. Right.

599
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,160
So this number six. Right.

600
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,320
I will see this output and nothing else

601
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,640
right now when I'm going to execute,
this is what we're going to see.

602
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:07,120
This.

603
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,880
So these number six condition was true.

604
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,800
One condition was true.

605
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,040
I was given the green light. Right.

606
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,160
I executed the line number
ten and my LS blog are ignored.

607
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,080
Right.

608
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,800
Then we have in
this line that comes from the line

609
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,920
17 and then the next eve statement, right?

610
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,000
It says, Hey, if these equals to sixth

611
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,040
condition is true,
I'm executing this statement now.

612
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,640
I thought. I thought that this two lines

613
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,280
belongs to the last block,
but that's what I thought.

614
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,640
But Java can read only one statement
that will belong to the else.

615
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,840
Or if so, now you're always executed
today, Saturday.

616
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,400
But then it thought that this belongs
to the else float.

617
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,160
If block

618
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,160
and it

619
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,240
showed
that this line belongs to the last block

620
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,200
and that this line

621
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,720
does not belong to any block of code.

622
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,200
It told that it belongs
to the entire main method.

623
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,720
And that's why what happened
it did executed this line.

624
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,160
Right? They did execute in itself.

625
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,640
So this is what happens.

626
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,120
That's when we don't have a script.

627
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,320
So that's why I always, always say, guys,
most most preferable way,

628
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,040
regardless of how many statements
you will put inside where they will

629
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,960
could one statement or two statements
always, always use curly braces right.

630
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,680
So this way
you are not going to get confused

631
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,520
and this way you are not going to have
any logical issues or logical errors

632
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,800
in your code because when you look
and do syntax wise, it looks fine, right?

633
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,360
Syntax wise you look fine.

634
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,240
But when you execute,
you will start wondering, Hey,

635
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,720
why this code got executed?

636
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,560
Because I thought
it belongs to the ls Black.

637
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,800
Not that's what you're told by Java
because you did not specify the curly

638
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,480
braces.

639
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,600
Now, Java told that only this statement
belongs to the LS black

640
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,720
as it makes sense.

641
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,880
Based. Is

642
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,400
there any other use in the done basis?

643
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,720
I you just so where are you?

644
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,560
Guys will see some ties when you guys
are given assignments, right?

645
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,560
Maybe that's what you guys are going
to see later after you guys graduated.

646
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,520
Then you start going on the market, right?

647
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,680
Sometimes you guys will be
given some assignments to do so.

648
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,280
This way you don't get confused.

649
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,880
Okay.

650
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,800
Why did they give me the code
that don't have any braces?

651
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,600
These there is a possibility.

652
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,760
Yes, there's a possibility
that you can have it.

653
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,160
But we always, always,
always preferred to use curly braces.

654
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,160
So this way you easily can see

655
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,960
where your block of foot starts
and where you block of good.

656
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,000
It's just

657
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:04,680
you just

658
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,160
not you just have to finish your
all your statements

659
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,160
and what happens does you again
when you try to format your code, right.

660
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,360
When you go and try to format your code,
you guys see when you formatted your code,

661
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,480
you add Java tells you, okay, you know
what, this is belongs to the board

662
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,960
and this is it already treated

663
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,320
as a part
that should belong outside of that your

664
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,160
if okay, when it was printed

665
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,760
in 1922 it

666
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,080
no they are printed

667
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,160
Catalina
Yes that's, that's what I'm explaining.

668
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,840
Right.

669
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,080
So because you did not specify
your curly braces,

670
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,960
that's why Java code that this statement

671
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,000
Java two that this statement

672
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,240
does not belong to the eve block

673
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,760
it it treats this statement
as an independent. Yep.

674
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,800
All in all,

675
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,640
if you go into adding curly braces,
then your code will be written properly.

676
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,240
Right? Then. Then then your java,

677
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,000
your java.

678
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,160
Read the code properly.

679
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:18,000
Otherwise it treats only this statement
that belongs to the elsewhere

680
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,040
and they treated us.

681
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,320
Only this statement belongs to the
if BLOCK okay. Yep.

682
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,880
So no matter,
you can have ten lines of code, right?

683
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:33,000
Let me do another example.

684
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:41,200
You know who

685
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,840
we would say?

686
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,600
For example, let's take a variable, right?

687
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,880
Blue marble

688
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,440
underneath and we will say, yes,

689
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,760
it is sunny right now.

690
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,280
You want to say,
here is it's sunny, right?

691
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,480
If it's sunny, no.

692
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,440
And for example,
you forgot to add your curly braces.

693
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,400
What you want to add multiple statements

694
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,840
is only weather, right?

695
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,240
So let me add three statements.

696
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,360
All I will go

697
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,640
or look

698
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:36,920
here.

699
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,240
Let's it all right

700
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,400
so I enjoyed

701
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,760
right.

702
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:51,000
So if you want to have a breezy Sprite,
if you to have a braces,

703
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,160
if you want to have them right
when the condition is true those are three

704
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,360
statements will get executed
when the condition will be false.

705
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,040
How many of our quotes
say are you going to see this?

706
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,840
How many outputs

707
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,360
if the condition

708
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,360
is false?

709
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,480
Zero zero. Why?

710
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,200
Because condition was false.

711
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,320
Entire block got ignored right by well,

712
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,280
what happens if you go to reboot?

713
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,480
If you're going to remove
your curly braces,

714
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,480
what's going to happen to statements
will get executed.

715
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,000
Why Java thing is okay,
this statement belongs to the eve.

716
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,480
This statement don't belong to the right.

717
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,880
So because this was false, now

718
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,080
I'm ignoring this block
because it belongs to the eve.

719
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,080
But there is.

720
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,200
I'm exactly right. There is something.

721
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,840
So now you can have ten lines of code
inside

722
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:59,320
by Java will treat it only only one.

723
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,200
Okay, I hope that makes sense.

724
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,360
And when I was going to try
to out of format

725
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,240
you could right whenever you want to do
come on shift or control shift F

726
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:15,120
your ID will help you to format
and this way you can like will see.

727
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,240
Okay, this is where your e block starts.

728
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,760
This is where it ends.

729
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,480
And this is outside, right?

730
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:28,760
That's why I always tell you guys, always,
always try to format your code.

731
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,440
All right.

732
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,000
So that's
if you going to have it with no braces.

733
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,760
But once again, this is 99%,
99% of the time

734
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:46,560
we are going to write our curly braces.

735
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,720
If you don't put the best condition

736
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,760
or. Yeah,
as of now, we don't have the l support.

737
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,240
These statements will be treated
as independent statements

738
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,560
outside of the
you block or outside of the cuts.

739
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,560
Right.

740
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,960
That's how

741
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,080
it is.

742
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,680
All right, guys, Any questions?

743
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,360
Any questions

744
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,960
or. I hope it's good.

745
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,480
I hope it's good.

746
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:28,840
Okay.

747
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,880
So today that was the recap
a little bit longer recap, right.

748
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,000
So but today, the topic is mostly
it will be a lot of a lot of practice.

749
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,160
So what we will do today, guys,
we will look into the nested E right.

750
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,480
But make sure you guys I hope you guys
all clear with the E Right.

751
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,560
That's all clear is that if statements you
know the variations of the state right.

752
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,560
So now there's another thing
that a week and a half in Java.

753
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,120
Nicole something nested.

754
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,240
E What is nested?

755
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,000
Eagle What then this E

756
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,520
Right.

757
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,840
So if statement it's

758
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,280
Eve inside another eve, right?

759
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,400
It's Eve inside the eve.

760
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,360
And as you guys saw, the variation of the
eve statement can be different, right?

761
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,680
We can have Eve, we can have Eve else
we can have Eve else Eve.

762
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,400
Right.

763
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,440
So are we talking about
any of this variation?

764
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,200
Can half inside another eve state.

765
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:40,560
Right.

766
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,080
So first
we will look into very simple, right.

767
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,200
So within what is in this book,
if ness that eve

768
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,840
when we have eve condition right

769
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,720
blooming condition in here

770
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,440
and now inside this

771
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,200
if we are going to have another eve

772
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,200
block of current year will be

773
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,680
when we can have some coding here right.

774
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,160
Right.

775
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:22,920
So what is nest
that eve nest of Eve is Eve

776
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,120
that we use inside another Eve.

777
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,840
Right.

778
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,080
So this Eve we call that this is our
our eve

779
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,040
eve and we all it isn't our either.

780
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,040
The okay

781
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,440
so first

782
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,360
the way it works, right,

783
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,800
the way works once
you have your condition, right?

784
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,880
So once you have your condition. Right.

785
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,480
And we know
when do I enter my eve statement?

786
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,800
I enter my eve statement only.

787
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,760
Only when condition becomes true.

788
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,720
When condition becomes true,
I am able to enter this block of code

789
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,320
that starts from here,
and it ends all the way in here right now.

790
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:18,480
Once the condition is true,
I am allowed to enter this block of code.

791
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,880
So now when I enter this block of court,
I see this line,

792
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
I see this line and this line. Right.

793
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,640
So first I will execute this code.

794
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,200
But as soon as I enter inside

795
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,440
what I'm seen, I'm
seeing another Eve statement, Right?

796
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,080
And we know how our statement executed our

797
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,040
if statement is executed
based on the true condition.

798
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,240
Based on the true condition.

799
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,160
Right.

800
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,200
So for now, all we said,
guys, that our nest that if it's

801
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,600
eve inside another if right

802
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,600
so now in which case

803
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,080
would you want to place in new inside

804
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,840
another eve

805
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,720
usually right.

806
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,480
Usually When do we go for nesting,

807
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,840
When do we go for nesting.

808
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,040
So for example,
let's think of the realized

809
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,120
scenario realized in that right

810
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,440
so nest that if

811
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,840
works it's like a check boxes.

812
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,200
Our first condition have to be pass

813
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,280
before you going to get a chance
for a second condition

814
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,080
or That's right when you go for a doctor
right when you go for a doctor

815
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,080
in doctor will ask you hey,
do you have any medication?

816
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,720
Right. Do you take any medication?

817
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,200
Now you have to answer Yes.

818
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,080
Right.

819
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,800
If you answer yes, only

820
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,800
then I'm going to do the further check.

821
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,520
Only then I'm going to ask.

822
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,040
Okay.

823
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,080
Tell me,
what kind of medication do you take?

824
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,560
But let me ask you guys,
am I going to ask you

825
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:13,600
if you're taking any medication,
if you want to answer to me, no.

826
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,120
No, you're not. Right. So what happened?

827
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,840
Our first checkpoint needed to be passed,
right?

828
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,200
Do you take any medication?

829
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,320
Yes, I do take any medication.

830
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,400
Okay. Now condition becomes true.

831
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,360
Now, let me take our duty.

832
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,960
Do you take any allergy medication right.

833
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,400
Or do you take any other things? Only.

834
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,040
And the only one?

835
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,680
My first checkpoint pass.

836
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,960
Then I'm going to ask. Right.

837
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,760
For example, if I'm going to ask, hey,
did you guys have COVID?

838
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:44,680
Right?

839
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,760
So now, for example, I'm going to say yes

840
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,000
and only in if I'm going to say yes, then
you guys will ask Me okay, how was it?

841
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,960
Right.

842
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,080
But if I'm going to tell, you know,
I never heard a cataclysmic

843
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,640
you guys not going to ask me
any further questions.

844
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,760
So what happens?

845
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,320
My first checkpoint has to be passed.

846
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:12,920
And only and only then I'm going
to check a second checkpoint.

847
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,000
Right? It's like first checkpoint pass.

848
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
If the first pass, then
I'm going to check the second one.

849
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,640
And can I have multiple checkpoints?

850
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,160
Of course
we can have multiple checkpoints, Right.

851
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,040
So like I'm an example

852
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:32,240
this how are we going to have a class

853
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,960
like you name it?

854
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,960
Is this the right to be?

855
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,200
Instead, if

856
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,720
you see me

857
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,240
again,

858
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,840
for example, let's talk about I don't know

859
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,000
this Daisy this days, right.

860
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,680
Very, very hot topic.

861
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,040
Give example this class, for example.

862
00:54:59,240 --> 00:54:59,440
Right.

863
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,840
Let's talk about the
I don't know, vaccine.

864
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,600
Right.

865
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,920
So now I'm going to ask you, hey,
do you guys have a vaccine?

866
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,760
Right. And this is just an example.

867
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,640
There's I'm not I'm not asking you
whether you have it.

868
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,680
That's your personal choice, right?

869
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,880
So now if you go going, you tell me, Yes,
I have my vaccine.

870
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,080
Now, I'm going to ask,
did you get a second dose?

871
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,280
Do you have both doses right.

872
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,560
And then based on that, I make a decision.

873
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,360
But if you're going to tell me
that you did not take a vaccine,

874
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,280
I'm not going to ask you
how many doses you take.

875
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:33,760
Right.

876
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,240
So only normally or I'm going to ask
what kind they go.

877
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,520
Right.

878
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,720
That's actually like what option.

879
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,360
Let's pick out two variables, right.

880
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,560
So let me take a Boolean vaccine.

881
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,920
Right?

882
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,400
Boom. Next. Right.

883
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,240
And for example,

884
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,840
let's let's put a true well look into
different, different options.

885
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,520
Right? So Boolean mixing true.

886
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,080
And I don't know,
let's say a dose, for example, integer

887
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,040
dose equals
2 to 1 dose, for example, right?

888
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,800
Yes. An example. Right, Right.

889
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,200
All right.

890
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,160
So the way we're going to have so firstly,
once you have E, right.

891
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,440
So now I'm going to say, hey,

892
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,440
if you have a Z, right,

893
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,840
if you have a like stain, right.

894
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:34,120
All you only if you have a vaccine
only then I can ask you.

895
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:39,400
So how many,

896
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,840
how many do this?

897
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,960
Obviously only people, right.

898
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,680
For example. Right.

899
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,120
So now

900
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,440
looking at this simple, right, am I going
to see the output of the line 13?

901
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,280
Yes or no? This

902
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,040
Yes. Y
Because the condition is true, right?

903
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,560
Because the condition is true.

904
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,120
So now y line 13, they're executing
now all we know only one.

905
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,160
My condition is true.

906
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,080
Now I can take another condition, right?

907
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,840
If those equals two

908
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,040
equals two one, for example. Right.

909
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:25,560
If those equals one,
then everyone intercedes is all I.

910
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,560
Or when are you taking your second grade.

911
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,960
Something like that.

912
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,520
What are you taking your

913
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,840
place. Right.

914
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,680
Something like this. Right.

915
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,080
So now what do we have?

916
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,280
We have Eve inside another IEF, Right.

917
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,160
So what do we did?

918
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,840
We took one if statement and nested inside
another statement.

919
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,560
Right.

920
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:58,680
So now this is statement,
the one that is outside we call it

921
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,680
It's our eve.

922
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,080
And this eve statement we call it

923
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,000
It's our nested eve, right?

924
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,040
Which means when we do, we want to nest

925
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,520
when you want to

926
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,560
do this further check all we know

927
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:23,800
only if our first check point has volume
only if our first condition will be true.

928
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,360
Only then I'm going to do the
for the chip.

929
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,200
Right.

930
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,240
So now let's

931
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,520
let's analyze it.

932
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,440
Okay. Right.

933
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:47,880
So I always code

934
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,920
inside the main method executes
that put the bottom until it c

935
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,600
any for now it sees if statement right.

936
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,240
Hey is the condition is true.

937
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,720
Yes condition is true.

938
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:05,440
When the condition truth
given a green light,

939
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:08,400
I can enter my e block

940
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,960
telling me guys
where my where my are in block

941
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,720
ns Can you guys tell me
it starts in here, right?

942
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,560
This is my opening.
Curly brace is where it ends.

943
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:25,960
On which line?

944
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,280
17 or 19. My R is 19.

945
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,040
That's where it starts, right?

946
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,520
You guys see even the alignment,
it starts from here.

947
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,040
It ends in here. Right?

948
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,680
So now when my first check

949
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,680
point pass enter an inside.

950
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,400
So now am I insecure in line 13 days?

951
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Am I executing line 13?

952
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,880
Yes, I am executing.

953
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,440
I am executing my line 13 y
because I got my green line.

954
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,000
Now I'm seeing the line that there's
no condition, I'm just going to print it.

955
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,280
Then your code goes up to the bottom.

956
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,400
Now what it sees,
it sees another if statement, right?

957
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,560
When I see if statement, okay.

958
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,120
In order for me to go inside,
I have to check the condition.

959
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,640
What?

960
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,960
When I was able to go inside.

961
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,800
All in only because my first two point
has passed right now.

962
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,120
Check.

963
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:23,400
Hey, if those equals two, one
is the condition for this

964
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,920
condition is true.

965
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,200
That same thing.
Now my condition has passed.

966
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,440
I'm able to enter my list of E

967
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:38,640
that starts from here and ends in me.

968
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,240
So in this case,
what I'm going to get, I'm going to get

969
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,040
how many those is how you take in
when you take in your second.

970
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,760
Now let me change it to false this.

971
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,320
Well, what will be the

972
01:00:52,320 --> 01:01:02,640
output on my program?

973
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,680
Why no execution? My notes.

974
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,920
I specified those equals to one.

975
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,480
This is true. Y y y y.

976
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,400
There is no output

977
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,240
it will skip.

978
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:21,800
Right.

979
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,760
So now

980
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,000
this is condition is being nested.

981
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,320
It's being nested inside.

982
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,400
This is statement before

983
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,280
before I can check this condition.

984
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,400
First I have to verify this condition.

985
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,720
Right? First I have to verify.

986
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:45,360
So now in this case, condition is false.

987
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,360
One condition is false.

988
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,120
I'm given the red light.

989
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,400
I cannot enter this block of code.

990
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:55,400
So it means I cannot enter a block of code
that starts from here.

991
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,600
It ends in here.

992
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,800
So this entire statement will be ignored.

993
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,560
Right?

994
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,440
So they go ahead and this is the right
this is the right conclusion.

995
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,160
Your nested if guys units that if always

996
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,400
always has a dependency on you are if

997
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,280
you're in there if

998
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,480
will get a chance for two for execution

999
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,880
only if the are if condition will be true.

1000
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:28,440
If the other condition is false
you're either

1001
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,720
eve will never ever be executed.

1002
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,320
Right.

1003
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,080
So this small if the one that we nested

1004
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,200
always always depend on our piece.

1005
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,400
Well, all right.

1006
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,440
So right now I'm going to have false
no execution at all.

1007
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,400
Right. Okay.
Now let's let's do what I like to do.

1008
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,960
Different variations,
because here we will have to

1009
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,960
let me have two.

1010
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:02,600
So how many outputs am I going to see?

1011
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:10,040
One, Which line is

1012
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,880
30? Right.

1013
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,640
So, hey, if is the condition is true.

1014
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,240
Yes, condition is true. Condition
it's true.

1015
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,120
I am allowed to go inside the eve block.

1016
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,640
My our eve starts from here
and it ends in here.

1017
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,480
Right.

1018
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,440
So as soon as I enter my eve

1019
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,280
block, I'm seeing this C
So do I have any condition to execute?

1020
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,400
This is out? No.

1021
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,920
Okay, I'm just going to execute it Now.

1022
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,120
Your Java runs into the another eve.

1023
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,560
Oh, now the nested. Okay, cool.

1024
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,760
Now when your Java sees if statement,
it's always have to check the condition.

1025
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,720
Hey is that those equals two one note.

1026
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,200
Those equals two two.

1027
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,080
All right then.
I did not get a green light.

1028
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:03,840
So this statement
will be ignored is even more

1029
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,360
general.

1030
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,280
This is our just our variation, right

1031
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:13,520
e e inside

1032
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,960
another x can win this, if else.

1033
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,480
Yes, we can. Right.

1034
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,400
There is a three variation
that you guys saw of the eve statement.

1035
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,520
You can have just simple eve block
you statement can have Eve ls blank.

1036
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,400
Your Eve statement can have Eve
ls Eve Lux right.

1037
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,360
Can I have another ls requires
looking of another bills.

1038
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:35,760
Okay.

1039
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,120
So if if does equals to one,
where are you taking your second dose?

1040
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,120
Otherwise.

1041
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,960
Otherwise we'll just say
you are fully vaccinated. This

1042
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:56,200
your only looks

1043
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:59,840
and you see.

1044
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,040
Okay. Alexander, can you.

1045
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:07,840
Can you please do fix your alignment
and your both conditions are true.

1046
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:13,320
That's why you see in two outputs. Yep.

1047
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,200
You Alexander,
you both condition up? Sure. Okay.

1048
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,120
All right.

1049
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,560
Let me ask you guys in this situation,
which lines are

1050
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:38,920
my going to see is an output?

1051
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,240
I added one more statement.

1052
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:45,840
Yes, I added my LS part as well.

1053
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,480
30 minutes right there. Terminated.

1054
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,360
Hey, it's the vaccine condition is true.

1055
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,320
I can go inside, right?

1056
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,400
Always. Always.

1057
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,440
Pay attention, guys, Where you are.

1058
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,640
It starts.

1059
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,080
It starts from here.

1060
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,920
It ends all the way in here.

1061
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:05,520
And because we are using it, these guys
just put your one under the after

1062
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:10,920
the currently basis and just double with
you will tell you entire block of split.

1063
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,760
So this way you see
what belongs to the are is this way

1064
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,000
you will see what belongs to the inner
right

1065
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,040
So in this case, this condition is true.

1066
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,440
So line 13 will get executed.

1067
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,320
This condition will be false.

1068
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:34,120
So we know when the condition is false,
we will go to the else work.

1069
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:34,400
Right.

1070
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,760
But how many have you taken?

1071
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:38,360
You go.

1072
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,440
There was two.

1073
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,560
You are fully right.

1074
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:46,600
It's And if I'm taking it to false right.

1075
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,880
How many equals this

1076
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,520
you are fully vaccinated.

1077
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:04,760
Will will my else blunder executed. Why?

1078
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,480
Why them?

1079
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,240
Why My block is not getting executed This

1080
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,000
let me try to run.

1081
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:26,640
There's no output.

1082
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,480
It's not printing anything

1083
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,440
or printing anything. Why?

1084
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,200
Because this ls block.

1085
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,600
Guys, this ls BLOCK is part of this.

1086
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,320
If right.

1087
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,920
They appear in the where they leave.

1088
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:49,360
They leave inside this if statement.

1089
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,680
Because our if condition was what?

1090
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,880
Because our condition was false.

1091
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:58,200
Everything that ignore
everything are involved.

1092
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,640
So don't get confused.

1093
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:03,520
This part belongs to to the in there.

1094
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,360
If this sport does not belong to the

1095
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,680
if you like, the more examples

1096
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,240
that are false,

1097
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,120
you will see right in which cases
we will go for

1098
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,400
this foot

1099
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,560
in which we will go for our nesting

1100
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,120
for example.

1101
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:24,600
Right.

1102
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,400
So, so we have an example, right?

1103
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,320
For example we have an example.

1104
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,280
So we will take two variables.

1105
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,960
If we will take two variables, right,
we will take two variables.

1106
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:43,040
So I'll have a they right and we can be

1107
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,560
integers, they are nothing

1108
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,960
I want to say Friday.

1109
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,480
Let's take a string.

1110
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,520
Let's take a string.

1111
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:55,680
String

1112
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,400
Li equals two press

1113
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:03,160
right, right.

1114
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,440
For example. Right.

1115
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,480
In examples,

1116
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,920
we want to check if it's Friday, right?

1117
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,880
We want to check it's Friday.

1118
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,960
If it's Friday,
then we're going to go for movies, right?

1119
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,440
For example, every Friday.

1120
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,520
You guys going for movies, right?

1121
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,640
Hey, if it's Friday, I'll go for movies.

1122
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,440
If it's not Friday, I'm going for movies.

1123
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,120
Right?

1124
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:30,240
So then what do you want to to
look you want to look into a date,

1125
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,840
for example, Right?

1126
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,480
You want to say, okay, today's Friday.

1127
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,040
And you know what?

1128
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,960
If today is a Friday 13,

1129
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,440
if today is Friday 13th,
then you watch a scary movie.

1130
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,600
Otherwise you'll watch,
I don't know, James Bond movie, right.

1131
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,200
Something like this.

1132
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,600
So now let me ask you this.

1133
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,680
What will be your R condition?

1134
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,920
What I will be your R
If you want to check the data,

1135
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:03,440
you want to check the date first?

1136
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,160
We will check the day. Right.

1137
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,840
So first, I want to decide

1138
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,600
whether I'm going to the movie
or whether I am not going to the movie.

1139
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,920
Right. I don't care about the date.

1140
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,600
Then they can be 13, 21st,
whatever the date is.

1141
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,800
But my most important thing
Friday is the only day of

1142
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,760
when you guys have right
sense from syntax.

1143
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,400
Are you like, okay, if it's Friday,
I'll go for a movie, right?

1144
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,360
Okay.

1145
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:30,960
So then we will do say, Hey Eve,
how do we compare to strings?

1146
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,640
This thing I've got to show you, right?

1147
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:43,920
You guys did an example.

1148
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,440
So if they if they write, if they now

1149
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,760
when we have two strings gets right,
what do we have?

1150
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,000
Strings we try not to use to equal sign

1151
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,280
we not going,
oh, will you give me a syntax.

1152
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,440
Why and I'm not going to have any errors.

1153
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,160
Good syntax
is not going to give me any errors,

1154
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,280
but a best, best way

1155
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:15,320
to compare to strings
always, always use equals.

1156
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,680
Once you guys

1157
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,440
are going to have

1158
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,840
a you guys going to have two classes

1159
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:30,960
where you guys will be happy,
where you guys will be learning strings.

1160
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:31,800
Okay?

1161
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:37,200
So and in those days,
you guys will understand why we do

1162
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,160
go the equals type in

1163
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,120
instead of equals
using the two equals sign.

1164
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:44,680
Yeah.

1165
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,840
So never say, hey,
if the day is equals your Friday, right.

1166
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:54,320
Then we will say I'm going for a movie.

1167
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,160
See them once

1168
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:01,360
I'm going to the movies to the right.

1169
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,760
You only have otherwise by me. I

1170
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,520
we cannot it right we cannot exist.

1171
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,240
That's fine for you.

1172
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,720
Interesting.

1173
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,880
Oh I'm like

1174
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,240
I'm going to say I'm going to study.

1175
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:31,800
Okay.

1176
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,600
I hope you guys doing all right.

1177
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,960
So for now, what are we seeing?

1178
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,880
We just in simple if statement, right.

1179
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,560
If statement that consists of two blocks.

1180
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:46,720
It consists of the
if block only consists of the else block.

1181
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,160
Right.

1182
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,760
So we have in this condition, guys,

1183
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,560
which line will get executed

1184
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:06,240
in pool? Why?

1185
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,840
Because condition
will give me a true right.

1186
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,720
They variable.

1187
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,120
They hold the value of Friday.

1188
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,720
Hey is the Friday equals to Friday.

1189
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,600
Yes, condition is true.

1190
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,000
So your line 28 will get executed.

1191
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,680
Right? Line 28.

1192
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,280
And then you also black will be ignored.

1193
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,720
BLOCK loading. Go. Right.

1194
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,920
So I'm going to the movies today.

1195
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:34,480
Now what I have, I a condition.

1196
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,000
Condition
that depends on the date right now

1197
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:43,680
I'm saying, hey, if the day is Friday,
because it's my movie day.

1198
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,240
You know what?

1199
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,240
Let me check the date.

1200
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,400
It's Halloween time.

1201
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,240
And no, this let me see that.

1202
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,520
They will be 13.

1203
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,520
I'll watch a scary movie. Right?

1204
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,920
So now what I want to do,
I want to add another if statement.

1205
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:57,480
Right.

1206
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,520
So now what I would like to do,
I would like to list

1207
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:05,880
why I want to do this
because I had a dependable condition.

1208
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,440
Right?

1209
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:10,880
Only it because it's Friday
now I will check a date.

1210
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,600
Right.

1211
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:15,240
So now what will do inside this
if statement?

1212
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,400
I'm going to throw another if statement.

1213
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:18,880
Right.

1214
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,400
Hey, all know
only because the condition was true.

1215
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,720
Just make sure this

1216
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,280
27 Why didn't you this

1217
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,720
I use be it when they are here I said

1218
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:43,680
I said D right here I have they.

1219
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,000
So what we work is the variables.

1220
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,560
We work with the values
that we have placed inside.

1221
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,200
Right before I had this variable
and I added this value.

1222
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,840
Now what I'm referring to is variable.

1223
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,440
I see. Yeah.

1224
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,400
Because I have a day.

1225
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,120
What is the value in here?

1226
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,000
In order for me

1227
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,440
to compare something to something,
I have to have two values, right?

1228
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:10,640
Yeah.

1229
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,560
I cannot just say if they right.

1230
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,640
I cannot just say if they right.

1231
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,840
Why I cannot see why I can.

1232
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:30,000
Let's say if they guess which.

1233
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,120
So remember guess the way the f works.

1234
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,640
Exactly. Why.

1235
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,400
Because that they exist.

1236
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:42,560
Strings the way if works,
I must get a boolean condition.

1237
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,400
Right?

1238
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:48,800
I must get a boolean condition
if I can have a they if I can have a date.

1239
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,880
It's not a valid condition like always.

1240
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,400
Always inside the if still if statement.

1241
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,320
There has to make a statement
that will give me a boolean.

1242
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:01,240
So that's why.

1243
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,440
And see now what I'm going to do.

1244
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:05,760
I'm going to compare to values.

1245
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,400
Hey, if the value inside the variable box,

1246
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,120
inside the variable date inside
this box is equal to what is equal.

1247
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,520
So you ready equals to

1248
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:21,520
right.

1249
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,040
So this equals to Friday only.

1250
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:29,600
Only if this condition will be true,
then this things that will check right

1251
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,920
now. So yeah, I'm going to the movie

1252
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,880
now because I decided I'm
going to the movie now.

1253
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,160
I have another condition I'm going to do.

1254
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:43,160
I went to let's see if they is equal.

1255
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,880
Right. We check in now again.

1256
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,840
Right again, I'm not saying.
Okay. So sorry.

1257
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,560
Not the right date right now.

1258
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,560
What? I'm you. Why?

1259
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,240
I'm using equality upgraded to come up
with the bulling condition.

1260
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:57,600
Right.

1261
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,160
I cannot say equal because it will be
in this time in operation.

1262
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,560
I have to give a value. Right.

1263
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:09,800
I'm going to say here,
if the is equal to 13, then

1264
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,080
all I am

1265
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,160
watching is is

1266
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,960
moving right.

1267
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,400
Well, we can leave it for now like that.

1268
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,560
Okay. This

1269
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,080
tell me the output

1270
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,400
we just looking into this program,
what will be the output?

1271
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:37,680
How many I will have written once this out
to see out three yourselves

1272
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:41,040
How many statements am I going to see
is an output right now

1273
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:43,200
when I'm going to execute my program,

1274
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,480
which lines

1275
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,440
I'm going to see?

1276
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:56,160
29. Definitely I'm going to see 29. Why?

1277
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,320
Because

1278
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,480
they already is equals to Friday.

1279
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,600
Condition is true.

1280
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,800
I'm going inside that block. Right.

1281
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:09,160
And then inside eve blocks
This out is just there, right?

1282
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,480
There's no condition
to execute my line 29.

1283
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,480
So I'm just going to print it.

1284
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,440
But then your code goes down
and it's sees line 32.

1285
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,160
You know what?

1286
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,920
Line 32, the place to be inside at East.

1287
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,280
So before I execute line 32,
I have to check the condition right

1288
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:31,080
now, Hey, is the date
this equals to 13 years.

1289
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,560
This is equal to 13.

1290
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,240
Condition is true immediately.

1291
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:35,640
Right.

1292
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,040
So this way you're going to see 29 and 32.

1293
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,840
What will happen to the line? 38

1294
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,480
And what why is it getting ignored?

1295
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:59,160
Why is it getting ignored?

1296
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,440
Because you're Eve, right?

1297
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:05,160
Because this Eve was still

1298
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,480
when the if is true, else is getting
ignored.

1299
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,400
Right?

1300
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,160
Else is getting

1301
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,320
you guys.

1302
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,560
I'm keeping an example.

1303
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,200
I will just try to change the values
right now

1304
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,280
already.

1305
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,360
What will be the output this

1306
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,560
what what

1307
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,840
what happens with this gear movie?

1308
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,120
My date is 13.

1309
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:55,800
What happens is watching a scary movie
days. Why?

1310
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,960
Why is it get it?

1311
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:03,840
Why is it getting ignored?

1312
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,840
Because it's not Friday. Right.

1313
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,200
But the right.

1314
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,240
So this is your Eve statement.

1315
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,280
This is your last part, right?

1316
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,680
So, hey, is the day equals two Friday?

1317
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,280
No day is equals to Saturday.

1318
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,600
Write days as equals to Saturday.

1319
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,800
So it means I cannot enter these F block.

1320
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,640
It means in three
you block is get an oops is get in.

1321
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,920
What is getting ignored is getting ignored

1322
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,840
and because we have the otherwise part.

1323
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,720
So now our code will go to the light duty

1324
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,040
right?

1325
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:49,320
I'm keeping
the cadets. I'm just changing the

1326
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,120
different values.

1327
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,040
So the difference between equals in

1328
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:02,040
so one equals sign, right?

1329
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,000
One equals sign.

1330
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,920
It's an assignment operator. Right.

1331
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,040
One equal sign is an assignment.

1332
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,120
Operator Two equals sign, right?

1333
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,400
Do equals sign.

1334
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:18,040
For example, let me let me take another
variable integer

1335
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:21,520
D equals two.

1336
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,920
I need also 30, right?

1337
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,400
So now I can say

1338
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,440
they equal equal equal

1339
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,240
to D, right.

1340
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:41,920
So if I'm saying they equal equal to D,
what am I doing in here?

1341
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:52,080
This what am I doing?

1342
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,520
I am comparing, right?

1343
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,280
So I'm comparing a one value
to another one.

1344
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:01,160
So I'm saying he is the date
which is 32 equals to 13.

1345
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,160
Is it true or false?

1346
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,200
Are they equal or no.

1347
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,200
Okay, we'll go.

1348
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:06,600
Right.

1349
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,320
So this will give me one bullet, right.

1350
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,440
This will give me one bullet. Right.

1351
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,600
And it will give me condition right.

1352
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,280
But if I'm going to say

1353
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:22,240
they equals to D right, they equals to D

1354
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,920
then what I'm doing taking the value of D

1355
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,440
and assigning it to the variable date.

1356
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,240
Right.

1357
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,280
Reassigning it. Yep.

1358
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,080
That's what. Exactly, Exactly. It

1359
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,080
is. Two

1360
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,800
how to know ls if a sign to Well this.

1361
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,920
That's why guys do so now

1362
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:52,880
which ls belong to the
if so my suggestion as always.

1363
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,640
Always When I'll give you
we will do couple more examples this

1364
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,080
and then they'll give you a test and then
you actually will be doing lot of tasks.

1365
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,920
So whenever you're doing this,

1366
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:09,320
always, always try to write your first
if statement.

1367
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,360
Don't go into the next thing.

1368
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:15,960
Identify
first what you have as an R if statement

1369
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,600
and whether you're going
to have the block,

1370
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,200
whether you're not going to have the LS.

1371
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,440
But once you identify you are eve

1372
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,440
only then go into the next right
only then go into then this.

1373
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,960
So here.

1374
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,080
Yep. And if you guys have any
issues in the code, please

1375
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:35,760
post it in the support channel.

1376
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:36,320
Right.

1377
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,360
So here we're talking.

1378
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:42,480
Hey, if the day is Friday, right in the
this Friday you said you go into the movie

1379
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,120
otherwise you're going to study, right.

1380
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:49,880
This ls belongs to this E for now.

1381
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,880
Give me give me your email
If you're in there, you have it ls part

1382
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,360
can you either blog has a cameo in there

1383
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:02,640
if statement has the ls blockers,
you can have it right.

1384
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,920
So the only thing is always always
be careful when you will be early.

1385
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,560
If these equals 13,
this is where you nest.

1386
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,720
You've starts.

1387
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:15,800
If you want to add the ls block to it,
it has to start in here.

1388
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,080
Right?

1389
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,600
We can add those

1390
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,320
in. Let's say it's all

1391
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,640
brim or

1392
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:35,400
change.

1393
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,400
Okay. This

1394
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,000
Okay. So now what?

1395
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,240
We did

1396
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:43,080
this if statement that consists

1397
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,960
of the eve block and of the LS what I did.

1398
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,400
I nested it. I nested it inside.

1399
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:55,880
We're inside my if block right there
always double click it.

1400
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:00,880
It will show you where if block starts
and where it ends, right.

1401
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:05,480
It always will show you that
this LS part two, which is statement in

1402
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,400
this ls you want to do this right?

1403
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,240
Okay, so we'll just play these the values.

1404
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,680
We'll just place the values, right?

1405
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:24,240
So let's do 14.

1406
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:27,040
So what will be the

1407
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,960
what will be the output? This

1408
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:50,120
again, Right?

1409
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,640
So just going to the right.

1410
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:58,720
So first Friday is the these Friday.

1411
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,720
Yes. Condition is true.

1412
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,840
Automatically automatic.

1413
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:07,880
When this condition is true
you'll go inside that you have block

1414
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,160
so your else block will be ignored right
away.

1415
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:16,360
38 is not getting executed right now
once you enter your block.

1416
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,360
This is where it starts.

1417
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:20,720
This is where it ends. Right.

1418
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,920
So he lives
should go top to the bottom right now.

1419
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,520
What you see you see the line 39.

1420
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,640
Am I executing it? Yes, I'm executed.

1421
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:34,000
Then going down while executing
your Java sees this keyword.

1422
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:34,520
Right.

1423
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,640
So remember that those key words
have a specific meaning for Java, right?

1424
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,680
As soon as a Java is if it knows.

1425
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:43,960
Okay, they put the condition.

1426
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:47,880
Now when I see the condition,
I have to check it first.

1427
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:48,480
Right?

1428
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:52,200
I cannot just go right away
inside the put condition

1429
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,480
only if it passed
then I will be able to enter.

1430
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:55,840
Right.

1431
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,680
Hey, date is equals to 13.

1432
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,400
Condition is true or false.

1433
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:01,760
Right?

1434
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,200
Condition And this statement is false.

1435
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,240
So I am given a red light.

1436
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,960
So it means my eve block I am ignoring.

1437
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,760
So when when my eve block is ignoring

1438
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,720
Eve, I have the block.

1439
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,720
I'll go inside the block
and this code will be executed.

1440
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:23,000
Right?

1441
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,440
Else will be print.

1442
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,920
Right.

1443
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:30,600
So my suggestion
this API when you doing then this

1444
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:34,080
and if right because now guys you're

1445
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,280
the one who can check
if you were raped in your code

1446
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:43,920
correct or no how by providing
different different outputs.

1447
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,520
So you guys right now will be able

1448
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,440
to test your own code in
how do you test your own court

1449
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:56,840
by providing different values
to those variables.

1450
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:01,440
I always, always say,
okay, now you have if ls

1451
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:06,360
and you have nested,
if always check, always check.

1452
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,360
Hey, how can I get the condition?

1453
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,520
How can I get the ls?

1454
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:13,320
My my
I want to see that my ls block works?

1455
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,160
What should I change this?

1456
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,760
I want to check that this ls block works.

1457
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:28,880
What should I change?

1458
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,720
Tell me this. I will change my variable

1459
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,080
to it to watch on to what?

1460
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,760
I need to change it.

1461
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,520
I can change it to any other day. Right?

1462
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:44,840
Let me change it to Thursday.

1463
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,400
Right.

1464
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,040
So now when you change it to Thursday,
you check.

1465
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:50,640
Okay. My ls block works.

1466
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,920
My ls block works good.

1467
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,840
Now let me check my block.

1468
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,720
In order for that to work,
I have to change it for Friday.

1469
01:28:58,720 --> 01:28:59,320
Right.

1470
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,160
And then you have to think right.

1471
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:02,760
Then your logic should be okay.

1472
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,120
I want my eve block to be executed.

1473
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,320
If I want my eve block to be executed.

1474
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:11,800
What I need to change.

1475
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,080
I need to change it to the 30.

1476
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,400
So you guys see, by providing you

1477
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:19,400
provide different value than Friday,

1478
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:22,840
you will check that your LS block
have the right condition.

1479
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,360
By changing it back to Friday,
you will check that

1480
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:30,520
your eve block
is working to check your nested condition.

1481
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,480
You'll just do
variations of the 13 and 14.

1482
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:37,400
So now by providing this three
for different

1483
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:41,040
values,
you are able to test your own code.

1484
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,320
You're able to test your own logic, right?

1485
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,520
Oh, right,

1486
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,800
right, right.

1487
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:55,560
Okay, good.

1488
01:29:55,560 --> 01:30:00,520
So I'm going to leave the code
and let's take a break, guys.

1489
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,920
We'll take a break and then after break,
we'll do one more example

1490
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,760
where we will try to nest a bigger
if statement.

1491
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,520
And then after you guys will go,

1492
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,240
going to have a lot
a lot of exercise to get to the.

1493
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,600
So there will be a lot of practice.

1494
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,120
So why did I use

1495
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,280
equals?

1496
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:25,480
So for now those
I cannot go too much into details.

1497
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:31,280
But Gerald, whenever you have strings,
always, always, always.

1498
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,040
What is the variable day
Variable base of which type?

1499
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,800
It's of the string type, right.

1500
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,720
So any time we compare string, it's

1501
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:45,800
always best choice to use equals

1502
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:50,040
never go for double equals sign.

1503
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:54,680
When comparing to strings, walk
for the double equals

1504
01:30:54,680 --> 01:30:58,200
sign when you want to compare
numeric values.

1505
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,840
Okay, what?

1506
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:03,560
Once you guys

1507
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,280
start learning strings,
you guys will learn

1508
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:10,720
that there is a different ways
how this strings up form.

1509
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:11,520
Okay.

1510
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:16,360
Behind this scene this and many different
operations are happening.

1511
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,560
And once we start
learning about the strings, once

1512
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,840
we start learning about something
that call

1513
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:28,400
immutability and immutability, then
you guys will get a very clear picture.

1514
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,960
Why use it?

1515
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:33,320
Typing equals It's always, always

1516
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:37,080
best choice. Yep.

1517
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:41,040
So think of it
for when compare is in, right? Yep.

1518
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,600
We can type it

1519
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,720
with some theory right compared.

1520
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:50,520
We will say two or more values.

1521
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:54,040
Right?
So if your values are numeric, right.

1522
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:57,000
If your values are numeric

1523
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,200
use double equals.

1524
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,480
If values are string values

1525
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,720
used, that equals

1526
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,080
No, it's not the same.

1527
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:18,560
It's not the same, but equals will be used
only only for strings.

1528
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:23,960
You cannot use equals when you going
to try to compare to numeric values.

1529
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:24,560
Right.

1530
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,720
That's
why we have there's a different data times

1531
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:32,480
we have because with different data types
we can perform different actions, right?

1532
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:37,080
So you guys learn with numeric values
when you go in to use the plus

1533
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:41,040
sign, you will be performing
arithmetic operations

1534
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,600
when you go into
is a plus sign with the strings.

1535
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,400
You guys are doing concatenation right?

1536
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,000
So the same thing. Why in here, right?
All in.

1537
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,560
Only when you have numbers

1538
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:56,040
used to two or to equal signs
when you use the string use that equals.

1539
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,080
But on the class

1540
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,600
13 or 14,

1541
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,760
you guys will see in details why?

1542
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,800
I'm not saying it's not going to work this
in some cases

1543
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:11,000
using double equals sign
when compared to strings.

1544
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,360
It will work,
but in some cases it won't work.

1545
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:14,960
Right?

1546
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,240
So once you know the difference, then
you guys will use your own best judgment

1547
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:20,040
when to use it.

1548
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,040
But before that, you need to know why.

1549
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:24,880
For now,
just always, always use equal sign.

1550
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,240
So this way you are not going
get any logical errors, right?

1551
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,280
Syntax will be correct.

1552
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,800
Syntax you in Java will be perfectly fine.

1553
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:42,280
But logically this
sometimes might get some mistake.

1554
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,680
So let's take a break guys.

1555
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:46,640
It's 1134.

1556
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,960
Let's take

1557
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,000
in most

1558
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:57,320
the mistake make is

1559
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:00,960
an easy.

1560
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,120
I'm sorry,
I did not understand your question

1561
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:08,760
or two all day or exercises.

1562
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,800
Exercises? No.

1563
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:15,080
We will do one more example that cost this
that if I want to make sure you get it

1564
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,920
and then you'll do, you'll do them.

1565
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:21,720
And then we look into the scanner
and then we will combine

1566
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,400
all the things with the scanner.

1567
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,800
And then this that if

1568
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:30,360
you guys are

1569
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,040
going to have I'm giving you examples

1570
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:37,080
what I wanted to say,

1571
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,120
you know, and they'll try to deposit
as the only thing.

1572
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,880
Well, after I time guys, I do go over.

1573
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:45,040
I did not change anything in the code.

1574
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:50,280
I just tried play this different balance
right to develop your logic stronger.

1575
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:53,520
But for now, guys, let's take a break.

1576
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:55,720
I'll leave your this screen in here

1577
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:01,400
and yeah, of

1578
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:22,080
course.

1579
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:22,800
All right.

1580
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,240
So let's come back in

1581
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:29,520
a few minutes time.

1582
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,560
You guys have issues in the code.

1583
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,400
Please make sure you post in the support

1584
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,720
channel
so Sheila can capture it right away.

1585
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,920
All right?

1586
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,400
Okay. Yes. Right.

1587
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:44,680
So what are we are learning, right.

1588
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,760
We are learning about the

1589
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:50,280
conditional statement, right, Eve?

1590
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:50,800
Right.

1591
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:56,280
Whenever in our code we would like to
specify condition we are using if they.

1592
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:57,160
Right.

1593
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,560
There's
a different variations of each statement

1594
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:03,600
we can have we can have our
if statement can consist of just only

1595
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,960
if what it can consist of
if else block or we can of

1596
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,520
if else if blocks
and now what we learning what we can do

1597
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,600
we can nest if condition

1598
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:20,360
and inside another if condition.

1599
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,000
Right.

1600
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:25,360
So and as there's
a many different variations

1601
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,800
of the eve statement,
we can either in just simple eve

1602
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:32,840
we can either in
as that if else statement or we can end

1603
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:34,600
next the

1604
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:38,680
entire eve else eve block right.

1605
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:41,520
So another thing is about nesting, right?

1606
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:44,400
But nest and we can do

1607
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,360
we can nest eve statement

1608
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:50,960
inside either one of the blocks.

1609
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:56,680
We can either nested inside eve block
or it can be either

1610
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:00,920
nested inside that else block
depend on the logic, depend on our

1611
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:03,360
access.

1612
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:04,800
Right.

1613
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:07,560
And what we say about the

1614
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,120
nested it right.

1615
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:12,360
So in which case we would like to go what

1616
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,280
we would like to do the further check

1617
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,960
right when we know
that we receive one information.

1618
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:22,280
But now we want to check
another information.

1619
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,920
Right that in there eve information always

1620
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,680
always have a dependency on the

1621
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:35,080
our information, right. Yes.

1622
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:38,280
So and it is as we look here witness

1623
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,400
that inside just eve block right here

1624
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:45,800
we had our eve else block
But nested inside of if right.

1625
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,720
Let's look at one more example and
then you guys will be doing your tasks.

1626
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:51,600
You have either else

1627
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:56,760
here we have Eve inside in here.

1628
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,960
Yes, we can add it, right?

1629
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,600
For example, let's say

1630
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,520
right, let's think of the condition
where we can have the condition

1631
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,240
if they it's Friday.

1632
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:09,200
Otherwise, if it's not Friday.

1633
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,000
Right.

1634
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:13,400
Do you want can you can
you add another condition?

1635
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:16,080
Yes, we can add another condition,
for example.

1636
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:16,640
Right.

1637
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,080
If the day is not Friday,

1638
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:22,720
let's say come up with some condition,
what do you guys want to do?

1639
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,120
Throw it.

1640
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:24,120
The day is not Friday.

1641
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,000
What do you want to check

1642
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,160
If the day is not Friday?

1643
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,720
I don't know. Let's check the time.

1644
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:31,200
That's fine.

1645
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,120
Let's check the time.

1646
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:35,040
Right. Let's enter the time.

1647
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:38,040
I don't know, Integer

1648
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,280
Just does maybe will be silly example.

1649
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:41,760
Right. And

1650
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,600
yeah, but that's right.

1651
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,760
Or we can we can check if a date. Yep.

1652
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:49,800
We can do. That's fine.

1653
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,240
That's fine.

1654
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,960
We can add another eve. Right.

1655
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,480
So here we are defining.

1656
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:57,120
Hey, if the day is Friday,
then you go into the movie.

1657
01:38:57,640 --> 01:38:59,400
Otherwise we are studying.

1658
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,360
Let's just try. Now there are others.

1659
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,200
So maybe the time that's fine.

1660
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:03,840
But it can be.

1661
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,200
You think, for example, right now
it's 12:00 or something like that.

1662
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,520
Right now just is an example, right?

1663
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,720
Maybe one logically make any sense.

1664
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,280
But just to just to show you. Right.

1665
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:20,880
Just to show you, for example,
we can say, hey, Eve thought.

1666
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:21,480
Right.

1667
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:25,240
If it's not Friday, right,
it means it can be any other day.

1668
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:29,240
So now maybe, guys, Monday through Friday,
you guys work in Saturday, Sunday,

1669
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:31,080
you have your class. Not, for example.

1670
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:36,240
Now we can say,
hey, if time is more, then I don't know.

1671
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,240
Let's take a 24 hour clock.

1672
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:39,480
Right?

1673
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:43,240
If time is more than 23, right,
which means 11 p.m.,

1674
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,520
for example, I'm just saying this.

1675
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,040
Oh, I have to go to sleep.

1676
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:49,840
I have to go to sleep.

1677
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:54,600
I have to go to sleep because I have work.

1678
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:55,560
I don't know.

1679
01:39:55,560 --> 01:40:01,160
Of course I have work or something
or I have class.

1680
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:06,240
He can logically
want to make any sense, but

1681
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:11,560
this is just and I wanted to show you
that your Eve statement

1682
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:16,600
can be nested inside,
that else can then be messed with. Yes.

1683
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,800
So now you have. Right.

1684
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,560
You have your else block and all.

1685
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,720
We only if the if condition will be false,

1686
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:28,160
then you go inside that else
block Right as well.

1687
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,120
What should I change this?

1688
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:34,000
What should I change
if I want to go inside the else BLOCK

1689
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:37,080
What should I change?

1690
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:38,280
Open day, right.

1691
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:41,160
Let's change to Monday, right?

1692
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,840
What is the Monday?

1693
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:46,560
So now what will happen, right?

1694
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,120
Hey, they is equals to Monday.

1695
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,640
Hey, is these equals two to Friday?

1696
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,040
No condition is false.

1697
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,760
Condition is false.

1698
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,840
My entire eve block will be ignored.

1699
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,840
Right.

1700
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,680
So then my code will go inside
where my call will go

1701
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:08,440
inside the else block,
and then regular execution starts based.

1702
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,880
Once you enter your ls block where you ls
block starts

1703
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:15,280
you ls block starts from here
and it ends in here.

1704
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:17,240
You can see the always line.

1705
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,080
How do you know which one?

1706
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:23,200
If you if there's no syntax issues, guys.

1707
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,680
And if you want,
you format your code. Right.

1708
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:26,960
Thanks to Elise.

1709
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:31,040
You guys can see which block belongs
to which Eve starts.

1710
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:31,800
Said this.

1711
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:37,320
You have this level L
starts of this level ls close here, right?

1712
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:39,240
Everything is like the same thing.

1713
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:42,120
And that if ls block goes in here. Right.

1714
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,800
So this way you can see.

1715
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:47,040
So now, because condition for the hour
equals false.

1716
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,560
Now we go in inside the ls point.

1717
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,640
Once we enter the ls part
your java sees a C felt stable.

1718
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:57,000
Is there any conditions
to execute this statement?

1719
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,640
No, I can easily execute it. Sure.

1720
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:03,560
I'll executing now once I executed.

1721
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,240
Now your job is easy.

1722
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,680
Now it is okay if it's a keyword.

1723
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,240
What is this keyword means?

1724
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:13,920
It means that my programmer
at it's some condition, right?

1725
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,240
If I want.

1726
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:18,760
So now any time this condition
I have to check if it's true or false.

1727
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,240
Now I'm checking.
Hey, if the time. More than 23.

1728
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,480
No time is 12, right?

1729
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:25,600
So the time is not more than 23.

1730
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:31,840
So your statement in here
will be in more, right.

1731
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:36,240
And then I'll see as you guys,
so be all in the logic

1732
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:39,160
based on the exercise, for example. Right.

1733
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:45,240
We can say, hey, if they is not Friday,
then I'll do this right.

1734
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:48,960
So it's all depend how we are
you guys going to place the condition

1735
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:54,160
it can be either inside e port,
it can be either inside the LS block.

1736
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:59,840
All depends what kind of condition
you guys going to have in here.

1737
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,680
Like, for example, I give you the

1738
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,440
in here, right?

1739
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:07,720
You guys will do this after this, right?

1740
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:11,800
So, for example, right here,
you will have your exercise.

1741
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:15,800
Each says you will have a craft,
you create the Java program, right?

1742
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:18,840
So you will have to
create the Java program.

1743
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:23,360
And then which you have two variables
mortgage rate in mortgage price.

1744
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,440
In your case, you will have to identify.

1745
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:30,520
You want to check the price for a house

1746
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:35,320
only and only when the mortgage rate is

1747
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,840
less than 4.5.

1748
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,240
I think that's what

1749
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,840
the program is.

1750
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,720
If the rate is more than 4.5,
you're not buying the house.

1751
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,960
But if the rate is less than 4.5,

1752
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,320
then you will consider buying
and then you'll start checking the price.

1753
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:52,840
Right.

1754
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:56,480
So what we seen,
we see the first the will dependency

1755
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,600
price will depend the rate, right?

1756
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,920
If the rate only normally
if the rate matches my condition,

1757
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,160
then I'll check the price. Right.

1758
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:09,680
So in this case depend
what kind of operator you put.

1759
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:16,080
So if the price is
if the mortgage rate is more than 4.5,

1760
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:20,840
you not buying the house,
otherwise you'll start checking the price.

1761
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:21,560
Right.

1762
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:24,360
So units that if will go to the last part.

1763
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,960
But what if you do not

1764
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:31,200
great greater What if you do
the less than equal operator.

1765
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:33,680
Right.
Then your logic have to change, right?

1766
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:36,520
You guys will do the assessment
and then as we will look right.

1767
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:40,840
So it's all depend on the logic
is it's all will depend

1768
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:45,120
on the condition
that you will place inside your statement.

1769
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,000
Let's look

1770
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,480
one that's just like this before
I'll give you the practice

1771
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,800
that we've more

1772
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,920
meaning,

1773
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,040
for example. Right.

1774
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:10,800
So what am I going to have this

1775
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,120
What are we going
to I'm going to ask you this.

1776
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,920
For example, write repo, right?

1777
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:20,120
I'm going to ask you,
did you guys do the repo right?

1778
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:23,560
So your question will be either yes or no.

1779
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:25,840
Right? Your question will be either
yes or no.

1780
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:29,080
So now only only

1781
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:32,360
if you are going to tell me that yes,
you guys have done repo.

1782
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:36,080
Now I can check
how many exercises you've done.

1783
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:40,640
If you've done more than I don't know,
five exercises, I'll tell you.

1784
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:42,840
That's good.
But you should have done more.

1785
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:46,320
If you done more than ten exercises,
I'll tell you that you did good.

1786
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,480
If you've done more
than 15 exercises, then, or if you done

1787
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:54,240
all of it, I'm going to tell you
you guys did a great job, right?

1788
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:56,160
So now let me ask you this.

1789
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,320
What will be my condition?

1790
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:01,880
Okay, So what is my order condition
and my check in?

1791
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:03,000
How many assignments

1792
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,760
you completed or I'm checking
whether you have done repo or not

1793
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:13,720
doing it or not.

1794
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,160
Right.

1795
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:19,960
If you have not done repo, how can I ask,
Hey, how many assignments you've done?

1796
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,920
You already told me
you have not done right.

1797
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,240
So always, always does
define your first time.

1798
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:28,880
You are condition right so let's take it

1799
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,960
ball in repo company right

1800
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,360
right from three

1801
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:42,080
and then we going to say
I hope you guys will get it right

1802
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:46,440
and then let's say
let's in your assignments

1803
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:50,280
how many assignments you guys have.

1804
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:54,160
19 in there thing like total 19 or 20
something before this year,

1805
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:58,360
93, for example, it's in 1990.

1806
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,000
All right.

1807
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,120
So first, you guys already told me
that your order condition is

1808
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,200
to check

1809
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:10,200
whether
whether a report is completed or not.

1810
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:10,760
Right.

1811
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:13,800
So how do we specify the condition

1812
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,160
we're using if state
What if I have to check something?

1813
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:18,880
Right.

1814
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:21,960
Hey, I'm going to say,
hey, if repo is completed,

1815
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:23,920
right?

1816
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:29,560
If repo is completed,
then I will perform some action.

1817
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:32,040
Then that will perform some action. Right?

1818
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:34,200
Do I have to have the ILS block?

1819
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,400
We can have it.

1820
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,000
We don't have to have it.

1821
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,600
Like, for example,
let me add let me add it.

1822
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40,040
Right.

1823
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,600
So I'm going to l

1824
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:44,760
show you do homework. Right?

1825
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:46,920
Let's say you want to tell me
you did not complete it.

1826
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:49,120
I'm going to say, please
make sure you do homework.

1827
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,960
Please make sure

1828
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:56,680
you do homework.

1829
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:57,240
Right.

1830
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:03,000
We do your homework.

1831
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:07,880
So my my suggestion this before
jumping into the next in writing.

1832
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:10,400
You other could check this column.

1833
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:13,400
Always check. Always check that. Sure.

1834
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:17,640
If one works, always check that your else
part works, right?

1835
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:19,720
Hey, is rep well, it's completed.

1836
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:21,680
If the condition will be true. Right.

1837
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:24,000
Let me see. Let's do me

1838
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:28,160
right.

1839
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,240
It's not out there.

1840
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:32,360
Just like

1841
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:36,720
for example, I'm going to say Agent

1842
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:37,760
feedback

1843
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:42,600
right before nesting because your nesting,

1844
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,640
you know, get the little complicated
is always check that you're simple.

1845
01:48:46,640 --> 01:48:49,280
If works, don't go for it right.

1846
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:53,200
And how do we check that
my even else works?

1847
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,960
You have to provide two conditions.
True and false.

1848
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,880
Okay, let's check who is the true.

1849
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,800
Is my true condition works? Yes, it works.

1850
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:04,320
Let me check if my false condition
what's right?

1851
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,680
That my logic is correct what I did.

1852
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:09,240
Okay, good. It work. Right?

1853
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:13,080
So now go ahead and do the next ones
because you are.

1854
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:17,880
Some guys will start becoming
a little more and more complex right.

1855
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,840
So that's why
I always try to complete the simple part.

1856
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:24,240
So now, now I've said, okay,
you know what?

1857
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:29,560
I'm only when all the rebels are completed
now I will check the assignments.

1858
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:29,960
Right?

1859
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:34,000
So for example,
now I can say, Hey, be right.

1860
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,920
For example, the assignments

1861
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:43,080
always are more or equal than 90, right?

1862
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,080
If you want or not more equal.

1863
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:46,920
Okay.

1864
01:49:46,920 --> 01:49:48,680
Let's say let's say out of the 90,

1865
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:52,600
if you completed more than more than 16,
we are good.

1866
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,000
We are happy. Right?

1867
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:57,720
So all agreed to

1868
01:49:59,120 --> 01:50:02,040
be to again, amazing

1869
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:08,160
region, for example, right

1870
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:11,520
here, We will start going down
this will start going that right.

1871
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,840
And then if maybe let's check
why why do you do this

1872
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:18,640
pattern is the highest because that's now
what are you guys will start looking

1873
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:23,640
that's besides having this syntax issue
which is very very easy to catch.

1874
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:29,240
Why Because we use an IDs, we might start
having the logical issues, but let's try

1875
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:32,280
the first this way, and then we will try
to change the operator.

1876
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,920
Keep.

1877
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:36,480
And then for example,
let's say else elseif

1878
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:41,200
E let's say you can say a standard

1879
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,720
and then us build them correctly,

1880
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:49,040
let's say are more than if you did

1881
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:52,520
or we can add equal right if. You did.

1882
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:53,640
That's fine.

1883
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,280
Operator It's my main things right now

1884
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:59,960
to show you guys.

1885
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:02,040
Then this would be see

1886
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,480
we get good,

1887
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,560
but you should be more

1888
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:12,600
we should be more.

1889
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,080
For example,

1890
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:17,480
statements right now
don't really don't really

1891
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:21,720
don't really that matter.

1892
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:22,320
Right.

1893
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:25,840
All well, let's say,
do I want to have another elseif?

1894
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,960
You can look another

1895
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,520
see, let's say

1896
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:34,320
something and

1897
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:38,840
let's
see if you've done more than I don't know.

1898
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,720
It's. It's more than six, right?

1899
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:43,680
More than six

1900
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:50,480
or two more

1901
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:55,840
or more.

1902
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,520
One like that.

1903
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,360
Something like that.

1904
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:01,160
Well, let's do this.

1905
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,680
Maybe I'm.
Maybe I made him a logical mistake.

1906
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:04,440
And we will see.

1907
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:07,560
Is there a range of.

1908
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:10,320
Yes. Once we start learning more.

1909
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:13,480
You guys see right now you this
you see that we start facing him.

1910
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:14,880
What if I want to do this?

1911
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:15,800
We have not learned.

1912
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:17,880
But of course we can do more stuff.

1913
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:21,120
Next class
we will start learning addition of things

1914
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,200
that we can add to our code in.

1915
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,280
With the help of those additional things,

1916
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:30,920
we can add multiple conditions,
for example.

1917
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,760
Right. So now what are we see right now?

1918
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,480
What do we see?

1919
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:38,800
Hey, I have my Eve statement inside.

1920
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,000
My is statement.

1921
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,800
I notice that in that eve. Right.

1922
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,160
And this another Eve statement.

1923
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:46,520
And this is statement.

1924
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:50,320
However, if else if if statements.

1925
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:53,120
Right.

1926
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:54,920
Did you guys know what

1927
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,880
did you guys do on how to debug you could

1928
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:02,400
how to do the low execution of your code.

1929
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:07,960
No I will

1930
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:11,440
I will teach you
I will teach you a little bit later.

1931
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,120
But let me show you this.

1932
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,560
Let me show you how to do it.

1933
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:17,320
But I promise you I will teach you guys.

1934
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:19,760
You guys will all will be able to do it.

1935
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:22,120
But basically what is debugging
is debugging.

1936
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:22,920
Let's look this.

1937
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:25,920
If I'm going to click right now
and run, execute super quickly.

1938
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,600
Right, Super quickly. You don't see debug.

1939
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:32,440
Basically debug is a term
that you guys will start here in a lot.

1940
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:35,600
You bike, it's a thinker,
it's a slow execute you know

1941
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:39,360
by executing you could slow you can

1942
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:42,160
you can first understand
what's going on in your code

1943
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:46,240
and you can capture any logical issues
you might have.

1944
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,840
Right. For now, I'll just do it by later.

1945
01:53:48,840 --> 01:53:49,680
I will teach you this.

1946
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:54,560
So this way
it's easier for you to see right?

1947
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:54,880
Okay.

1948
01:53:56,360 --> 01:53:57,920
Well, we'll do

1949
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:02,360
it quickly.

1950
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,400
Okay? Okay.

1951
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:05,400
So this way.

1952
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:09,200
Also through your actual let me stop you
this through your debug and you can

1953
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:12,600
you will see that your code is actually

1954
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:15,400
being executed up to the bottom.

1955
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:18,760
How your eve statement works,
it will be very, very useful.

1956
01:54:18,760 --> 01:54:20,960
We will teach you this,
but why not try to watch?

1957
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,640
All right.

1958
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:25,080
So as we said, what happens?

1959
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:30,760
Our main method is the entrance to your
to your to our program.

1960
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:32,760
Our program is of class, right?

1961
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:38,160
So this is where our main method starts
and the code executes plus to the bottom

1962
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:41,080
that to the bottom.

1963
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:43,080
Right.

1964
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:44,520
So first, what happens?

1965
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,440
What are we doing on the line? Seven days.

1966
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,760
What are we doing on the line? Seven

1967
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:55,200
Romney We will try to switch
and you will see what's the difference.

1968
01:54:55,440 --> 01:55:01,000
Keep we are initializing.

1969
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Then there will and assigning the value
right

1970
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:07,280
or another term?

1971
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:12,520
Another term you guys are declaring the
variable and assigning the value right?

1972
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:13,880
Different different things.

1973
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:16,520
But here we are just

1974
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:19,040
initializing our variables, right?

1975
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,360
First variable.

1976
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:24,480
Second variable, right
first we'll get there now.

1977
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:25,200
Right.

1978
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:28,680
So now what are your code,
your participation if condition.

1979
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:28,920
Right.

1980
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:34,520
So now, in order for you for your code
to proceed, you have to define here.

1981
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,960
Is the condition true or false? Right.

1982
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:40,280
Hey, what is the value inside
this variable?

1983
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:43,640
The value inside
this variable is false, right?

1984
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:46,760
So now look where your code jumps
right away. Yes.

1985
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:49,200
So no, because your condition is false,

1986
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:52,080
but your code jumps right to inside it.

1987
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:53,120
Right.

1988
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:56,040
So it means here you're in start you book

1989
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:00,440
now even on the

1990
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:05,800
no blog that executed in
your core is finished.

1991
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:06,160
Right.

1992
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:09,240
You could say okay
now let's change the value.

1993
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:11,400
Let me change it for true

1994
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:13,440
with the actual

1995
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:18,040
and now let's see.

1996
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:18,680
Okay. Right.

1997
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:19,400
The same thing.

1998
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,120
Initialize two variables right now.

1999
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:26,600
Chicken
hey is ready if repo condition true.

2000
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,200
One condition is true.

2001
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:34,720
We are given the green light so now I am
allowed to go inside the eve block.

2002
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:35,160
Right.

2003
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:40,880
So no Echo Greenway is given
now I am inside my eve block. Now.

2004
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:45,720
When I am inside a block, I will start
executing the lines of code right?

2005
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:47,760
I'm executing my statement.

2006
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:52,080
Now you just use another EVE statement.

2007
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:57,200
But what version of the statement sees it?

2008
01:56:57,240 --> 01:57:00,200
See is if else if state right.

2009
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:05,720
So the way Eve ls if speaking
I think we call it a ladder.

2010
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,360
Eve right ladder.

2011
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,600
It's like a ladder right by ladder.

2012
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:12,360
You go in one by one,
one by one, every single step.

2013
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,280
So now it works. He

2014
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:18,000
has Solomon is more than 16.

2015
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,280
What is the value inside?

2016
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,520
It's an assignment is 19.

2017
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:24,640
Hey, is 19 is more than 16 now.

2018
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:28,080
Condition becomes true
When condition becomes true,

2019
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,840
the gates are opening for me, right?

2020
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:31,840
The gifts are opening.

2021
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:34,800
I'm going inside that eve statement,
right? I'm going inside.

2022
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:40,200
If statements, I'm executing the block
of code inside the eve statement.

2023
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:40,760
Right.

2024
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:44,040
Once I executed,
what happens with the rest blocks?

2025
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:55,440
What happens with the block space?

2026
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:59,320
It will skip right out of the entire eve.

2027
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:01,920
LS If only one condition always true.

2028
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,520
There is no way
that there is a two condition.

2029
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:07,280
It will be true inside a equals
each statement.

2030
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:10,520
Right
So now executed executing one block well,

2031
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:15,360
you can see your block was ignored,
another block was ignored

2032
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:18,480
and obviously else was ignored.

2033
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:23,640
Why this ls Now think of it
as this ls belongs to this.

2034
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:26,520
This ls
does not belong to this eve. Right.

2035
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:29,520
So this entire ls was ignored one

2036
01:58:29,720 --> 01:58:33,400
because this condition
was in this is true.

2037
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,320
And now, in order
for you to test your logic, this right?

2038
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:39,720
Okay. You check for true and false.

2039
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:45,280
Now you have to check when assignment be
more than ten, but should be less than 16.

2040
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:45,880
Right?

2041
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:47,640
You always always.

2042
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:49,720
Guys have to check your logic, right?

2043
01:58:49,720 --> 01:58:51,440
No something.

2044
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:55,320
Let me put 12th let's look at something

2045
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,760
Let's try to do the things right

2046
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:03,040
initialize in two variables.

2047
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:05,640
Take in the first order condition. Right.

2048
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:07,480
Is the condition true or false?

2049
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:13,120
This.

2050
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:15,040
So I am going inside.

2051
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:18,080
Right? I'm going inside.

2052
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:20,600
There's no condition to execute line 12.

2053
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:23,880
But now I have the execution of the line.

2054
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:26,000
What? I see another statement. Right?

2055
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:27,760
I see another statement.

2056
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:28,240
Then drag.

2057
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:31,080
Okay. If I see if it means
I have to check the condition.

2058
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:31,880
Right.

2059
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:36,360
Hey, if assignment is more than 16,
no condition is false.

2060
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:37,560
So if.

2061
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:40,680
Look, let's keep
here is the condition is true.

2062
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:44,160
Assignment is 12. Yes,
it is more than ten.

2063
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:47,040
Okay. Condition is true.
I am going inside.

2064
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:52,120
So now your condition of ls
If block was true.

2065
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:54,840
So now you were able to go inside.

2066
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:58,200
So now the line 17 will get executed

2067
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:01,200
and everything else will be ignored.

2068
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:02,280
Right? Everything's

2069
02:00:04,720 --> 02:00:05,880
So now let me ask you.

2070
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:08,680
And of course, you guys will have to test
for this condition.

2071
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:11,480
Right? Let me do actually,
let me ask you guys.

2072
02:00:11,480 --> 02:00:14,760
What if I put condition five?

2073
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:17,280
What are we dealt with?
Let me actually rule this bridge up.

2074
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,320
Maybe I'll just so this way.

2075
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:22,640
We don't have repetitive code.

2076
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:25,240
All right, so what it will be now

2077
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:28,680
tell me.

2078
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:29,880
I'll give you a one.

2079
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:30,520
So one thing.

2080
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:33,000
This place, whenever I try to

2081
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:36,840
whenever I try to type one,
explain some code.

2082
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:38,400
This please try to pay attention

2083
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:42,000
because it's important
to capture the logic in the code.

2084
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:45,000
I'll give it to you guys. Code. I will.

2085
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:46,200
I will have.

2086
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:49,160
I will give you time right now,
you guys will be able to type.

2087
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:51,560
So I remove something.

2088
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,800
So tell me, guys,
what will be the output right now

2089
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:02,480
from If

2090
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:09,360
you did good one, you should do more.

2091
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:11,840
Okay.

2092
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,560
Please pay attention to the variables.

2093
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:15,240
This one is true.

2094
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:27,440
The other one is five.

2095
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,400
So 21

2096
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:35,080
I was coming to 2113 and 21,

2097
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:38,280
13 and 21.

2098
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:40,560
Remember this? One thing

2099
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:44,320
I remember is statement, right?

2100
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:46,800
This is statement. We'll have one output.

2101
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:49,600
If this if statement possible,
we will have

2102
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:52,680
because we did not have the right
not to cook this.

2103
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,400
Now let's write.

2104
02:01:54,400 --> 02:01:56,440
That's inputs.

2105
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:57,360
That's what I always say.

2106
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:59,880
Also do your manual debugging.

2107
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:02,560
No, it's it's complicated.

2108
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:07,680
So with the first,

2109
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:11,440
that's why we always try to write
from this simple case.

2110
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:15,120
Don't Look into here,
don't look into here for now.

2111
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:16,760
Ignore all of this.

2112
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:19,880
What is our most important thing
to check right now?

2113
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,600
What is the important thing to check? This

2114
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:25,920
important

2115
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,160
part is to check you our if condition.

2116
02:02:29,160 --> 02:02:29,840
Right.

2117
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:35,840
So now now when you look into your are Eve
you are Eve

2118
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:40,720
is it consists of only Eve block or it
consists of the even else block.

2119
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:42,360
How many blocks you are.

2120
02:02:42,360 --> 02:02:43,640
Eve has

2121
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:49,240
two outside of two

2122
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:53,720
or how many always gets executed.

2123
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:58,400
Only one only one number goes out of
the entire is statement.

2124
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,480
There's always only one statement.

2125
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:04,320
It's either will go to the eve
or is either will go to the right.

2126
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:07,400
So now in this condition what do we have?

2127
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,960
Condition is true.

2128
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:10,200
Condition is true.

2129
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:16,440
So which block is getting ignored?

2130
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:18,320
Else is getting ignored.

2131
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,200
That's it.

2132
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:20,880
Else is getting ignored.

2133
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:23,560
Why? Because this

2134
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:28,680
constant in this space,
this it comes in the here now

2135
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:31,760
because Eve block is true Now you going

2136
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:34,560
inside the eve black ls block that ignored

2137
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:38,560
So now only know only this
when you are eve

2138
02:03:38,560 --> 02:03:43,320
condition is true only then start looking
inside inner Don't ever

2139
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:45,480
don't even look

2140
02:03:45,480 --> 02:03:50,120
inside the inner
until you check the outer Keep.

2141
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:52,040
All right, so now

2142
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:55,000
what are we inside the outer embrace

2143
02:03:55,080 --> 02:04:00,160
Now inside our eve Now your java entered
your java and third in here.

2144
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:02,360
So your java is standing in here.

2145
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:07,000
Now what Your java is
your Java's use another eve statement.

2146
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:10,640
But this eve statement consist of eels.

2147
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,240
Eve ls eve blocks.

2148
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:15,760
So all of the eve ls eve blocks.

2149
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:25,040
How many blocks will get execute against?

2150
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:27,560
Let's see. Let me ask you guys
what will be the difference?

2151
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:33,520
What is the difference
if our little half Eve else Eve

2152
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,160
And what is the difference?

2153
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:40,840
If I'm going to have
this is one variation.

2154
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:43,560
It's one variation.

2155
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:45,840
This is the second variation.

2156
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,640
If I'm going to have Eve

2157
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,080
ls Eve

2158
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,960
and else,

2159
02:04:54,040 --> 02:04:55,680
what is the difference between first

2160
02:04:55,680 --> 02:05:17,440
and second variation?

2161
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,400
First one has the outer.

2162
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:21,840
And that is true.

2163
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:22,520
No, no, no.

2164
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:23,280
Don't look at this.

2165
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:26,320
I'm just looking into this.

2166
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:29,680
What is the difference
if I'm going to have Eve statement?

2167
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:32,880
But one statement when you have Eve ls

2168
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:36,240
Eve BLOCK And this second statement

2169
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:41,240
when you have Eve else Eve and else block
it will have three blocks.

2170
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:43,880
This one has three blocks,
this one has two blocks.

2171
02:05:44,120 --> 02:05:45,720
This one don't have the block.

2172
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:49,760
But this has the LS block.

2173
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,680
So remember this.

2174
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,040
In this case, we.

2175
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:56,840
Chaikin Hey, condition can be true, right?

2176
02:05:56,840 --> 02:05:59,520
Condition can be true,
but condition can be false in here.

2177
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:00,040
Right.

2178
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:04,400
And condition for the elseif
can be false as well.

2179
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:08,440
If you don't have that ls part
what will will happen.

2180
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:13,360
This if there's no elsewhere,
what will happen?

2181
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:15,760
There won't be no output, right?

2182
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:18,080
There will be no output at all. Why?

2183
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:20,520
Because our boolean, right?

2184
02:06:20,520 --> 02:06:23,280
Because our ruling can have either true
or either false.

2185
02:06:23,600 --> 02:06:26,160
In this case, if this condition was false

2186
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:29,400
and this condition was false

2187
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:33,320
and this condition
if also none of the conditions are match.

2188
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:37,440
So what we did in here, guys,
we did not provided

2189
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:40,440
the LS block, I didn't know provided
that ls block Right.

2190
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,440
So all the conditions here are false,

2191
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,840
but you did not provide
any code for the else part.

2192
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:50,360
So if the condition is false,
if the condition is false,

2193
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:53,440
I how you how you java can print.

2194
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:55,080
You cannot print. Right.

2195
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:57,240
If the conditions are false, great.

2196
02:06:57,240 --> 02:07:01,080
Now, but what will be the difference
in here if the if condition is

2197
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:04,440
and the elseif condition is false,

2198
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:06,360
what will happen is

2199
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:14,960
evil print otherwise.

2200
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:17,200
Right? Why?

2201
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:21,960
Because condition either can be true
or either can be false.

2202
02:07:22,120 --> 02:07:22,760
Right.

2203
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:27,880
So now you as a programmer,
you provided otherwise condition, right?

2204
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:33,440
So out of any time
you guess have eve and else

2205
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:37,960
always only one or always only one weather
you can have

2206
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:41,160
ls if you can have hundreds of else
if it does not matter.

2207
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:41,840
Right.

2208
02:07:41,880 --> 02:07:45,600
But as long as you have else block,
it means at least one

2209
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:49,560
statement will be executed,
even if none of the else, if

2210
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:51,160
it will be

2211
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:54,080
full,
will be true elsewhere, will get executed.

2212
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:57,960
In this case, I didn't approve this
because I did not added elsewhere.

2213
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:00,480
So I wanted to see your logic.

2214
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,280
All right.

2215
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:07,120
So now let's look and back to our code,

2216
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:10,680
which is so
now I don't have the density here, right?

2217
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:15,240
So now, once again,
core condition was true, right?

2218
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:16,680
We went

2219
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:20,720
the moment we went inside your java.

2220
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:24,880
So another
if statement Java so another if statement.

2221
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:28,680
Now when you Java C is eve ls eve

2222
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:32,880
blocks case E false eve blocks
it's like a leather this right.

2223
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:35,760
The leather leather.

2224
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:40,000
All right, so your java will go
by the leather one by one.

2225
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,520
It will check.
Hey, is this condition is true?

2226
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:44,160
No. Okay, I'll go check.

2227
02:08:44,160 --> 02:08:46,840
Has this condition is true? No.
Okay. I'll go and check.

2228
02:08:46,840 --> 02:08:48,680
Hey, is this condition is true?

2229
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:50,920
Hey, this condition is true.

2230
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:56,000
It will go one by one, by one by one
to check all the conditions.

2231
02:08:56,440 --> 02:08:59,080
And if it does not find, then this.

2232
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:00,800
If it does not find it.

2233
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:06,120
If you don't have the block,
nothing will be executed.

2234
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:09,240
That is once again, if you have issues,
please, please, please,

2235
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:13,080
please, please,
please make sure you put it in the in

2236
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:16,840
the support channel
and then a little bit we will look.

2237
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:17,800
Right. Right.

2238
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:21,040
So and once again, guys, before you run,

2239
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:24,600
you always try to look mentally right?
Okay.

2240
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:27,840
Let's have a look in here.

2241
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,640
This condition was true, right?

2242
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:32,080
This condition is true.

2243
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,680
I am going inside.

2244
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:35,320
Inside.

2245
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:38,120
Don't see because I removed one one line
code base.

2246
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:40,440
You had great job. I did remove it.

2247
02:09:40,440 --> 02:09:43,280
So if you look into my code,
I remove that line of code.

2248
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,800
Yep. Okay.

2249
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:47,600
So is this condition true or false?

2250
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:52,680
This truffles?

2251
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:57,720
Oh, can I go inside that you block?

2252
02:09:57,720 --> 02:10:00,760
No, I cannot go now.

2253
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:03,000
I have.

2254
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:05,480
I have another else if. Right.

2255
02:10:05,480 --> 02:10:09,240
So now you will go and check another
if condition.

2256
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:10,800
Hey, is this condition.

2257
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:14,400
It's true right now.

2258
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,600
What condition is false?

2259
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:18,120
Condition is false.

2260
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:18,520
Okay.

2261
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:19,520
Condition is false.

2262
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,680
Remember, your Java

2263
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:24,960
cannot make a decision to stop by itself.

2264
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:28,000
Right? Your program is not smart.

2265
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:29,680
Your program will do.

2266
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:32,680
Would you as a programmer
have written it to do right

2267
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,040
and your java will just continuously
check.

2268
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:39,840
Okay, now I see another else
if it means I have to check the condition.

2269
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:42,080
Hey is this condition is true?

2270
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:44,200
No condition is false.

2271
02:10:44,200 --> 02:10:47,240
No, none of the can.

2272
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:49,120
None of the conditional. What's true?

2273
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:51,120
None of the condition was true.

2274
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:52,600
What happened?

2275
02:10:52,600 --> 02:10:54,560
None of the condition became true.

2276
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,440
But we did not specify the LS block.

2277
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:02,560
We did not specify the LS block
for which if statements for you in there.

2278
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:04,560
If statement, there's no else.

2279
02:11:04,560 --> 02:11:07,240
So it means none of this code
were executed.

2280
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:09,440
That's why I don't have any.

2281
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,680
Right. I don't have enough.

2282
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,120
You know how they are.

2283
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:14,320
But how else? One.

2284
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:22,160
Yes, I can have the else.

2285
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:22,680
What?

2286
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:24,160
I'll just add the question.

2287
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:26,600
Why write it then?

2288
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:30,720
Now me adding the block right now,
what will be the output

2289
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:37,920
this will be just the line 19.

2290
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:39,280
You will be the option.

2291
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:43,760
What will be the option?

2292
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:46,480
Right. Let's plug in this.

2293
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:50,400
Let's play games.

2294
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,760
Well, actually, one more thing.

2295
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:54,280
This let's do let's do some of you.

2296
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:58,240
Some of you guys were saying right
so now listing.

2297
02:11:58,240 --> 02:12:03,160
Why did I use the greater
let's some of you guys were saying

2298
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:07,640
what if we try let's let's try this right
Let's put it.

2299
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:10,200
So I'm changing it to else right?

2300
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:12,080
You guys don't have to change it
the new code

2301
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:13,520
because there will be an issue.

2302
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:15,960
But please look into the code right
now. Right?

2303
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:17,600
I am changing less.

2304
02:12:18,600 --> 02:12:20,920
I'm changing less,

2305
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:26,120
I am changing less.

2306
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:31,080
So tell me, guys,
with the current values of the variables,

2307
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:43,240
what will be my outputs?

2308
02:12:43,240 --> 02:12:48,600
All of them.

2309
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:51,040
17 All

2310
02:12:58,680 --> 02:12:59,520
you did amazing.

2311
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:04,320
What?

2312
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:07,120
114, 16,

2313
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:18,720
16, 15, 17.

2314
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,280
Okay, guys, don't run the code.

2315
02:13:20,280 --> 02:13:27,200
I want you to pay attention on the screen
right now.

2316
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:29,160
Always analyze it. You are so this.

2317
02:13:29,160 --> 02:13:31,880
You don't even need to run the code

2318
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:35,280
to see if your program gives
you the right output.

2319
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:38,160
Right.

2320
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:45,760
You know,

2321
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:51,600
All right,
this is the condition, true or false?

2322
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:52,120
True.

2323
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:58,200
Can I go inside?

2324
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:00,000
Which block is ignored right away?

2325
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,400
Guess which block is ignored right away.

2326
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:06,600
Else. That's it.

2327
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:09,440
Else is ignored.

2328
02:14:09,440 --> 02:14:13,560
So now the moment I'm entering, I'm
seeing that if statement.

2329
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:15,600
Right.

2330
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,040
Okay.

2331
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:18,840
Just now I have to check.

2332
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:20,000
Java has no option.

2333
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,080
It sees if it has to check.

2334
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:24,720
Hey, is the assignment
less than 16 condition

2335
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:28,120
true or false?

2336
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:35,200
So what happens once
the condition is true?

2337
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:36,360
I am going inside.

2338
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:39,480
Condition is true.

2339
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:42,000
I am going inside.

2340
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,760
I will execute the line.

2341
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:46,400
13 What happens after that

2342
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:58,280
That say, guys, that's it.

2343
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:01,760
Everything else out of your entire

2344
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:04,760
if else if ls if ls block.

2345
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:08,520
Remember there is only one
block of code gets execute

2346
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,840
only one based on the condition.

2347
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:15,000
If this condition is true,
I'll give you the code.

2348
02:15:15,560 --> 02:15:17,640
Otherwise this condition is true.

2349
02:15:17,640 --> 02:15:19,080
I'll give you the code.

2350
02:15:19,080 --> 02:15:20,760
Otherwise this condition is true.

2351
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:21,720
I'll give you the code.

2352
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:24,720
Only one condition can be true, right?

2353
02:15:24,720 --> 02:15:26,640
Only one condition can be true.

2354
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:27,880
So what happens?

2355
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:30,120
The way Eve statement works.

2356
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:35,040
As soon as it finds, As soon as it finds
the first true condition.

2357
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:37,160
Guess it's out.

2358
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:39,320
That's it. It's out, guys.

2359
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:41,800
Everything else will be ignored.

2360
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:45,240
That's why I want to. We.

2361
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:48,160
When we build in the if f l e bloggers,

2362
02:15:48,520 --> 02:15:53,240
we have to make sure that we put only one
right condition.

2363
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:55,240
It put only one condition.

2364
02:15:55,240 --> 02:15:56,400
That is true.

2365
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:58,920
And then we put the logic correct.

2366
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:03,920
Okay, so now is built logically,
this output will be there.

2367
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:07,400
My output is my logically is
this makes sense

2368
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:10,920
based? No.

2369
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:12,240
So what happened right now?

2370
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:15,400
This syntax is correct, right?

2371
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:16,760
Syntax is correct.

2372
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:17,760
There's no issue.

2373
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:21,480
My I have all conditions
for boolean conditions.

2374
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:25,600
I have my I have my curly braces.

2375
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:26,200
Right.

2376
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:29,960
But what I got right now,
I got logical mistake.

2377
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:35,280
And usually logical errors are very
not very bad.

2378
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:37,320
They are harder to capture. Right.

2379
02:16:37,680 --> 02:16:41,680
Because your idea is they're not going
to show you your logical errors.

2380
02:16:41,720 --> 02:16:46,680
Now you by debugging your code, you
by providing

2381
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:51,000
different values different conditions.

2382
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,840
You as a programmers,
you will be able to test your code.

2383
02:16:55,760 --> 02:17:00,120
So this way, guys,
if you go to put less 16, right,

2384
02:17:00,360 --> 02:17:02,840
even right
now, let's say you need 15 assignments

2385
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:07,600
and based on my code,

2386
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:14,360
based on my pool, I want to have right
I not 15, let's do nine right.

2387
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:15,480
Based on my quote,

2388
02:17:15,480 --> 02:17:19,320
I want to see this output based on my code
logic with this one thing,

2389
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:23,600
but because I did the different operator,

2390
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:28,920
what be the output based?

2391
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:30,680
It will be first.

2392
02:17:30,680 --> 02:17:34,360
So now, guys,
regardless, you might have zero.

2393
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:36,200
You might have

2394
02:17:36,200 --> 02:17:39,000
one you might have two, three, four, five.

2395
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:42,160
But because logically
you put the wrong operator,

2396
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:44,880
because this condition
always will be true, right?

2397
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,800
What if I'm going to put -100?

2398
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:50,640
What will happen this

2399
02:17:52,760 --> 02:17:54,720
e will still be one.

2400
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:56,480
Still going to be one, right?

2401
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:57,920
That's why this

2402
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:01,440
you always, always make sure you read
as time is correct.

2403
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:04,400
And make sure you provide the

2404
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:05,360
right

2405
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:07,120
apparatus. Right.

2406
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:10,120
So in this case, we should make it greater

2407
02:18:10,440 --> 02:18:15,720
right?

2408
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:17,440
Can I write it? Sure.
I'll run it right now.

2409
02:18:17,440 --> 02:18:21,480
So right now,
which lines will get executed?

2410
02:18:21,480 --> 02:18:39,120
Which lines based on the values?

2411
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:40,520
Is the first condition true?

2412
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:46,360
This is the first condition to.

2413
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:47,920
Is it more than six?

2414
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:50,840
No, I don't think
ten is more than 16. Condition is false.

2415
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:54,240
Next one,
I'm going to check this condition.

2416
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:55,960
Hey, is it more than ten?

2417
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:58,320
Is condition true or false?

2418
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:00,480
No condition is false.

2419
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:02,520
Now, you will learn in here.

2420
02:19:02,520 --> 02:19:05,040
So that's what we will get.

2421
02:19:05,240 --> 02:19:07,080
We need to try to do more homework.

2422
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:07,560
Right?

2423
02:19:07,600 --> 02:19:10,800
Unless you guys can add greater or equal.

2424
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:13,760
Operator, That's different story, right?

2425
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:15,360
The difference for

2426
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:19,080
my one thing is please, please, please,
always remember.

2427
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:19,400
Right.

2428
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:20,960
Where's your

2429
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,800
where's your eve else

2430
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:27,480
Here. Right.

2431
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:28,480
I'm going back guys.

2432
02:19:28,480 --> 02:19:30,120
I'll bring back that screen.

2433
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:32,560
But I want to make sure you understand
this.

2434
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:37,240
I want to make sure you understand right.

2435
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:39,840
So let me make this to make

2436
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:45,120
the way I'll teach you this.

2437
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:46,400
Let me show it.

2438
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:48,400
Let me. Let me show it to you first.

2439
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:57,240
And then
and then I'll teach you basically.

2440
02:19:57,240 --> 02:19:59,920
So this is the example
from your previous class.

2441
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:03,160
I want you to understand how that

2442
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:06,960
if else
if statement works, guess right. So

2443
02:20:08,040 --> 02:20:10,200
I wrote the entire statement

2444
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:14,040
when we have if else

2445
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:18,240
or when we have if else if.

2446
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:23,600
But we also have the only one
condition will be execute only one always.

2447
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:27,000
There's no way your java execute
all of them.

2448
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,960
That's why you also

2449
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:34,680
bullets
selective execution based on the condition

2450
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,440
specific statement will get executed here.

2451
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:47,400
I have written one, 2345678 statements,
but it does not mean all.

2452
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:51,840
It will indicate
only when matching condition will be true.

2453
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:55,160
And I want you to see how that statement
works.

2454
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:55,600
Guess

2455
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,400
if this equals two two.

2456
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:00,120
Right.

2457
02:21:00,400 --> 02:21:02,840
So starting from the top

2458
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:05,120
first condition to false.

2459
02:21:05,800 --> 02:21:08,600
False. Ignore condition.

2460
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:09,800
True or false?

2461
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:12,720
Now sure, I am going inside.

2462
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:15,880
I'm executing line 13.

2463
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:17,600
That's it. Existing.

2464
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:21,600
Well, the rest of the code gets ignored
as soon as you show

2465
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:26,560
Java finds one true condition,
it's out out of the door right.

2466
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:28,680
But now look at this.

2467
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:30,080
This I want to make based on

2468
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:36,760
the what happens vs if else if this.

2469
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:41,400
Okay so if else if we call it a ladder,

2470
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:44,800
if it means one by one

2471
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:49,360
like by the ladder
your java will be going and checking

2472
02:21:49,360 --> 02:21:53,720
every single condition
until it finds the true right look.

2473
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:56,640
Good checks first condition, false check.

2474
02:21:56,640 --> 02:21:59,760
Second condition. Third, fourth, fifth.

2475
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:02,720
Like a letter one by one goes.

2476
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,760
Now it finds the right condition, it

2477
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:08,480
executes right
and then the block, it's ignored.

2478
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:12,080
So now when I'm going to have

2479
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:14,160
90 that same thing.

2480
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:17,280
What it does, it goes one by one, right?

2481
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:21,360
Those checks, every single thing it has.

2482
02:22:21,360 --> 02:22:25,360
And only normally
when none of the condition were matched,

2483
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:28,160
then they jump into the else. BLOCK Right.

2484
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:31,760
So out of this five statements,

2485
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:40,000
only one block get executed.

2486
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,320
All right.

2487
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:44,000
Do you guys want to do the exercise?

2488
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,160
And then I'll teach you
the is how to debug

2489
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:51,480
because what I want you best to try

2490
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:54,120
without debug and without the running is

2491
02:22:54,120 --> 02:23:00,000
I want you to first look into the code
and try to make normally debug it

2492
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:03,920
inside your mind
by trying to develop your logic.

2493
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:14,040
Given all the assignments in here.

2494
02:23:14,040 --> 02:23:15,120
Vega Right.

2495
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:16,320
First with the vaccine.

2496
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:18,600
Simple one and this one right here.

2497
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:21,800
Let me send you your sentence based.

2498
02:23:21,800 --> 02:23:32,400
Okay, one thing, guys, please read it.

2499
02:23:32,400 --> 02:23:34,840
Okay, Don't rush list.

2500
02:23:34,840 --> 02:24:27,360
Read it first.

2501
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:28,840
You guys will go this fast.

2502
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:31,240
I'll give you maybe 20 minutes
worth. Right?

2503
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:35,080
I just share it in the course announcement
and then we will look into this.

2504
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:38,280
Our we will try to make
with the help of scan

2505
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:41,000
and we'll try to make our program
more interactive.

2506
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:45,840
And after we learn the scanner, then
you guys are going to have more tests.

2507
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:49,520
We will be combining our
if statements in the scanner.

2508
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:52,560
Okay. Yes.

2509
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:54,800
So all of it right
now, guys, I send it in there.

2510
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:57,520
I send it in the course announcement.

2511
02:24:57,520 --> 02:24:59,800
So please take it from there.

2512
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:02,600
And I'll keep the four in here.

2513
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:07,440
Okay.

2514
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:10,480
Silence, please
look into the semen. Right.

2515
02:25:10,480 --> 02:25:12,360
The shorter by the salmon, please.

2516
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:12,760
Read it.

2517
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:14,800
In the course announcement.

2518
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:17,720
Everything is in there. Guess all three.

2519
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:22,200
Try to do all three. Yep.

2520
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:25,040
I'll give you 20 minutes for it. What?

2521
02:25:25,080 --> 02:25:35,240
I guys think.

2522
02:25:35,240 --> 02:25:35,760
All right, it's.

2523
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:36,880
I'll give it 20 minutes.

2524
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:39,600
I'll pause for now, and I'll just

2525
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:42,960
take myself a little break, okay?

2526
02:25:42,960 --> 02:25:43,520
All of.

2527
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:48,360
Yes, three guys, all of them.

2528
02:25:48,360 --> 02:25:48,880
Right.

2529
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:51,200
So right now,
remove the extra bracket right there.

2530
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:52,760
Remove the extra bracket.

2531
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:56,240
So now, just by looking into this,
we don't

2532
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:59,280
we don't even have to execute.

2533
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:03,360
Tell me that, guys, why my job
is complaining, why McCaw is complaining

2534
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:16,720
is on the line 28.

2535
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:17,920
Okay. But

2536
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:26,520
so now just by looking at our code
this way, just by looking at our code,

2537
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:30,320
look,
there is an extra bracket in here, right?

2538
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:32,280
Extra bracket in here.

2539
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:33,200
Is it missing?

2540
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:37,280
Now let's see if it's missing,
but I want you to pay attention in here.

2541
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:42,560
This right can I can
I can add an extra bra or else.

2542
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:44,760
Okay. Let me add what else.

2543
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:47,840
Let me see.

2544
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:48,400
Well, let's see.

2545
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:52,320
For example, right now
I do still not good, right?

2546
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:52,840
Still number.

2547
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:55,680
But for example, let me add.

2548
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:57,000
So what?

2549
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:01,920
Because this sometimes there could be also
some logical logical each.

2550
02:27:01,960 --> 02:27:02,440
Right.

2551
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:06,280
So what you guys
always have to check right here

2552
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:10,440
where are your if statement starts
you intend

2553
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:15,840
to start your statement from here
and then and all the way to here.

2554
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:16,600
Right.

2555
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:20,040
And this is should be your l statement
always do this.

2556
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:20,480
Okay.

2557
02:27:20,480 --> 02:27:24,360
But let me see how my java reads this
statement.

2558
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:25,520
Double click.

2559
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:27,400
This is what you do right now.

2560
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:32,560
Now would have happened your clothes your
if statement right

2561
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:36,640
you started if statement in here
what you did you closed

2562
02:27:37,080 --> 02:27:40,600
now when you really really look
what happens

2563
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:45,880
you have independent
if statement you have another if statement

2564
02:27:46,400 --> 02:27:49,400
and you have ls blog
then this by itself right

2565
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:51,360
you have the blog than this by itself.

2566
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:53,280
So that's why this is important.

2567
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:58,640
Always, always check
where are intend to specify your e block.

2568
02:27:58,640 --> 02:27:59,240
Right.

2569
02:27:59,240 --> 02:28:03,720
So my e block intend to start from here
and not in here.

2570
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:07,320
My e block in ten to end in here.

2571
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:12,400
So it means this is
I am closing to and I'm going to

2572
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:15,280
like this.

2573
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:16,680
We will try to execute it right.

2574
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:20,760
And then I'll show you what could be
the issues if you wouldn't have it right.

2575
02:28:20,800 --> 02:28:23,320
If you.

2576
02:28:23,320 --> 02:28:26,880
Okay right, right.

2577
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:29,800
So this is just
how our program should look, right?

2578
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Hey, we decide that my GPA,

2579
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,720
which case I'm asking GPA
only if the user has a diploma.

2580
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:41,600
So now I have IGP
condition has a dependency on diploma.

2581
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,560
So this a dependency.

2582
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:45,200
It means I have to nested.

2583
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:48,120
This will become my either if statement.

2584
02:28:48,120 --> 02:28:48,680
Right.

2585
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:53,480
What is my r e my r it will be diploma
because based on this condition

2586
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:59,000
I will start checking GP right so
and now would say he in diploma.

2587
02:28:59,040 --> 02:28:59,360
Right.

2588
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:02,280
If diploma is equal to true
then I'm saying

2589
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:05,440
and then I'm having

2590
02:29:05,440 --> 02:29:08,600
another issue statement
now because user has a diploma

2591
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:12,080
I'll check the GP if it's more than 3.5,
I'll say that you eligible for

2592
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:15,240
otherwise you should study hard, right?

2593
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:16,520
Okay.

2594
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:18,360
So without the execution,

2595
02:29:18,360 --> 02:29:22,360
by looking at the current output,
what will be my current?

2596
02:29:22,360 --> 02:29:25,720
What will be the output of my program

2597
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:30,680
to their degree? Why?

2598
02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:31,280
What happens?

2599
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:33,280
I have my GPA says 3.5

2600
02:29:42,240 --> 02:29:45,320
because the our condition is false.

2601
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:48,400
I don't care what you have in sight.

2602
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:50,520
I don't care is a moment. Why?

2603
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:53,320
Because first our condition have to pass.

2604
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:53,880
Right?

2605
02:29:53,880 --> 02:29:57,440
So now when I'm executed,
they go right to get a degree.

2606
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:58,200
Okay,

2607
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:01,120
so what if I want to?

2608
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:03,360
An output is.

2609
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:05,200
Congratulations.

2610
02:30:05,200 --> 02:30:06,920
You should have studied harder.

2611
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:09,080
What should I change this?

2612
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:12,000
I want to see the output congratulations.

2613
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,320
And I want to see
you should have studied harder.

2614
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:15,040
So me?

2615
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:25,600
How should I change my values?

2616
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:27,280
I have to make my condition true

2617
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:34,920
in anything else.

2618
02:30:34,920 --> 02:30:38,120
And in order for this condition
to be false,

2619
02:30:38,120 --> 02:30:45,720
because I want to support, to execute,
I have to change it right.

2620
02:30:45,720 --> 02:30:47,280
So now what happened?

2621
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:49,720
We check that our if condition is true.

2622
02:30:50,160 --> 02:30:54,000
And now the second condition
was false, right?

2623
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:56,800
How do I make second condition true?

2624
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:59,120
I want to make my entire statement.

2625
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:09,440
True, True.

2626
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:10,960
Okay. Is the GPA right?

2627
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:14,760
All I do, I'll just choose DP.

2628
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:15,320
Okay.

2629
02:31:16,640 --> 02:31:19,320
So by playing these values like that,
you guys

2630
02:31:19,320 --> 02:31:22,680
are testing the logic of your course,
right?

2631
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:25,640
Okay. Let me ask you guys this.

2632
02:31:25,640 --> 02:31:28,680
I'm going to make some changes
making you change

2633
02:31:29,480 --> 02:31:31,800
and pay attention to any of this.

2634
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:38,480
I'm making change in here
and I'm removing this.

2635
02:31:38,480 --> 02:31:39,960
What will be the output this

2636
02:31:50,840 --> 02:31:51,600
thing, right?

2637
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:56,160
Nothing y because, hey,
one condition is true right now.

2638
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,520
How I represent my if statements

2639
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:02,800
my if statement consists of only if block
right

2640
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:05,880
all I do I remove the otherwise condition.

2641
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:11,040
Right I remove the otherwise condition
and inside my if statement I added this

2642
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:16,240
but if and then here because of the e for
ls block always one blocks gets executed.

2643
02:32:16,560 --> 02:32:21,440
But in this case
the condition is also not right now.

2644
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:24,040
So now you guys. So no output.

2645
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:28,720
So now let me do something.

2646
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:33,120
If is for this, then okay, you give it,
you can share your current.

2647
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:34,320
Then we can see.

2648
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:35,400
We can see

2649
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:38,160
the No, let me do some things

2650
02:32:38,160 --> 02:32:40,280
guys, based on the

2651
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:43,280
some code that I have seen this

2652
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:46,920
I want you to look at
look at this at my screen.

2653
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:50,440
So I'm going to remove this.

2654
02:32:51,720 --> 02:32:54,360
I'm removing the bracket from the line 27

2655
02:32:55,080 --> 02:33:00,120
and I'm adding it on the line 21.

2656
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:03,520
Can you tell me, guys, just because I did

2657
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:06,960
my brackets differently,
can you tell me what it will be?

2658
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:20,960
My output.

2659
02:33:20,960 --> 02:33:23,520
You give the check, check your logic.
How would you do?

2660
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:30,160
Why so right now here you saying that
you should get a degree in your else part?

2661
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:31,440
You should get a degree.

2662
02:33:31,440 --> 02:33:33,560
But then how come you check in GPA?

2663
02:33:33,560 --> 02:33:35,600
Remember,
if there's no GPA, there's no degree.

2664
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:39,360
We check in GPA
all in only if user has a diploma.

2665
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:42,840
Okay, So In your case,
you must be inside the export.

2666
02:33:43,480 --> 02:33:47,400
So is the output in here
the same or different?

2667
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:51,880
Or what am I going to see all

2668
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:56,040
we want? 23

2669
02:33:58,520 --> 02:33:59,520
I change the brackets.

2670
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:00,000
Remember this?

2671
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:03,600
I removed it from the line 27
and I put my bracket

2672
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:05,640
on the line 21

2673
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:10,320
that thing.

2674
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:13,360
Let me try to run.

2675
02:34:13,360 --> 02:34:15,880
It does me
You are eligible for scholarship.

2676
02:34:15,880 --> 02:34:20,240
How am I eligible for scholarship
if I don't have a diploma?

2677
02:34:20,240 --> 02:34:20,520
Let me.

2678
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:22,200
Guys, what happened

2679
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:35,160
if they go right, All good.

2680
02:34:35,640 --> 02:34:38,680
Because right now what have happened days

2681
02:34:39,240 --> 02:34:41,960
I misplace my brackets.

2682
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:44,000
I misplaced my brackets.

2683
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:48,240
So if I'm going to look at my code right
now, what?

2684
02:34:48,240 --> 02:34:52,680
How days instead of the nesting
I should have missed.

2685
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,480
Right.

2686
02:34:53,480 --> 02:34:55,680
We saw already how things needs to be,
right?

2687
02:34:55,680 --> 02:34:57,280
I should have missed. Right.

2688
02:34:57,280 --> 02:35:02,880
So what I did,
I started my statement, right.

2689
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:05,320
I opened my if statement.

2690
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:08,840
But then what I did, I closed it right.

2691
02:35:08,840 --> 02:35:14,240
And now on the line 22
have another statement starts from here.

2692
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:16,920
And together with the LS block,
it ends in here.

2693
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:19,000
So now what had happened?

2694
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,040
Because a misplaced the bracket that I got

2695
02:35:22,160 --> 02:35:25,640
two independent statements.

2696
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:28,560
Right? So now I am not nesting.

2697
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:31,960
And when you have two independent
statements remember guys

2698
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:36,480
what Joe will do okay
there's no dependency on the statement.

2699
02:35:36,480 --> 02:35:38,800
Right. So it checks is diploma.

2700
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:39,760
Diploma is false.

2701
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:42,120
Okay. Diploma
I suppose I cannot go inside.

2702
02:35:42,360 --> 02:35:46,800
This blog gets ignored, but
because you could run stuff to the bottom.

2703
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:48,840
Now goes down.

2704
02:35:48,840 --> 02:35:54,040
And because this if statement is right,
it's independent, right?

2705
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:56,400
So now what? I will check all KGB.

2706
02:35:56,400 --> 02:36:00,120
Give me more than more than it's for It's
more than 3.5.

2707
02:36:00,120 --> 02:36:01,320
Condition is true.

2708
02:36:01,320 --> 02:36:06,000
And that's what is going inside and that's
why it's printing this statement.

2709
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:08,480
Okay. That's
why it's printing this statement.

2710
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:14,520
So that's why it's important, as always,
always pay attention, which if statement

2711
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:20,120
you are missing and where you are
it starts, where you are, if it's right.

2712
02:36:20,400 --> 02:36:22,480
And what will be your best friend
in here, guys?

2713
02:36:22,680 --> 02:36:24,480
Always for my chocolate.

2714
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:27,480
When you going to For my chocolate
because your I.D.

2715
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:30,320
now you clearly see
this is one a statement.

2716
02:36:30,560 --> 02:36:34,520
This is another the two independent
they are not right

2717
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:38,160
but because we want to list it means this

2718
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:42,120
e you have to leave inside here.

2719
02:36:42,200 --> 02:36:42,720
Right.

2720
02:36:42,720 --> 02:36:45,680
So you cannot leave outside of the
our e right.

2721
02:36:45,680 --> 02:36:46,920
We have to live inside.

2722
02:36:46,920 --> 02:36:52,760
So you take it from here
and you must place it inside the brackets.

2723
02:36:52,760 --> 02:36:53,520
Right.

2724
02:36:53,520 --> 02:36:59,120
So this way
now is released inside this for like

2725
02:37:00,520 --> 02:37:02,000
no, our first program was correct.

2726
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,880
This all I do that I just wanted
to show you different variation.

2727
02:37:04,880 --> 02:37:07,960
So here we had our block

2728
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:10,360
that's first we look at the right way.

2729
02:37:10,360 --> 02:37:12,200
That's all You should get it right.

2730
02:37:12,200 --> 02:37:13,680
That's how it was

2731
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:15,800
pulled.

2732
02:37:16,480 --> 02:37:18,600
But I just tried to show you

2733
02:37:18,600 --> 02:37:21,720
what kind of mistakes you guys might make.

2734
02:37:21,720 --> 02:37:24,200
Right. And

2735
02:37:25,240 --> 02:37:28,360
it's easy, guys,
to eliminate this type of mistakes.

2736
02:37:28,360 --> 02:37:30,720
It's easy
to eliminate this type of mistakes

2737
02:37:31,080 --> 02:37:34,640
by first defining your order condition
complete.

2738
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:39,240
You are a condition, and only then
going forward in either statement.

2739
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:39,920
Okay.

2740
02:37:42,520 --> 02:37:44,720
Okay let me see who

2741
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:57,360
and I'll add the text in here.

2742
02:37:57,360 --> 02:38:02,080
So any time you guys want to go back
and take a look at the assignments in this

2743
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:07,240
thing

2744
02:38:09,960 --> 02:38:10,680
is the problem.

2745
02:38:10,680 --> 02:38:13,560
So the same thing in here, this
what is you are condition.

2746
02:38:14,640 --> 02:38:16,160
Do we have any dependency there?

2747
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:20,600
There's no no any dependency.

2748
02:38:20,600 --> 02:38:32,880
We put my name
my main condition is the rate.

2749
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:34,560
What do know? Dependency.

2750
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:38,040
I don't want to I don't want to buy
if the rate is not matching

2751
02:38:38,040 --> 02:38:40,040
My, my, my condition. Right.

2752
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:43,800
If the rate is too high,
I'm not even buying the house.

2753
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:44,440
I don't.

2754
02:38:44,440 --> 02:38:45,520
I don't look at the house.

2755
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:46,360
Right. Why?

2756
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:48,600
Because the rate is way too high.

2757
02:38:48,600 --> 02:38:54,320
Only moly when that condition will
match thing and I will think of buying.

2758
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:54,600
Right.

2759
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:57,880
So your
your rate should be your go to condition.

2760
02:38:58,400 --> 02:38:59,640
If we see

2761
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:04,280
that thing.

2762
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:04,880
Okay. Right.

2763
02:39:04,880 --> 02:39:07,160
So let me see

2764
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:08,920
where that mortgage may go.

2765
02:39:08,920 --> 02:39:11,520
And that's where you
guys is. If mortgage first

2766
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,640
a thing you did to seen

2767
02:39:17,640 --> 02:39:20,040
in there thing you again misplace

2768
02:39:20,040 --> 02:39:23,480
your you
misplace brackets in there. Right.

2769
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:27,440
So how to execute your code by providing
different values and then you'll see

2770
02:39:27,480 --> 02:39:33,160
whether there's any mistake
or there's no mistake.

2771
02:39:33,160 --> 02:39:38,160
This equals you

2772
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:43,120
price quite

2773
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:48,720
or even 4.6 in your price, which

2774
02:39:51,960 --> 02:39:52,840
means

2775
02:39:55,240 --> 02:40:03,120
it's 600,000, which is

2776
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:06,760
for me includes

2777
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:18,760
which is home front.

2778
02:40:18,760 --> 02:40:29,400
So right, so, so fresh.

2779
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:30,360
What are we doing? Right.

2780
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:33,480
So we're saying hey, right, see

2781
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:37,720
if the rate is than 4.5.

2782
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,280
I'm not buying anything.

2783
02:40:39,280 --> 02:40:39,600
Right.

2784
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:41,040
I'm not buying anything.

2785
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:43,600
The house can be hundred thousand.

2786
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:45,200
The house can be 1 million.

2787
02:40:45,200 --> 02:40:47,520
The house can be whatever price.

2788
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:48,880
I don't care. Right?

2789
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:49,840
I don't care.

2790
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:51,640
So but what I care.

2791
02:40:51,640 --> 02:40:53,640
I care about the rate. Right?

2792
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:56,400
So in here, what you guys see,

2793
02:40:56,400 --> 02:41:00,120
we put our IT condition
and we say otherwise.

2794
02:41:00,120 --> 02:41:00,480
Right?

2795
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:05,760
So now inside the otherwise force
that's where we did our listing right.

2796
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:07,280
That's where we did our list.

2797
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:09,280
Right.

2798
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:10,640
So no

2799
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:11,800
Great.

2800
02:41:11,800 --> 02:41:14,480
4.600 thousand.

2801
02:41:14,840 --> 02:41:15,640
What are we doing.

2802
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:21,000
So we buy no, we're not buying.

2803
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:29,600
Tell me what will be the output?

2804
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:31,560
Why are we not buying

2805
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:40,760
so exact the same thing?

2806
02:41:40,760 --> 02:41:43,800
Hey, in which case I can check.

2807
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:46,000
This is all.

2808
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,720
Only my court will go to the else.

2809
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:50,520
All in all.

2810
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:54,840
But before my code goes to the board,
I'll have to check the if condition.

2811
02:41:54,840 --> 02:41:55,520
Right.

2812
02:41:55,520 --> 02:41:56,520
So now I'm checking.

2813
02:41:56,520 --> 02:41:58,880
Hey is rate is more 4.5?

2814
02:41:59,320 --> 02:42:02,560
Yes. In this case condition in here

2815
02:42:02,840 --> 02:42:07,160
became true
so your code goes inside the if block

2816
02:42:07,320 --> 02:42:12,120
so whenever the code goes inside of you
block else spot is getting ignored.

2817
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:12,840
Right.

2818
02:42:12,920 --> 02:42:16,200
So we will get execution
of the statement 21

2819
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:19,520
things it cannot buy the house I'm

2820
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:23,080
look buying the house
right so now in order for me

2821
02:42:24,120 --> 02:42:25,920
to give a chance for minus

2822
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:30,280
that even right
I have to make my condition to be false

2823
02:42:30,840 --> 02:42:40,400
so it can go inside the house for you.

2824
02:42:40,400 --> 02:42:40,960
All right.

2825
02:42:40,960 --> 02:42:43,120
I'm taking pay is the right.

2826
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:45,400
There's more than 44.5.

2827
02:42:45,400 --> 02:42:47,400
No condition will be false.

2828
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:50,960
So now your code automatically jumps
inside the board.

2829
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:51,760
Inside.

2830
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:54,120
That is for
there's no condition to execute.

2831
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:56,640
Line 25 leads you to the line 25,

2832
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:59,720
and that's the execution of the line 25.

2833
02:42:59,720 --> 02:43:04,200
Your Java runs into the if part right
the java ransom to the

2834
02:43:04,200 --> 02:43:09,120
if condition as soon as the
if it knows it's facing right now

2835
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:12,600
statement
in which it has to check the condition

2836
02:43:13,040 --> 02:43:17,640
before executing particular statement
which no he's

2837
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:22,440
the condition 12 false is
condition is a condition is false in here

2838
02:43:22,680 --> 02:43:27,000
so the same thing you gentlemen to
the bills for Anthony go exit

2839
02:43:32,400 --> 02:43:34,800
this exercise this this exercise right

2840
02:43:35,640 --> 02:43:39,240
good Have we got honest inside
that if bought as well right.

2841
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:42,640
Because having this inside
that if bought as well how common

2842
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:47,640
this being said that if part of this exact
let me make it revolutionary right

2843
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:51,400
all this things try
and you know in different way.

2844
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:55,920
Yes we are trying to do it to develop
a logic right to do all of the logic

2845
02:43:55,920 --> 02:43:59,760
and you always should know
that there's at least

2846
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:03,360
different ways how the exercise

2847
02:44:03,360 --> 02:44:05,400
can be completed, at least two ways.

2848
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:09,080
So how can make minus two inside the

2849
02:44:09,080 --> 02:44:12,360
even if I want to do next in inside the
if right.

2850
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:18,760
If you guys will need to help me
with the condition.

2851
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:21,160
How do I make this outputs. Good.

2852
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:24,840
How do I make to make sure that no, I'm
taking

2853
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:28,960
the price inside
that you look how can I do

2854
02:44:35,400 --> 02:44:40,000
that?

2855
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,160
What should be my conditions as in here?

2856
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:49,080
What should be my condition?

2857
02:44:49,080 --> 02:44:51,640
I just need you to change the operating.
Right.

2858
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:56,160
So now in here, I'll just say here,
if right in

2859
02:44:56,160 --> 02:45:00,600
that case are used greater here,
all diseases say go right.

2860
02:45:00,920 --> 02:45:03,360
So what I do right
now, afford them, right?

2861
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:06,600
I just flip. So now I'm saying he all in.

2862
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:09,560
Only if the right more than less than 4.5.

2863
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:18,240
Then I'll consider the divide
and then I'll add the 29.

2864
02:45:18,240 --> 02:45:21,960
So you guys see exactly
the same exercise. Why?

2865
02:45:21,960 --> 02:45:24,480
Just by using different operators, right?

2866
02:45:24,520 --> 02:45:27,840
By using different operators
when nested inside, different

2867
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:38,200
based on the exercise.

2868
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:38,400
Right.

2869
02:45:38,400 --> 02:45:40,480
Based in the exercise
and extend the Remember,

2870
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:44,200
our prices have a dependency
on the rate, right?

2871
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:45,360
I mean, logically,

2872
02:45:45,360 --> 02:45:48,560
maybe it does not really make sense
because we are paying cash.

2873
02:45:48,560 --> 02:45:48,800
Right.

2874
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:53,640
But just by based on the assignment
what all our assignments specify.

2875
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:55,720
Okay.

2876
02:45:55,720 --> 02:45:57,240
Remember, there's it

2877
02:45:57,240 --> 02:46:00,720
once again, how can you check
if you did your assignment for it?

2878
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:03,480
All you have to do
just provide different values.

2879
02:46:03,840 --> 02:46:06,680
Just provide different and test your code.

2880
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:08,560
Right. Let's try it.

2881
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:10,120
Let's make right.

2882
02:46:10,120 --> 02:46:14,040
Write this 4.0 Home
prices, hundred thousand.

2883
02:46:14,320 --> 02:46:17,880
Let try to run it.

2884
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:20,640
Both programs
give me exactly the same output.

2885
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,680
Let me change the one right to five.

2886
02:46:24,120 --> 02:46:25,080
Right to

2887
02:46:26,840 --> 02:46:28,800
work programs the same up.

2888
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:31,200
Let me change it. You see.

2889
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:36,200
Oh, I'd extra zero and you know
what programs exactly the same outputs

2890
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:41,480
so you guys are the who you are
the person who can test your code.

2891
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:43,880
You are the person
who can test your logic.

2892
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:48,240
So now, regardless of me
providing different values,

2893
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:55,080
whether I in this step inside the block,
whether I missed the page, and if what

2894
02:46:55,320 --> 02:46:59,800
my program shows me the right output,
why does it shows me the right output?

2895
02:47:00,120 --> 02:47:02,560
Because I put the correct logic in.

2896
02:47:02,560 --> 02:47:05,480
I didn't just use the right operator,
right the box

2897
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:10,080
put in right.

2898
02:47:10,080 --> 02:47:11,080
Any questions here?

2899
02:47:11,080 --> 02:47:14,760
This why, why did we sleep
and all that kind of stuff.

2900
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:24,560
Any questions for.

2901
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:26,920
Suffice

2902
02:47:27,240 --> 02:47:30,000
it to say that the

2903
02:47:31,080 --> 02:47:34,120
most system

2904
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:38,480
blocks we

2905
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:44,000
in. All right
this and I hope it's more than two people

2906
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:51,320
that don't have any questions right.

2907
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:54,680
The court will be on cameras
this the call will be on tenants.

2908
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:57,280
Right. And plus you guys needed
so right now all you do.

2909
02:47:57,280 --> 02:47:59,600
Guys, you guys just come here, okay?

2910
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:03,000
Alone wants to keep moving.

2911
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:11,960
All the.

2912
02:48:11,960 --> 02:48:16,120
All right.

2913
02:48:16,120 --> 02:48:21,040
I think they were all very very similar
just to develop

2914
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:24,840
your logic based on

2915
02:48:25,800 --> 02:48:26,520
the same thing.

2916
02:48:26,520 --> 02:48:28,680
Right. So what do we have in here? Right.

2917
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:32,200
We have our condition
and in their condition.

2918
02:48:32,200 --> 02:48:33,000
Right?

2919
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,160
So now it's

2920
02:48:39,280 --> 02:48:39,520
okay.

2921
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:41,040
Farhad, I want you.

2922
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:44,400
I want you to test your code,
because right now, the same with me.

2923
02:48:44,400 --> 02:48:49,560
Copy code.

2924
02:48:49,560 --> 02:48:51,920
Let me play this code animate.

2925
02:48:51,920 --> 02:49:03,960
And let me ask you guys, are we nesting
in here or we're not nesting?

2926
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:06,840
I want you to look at the code
I just copied from you this,

2927
02:49:07,080 --> 02:49:08,040
and I want you to look.

2928
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:12,960
I'm innocent or we're not nesting here.

2929
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:18,920
Why not?

2930
02:49:18,920 --> 02:49:20,680
We should be nesting, right?

2931
02:49:20,680 --> 02:49:22,160
We should be nesting.

2932
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:25,440
So now how can you find out for hot,
right?

2933
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:27,880
How can you find out
that you made the issue right?

2934
02:49:29,560 --> 02:49:31,200
So it's you know, it's in.

2935
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:35,600
You have to be eligible to the natural
blood if you're years old, right?

2936
02:49:35,640 --> 02:49:37,760
18 years or older. Right.

2937
02:49:37,760 --> 02:49:40,800
So now I'm going to change it to 16.

2938
02:49:41,240 --> 02:49:44,680
What will be the output of my program

2939
02:49:44,680 --> 02:49:48,880
if I'm going to logically, logically,
based on the assignment?

2940
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:53,040
It should be I'm not eligible,
but based on this code,

2941
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:55,800
what will be my output this

2942
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:04,880
likelihood our copy your code.

2943
02:50:04,880 --> 02:50:07,240
You just have to look right now.

2944
02:50:07,240 --> 02:50:09,760
So what will be the output
with the current values

2945
02:50:12,040 --> 02:50:13,360
you will be what?

2946
02:50:13,360 --> 02:50:16,320
Tell me guys,
how many outputs water will be Outputs.

2947
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:17,240
Tell me.

2948
02:50:17,880 --> 02:50:19,920
No, there's no error, guys.
I say the code.

2949
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:22,440
My my java is fine syntax is correct.

2950
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:24,200
Syntax is fine.

2951
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:30,880
Racism of this index is still fine.

2952
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:33,120
No output when you sign

2953
02:50:41,400 --> 02:50:47,200
you think it's

2954
02:50:54,120 --> 02:50:54,400
okay.

2955
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:57,600
Guys, let me ask you let me ask you 21

2956
02:50:57,600 --> 02:51:06,120
and 23.

2957
02:51:06,120 --> 02:51:06,600
Okay.

2958
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:11,000
So first of all,
how many if statements do they see?

2959
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,040
How many statements

2960
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:18,240
do are they dependent

2961
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:24,120
or they independent?

2962
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:25,760
They're independent, right.

2963
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:29,880
So first here you have one each statement,
then you have another.

2964
02:51:29,880 --> 02:51:32,520
If statement, there independent, Right.

2965
02:51:32,520 --> 02:51:33,760
The independent.

2966
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:38,720
So now it means are the two independent
if statements

2967
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,040
you going to have output from one

2968
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:43,560
and you're going to have an output
from another one. Why?

2969
02:51:43,560 --> 02:51:45,600
Because they have ls blocks. Right.

2970
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:49,120
So now if you're going to run,
what's going to happen

2971
02:51:49,400 --> 02:51:50,040
right

2972
02:51:54,600 --> 02:51:55,040
here?

2973
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:56,520
Right here?

2974
02:51:56,520 --> 02:51:58,640
Your program, no syntax issues.

2975
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:00,720
What you told me you're not eligible.

2976
02:52:00,720 --> 02:52:02,640
And now you accepted me, right?

2977
02:52:02,640 --> 02:52:06,360
So now logically,
we need a mistake in here, right?

2978
02:52:06,560 --> 02:52:12,960
So now, instead of the nested,
you two independent statements right now,

2979
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:18,000
this should be in this that statement
in which you blog this image block

2980
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:22,200
about the weight

2981
02:52:22,200 --> 02:52:28,920
in which block should we added in it
you look right inside of E block

2982
02:52:28,920 --> 02:52:32,880
and now because my E block right now

2983
02:52:33,280 --> 02:52:37,440
will consist right
because my can walk right now

2984
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:42,000
consists of one, two, three, four, five,
five lines of code.

2985
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,080
What do we need This

2986
02:52:51,480 --> 02:52:53,160
We need our basis.

2987
02:52:53,160 --> 02:52:55,920
We need our basis
because without the braces, Joe,

2988
02:52:55,920 --> 02:53:01,040
I can read only one statement after that
it things that everything belongs to.

2989
02:53:01,040 --> 02:53:04,200
The main quote page.

2990
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:04,960
Always, always.

2991
02:53:04,960 --> 02:53:08,720
Make sure you guys know where you're
nesting in the what are in here too?

2992
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:13,080
Because I don't like to do the coding
in this races.

2993
02:53:13,080 --> 02:53:14,360
Right this way.

2994
02:53:14,360 --> 02:53:18,120
It's easier for me visually easier to see
because what you guys have

2995
02:53:18,120 --> 02:53:20,000
to remember right this

2996
02:53:21,120 --> 02:53:23,960
why we trying to

2997
02:53:23,960 --> 02:53:26,040
get you in the habit of

2998
02:53:27,280 --> 02:53:28,960
giving the

2999
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:31,440
given the correct names for variables.

3000
02:53:31,440 --> 02:53:31,960
Right.

3001
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:35,520
Remember, there's your variables
have to have a meaningful name, right?

3002
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:40,680
Why we telling you that
you have to follow the camel case, right.

3003
02:53:40,680 --> 02:53:41,800
For variables. Right.

3004
02:53:41,800 --> 02:53:46,360
If the variable is long, we have to follow
the camel case right here.

3005
02:53:46,680 --> 02:53:49,720
Why do we tell you
that your classes should be.

3006
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:52,200
Well, that's of
the should be with the uppercase, right?

3007
02:53:52,680 --> 02:53:54,920
Because when you're doing your own coding,
it's fine.

3008
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:56,760
This your thing probably work.

3009
02:53:56,760 --> 02:53:59,400
You understand your program.

3010
02:53:59,400 --> 02:54:01,120
But eventually, guys, right.

3011
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:05,240
Eventually, once you graduate it,
once you start looking for a job

3012
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:08,640
and once you guys will be working, right,
So what happens?

3013
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:11,640
You guys will be working together
as a team, right?

3014
02:54:12,120 --> 02:54:14,760
There will be a team of two
or three automation

3015
02:54:14,760 --> 02:54:18,520
engineers, maybe five, six, seven, 20,
whatever that will be right.

3016
02:54:18,520 --> 02:54:21,680
And you guys all will be looking
into the same code, right?

3017
02:54:22,200 --> 02:54:25,360
And every company
will have those coding standards, right?

3018
02:54:25,720 --> 02:54:30,360
And you want to make sure that not just
you can understand your code,

3019
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:34,560
but other person, other person
who works with you, right.

3020
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:38,040
You will understand you could,
but you want to make sure you are equal.

3021
02:54:38,040 --> 02:54:39,280
Understand this, right?

3022
02:54:39,280 --> 02:54:42,960
That's why we trying to follow
get all this coding standards right

3023
02:54:44,040 --> 02:54:47,360
now is to make sure you use breaks
is we use your data.

3024
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:49,560
Right so this we to be

3025
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:53,760
easier for you for now
just for you to read in the sense by layer

3026
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:56,320
it will be very very beneficial
for your work.

3027
02:54:56,400 --> 02:54:59,760
You all right it's any questions?

3028
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:03,000
Any questions for a nesting
because we now live in nest and we will be

3029
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:15,920
combining honesty.

3030
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:18,040
Give me the time to copy and paste. Okay.

3031
02:55:18,040 --> 02:55:20,360
And one thing is, if

3032
02:55:20,360 --> 02:55:22,640
sometimes you don't have enough time to do

3033
02:55:22,640 --> 02:55:24,960
this,
time is what my suggestion to you guys.

3034
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:27,360
You can watch.

3035
02:55:27,360 --> 02:55:30,120
And this then and after class is over.

3036
02:55:30,120 --> 02:55:33,320
If you are not able to complete,
please sure you do those assignments

3037
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:35,520
and I will ask you probably

3038
02:55:35,520 --> 02:55:39,520
to redo the assignments in any way
this whether understanding or not.

3039
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:41,760
You understand? Okay. Yeah. Because

3040
02:55:42,840 --> 02:55:43,400
I want to be a

3041
02:55:43,400 --> 02:55:47,160
teacher and it's important guys
to pay to look into those details.

3042
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:47,400
Right?

3043
02:55:47,400 --> 02:55:51,960
Because sometimes if I'm showing something
and if you guys type in.

3044
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:52,480
Right.

3045
02:55:52,480 --> 02:55:56,520
You might miss some information
because your guarantee your code

3046
02:55:56,520 --> 02:55:57,840
and then if you're stuck

3047
02:55:57,840 --> 02:56:01,480
and you getting frustrated in there
with me, all God will be available to you.

3048
02:56:01,480 --> 02:56:04,480
This.

3049
02:56:04,480 --> 02:56:07,640
So now let me show you guys the debugging
and then

3050
02:56:09,240 --> 02:56:11,760
let me show you debugging this
and then we'll take a break.

3051
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:13,840
After break,
we will look into the scanner. Okay.

3052
02:56:14,360 --> 02:56:17,280
So once again, what I said,
debugging is a very,

3053
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:20,800
very useful feature
that everybody's doing.

3054
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:21,240
Right.

3055
02:56:21,240 --> 02:56:27,000
And Maybe now you want to find
that much of the benefits you enjoy.

3056
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:30,840
I will ask you to try doing it
the most benefits you guys will start

3057
02:56:30,840 --> 02:56:36,160
finding once we start learning
cycles, loops, some repetitive statements,

3058
02:56:36,840 --> 02:56:42,000
it will be visually very easy,
understandable for you to see and once

3059
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:46,920
our code becomes longer, longer, longer,
then it will be very beneficial for you.

3060
02:56:46,920 --> 02:56:51,480
So every automation engineer,
every programmer, guys, they all

3061
02:56:52,080 --> 02:56:55,040
using debugging,
because only by using debugging

3062
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:58,040
you can identify your mistakes,

3063
02:56:59,240 --> 02:57:02,000
debugging, you just slow execution
step by step.

3064
02:57:02,440 --> 02:57:07,680
So now when you just click on one, right
your job, it quickly runs.

3065
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:09,360
What do we do in debugging?

3066
02:57:09,360 --> 02:57:11,600
So now you control the piece.

3067
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:15,360
Okay, while debugging, you guys can define

3068
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:20,240
where you want to start to slow execution
and when you want to end.

3069
02:57:20,440 --> 02:57:22,680
Okay So you are in the control.

3070
02:57:23,400 --> 02:57:25,560
So in order to start debugging, right?

3071
02:57:26,440 --> 02:57:29,680
So of course the will there,
there's an option when you click on debug,

3072
02:57:29,840 --> 02:57:34,600
right, One option
or on your for some of you

3073
02:57:34,600 --> 02:57:38,800
probably just top left top right corner
which it will be, there will be a bug.

3074
02:57:39,280 --> 02:57:40,160
Greenberg Right.

3075
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:43,360
So meant that button is meant
for department, right?

3076
02:57:43,880 --> 02:57:47,280
But even if I click debug write debug
what I'm debugging me

3077
02:57:47,280 --> 02:57:51,200
writing the Java application
could still runs quickly, right?

3078
02:57:51,200 --> 02:57:53,720
You're not going to see the difference
where you click on what

3079
02:57:54,240 --> 02:57:55,880
or where you click on debug.

3080
02:57:55,880 --> 02:57:57,080
So number one thing,

3081
02:57:57,080 --> 02:58:00,960
what's important for debugging does
we have to add the breakpoint, right?

3082
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:04,240
You have to add a breakpoint

3083
02:58:04,240 --> 02:58:09,840
to identify the point from which point
you want to start to slow execution.

3084
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:12,920
Right? For example,

3085
02:58:13,080 --> 02:58:15,960
you don't want to probably debug
entire program, right?

3086
02:58:15,960 --> 02:58:17,720
I understand what's going on in here.

3087
02:58:17,720 --> 02:58:20,200
What I'm interested
I'm interested in this code.

3088
02:58:20,200 --> 02:58:20,800
Right.

3089
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:23,560
So it means I want to start
debugging from my line 18.

3090
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:25,160
So what I do, mess with your mouse.

3091
02:58:25,160 --> 02:58:28,080
Just left, left, left, left button.

3092
02:58:28,200 --> 02:58:31,120
You must you just double click
and it brings this button.

3093
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:35,560
Hey, go it say is when you have an always
is line breakpoint.

3094
02:58:35,560 --> 02:58:40,560
So it means from this point
your code will be breaking down.

3095
02:58:40,560 --> 02:58:44,400
And from this point
you can control your code while debugging.

3096
02:58:44,400 --> 02:58:45,000
Right.

3097
02:58:45,080 --> 02:58:49,840
Your breakpoint is not going to work
when you just want to click on run.

3098
02:58:49,840 --> 02:58:54,120
Your breakpoint is going to work all in
only when you're going to click on debug.

3099
02:58:54,360 --> 02:58:56,120
Okay, So now what do you do?

3100
02:58:56,120 --> 02:58:59,600
Once again, if you want to remove the same
thing, you just double click,

3101
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:01,920
okay?

3102
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:04,840
If you don't have the numbers,
all you guys do, right click here.

3103
02:59:05,400 --> 02:59:08,440
It tells you show line numbers
with difference.

3104
02:59:08,520 --> 02:59:10,480
You guys can select all of this, right?

3105
02:59:10,480 --> 02:59:11,760
All you do just right click.

3106
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:14,240
And this options are in there
if you don't see the numbers

3107
02:59:14,520 --> 02:59:16,000
because this isn't right.

3108
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:21,120
If you want to see the numbers,
you just show clip, show line numbers.

3109
02:59:21,120 --> 02:59:22,080
So what do you do?

3110
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:23,640
Double click with your mouse.

3111
02:59:23,640 --> 02:59:27,240
Now, once you have your breakpoint,
then you just do right click

3112
02:59:27,440 --> 02:59:31,280
and you see the option debug
and you just click on it.

3113
02:59:32,600 --> 02:59:36,640
So first time first by one,
you trying to debug

3114
02:59:36,920 --> 02:59:41,760
your idea will ask you for permission
because this is your java screen.

3115
02:59:41,760 --> 02:59:44,000
You can see it has a little g on the top.

3116
02:59:44,400 --> 02:59:49,640
So now your Java is asking your permission
to switch for the debug window.

3117
02:59:49,640 --> 02:59:50,280
Right?

3118
02:59:50,400 --> 02:59:52,720
And then this option
you just click on switch.

3119
02:59:53,040 --> 02:59:57,680
But if you don't want your ID
every time ask you for this option,

3120
02:59:57,960 --> 03:00:00,240
you'll just click.
Remember my decision, right?

3121
03:00:00,280 --> 03:00:03,400
But for now, I'll do it later
because I know I'll have to show it

3122
03:00:03,400 --> 03:00:04,160
multiple times.

3123
03:00:04,160 --> 03:00:09,240
All you do, you just go on switch
and what you will notice this one right?

3124
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:11,600
You are in the debug window.

3125
03:00:11,600 --> 03:00:14,600
So every other window you guys can ignore.

3126
03:00:15,080 --> 03:00:19,040
This is your main screen where you guys
have to see and all you have to do.

3127
03:00:19,040 --> 03:00:22,120
There's only one or two buttons
that we have to do this.

3128
03:00:22,240 --> 03:00:24,480
Okay, don't.

3129
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:26,280
First of

3130
03:00:26,280 --> 03:00:29,360
all, how do you know that
you run your code you to see here

3131
03:00:29,360 --> 03:00:32,960
is a red button, like a recording button
that you have, right?

3132
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:34,680
That means your you're running your code.

3133
03:00:34,680 --> 03:00:40,160
Your code is on the spin by if waiting for
your input, it's waiting for your input.

3134
03:00:40,600 --> 03:00:45,000
So now when we go, I am running
and that's why I'm doing this.

3135
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,520
I am running one woman

3136
03:00:48,080 --> 03:00:49,520
or one

3137
03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:52,440
woman.

3138
03:00:52,440 --> 03:00:57,600
Show you two buttons, right?

3139
03:00:58,400 --> 03:01:03,480
So here when you are on your debug screen
right here, my button selector.

3140
03:01:03,840 --> 03:01:06,120
So now there's this options
that we need to.

3141
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:07,080
See this.

3142
03:01:07,080 --> 03:01:08,560
You just have to look into this.

3143
03:01:08,560 --> 03:01:10,640
Two errors, two errors.

3144
03:01:10,640 --> 03:01:13,120
So one option says run into

3145
03:01:13,320 --> 03:01:15,800
and then the other one sees run over

3146
03:01:16,360 --> 03:01:19,320
or now we will select this longer error.

3147
03:01:19,560 --> 03:01:22,120
You'll just select this longer error.

3148
03:01:22,480 --> 03:01:24,240
And what this error will do this,

3149
03:01:24,240 --> 03:01:28,040
it will execute the line by line,
by line by line your code.

3150
03:01:28,560 --> 03:01:31,040
So what I do are click on this option.

3151
03:01:31,800 --> 03:01:33,960
It says step over. So not run over.

3152
03:01:33,960 --> 03:01:37,680
It's a step override step
by step will be taking the step over.

3153
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:38,080
Right.

3154
03:01:38,080 --> 03:01:41,840
Make sure you don't do you don't click
step into because it will take you

3155
03:01:41,840 --> 03:01:45,840
somewhere deep inside where you don't
want to be it right step over.

3156
03:01:45,920 --> 03:01:47,720
You just flip and step over.

3157
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:50,680
Oh, can you execute
step by step right now?

3158
03:01:50,760 --> 03:01:52,160
Obviously. Jump in here. Why?

3159
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:55,200
Because the IS was less than 16 right.

3160
03:01:55,200 --> 03:01:56,760
And then step over.

3161
03:01:56,760 --> 03:01:59,080
It executes that over exit.

3162
03:01:59,320 --> 03:02:02,760
That's a step back.

3163
03:02:02,760 --> 03:02:06,680
We will go as if some so
now how do you know that your call finish

3164
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:11,360
execution issue the button is disabled
okay so let's do once again

3165
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:15,000
the once again goes for a breakpoint.

3166
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:19,880
Make sure you have a breakpoint for
whichever line you want to have a guess.

3167
03:02:19,880 --> 03:02:20,480
Right?

3168
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:24,560
I want to how my if statement works,
I'll do the breakpoint in here.

3169
03:02:24,920 --> 03:02:25,240
Here.

3170
03:02:25,240 --> 03:02:26,200
I know what's going on.

3171
03:02:26,200 --> 03:02:28,360
I can I have this breakpoint in here.

3172
03:02:28,360 --> 03:02:32,120
I can edit this is initialization
or my variable know what's happening.

3173
03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:35,040
So I don't really care about the code
I hear from him.

3174
03:02:35,040 --> 03:02:35,280
Right?

3175
03:02:35,280 --> 03:02:37,920
So once you have your breakpoint,
double click right,

3176
03:02:38,320 --> 03:02:41,480
then all you do is just directly
and select the option.

3177
03:02:41,480 --> 03:02:42,600
Debug not running.

3178
03:02:42,600 --> 03:02:44,720
We are debugging right?

3179
03:02:45,240 --> 03:02:46,280
You book right.

3180
03:02:46,280 --> 03:02:48,760
First time this window will show right.

3181
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,480
Please make sure you select.
Remember my decision.

3182
03:02:51,480 --> 03:02:55,480
So this way there's more going to come up
all the time so it doesn't bother you.

3183
03:02:55,480 --> 03:02:58,880
So just so I can remember my
decision and click on Switch.

3184
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:00,480
If you

3185
03:03:00,480 --> 03:03:04,840
see green highlighted error line,
it means your debug mode.

3186
03:03:05,200 --> 03:03:07,240
How do you know you inaudible mode here?

3187
03:03:07,240 --> 03:03:11,280
Because there is a multiple sign
that you guys will see you right.

3188
03:03:11,280 --> 03:03:14,600
So all these buttons you could see
there is a run

3189
03:03:14,600 --> 03:03:17,840
button is enabled in the red button.

3190
03:03:17,840 --> 03:03:20,320
It means you are still executing
your code.

3191
03:03:20,320 --> 03:03:23,760
You want to stop, you can stop
and you step in and step over.

3192
03:03:23,760 --> 03:03:26,360
Buttons are enabled, right?

3193
03:03:26,760 --> 03:03:29,880
And all you have to do
is you just click, step over,

3194
03:03:29,880 --> 03:03:37,920
step over.

3195
03:03:37,920 --> 03:03:39,960
Mohammad You just can double click.

3196
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:49,640
You don't have to do the right click
just to double click.

3197
03:03:49,640 --> 03:03:53,600
The only one thing this
the only one thing I want to ask

3198
03:03:53,640 --> 03:03:56,560
all of you guys,
if you decide to debug, right?

3199
03:03:56,560 --> 03:03:59,120
For example, let me change in here.

3200
03:03:59,480 --> 03:04:00,000
Right?

3201
03:04:00,480 --> 03:04:04,920
For example, this if you decide to
debug, that's I want to debug

3202
03:04:06,200 --> 03:04:07,240
right now.

3203
03:04:07,240 --> 03:04:08,920
Let's say I started debugging, right?

3204
03:04:08,920 --> 03:04:10,760
I'll step over.

3205
03:04:10,760 --> 03:04:12,960
I'll do step forward.

3206
03:04:12,960 --> 03:04:13,480
Okay.

3207
03:04:13,480 --> 03:04:16,320
Now in here I've got my output right

3208
03:04:16,720 --> 03:04:19,440
and you did not finish right.

3209
03:04:19,920 --> 03:04:23,120
Then later, whenever
you want to try to debug another program,

3210
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:25,120
it might cause some issues. This.
That's right.

3211
03:04:25,400 --> 03:04:30,360
Please make sure if you are done debugging
right, make sure your code has stopped.

3212
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:31,920
Make sure your code has that.

3213
03:04:31,920 --> 03:04:34,200
Make sure you're terminated. Okay?

3214
03:04:34,200 --> 03:04:37,240
Or if you want your program
to finish running

3215
03:04:37,240 --> 03:04:40,520
without you doing anything,
just click on Run.

3216
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:44,040
So either
click on Run or either click on Stop.

3217
03:04:44,040 --> 03:04:46,560
Don't leave your program debug
in the middle.

3218
03:04:46,560 --> 03:04:47,400
Okay?

3219
03:04:47,400 --> 03:04:50,800
Because after that you're going to try
to run is going to run my run

3220
03:04:50,800 --> 03:04:54,160
something different when I try to debug
it might do something different.

3221
03:04:54,440 --> 03:04:57,680
Make sure if you start debugging,
make sure you finish.

3222
03:04:57,960 --> 03:04:58,600
Okay.

3223
03:04:58,600 --> 03:05:00,560
So if you don't want. Okay, I got it.

3224
03:05:00,560 --> 03:05:03,240
I got it. How that works.
I don't want to debug it. Okay.

3225
03:05:03,240 --> 03:05:07,080
Just terminated
terminated in the code will be terminated

3226
03:05:07,360 --> 03:05:10,640
or let's see if you debug in right
and then you change your mind

3227
03:05:11,280 --> 03:05:14,120
or you do just either click on run

3228
03:05:14,760 --> 03:05:18,280
resume or either
click on stop resume or stop.

3229
03:05:18,320 --> 03:05:20,880
But you want to make sure
your code is completed.

3230
03:05:21,200 --> 03:05:24,920
You want to make sure your Java stop
the execution, that it's

3231
03:05:24,920 --> 03:05:26,120
not spinning and waiting.

3232
03:05:26,120 --> 03:05:29,280
Because sometimes what might happen
as you might forget

3233
03:05:29,360 --> 03:05:32,640
and then what
you'll do, you'll go back to your Java,

3234
03:05:32,640 --> 03:05:37,320
you might start creating another class
and then you will be able to do the class.

3235
03:05:37,320 --> 03:05:40,920
But the program was closed in here,
so this way you don't forget.

3236
03:05:40,920 --> 03:05:41,160
Okay?

3237
03:05:41,160 --> 03:05:45,680
So always,
always make sure your this terminated.

3238
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:46,200
All right?

3239
03:05:46,200 --> 03:05:48,960
So you can try
and of course we will try more

3240
03:05:49,320 --> 03:05:52,800
and we will be trying more
every from every class.

3241
03:05:53,640 --> 03:05:55,760
Okay. So let's take a break, guys.

3242
03:05:55,760 --> 03:05:56,720
Let's take a break.

3243
03:05:56,720 --> 03:06:00,480
Let's let's be back by 2:00
and then we will look into this scanner.

3244
03:06:00,800 --> 03:06:03,360
I'll give you a few examples.

3245
03:06:03,360 --> 03:06:05,960
And then you guys will
have your tests to do. Get

3246
03:06:14,200 --> 03:06:15,040
how they're running.

3247
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:17,440
You figure.

3248
03:06:17,440 --> 03:06:20,000
But I changed the values right
now, as always.

3249
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:20,360
Always.

3250
03:06:20,360 --> 03:06:24,520
If you see that my output is different,
always look into my values.

3251
03:06:24,520 --> 03:06:26,280
Look into the values.

3252
03:06:26,280 --> 03:06:28,760
Then try to identify your code

3253
03:06:29,160 --> 03:06:32,880
and then find out what will be the output.

3254
03:06:32,880 --> 03:06:35,360
And then compare it with the

3255
03:06:37,880 --> 03:06:38,520
second test.

3256
03:06:38,520 --> 03:06:39,160
Second test.

3257
03:06:39,160 --> 03:06:53,520
Here goes.

3258
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:55,760
I promise not to confuse you guys.

3259
03:06:55,760 --> 03:06:57,880
I'll just keep this one

3260
03:06:57,880 --> 03:07:11,560
and I'll just do this one right.

3261
03:07:11,560 --> 03:07:14,480
Well,
let's try to try to look first. Right.

3262
03:07:14,920 --> 03:07:15,560
Try to.

3263
03:07:15,560 --> 03:07:19,800
You don't have to debug through the clips,
but the way I do because I like

3264
03:07:20,080 --> 03:07:23,000
because this is how you guys can develop
your logic.

3265
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,360
Try to just manually think of it. Okay.

3266
03:07:25,680 --> 03:07:27,680
In which case code will go here.

3267
03:07:27,680 --> 03:07:29,920
In which case it will go here. Right.

3268
03:07:30,120 --> 03:07:31,880
Tried to analyze you don't

3269
03:07:33,400 --> 03:07:34,480
look about what's my.

3270
03:07:34,480 --> 03:07:35,360
Yes, let me try.

3271
03:07:35,360 --> 03:07:38,280
Right. So whichever program
you want to debug right.

3272
03:07:38,280 --> 03:07:41,280
Which your program
you want to do back at the breakpoint.

3273
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:41,960
Right.

3274
03:07:41,960 --> 03:07:47,480
Are a breakpoint and then do right click
debug right click debug.

3275
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:49,800
What are you debugging Java application

3276
03:07:50,840 --> 03:07:53,840
How to activate the button in tools.

3277
03:07:54,920 --> 03:07:58,600
Oh, the tools are gone.

3278
03:07:58,600 --> 03:08:04,680
You mean that
you mean while you're debugging, you have

3279
03:08:04,760 --> 03:08:08,520
you have to start debugging and
you have to switch to the debug window.

3280
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:11,920
Yep. So you will have to start debugging,
right?

3281
03:08:12,360 --> 03:08:14,080
So from whichever point, right.

3282
03:08:14,080 --> 03:08:15,400
For example. Right.

3283
03:08:15,400 --> 03:08:19,200
Look, if you want to put the debug right,
for example.

3284
03:08:19,200 --> 03:08:19,880
Right.

3285
03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:22,480
Let me start just running.

3286
03:08:22,480 --> 03:08:26,240
So for example, if you want to try,
could you back from the line 23.

3287
03:08:26,320 --> 03:08:27,160
Right.

3288
03:08:27,280 --> 03:08:31,800
So in order for you to debug from line 23,
it means you code

3289
03:08:32,040 --> 03:08:34,920
will have to come to the last part, right?

3290
03:08:35,360 --> 03:08:37,320
So that's why I always,
always pay attention.

3291
03:08:37,320 --> 03:08:40,760
I always try to, if I'm going to debug
always for the beginning

3292
03:08:40,920 --> 03:08:42,600
your eve statement. Right.

3293
03:08:42,600 --> 03:08:45,680
And then for the breakpoint right click
do or

3294
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:50,880
debug job application
switch to the debug window right.

3295
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:54,160
And then if you did everything correctly,
you will see that

3296
03:08:54,840 --> 03:08:56,560
the line will be green highlighted.

3297
03:08:56,560 --> 03:08:58,560
It means where your code is pulse,

3298
03:08:58,560 --> 03:09:01,920
your java is in
there is waiting you to control it

3299
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:04,360
and then you just

3300
03:09:04,360 --> 03:09:07,800
then hear the all will be there,
all will be

3301
03:09:09,880 --> 03:09:13,680
there, all will be enabled

3302
03:09:24,040 --> 03:09:31,720
in second.

3303
03:09:31,760 --> 03:09:34,880
Why do you think in the you
you are getting that you are not eligible

3304
03:09:34,880 --> 03:09:39,360
to download blood
because your our condition is your

3305
03:09:40,400 --> 03:09:48,120
your your condition is false right.

3306
03:09:48,120 --> 03:09:52,040
Let me see.

3307
03:09:52,040 --> 03:09:53,400
No, in here We we did it.

3308
03:09:53,400 --> 03:09:55,520
That's
why we did the right nesting. Right.

3309
03:09:55,520 --> 03:09:57,800
So now if you will be 17, right.

3310
03:09:57,800 --> 03:10:00,760
You just have to make sure if you fix
if you will be set.

3311
03:10:00,840 --> 03:10:03,400
Oops. Not been here 18. Right.

3312
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:06,520
If you achieve this 17. Right.

3313
03:10:07,080 --> 03:10:09,360
So condition will be false in here.

3314
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:12,040
You will jump only to the else for right.

3315
03:10:12,840 --> 03:10:14,520
You will be eligible. You will.

3316
03:10:14,520 --> 03:10:17,960
We can accept you only
and only when this condition will

3317
03:10:17,960 --> 03:10:29,200
be true. You

3318
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:38,920
orange Leslie.

3319
03:10:38,920 --> 03:10:40,600
Okay, now it's already 152.

3320
03:10:40,600 --> 03:10:43,760
Let's be back by qualifying 12 Oh, replace

3321
03:10:45,240 --> 03:10:46,320
recording. Okay.

3322
03:10:46,320 --> 03:10:47,160
Thank you. Thank you for.

3323
03:10:47,160 --> 03:10:48,320
The remaining

3324
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:51,000
work as well regarding the scanner.

3325
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:51,680
Right.

3326
03:10:51,680 --> 03:10:55,680
So one thing I want you to remember
about the scanner right before we start

3327
03:10:55,680 --> 03:10:59,160
looking into into what it is,
and I hope you guys have a look already.

3328
03:10:59,880 --> 03:11:00,480
Okay.

3329
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:02,880
We are bringing scanner guys only.

3330
03:11:02,880 --> 03:11:05,040
Only, only for learning purposes.

3331
03:11:05,040 --> 03:11:09,120
Okay,
So you are not going to use the scanner

3332
03:11:09,280 --> 03:11:13,320
after probably class number
ten or 11 or 12.

3333
03:11:13,360 --> 03:11:14,040
Right.

3334
03:11:14,240 --> 03:11:18,160
So we bring in it
and only to make our program

3335
03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:22,880
more interactive so
and to help you develop a stronger logic.

3336
03:11:23,240 --> 03:11:26,680
And of course, definitely, guys,
when it comes to the

3337
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:30,720
working environment, you guys are never
going to work with a scanner.

3338
03:11:30,720 --> 03:11:33,000
So scanner is very easy.

3339
03:11:33,000 --> 03:11:37,120
So there is a two lines that you guys
probably will have to memorize

3340
03:11:37,560 --> 03:11:40,800
because
based on the current level of knowledge,

3341
03:11:41,720 --> 03:11:44,240
I won't be able to explain
all the details.

3342
03:11:44,240 --> 03:11:46,320
So you have to take it as it is.

3343
03:11:46,320 --> 03:11:49,480
But there is only two or three lines
that you guys have to remember.

3344
03:11:49,480 --> 03:11:53,280
Okay, so now when we look to this scanner,

3345
03:11:53,280 --> 03:11:57,560
this okay, scanner is a special class.

3346
03:11:57,720 --> 03:12:00,960
The way the way we have a string, right?

3347
03:12:00,960 --> 03:12:02,320
You guys look over the string.

3348
03:12:02,320 --> 03:12:04,040
You say the string is a class

3349
03:12:05,160 --> 03:12:07,120
that pulls the values, right?

3350
03:12:07,120 --> 03:12:08,400
That hold the values.

3351
03:12:08,400 --> 03:12:12,360
So anything you put inside a double code
is considered to be a string, Right?

3352
03:12:12,760 --> 03:12:15,560
So now this is another test of class.

3353
03:12:15,560 --> 03:12:17,760
We look at equal scanner.

3354
03:12:17,760 --> 03:12:20,760
Okay,
so why do we need scanner, for example?

3355
03:12:21,400 --> 03:12:24,640
We need to represent the values right of

3356
03:12:25,840 --> 03:12:27,360
multiple

3357
03:12:28,400 --> 03:12:29,640
the to do

3358
03:12:29,640 --> 03:12:33,960
the two two strings
we use to display the values right of

3359
03:12:35,280 --> 03:12:36,920
collection of characters.

3360
03:12:36,920 --> 03:12:40,760
Now, when we talk about a scanner scanner
we will be using

3361
03:12:40,760 --> 03:12:43,920
to take an input from our user.

3362
03:12:43,920 --> 03:12:44,680
Right?

3363
03:12:44,760 --> 03:12:46,160
Right now, who is the user?

3364
03:12:46,160 --> 03:12:48,360
I am developing my own programs.

3365
03:12:48,360 --> 03:12:50,800
I'm using them,
so I'm a user of my own program.

3366
03:12:50,840 --> 03:12:55,320
So now with the help of Scanner,
what I will be able to do,

3367
03:12:55,320 --> 03:12:58,800
I will be able to capture my own inputs

3368
03:12:59,320 --> 03:13:02,600
and to be able to use them in my program.

3369
03:13:02,680 --> 03:13:05,240
Okay, so now there's a two steps.

3370
03:13:05,240 --> 03:13:06,360
We will have to do this.

3371
03:13:06,360 --> 03:13:09,160
Okay, So step number one, this.

3372
03:13:09,160 --> 03:13:13,200
When you create in your scanner,
do not ever name your class scanner,

3373
03:13:13,640 --> 03:13:18,600
don't need your class and scanner.

3374
03:13:18,880 --> 03:13:19,960
Right. Why?

3375
03:13:19,960 --> 03:13:23,400
Because scanner, it's already
existing class, right?

3376
03:13:23,400 --> 03:13:26,760
The same thing is a string,
so don't ever name it.

3377
03:13:26,760 --> 03:13:27,000
Right.

3378
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:30,120
You Can name it, Scanner them a scanner.

3379
03:13:30,120 --> 03:13:32,640
Example. What?
A scanner. Introduction. Right

3380
03:13:34,240 --> 03:13:34,800
now just

3381
03:13:34,800 --> 03:13:38,880
create a scanner.

3382
03:13:38,880 --> 03:13:39,800
Scanner.

3383
03:13:39,840 --> 03:13:40,440
Minimal.

3384
03:13:40,440 --> 03:13:44,240
Okay, I should be double in, but that's

3385
03:13:48,240 --> 03:13:51,960
and I know
it's it's not reserved for guys.

3386
03:13:51,960 --> 03:13:53,560
Remember any original words.

3387
03:13:53,560 --> 03:13:55,800
They are keywords, right.

3388
03:13:55,800 --> 03:13:59,640
And those keywords you guys can see
the way we specify them in here.

3389
03:13:59,640 --> 03:13:59,880
Right.

3390
03:13:59,880 --> 03:14:02,640
Scanner is actually should be true in

3391
03:14:02,640 --> 03:14:03,760
scanner.

3392
03:14:04,440 --> 03:14:06,560
Let me.

3393
03:14:06,560 --> 03:14:07,160
Okay.

3394
03:14:07,440 --> 03:14:09,120
Scanner. It's a class.

3395
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:11,280
It's already defined class.

3396
03:14:11,280 --> 03:14:15,760
It's already created class
that is inside the Java library.

3397
03:14:16,400 --> 03:14:21,160
And the purpose of that class
is to capture input from a user.

3398
03:14:21,280 --> 03:14:23,680
The same thing
like we have a straight right

3399
03:14:24,120 --> 03:14:26,960
string is already
a class that we have created

3400
03:14:26,960 --> 03:14:31,600
and it stays in the Java library
for our usage.

3401
03:14:33,240 --> 03:14:36,960
So in order for us to create a scanner,

3402
03:14:37,880 --> 03:14:41,280
one line you guys will have to kind of
like memorize, right?

3403
03:14:41,280 --> 03:14:43,840
But just to give you a little bit
example, right?

3404
03:14:43,840 --> 03:14:48,600
So whenever we create a variable, right,
whenever we create a variable here,

3405
03:14:50,160 --> 03:14:53,040
right, let's say ABC, right?

3406
03:14:53,040 --> 03:14:55,400
So steps we are falling, right?

3407
03:14:55,400 --> 03:15:00,320
So we're giving the name the specifying
what is a type of the variable, right.

3408
03:15:00,320 --> 03:15:04,640
What type of values we need to store
and in this case storing and storing Now.

3409
03:15:04,640 --> 03:15:05,480
That's right.

3410
03:15:05,480 --> 03:15:08,640
So now when it comes to the scanner,
that's a case scanner.

3411
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:10,560
It's a special right.

3412
03:15:10,560 --> 03:15:12,400
It's special type.

3413
03:15:12,400 --> 03:15:17,720
So it will be of the non primitive type
and as a string being primitive

3414
03:15:17,720 --> 03:15:22,160
and the scanner being primitive,
they have to start with the uppercase.

3415
03:15:22,160 --> 03:15:25,200
So we will type
scanner, we'll have to type a scanner.

3416
03:15:25,520 --> 03:15:27,840
And then based on their

3417
03:15:29,360 --> 03:15:31,080
rules, we have to give a name. Right.

3418
03:15:31,080 --> 03:15:33,480
I'll just give a name. For example.
Get right.

3419
03:15:33,880 --> 03:15:35,520
It can be anything. Remember this?

3420
03:15:35,520 --> 03:15:37,640
I have a box, right?

3421
03:15:37,640 --> 03:15:40,120
I can name this box whichever way I want.

3422
03:15:40,360 --> 03:15:41,080
Right.

3423
03:15:41,160 --> 03:15:46,480
So now here you created the variable
that can hold string type of values.

3424
03:15:46,800 --> 03:15:51,480
Here we create in the variable
that can hold a scanner.

3425
03:15:51,480 --> 03:15:54,360
What is a scanner
scanner is a special clause

3426
03:15:55,120 --> 03:15:59,600
that will allow me to take that
input from a user who is a user.

3427
03:15:59,600 --> 03:16:00,840
A user is me.

3428
03:16:00,840 --> 03:16:03,080
Okay, so now

3429
03:16:03,080 --> 03:16:06,400
the only thing initialization part
will look a little bit different, right?

3430
03:16:06,720 --> 03:16:10,000
So in here we will have to type new
and if you guys see

3431
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:13,560
it's a special keyword, okay,
you guys will only know what is means

3432
03:16:13,920 --> 03:16:16,560
and now we will have two
or three types scanner

3433
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:21,080
and then so this one, you guys
will have to memorize it once you start

3434
03:16:21,080 --> 03:16:25,720
learning objects in the classes, then
you will get you will gain more deep idea.

3435
03:16:25,720 --> 03:16:29,960
Why do we use new
and why do we use the parentheses in here?

3436
03:16:29,960 --> 03:16:34,080
Okay, so in here,
this big system that system that we

3437
03:16:35,840 --> 03:16:37,680
so system that out when

3438
03:16:37,680 --> 03:16:42,600
I tried to print something system
that in one they try to capture something

3439
03:16:42,600 --> 03:16:45,560
so where we will be capturing this system

3440
03:16:45,640 --> 03:16:49,120
but in this slide what it enables me

3441
03:16:49,440 --> 03:16:52,240
it enables me to capture the

3442
03:16:52,280 --> 03:16:55,840
any input
that we will be doing from our keyboard.

3443
03:16:55,840 --> 03:16:59,400
Okay, so our scanner now, once

3444
03:16:59,400 --> 03:17:03,480
I start executing my program,
I will be able to type in my console.

3445
03:17:03,480 --> 03:17:05,880
For example,
I want to type my name, right?

3446
03:17:06,240 --> 03:17:08,280
I want to check my name. Okay.

3447
03:17:08,280 --> 03:17:11,280
So now, with the help
of how how it will be possible,

3448
03:17:11,280 --> 03:17:15,760
it will be possible
with the help of scanner and using this.

3449
03:17:15,760 --> 03:17:16,720
So now what?

3450
03:17:16,720 --> 03:17:20,760
I read the name,
I will try it or whatever the value,

3451
03:17:20,760 --> 03:17:23,880
I will try to type from here.

3452
03:17:24,120 --> 03:17:29,320
Then this
I will have to store it inside my code.

3453
03:17:29,440 --> 03:17:29,720
Okay.

3454
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:33,320
So that's what
this line does because it just creates

3455
03:17:33,320 --> 03:17:37,160
as a scanner and enables
a keyboard for us.

3456
03:17:37,240 --> 03:17:38,160
That's what it does.

3457
03:17:38,160 --> 03:17:40,400
Okay, so now our program is ready.

3458
03:17:41,040 --> 03:17:44,440
Now in your console,
you can enter whatever thing you want.

3459
03:17:44,440 --> 03:17:47,200
So now when it comes to

3460
03:17:47,520 --> 03:17:48,800
different values, right?

3461
03:17:48,800 --> 03:17:50,240
So remember this.

3462
03:17:50,240 --> 03:17:53,240
There is a different data types in Java

3463
03:17:53,360 --> 03:17:55,560
that represent different values, right?

3464
03:17:56,280 --> 03:17:58,480
So what type of data type heroes case?

3465
03:17:58,480 --> 03:18:01,200
What type of values

3466
03:18:04,840 --> 03:18:05,840
it doing?

3467
03:18:05,840 --> 03:18:07,200
What if I will enter 12?

3468
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:08,520
What is 12

3469
03:18:12,240 --> 03:18:12,920
engager?

3470
03:18:12,920 --> 03:18:16,560
What if the 1299

3471
03:18:18,080 --> 03:18:19,440
double right?

3472
03:18:19,440 --> 03:18:24,640
So there is a different type of values
I as a user can enter.

3473
03:18:25,080 --> 03:18:30,000
Now I have to make sure my program
is able to capture captured.

3474
03:18:30,200 --> 03:18:34,480
Okay, so now because I can enter
different type of values,

3475
03:18:34,800 --> 03:18:37,560
there is a different ways house scanner

3476
03:18:37,560 --> 03:18:43,520
can capture for every different
type of value is scanned,

3477
03:18:43,560 --> 03:18:45,640
there uses different way.

3478
03:18:45,840 --> 03:18:47,560
For example right.

3479
03:18:47,560 --> 03:18:51,040
If I want to capture
and the name is a string value.

3480
03:18:51,240 --> 03:18:52,960
So now what?

3481
03:18:52,960 --> 03:18:56,640
We will have to do all in here guys.

3482
03:18:56,640 --> 03:19:01,080
We will have to do import
because this scanner right now

3483
03:19:01,120 --> 03:19:05,040
scanner the code of the scanner
class is inside this library.

3484
03:19:05,640 --> 03:19:09,000
So think weighted lead somewhere
in different country.

3485
03:19:09,280 --> 03:19:13,560
So now what we have to do,
we have to import it to our class.

3486
03:19:13,920 --> 03:19:16,680
You have to bring it to a country
so you can use it.

3487
03:19:16,760 --> 03:19:16,960
Okay.

3488
03:19:16,960 --> 03:19:20,720
So if you click in here,
it will give you the option import

3489
03:19:21,280 --> 03:19:23,880
or there is a shorter way
how you guys can do it.

3490
03:19:23,880 --> 03:19:25,360
Shortcut to import.

3491
03:19:25,360 --> 03:19:29,120
Do you just shortcut to import to import

3492
03:19:32,400 --> 03:19:34,600
existing class?

3493
03:19:34,720 --> 03:19:37,560
So then you do the current class

3494
03:19:39,240 --> 03:19:40,360
first class.

3495
03:19:40,360 --> 03:19:42,400
So a short way will be

3496
03:19:43,720 --> 03:19:45,000
for Mac users.

3497
03:19:45,000 --> 03:19:47,400
You guys will use

3498
03:19:47,560 --> 03:19:50,680
a month the last shift plus four.

3499
03:19:50,680 --> 03:19:52,720
Okay, this is Mac users.

3500
03:19:52,720 --> 03:19:55,920
What you guys will do
and the Windows users

3501
03:19:56,720 --> 03:20:00,080
you guys will do control shift
what you and I can do it

3502
03:20:00,920 --> 03:20:04,520
or you can do it
manually just by clicking Windows

3503
03:20:05,880 --> 03:20:11,560
Control system. Yep.

3504
03:20:11,960 --> 03:20:12,680
So what do you do?

3505
03:20:12,680 --> 03:20:15,720
Come on shift or so now what will happen?

3506
03:20:15,720 --> 03:20:18,520
Our import will come.

3507
03:20:18,520 --> 03:20:20,760
So it means this scanner class

3508
03:20:21,080 --> 03:20:24,840
leaves in somewhere
utilizing some of the utility library.

3509
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:28,440
We don't have to go that deep in there,
but that would basically it means.

3510
03:20:28,440 --> 03:20:29,000
Right.

3511
03:20:29,160 --> 03:20:31,880
So now once you importer,
once you brought it right now

3512
03:20:31,880 --> 03:20:36,880
there's no issue in
my code is not each. No.

3513
03:20:36,920 --> 03:20:39,120
We need to take our scanner.

3514
03:20:39,240 --> 03:20:43,560
We need to have our scanner
and to capture the value.

3515
03:20:44,280 --> 03:20:48,240
Now this variable refers to the scanner.

3516
03:20:48,720 --> 03:20:52,440
Exact the same thing
as this variable refers to the string.

3517
03:20:52,440 --> 03:20:53,120
Right.

3518
03:20:53,160 --> 03:20:56,640
If I want to reassign the value,
guess I'm going to say

3519
03:20:56,640 --> 03:21:00,000
straight SDR equals x, y, z. Right.

3520
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:02,880
So what I'm doing,
I'm referring to the variable.

3521
03:21:03,160 --> 03:21:05,160
I'm referring to a box. Right.

3522
03:21:05,160 --> 03:21:06,560
So the same thing in here.

3523
03:21:06,560 --> 03:21:10,720
Any time you want to work with a scanner,
you have to refer to the variable, right?

3524
03:21:12,640 --> 03:21:13,600
We import a scanner.

3525
03:21:13,600 --> 03:21:15,320
This, you guys will see a line.

3526
03:21:15,320 --> 03:21:17,000
We will get imported in here.

3527
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:21,960
So now we have to work with the variable
that points out to our scanner.

3528
03:21:21,960 --> 03:21:25,960
So now what I will do,
I will type scan right now,

3529
03:21:26,040 --> 03:21:29,280
what I'm trying to do, I'm
trying to capture the name.

3530
03:21:29,840 --> 03:21:33,560
Name is or what type of value
name is this tree

3531
03:21:34,080 --> 03:21:36,600
Now to string what I have to use,

3532
03:21:36,600 --> 03:21:39,600
I have to scan that next.

3533
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:41,760
Okay, so scan that mix.

3534
03:21:41,760 --> 03:21:43,920
What it will do guys, it will

3535
03:21:45,120 --> 03:21:48,480
it will capture

3536
03:21:48,800 --> 03:21:49,360
things

3537
03:21:50,080 --> 03:21:53,480
value from console.

3538
03:21:53,480 --> 03:21:54,960
So for example. Right.

3539
03:21:54,960 --> 03:22:00,120
So for example, what will happen right now
when I enter my name.

3540
03:22:00,280 --> 03:22:01,000
Right.

3541
03:22:01,360 --> 03:22:04,600
So this line will be able to capture it.

3542
03:22:05,760 --> 03:22:07,200
Now I have a value.

3543
03:22:07,200 --> 03:22:08,720
What do we do with the values though?

3544
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:10,360
I need to store this now somewhere.

3545
03:22:10,360 --> 03:22:12,640
This if I, if I grab the value

3546
03:22:15,080 --> 03:22:16,480
so now because

3547
03:22:16,480 --> 03:22:19,240
I grab the value,
I have to store it right.

3548
03:22:19,480 --> 03:22:23,560
We like to store things
because we want to use it in the future.

3549
03:22:23,560 --> 03:22:24,120
Right.

3550
03:22:24,240 --> 03:22:25,920
So now what type of variable?

3551
03:22:25,920 --> 03:22:29,280
I got a string right. I've got a string.

3552
03:22:29,280 --> 03:22:34,360
So now this value will be stored
in here, right?

3553
03:22:34,360 --> 03:22:35,920
It will be shown in here.

3554
03:22:35,920 --> 03:22:39,520
So now what I have to do because I grab it
all I do, I just have to store it.

3555
03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:42,360
So I will start it inside string

3556
03:22:42,360 --> 03:22:44,480
and I need to give a name.

3557
03:22:44,560 --> 03:22:47,080
I can just say name, right?

3558
03:22:47,080 --> 03:22:50,480
So now the value that you you type in

3559
03:22:50,480 --> 03:22:53,320
your console
will be stored inside this variable.

3560
03:22:53,520 --> 03:22:57,720
So now what I will do this
will allow me to capture any string value

3561
03:22:57,720 --> 03:22:58,880
from capturing the string.

3562
03:22:58,880 --> 03:23:02,960
Now leave a storage
inside the string variable right name.

3563
03:23:03,960 --> 03:23:06,160
And now what I can look into do so

3564
03:23:06,480 --> 03:23:11,160
and I'll just take me right now,
just type me.

3565
03:23:11,160 --> 03:23:13,800
So now let me try to run it

3566
03:23:15,240 --> 03:23:16,520
when I run it.

3567
03:23:16,520 --> 03:23:19,240
So I guess nothing happens.
Nothing happens.

3568
03:23:19,600 --> 03:23:20,840
But what do you guys will see?

3569
03:23:20,840 --> 03:23:22,920
You guys will see the red button in here.

3570
03:23:22,920 --> 03:23:25,320
So it means your program is running.
It's waiting.

3571
03:23:25,440 --> 03:23:26,760
Okay, It's waiting.

3572
03:23:26,760 --> 03:23:28,680
So now where is it exactly?

3573
03:23:28,680 --> 03:23:31,400
Waiting. It's
waiting for you in here. This.

3574
03:23:31,920 --> 03:23:35,960
It's waiting for you
to enter a string value.

3575
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:36,640
Right.

3576
03:23:36,640 --> 03:23:39,720
Okay.

3577
03:23:39,720 --> 03:23:41,360
Yeah, right.

3578
03:23:41,400 --> 03:23:43,520
I entered, right? I typed.

3579
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:47,200
So now, before you guys were not able
to tap on the console label.

3580
03:23:47,640 --> 03:23:49,200
So now what will happen?

3581
03:23:49,200 --> 03:23:52,000
This value will be stored in here.

3582
03:23:52,320 --> 03:23:56,000
And then all you're doing, you
just printing the value inside this box.

3583
03:23:56,000 --> 03:23:56,880
The only thing

3584
03:23:58,040 --> 03:23:58,520
in order

3585
03:23:58,520 --> 03:24:01,680
for you to continue the problem,
you guys will have to hit.

3586
03:24:01,680 --> 03:24:02,600
Enter.

3587
03:24:02,720 --> 03:24:05,840
Just hit, enter. Go here.

3588
03:24:05,880 --> 03:24:09,560
This name was capturing inside this box
and then we have printing it.

3589
03:24:10,360 --> 03:24:11,680
That's what happens.

3590
03:24:11,680 --> 03:24:13,000
Or we cannot add in here.

3591
03:24:13,000 --> 03:24:16,200
So no say hello

3592
03:24:16,240 --> 03:24:18,720
right now.

3593
03:24:18,720 --> 03:24:21,360
This is first time I'm running right now.

3594
03:24:21,360 --> 03:24:22,200
Can I run it?

3595
03:24:22,200 --> 03:24:24,480
Run it again? Sure, I can run it again.

3596
03:24:24,480 --> 03:24:26,840
Oh, plus if you need

3597
03:24:29,800 --> 03:24:33,120
signal,
you can even let me say I want to enter.

3598
03:24:33,120 --> 03:24:35,400
Delete. Right.
I want to enter the name Mariem.

3599
03:24:36,040 --> 03:24:37,800
They go. No. Tells me Mariam.

3600
03:24:37,800 --> 03:24:38,840
Before I was telling me.

3601
03:24:38,840 --> 03:24:41,040
Hello, Hanoch, I want to enter my name.

3602
03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:43,200
It will capture my name. Right.

3603
03:24:43,200 --> 03:24:44,680
So I guess you want what happened?

3604
03:24:44,680 --> 03:24:47,280
Our program become interactive right.

3605
03:24:47,280 --> 03:24:51,320
So now instead of the specifying
Hey value name is equal to us,

3606
03:24:51,320 --> 03:24:55,480
so what I'm doing, I'm able to capture it
from my console, right?

3607
03:24:55,480 --> 03:24:57,680
I'm able to capture for my keyboard.

3608
03:24:58,080 --> 03:25:01,360
So now every time I can enter
different names

3609
03:25:01,680 --> 03:25:05,040
and my program will display me
a different different names, right?

3610
03:25:06,120 --> 03:25:08,040
So now, for example,

3611
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:11,520
I want to capture an H, right?

3612
03:25:11,520 --> 03:25:13,600
I want to capture the H, right.

3613
03:25:13,600 --> 03:25:18,240
For example,
let's add the statement for let's say we

3614
03:25:19,360 --> 03:25:20,520
enter

3615
03:25:21,560 --> 03:25:22,200
your.

3616
03:25:22,200 --> 03:25:26,400
Okay,
so now H is a different data type, right?

3617
03:25:26,400 --> 03:25:30,960
To capture a integer value the same thing.

3618
03:25:30,960 --> 03:25:33,960
What we will have to do,
we will have to refer to it as Skinner.

3619
03:25:34,560 --> 03:25:36,120
I'll refer to it as Skinner.

3620
03:25:36,120 --> 03:25:39,480
And now what I'm capturing,
I'm captured as an option.

3621
03:25:39,480 --> 03:25:41,800
We have to select next integer.

3622
03:25:42,760 --> 03:25:45,320
Next integer to capture a string values

3623
03:25:45,480 --> 03:25:49,680
we do next to capture integer value,
we do next integer.

3624
03:25:50,240 --> 03:25:51,320
Now what are this thing?

3625
03:25:51,320 --> 03:25:54,120
If I'm going to enter the age,
what type of variable it will be

3626
03:25:54,360 --> 03:25:55,920
if I'm trying to capture integers?

3627
03:25:55,920 --> 03:26:03,200
So what type of box I have to create?

3628
03:26:03,200 --> 03:26:10,200
Integer it's empty and right H Well, 1321
So when you want 51 right so it will be.

3629
03:26:10,200 --> 03:26:11,120
H Right

3630
03:26:12,640 --> 03:26:15,160
now I can think so.

3631
03:26:15,160 --> 03:26:19,760
Let's say whatever name
I capture captured right name.

3632
03:26:19,760 --> 03:26:24,240
And that's some confirmation
that they will capture the name.

3633
03:26:24,240 --> 03:26:24,600
Right.

3634
03:26:24,600 --> 03:26:29,520
So you are whatever age we capture it

3635
03:26:31,160 --> 03:26:32,160
let's

3636
03:26:35,440 --> 03:26:37,120
figure right

3637
03:26:37,120 --> 03:26:40,320
so now what you see
let's try to see how it will work

3638
03:26:41,400 --> 03:26:44,160
right again my program is waiting

3639
03:26:44,400 --> 03:26:47,360
where it's waiting you don't see
because a program was running.

3640
03:26:47,360 --> 03:26:48,840
But I'll tell you guys was waiting.

3641
03:26:48,840 --> 03:26:50,880
It's waiting on the line 18.

3642
03:26:50,880 --> 03:26:55,240
It's waiting for you
to enter a string type of value.

3643
03:26:55,400 --> 03:26:56,120
Right?

3644
03:26:56,560 --> 03:26:59,160
Echo You got this. My name, my right.

3645
03:26:59,440 --> 03:27:01,320
Then I hit enter.

3646
03:27:01,320 --> 03:27:03,320
So now what happened?

3647
03:27:03,320 --> 03:27:04,880
I saw nine here.

3648
03:27:04,880 --> 03:27:06,440
Now I'm printing. Hello?

3649
03:27:06,440 --> 03:27:07,480
Right here.

3650
03:27:07,480 --> 03:27:09,840
I captured now my program.

3651
03:27:10,200 --> 03:27:14,120
Nice to add the output right now
tells me please enter your H.

3652
03:27:14,240 --> 03:27:14,880
Right.

3653
03:27:15,000 --> 03:27:17,960
So it means this line 22 was executed.

3654
03:27:17,960 --> 03:27:19,760
Now my code is waiting.

3655
03:27:19,760 --> 03:27:23,400
Is waiting for me
to enter some integer value.

3656
03:27:23,920 --> 03:27:25,800
Now let me see. I'm going to enter.

3657
03:27:25,800 --> 03:27:26,440
I don't know.

3658
03:27:26,440 --> 03:27:28,280
Just I'll just add 21. Right?

3659
03:27:28,280 --> 03:27:33,400
For example,
so now 21 will be stored in here

3660
03:27:33,840 --> 03:27:37,440
and then I'm just printing date and values

3661
03:27:37,440 --> 03:27:44,080
that are stored inside this boxes.

3662
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:46,520
Yep. Yep.
So that's, that's a good one of my rights.

3663
03:27:46,520 --> 03:27:51,240
And now if you guys really look right,
if I'm going to try to run again.

3664
03:27:51,240 --> 03:27:54,440
So now my program is waiting right

3665
03:27:54,920 --> 03:27:58,120
So you kind of like don't really know
what your program is waiting for.

3666
03:27:58,400 --> 03:27:59,480
Well, for example, right.

3667
03:27:59,480 --> 03:28:02,160
Maybe you have your friend,
you have your family next to you

3668
03:28:02,160 --> 03:28:04,400
and you want to show them
what you have done today.

3669
03:28:04,440 --> 03:28:07,640
Right now, you created this program
so you would

3670
03:28:08,160 --> 03:28:10,280
give kind of like construction, right?

3671
03:28:10,280 --> 03:28:11,160
You give it to your brother

3672
03:28:11,160 --> 03:28:14,560
insisting, going to say,
hey, can you check this exercise right?

3673
03:28:14,560 --> 03:28:17,520
You click on Run for Them
and you want them to do the things right.

3674
03:28:17,640 --> 03:28:22,560
So you want to do the instructions
so your user knows what to do, right?

3675
03:28:22,880 --> 03:28:23,160
Okay.

3676
03:28:23,160 --> 03:28:27,160
Now why don't we why don't we enter
the same statement in here?

3677
03:28:27,160 --> 03:28:27,720
Right.

3678
03:28:27,720 --> 03:28:31,920
So now, before capturing the name
we just ask, please enter your name.

3679
03:28:31,920 --> 03:28:32,200
Right.

3680
03:28:32,200 --> 03:28:34,840
So this way
be given the clear instructions.

3681
03:28:34,840 --> 03:28:37,640
Right.
You going to say please enter your name

3682
03:28:38,680 --> 03:28:39,240
right

3683
03:28:39,600 --> 03:28:42,920
system
that out we printed something out system

3684
03:28:42,920 --> 03:28:47,920
that anyone we captured
No now will be more Please enter your name

3685
03:28:49,040 --> 03:28:49,400
right.

3686
03:28:49,920 --> 03:28:52,200
Please enter your h

3687
03:28:52,640 --> 03:28:53,040
I go.

3688
03:28:53,040 --> 03:28:55,320
I see you are 25 years old.

3689
03:28:55,320 --> 03:28:55,560
Right?

3690
03:28:55,560 --> 03:28:58,080
But this is what my program captured.

3691
03:28:58,560 --> 03:29:01,040
So now when you look at this case

3692
03:29:01,160 --> 03:29:05,000
now, when you Look at this, guys,
do you see anywhere?

3693
03:29:05,000 --> 03:29:07,040
Right. Let me remove my console.

3694
03:29:07,440 --> 03:29:12,840
Is there any way in my program, guys,
I hardcoded the name what I mean

3695
03:29:12,840 --> 03:29:17,120
by hardcoded I say name equals to a self
and every time a princess.

3696
03:29:17,120 --> 03:29:24,960
So do you guys see this
any way in my program?

3697
03:29:24,960 --> 03:29:26,440
No, I did not specify.

3698
03:29:26,440 --> 03:29:29,960
So now I did not hardcoded
the value for h.

3699
03:29:30,360 --> 03:29:32,640
I did not hardcoded the value for me.

3700
03:29:33,000 --> 03:29:36,360
So now my program becomes interactive.

3701
03:29:36,360 --> 03:29:37,120
Right?

3702
03:29:37,120 --> 03:29:40,040
So now would be some things
that are running.

3703
03:29:40,040 --> 03:29:43,200
I can enter whatever name and those names

3704
03:29:43,600 --> 03:29:47,400
will be dynamically captured
right and stored.

3705
03:29:47,680 --> 03:29:49,560
So now when I entered

3706
03:29:50,560 --> 03:29:53,640
right when I enter my name

3707
03:29:54,160 --> 03:29:56,040
in here, let's, let's execute

3708
03:29:56,040 --> 03:29:58,680
manually, right line by line.

3709
03:29:58,680 --> 03:30:02,480
So in here, scanner is getting created.

3710
03:30:03,240 --> 03:30:04,360
What is it scanner?

3711
03:30:04,360 --> 03:30:08,840
Scanner is a special class
that enables us for this part.

3712
03:30:09,080 --> 03:30:11,920
That's what it enabled enables for us.

3713
03:30:12,160 --> 03:30:13,880
That's what it does.

3714
03:30:13,880 --> 03:30:18,360
Now when we see line 19,
it says, Please enter your name.

3715
03:30:18,480 --> 03:30:19,480
I see this output.

3716
03:30:19,480 --> 03:30:21,920
Yes, I see. That's output there.

3717
03:30:22,560 --> 03:30:24,720
One by right, one this to the bottom.

3718
03:30:24,720 --> 03:30:27,720
That's how my program is.

3719
03:30:27,920 --> 03:30:30,960
Now, when it comes for the assignment,
right

3720
03:30:31,840 --> 03:30:34,200
When it comes for that, there's

3721
03:30:34,200 --> 03:30:37,920
always, always operation on the right

3722
03:30:37,920 --> 03:30:41,760
happens first
and then the sign in the valley.

3723
03:30:41,920 --> 03:30:44,160
Right. And then operation on the left.

3724
03:30:44,160 --> 03:30:47,600
So at first scan that mix what it does,

3725
03:30:48,000 --> 03:30:53,240
it captures this value, which was a string
and what are we doing?

3726
03:30:53,240 --> 03:30:55,760
So now this basically captured
for yourself

3727
03:30:56,240 --> 03:30:58,640
and what we did
we stored inside this variable.

3728
03:30:59,160 --> 03:31:01,320
That's why
I've said that we seen this output. Hello.

3729
03:31:01,400 --> 03:31:02,520
So right.

3730
03:31:02,520 --> 03:31:05,160
And then the next print out,
please enter your age

3731
03:31:06,080 --> 03:31:09,840
now, because age is a different type
of value.

3732
03:31:09,960 --> 03:31:12,120
It's an integer type of value.

3733
03:31:12,120 --> 03:31:14,400
So now using our scanner.

3734
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:16,960
Using our scanner.

3735
03:31:16,960 --> 03:31:21,280
Right, Using the variable, this always,
always point out to the variable

3736
03:31:21,280 --> 03:31:23,040
that refers to the scanner.

3737
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:25,680
What do we capture
and we get an integer Next.

3738
03:31:25,680 --> 03:31:27,720
I know it means next integer.

3739
03:31:28,080 --> 03:31:31,840
Now 25 What it will be happening is 25.

3740
03:31:32,400 --> 03:31:34,080
It will be stored in here.

3741
03:31:34,080 --> 03:31:36,160
And then what we do name.

3742
03:31:36,320 --> 03:31:38,280
It's a variable, right?

3743
03:31:38,280 --> 03:31:40,080
You're referring to this variable.

3744
03:31:40,080 --> 03:31:41,760
Each referred to this.

3745
03:31:43,240 --> 03:31:44,800
That's what we do.

3746
03:31:45,920 --> 03:31:47,360
That's what I do.

3747
03:31:47,760 --> 03:31:48,480
For example.

3748
03:31:48,480 --> 03:31:51,800
Right. Well, I'll go one more

3749
03:31:51,800 --> 03:31:54,840
complete again, bring
you bring your example and try to put.

3750
03:31:54,840 --> 03:31:57,600
So now this is just simple examples right

3751
03:31:58,720 --> 03:32:02,920
in the are a date to change it to date

3752
03:32:05,320 --> 03:32:07,760
where I mean you
you mean you want to capture the date

3753
03:32:07,760 --> 03:32:12,360
the date of birth.

3754
03:32:12,360 --> 03:32:15,640
Then there is will
we will have to do this some operations

3755
03:32:16,160 --> 03:32:19,920
because if you really don't think
date of birth

3756
03:32:19,920 --> 03:32:24,040
it's will be a combination,
not just numeric values.

3757
03:32:24,040 --> 03:32:24,320
Right.

3758
03:32:24,320 --> 03:32:28,360
Because Java does not give us just
you know, I mean, it has those option,

3759
03:32:28,360 --> 03:32:34,400
but basically we will to capture enter,
for example, 0101 whatever year.

3760
03:32:34,440 --> 03:32:35,160
Right.

3761
03:32:35,160 --> 03:32:38,360
So it will be a combination of characters
so we can capture it

3762
03:32:38,360 --> 03:32:42,480
in the form of strings but
then we will have to do many operations.

3763
03:32:42,680 --> 03:32:46,200
But those operation
we will be able to do only and only once.

3764
03:32:46,200 --> 03:32:48,680
We know how to work with the strings.

3765
03:32:48,680 --> 03:32:52,040
Why do we will try to capture guys,
we can try to capture boolean,

3766
03:32:52,440 --> 03:32:56,320
we can try to capture double
because for every single option,

3767
03:32:56,880 --> 03:33:00,680
every single data type,
every single type scanner has an option.

3768
03:33:01,160 --> 03:33:04,680
Scanner has an option.

3769
03:33:04,680 --> 03:33:07,120
So all basically
you guys will have to memorize.

3770
03:33:07,120 --> 03:33:09,600
You'll just have to memorize this line.

3771
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:12,640
And then just based on the data type

3772
03:33:12,640 --> 03:33:16,440
that you're trying to capture, you guys
either will use next to capture strings

3773
03:33:16,920 --> 03:33:21,600
or you use next integer
to capture, to capture integer that's

3774
03:33:22,920 --> 03:33:25,120
acting out.

3775
03:33:25,680 --> 03:33:28,080
For example, let's try to do one more.

3776
03:33:28,240 --> 03:33:30,040
Let's try to do one more.

3777
03:33:30,040 --> 03:33:31,680
Okay. I'm not going to mess up this class.

3778
03:33:31,680 --> 03:33:35,360
This I'm
going to try to create a new class

3779
03:33:43,800 --> 03:33:46,920
who will maybe want two more

3780
03:33:46,920 --> 03:33:48,600
examples I'll show you and then you guys

3781
03:33:48,600 --> 03:33:52,480
will be able to do it on.

3782
03:33:52,480 --> 03:33:59,400
Let me do them then.

3783
03:33:59,400 --> 03:34:01,320
Just think

3784
03:34:02,120 --> 03:34:03,640
and I know you best pipe in

3785
03:34:03,640 --> 03:34:06,480
and I'll give you the time after them.

3786
03:34:06,480 --> 03:34:08,960
Minute. So what?

3787
03:34:08,960 --> 03:34:10,600
We'll try to do this.

3788
03:34:10,600 --> 03:34:12,880
Let's try to capture

3789
03:34:13,200 --> 03:34:16,600
an item that we want to buy

3790
03:34:17,240 --> 03:34:19,640
and let's try to capture the price right

3791
03:34:21,360 --> 03:34:22,680
and the price right.

3792
03:34:22,680 --> 03:34:25,920
So now to capture the values,

3793
03:34:26,440 --> 03:34:28,800
we will need the scanner, right?

3794
03:34:29,040 --> 03:34:32,600
And then we will be capturing two values,
right?

3795
03:34:32,760 --> 03:34:36,200
One is the item and one is a price.

3796
03:34:36,200 --> 03:34:36,480
Right.

3797
03:34:36,480 --> 03:34:41,080
And then we will see which option
we should select.

3798
03:34:41,080 --> 03:34:46,160
And I'll bring this back after that.

3799
03:34:46,160 --> 03:34:50,840
So now to capture input from a user,
we need scanner, right?

3800
03:34:50,840 --> 03:34:53,520
We need scanner
and they'll try to give scanner

3801
03:34:54,360 --> 03:34:56,880
any variable name, any available name.

3802
03:34:57,200 --> 03:34:58,960
And I would like to change the names

3803
03:34:58,960 --> 03:35:02,360
so you guys don't
get used to the same memorization, right.

3804
03:35:02,920 --> 03:35:04,480
I'll name it. Input.

3805
03:35:04,480 --> 03:35:06,920
You guys can name it, whatever
whatever you want. Right.

3806
03:35:06,920 --> 03:35:07,840
Because it's a books.

3807
03:35:07,840 --> 03:35:09,920
I can give you a name, whatever I want.

3808
03:35:09,920 --> 03:35:12,080
Next one, just try to memorize it.

3809
03:35:12,080 --> 03:35:15,880
You scanner and then you can

3810
03:35:18,280 --> 03:35:23,280
be right the same thing.

3811
03:35:23,400 --> 03:35:28,280
Now you created a new class
in which you want to use a scanner.

3812
03:35:28,280 --> 03:35:28,920
The same thing.

3813
03:35:28,920 --> 03:35:32,560
We will have two important assured
way to import it.

3814
03:35:32,560 --> 03:35:36,680
You'll do command shift
or or control shift or

3815
03:35:37,760 --> 03:35:39,720
I want you all right there. Right.

3816
03:35:39,720 --> 03:35:41,360
So now what happened?

3817
03:35:41,360 --> 03:35:43,520
Our scanner that imported.

3818
03:35:43,520 --> 03:35:46,840
He was going to get that important.

3819
03:35:47,560 --> 03:35:48,480
Now let's.

3820
03:35:48,480 --> 03:35:52,440
Let's give instructions what's given,
because I want you to capture the item

3821
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:55,120
and I want to capture the price. Right.

3822
03:35:55,120 --> 03:35:59,000
So I'm going to say it's all right.

3823
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:00,120
Same point.

3824
03:36:00,120 --> 03:36:01,360
And third

3825
03:36:02,640 --> 03:36:05,880
item you want to buy,

3826
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:09,600
right? Okay.

3827
03:36:09,600 --> 03:36:11,880
I want to enter banana.

3828
03:36:11,880 --> 03:36:13,120
I want to enter Apple.

3829
03:36:13,120 --> 03:36:15,560
I want to enter phone.
I want to enter car.

3830
03:36:15,760 --> 03:36:17,240
What type of value is that?

3831
03:36:17,240 --> 03:36:22,680
This.

3832
03:36:22,680 --> 03:36:24,360
It's a string, right?

3833
03:36:24,360 --> 03:36:29,520
So now it means here
I will be storing a string value.

3834
03:36:29,520 --> 03:36:31,960
Right. String. Oops. String item

3835
03:36:32,960 --> 03:36:33,280
straight.

3836
03:36:33,280 --> 03:36:34,480
Right, right.

3837
03:36:34,480 --> 03:36:36,400
So now who can capture that?

3838
03:36:36,400 --> 03:36:38,080
Who can capture that value? This?

3839
03:36:38,080 --> 03:36:39,640
Who can capture

3840
03:36:46,840 --> 03:36:47,600
input?

3841
03:36:47,600 --> 03:36:48,120
You get that.

3842
03:36:48,120 --> 03:36:50,520
Please make sure you don't name
your your class classes.

3843
03:36:50,520 --> 03:36:52,800
A scanner input. Right.

3844
03:36:53,120 --> 03:36:55,600
Who refers to my scanner input?

3845
03:36:55,600 --> 03:36:59,000
Know which option
I have to capture the string.

3846
03:36:59,200 --> 03:37:03,120
I have the option next to and tells
you will hear string.

3847
03:37:03,480 --> 03:37:05,520
I'm able to capture the string. Right?

3848
03:37:06,080 --> 03:37:08,560
I go, I'm capturing the string. Right.

3849
03:37:08,880 --> 03:37:10,280
Good. Okay.

3850
03:37:10,280 --> 03:37:11,760
So now whatever value

3851
03:37:11,760 --> 03:37:15,720
I will enter in here, Apple,
it will be stored inside this item.

3852
03:37:15,880 --> 03:37:19,280
Right now let me try to capture price

3853
03:37:19,720 --> 03:37:24,360
for a click.

3854
03:37:24,360 --> 03:37:25,840
And so this

3855
03:37:28,240 --> 03:37:30,800
all there and let's concatenate it.

3856
03:37:30,880 --> 03:37:32,880
Whatever the item you told me.

3857
03:37:32,880 --> 03:37:36,160
Right. You know, we sent the price

3858
03:37:36,160 --> 03:37:40,560
in, the previous item
that you will print out and now

3859
03:37:41,520 --> 03:37:44,480
the price is a different data type, right?

3860
03:37:44,880 --> 03:37:46,240
Price is a different data type.

3861
03:37:46,240 --> 03:37:49,040
So Now you guys will decide
how you want to enter.

3862
03:37:49,040 --> 03:37:53,760
If you want to enter using integers
or using a double.

3863
03:37:53,920 --> 03:37:56,880
Right, let's go for double.

3864
03:37:56,880 --> 03:38:00,720
So now again, who can capture
That was only my scanner.

3865
03:38:01,040 --> 03:38:04,200
Which variable refers to the scanner

3866
03:38:05,040 --> 03:38:07,440
input input

3867
03:38:07,440 --> 03:38:10,320
and then to capture the double values,
what do we will do?

3868
03:38:10,320 --> 03:38:12,000
Guess we'll just see next.

3869
03:38:12,000 --> 03:38:15,720
Double because we capture integer values.

3870
03:38:15,720 --> 03:38:20,200
We do next 90 To capture the double values
we will just do next double right.

3871
03:38:20,440 --> 03:38:24,680
And once we capture the price, we can
store inside this variable double as

3872
03:38:25,920 --> 03:38:28,480
And now this is the print out

3873
03:38:29,560 --> 03:38:32,040
about let's see

3874
03:38:35,120 --> 03:38:38,040
you selected and then plus item

3875
03:38:39,360 --> 03:38:41,200
plus item

3876
03:38:45,680 --> 03:38:47,920
something for the price

3877
03:38:50,720 --> 03:38:51,560
equal.

3878
03:38:51,560 --> 03:38:53,840
Then whatever the price

3879
03:38:54,880 --> 03:38:58,920
was first thing.

3880
03:38:59,160 --> 03:38:59,680
Right.

3881
03:39:01,280 --> 03:39:09,360
Let's see what will write.

3882
03:39:09,360 --> 03:39:12,240
Right. So this output came.

3883
03:39:12,280 --> 03:39:14,880
It means already a scanner was freed it

3884
03:39:15,480 --> 03:39:19,880
now we setting up the instruction
now you could put it in here.

3885
03:39:19,880 --> 03:39:21,360
It's waiting for a string.

3886
03:39:21,360 --> 03:39:27,360
Now I want to buy my nano bagel
as soon as I hit the enter.

3887
03:39:27,360 --> 03:39:29,440
Your program is still waiting This.

3888
03:39:29,440 --> 03:39:31,880
What do you see?
It's still waiting you now.

3889
03:39:31,880 --> 03:39:37,080
As soon as you going to hit enter
Banana will be stored inside this item.

3890
03:39:37,200 --> 03:39:37,880
Right?

3891
03:39:37,880 --> 03:39:39,720
And the code continues execution.

3892
03:39:39,720 --> 03:39:41,760
Now it is please.

3893
03:39:43,080 --> 03:39:46,320
And enter the price for banana.

3894
03:39:46,680 --> 03:39:48,680
Now your code is waiting in here.

3895
03:39:48,960 --> 03:39:50,640
You scan is waiting for you.

3896
03:39:50,640 --> 03:39:53,480
Now it's waiting for the price.

3897
03:39:53,480 --> 03:39:55,680
It will be zero nine. Right.

3898
03:39:55,680 --> 03:40:00,640
So now, as soon as you enter
zero 99 will be stored inside this box.

3899
03:40:01,360 --> 03:40:05,520
And then what we give you is selected
banana is price zero.

3900
03:40:06,360 --> 03:40:06,760
Right.

3901
03:40:06,760 --> 03:40:10,680
And once again, once we'll go.

3902
03:40:10,680 --> 03:40:13,320
Okay. So when that banana

3903
03:40:15,520 --> 03:40:16,560
store in this

3904
03:40:16,560 --> 03:40:19,440
item, how we were able to capture it

3905
03:40:19,680 --> 03:40:22,360
we were able to capture it using scanner

3906
03:40:22,720 --> 03:40:26,280
and using next next capture string value.

3907
03:40:26,880 --> 03:40:30,400
Then to capture double tap on value.

3908
03:40:30,840 --> 03:40:33,400
We still refer to the scanner,

3909
03:40:33,400 --> 03:40:36,760
but this time we select
next double, right?

3910
03:40:36,760 --> 03:40:40,320
And then when we select
the things that Bill zero 99 was able

3911
03:40:40,440 --> 03:40:46,520
to store in here,
that's how I was getting my right.

3912
03:40:46,800 --> 03:40:50,480
You enter in here,
but as soon as you hit enter,

3913
03:40:50,840 --> 03:40:54,240
your banana is getting stored
inside this variable

3914
03:40:54,800 --> 03:40:57,440
and your price is being stored

3915
03:40:57,600 --> 03:41:01,520
inside this variable you hit enter this.

3916
03:41:01,560 --> 03:41:05,320
Yep, you hit enter time,
you finish typing,

3917
03:41:05,400 --> 03:41:09,960
just hit enter.

3918
03:41:09,960 --> 03:41:14,480
And so all all the time
we have to use scanner.

3919
03:41:14,760 --> 03:41:15,760
Yes. Yes.

3920
03:41:15,760 --> 03:41:18,480
Any time you want to capture a values.

3921
03:41:18,480 --> 03:41:19,160
Right.

3922
03:41:19,200 --> 03:41:21,960
So you want to capture a string
you will use next

3923
03:41:22,240 --> 03:41:23,640
you want to capture double.

3924
03:41:23,640 --> 03:41:25,200
You use next double.

3925
03:41:25,200 --> 03:41:29,120
You want to capture integer
you will use next integer.

3926
03:41:29,280 --> 03:41:30,840
Okay, Next integer.

3927
03:41:30,840 --> 03:41:33,520
What do you guys will have it
on this length? You guys will have it on.

3928
03:41:33,520 --> 03:41:36,520
This lets us know when you think of this

3929
03:41:36,640 --> 03:41:39,280
now when you know is scan and right.

3930
03:41:39,800 --> 03:41:42,360
For example guys,
when you created your program

3931
03:41:42,720 --> 03:41:45,360
to see if the numbers are equal or not.

3932
03:41:45,360 --> 03:41:49,680
Right now those numbers can come from you
or from your program.

3933
03:41:50,200 --> 03:41:52,120
You don't have to hardcoded them.

3934
03:41:52,120 --> 03:41:56,680
And now by aligning different values,
you make your program into active

3935
03:41:56,680 --> 03:41:59,640
and you will be able to check your code.

3936
03:42:00,360 --> 03:42:02,320
Right?
So now that's what this can address.

3937
03:42:02,320 --> 03:42:02,880
And you guys,

3938
03:42:04,120 --> 03:42:06,200
you guys will have that on slides.

3939
03:42:06,200 --> 03:42:09,560
The only, only thing in order
for your scanner to want a nice

3940
03:42:11,280 --> 03:42:14,520
number one thing, don't ever
name your classes in scanner

3941
03:42:15,360 --> 03:42:18,840
And the part number two when you finish,

3942
03:42:18,840 --> 03:42:22,440
when you finish typing your value,
make sure you hit enter.

3943
03:42:22,680 --> 03:42:23,400
That's all.

3944
03:42:23,400 --> 03:42:24,240
That's all.

3945
03:42:24,320 --> 03:42:26,520
And just make sure you guys know, okay?

3946
03:42:26,520 --> 03:42:30,320
Just make sure you know that you provide
and right values.

3947
03:42:30,320 --> 03:42:34,400
For example, hey, what is the item
you want to add?

3948
03:42:34,400 --> 03:42:37,120
I want to add. I want to add. All right.

3949
03:42:37,880 --> 03:42:40,520
Let's say please enter the price, right?

3950
03:42:40,520 --> 03:42:42,320
Please Enter the price.

3951
03:42:42,320 --> 03:42:46,560
Now, you have to think your your

3952
03:42:47,880 --> 03:42:52,440
your scanner is waiting for double value,
right?

3953
03:42:52,920 --> 03:42:55,920
What if I enter a string, for example,

3954
03:42:55,920 --> 03:42:59,040
I want to say $1, for example,
and then hit enter.

3955
03:42:59,560 --> 03:43:04,400
Now, what is happening
this now you will complain.

3956
03:43:04,400 --> 03:43:07,600
It tells you input mismatch. Why?

3957
03:43:07,640 --> 03:43:10,440
Because you tried to capture
in string value

3958
03:43:11,160 --> 03:43:15,280
and you tried to store inside the double
and all the crazy things are happening.

3959
03:43:15,280 --> 03:43:20,200
So let's let's just make sure basically
you're providing the right values

3960
03:43:20,560 --> 03:43:26,120
into the right options, right for the next
enter only strings for an X double.

3961
03:43:26,120 --> 03:43:30,760
Make sure you capture only
double type of values and for integer.

3962
03:43:30,760 --> 03:43:33,840
Make sure you capture
it only using next routine.

3963
03:43:34,280 --> 03:43:39,440
Otherwise Java will complete.

3964
03:43:39,440 --> 03:43:42,960
What if you want to combine
double in the string in the input

3965
03:43:43,160 --> 03:43:46,840
right here we combine combining it
with the help of the string concatenation.

3966
03:43:46,840 --> 03:43:48,320
We combine it all.

3967
03:43:48,320 --> 03:43:50,600
You mean you want to type it?

3968
03:43:50,600 --> 03:43:53,160
Okay, if you want to type it,

3969
03:43:53,440 --> 03:43:56,240
then there is a different options.

3970
03:43:56,360 --> 03:43:58,400
Okay, let me show you something.

3971
03:43:58,400 --> 03:44:00,000
Let me show you something.

3972
03:44:00,000 --> 03:44:02,160
But I want you first to be clear
with this thing.

3973
03:44:02,160 --> 03:44:05,360
This I want you to first to be clear,
was this two examples, right?

3974
03:44:05,800 --> 03:44:08,880
So now, with the help of scanning,
you can capture anything

3975
03:44:08,880 --> 03:44:12,680
we want right?

3976
03:44:12,680 --> 03:44:15,400
So now when we talk about scanner,

3977
03:44:15,720 --> 03:44:19,240
remember,
scanner is a non primitive types, okay?

3978
03:44:19,680 --> 03:44:23,520
To cast non primitive,
there's other things we will have to do.

3979
03:44:23,520 --> 03:44:28,680
Like trust in non primitives
will be different than custom primitives.

3980
03:44:28,680 --> 03:44:29,040
Okay.

3981
03:44:29,040 --> 03:44:44,720
In that
we are going to learn a little bit later.

3982
03:44:44,720 --> 03:44:45,440
Well you guys.

3983
03:44:45,440 --> 03:44:49,520
Yeah, you guys can then shrug
different different things, but if you

3984
03:44:49,520 --> 03:44:53,040
if you instruct
if you're waiting for an integer.

3985
03:44:53,040 --> 03:44:53,480
Right.

3986
03:44:53,480 --> 03:44:57,080
If you're waiting for integer
then there will be a little bit more.

3987
03:44:57,080 --> 03:45:01,360
You will you want to see if it's a number
so that is more complicated.

3988
03:45:01,360 --> 03:45:02,080
Things will come.

3989
03:45:02,080 --> 03:45:05,160
So for now,
just try to enter the right values,

3990
03:45:05,160 --> 03:45:09,640
okay?

3991
03:45:09,640 --> 03:45:13,480
So this options that you guys
will be learning, what are what is coming

3992
03:45:13,480 --> 03:45:14,880
after that?

3993
03:45:14,880 --> 03:45:19,920
Why do I have the parentheses
and why throws me specific issue.

3994
03:45:19,920 --> 03:45:23,120
You guys will learn all in details
why they've happened,

3995
03:45:23,120 --> 03:45:26,560
what just happened.

3996
03:45:26,560 --> 03:45:28,200
So one thing I want to show you this.

3997
03:45:28,200 --> 03:45:34,120
Some of you ask if I want one
to enter a string and then double click.

3998
03:45:34,480 --> 03:45:37,680
So now remember this Any time.

3999
03:45:37,680 --> 03:45:41,040
If you are touching
anything to the string, what happens next?

4000
03:45:41,880 --> 03:45:43,800
For example, when you did your

4001
03:45:44,840 --> 03:45:45,160
test,

4002
03:45:45,360 --> 03:45:47,760
you did your example concatenation, right?

4003
03:45:48,000 --> 03:45:51,280
So when you did ten plus ten,

4004
03:45:52,080 --> 03:45:54,360
it will give you 20, right?

4005
03:45:55,040 --> 03:45:56,120
But when you do.

4006
03:45:56,120 --> 03:45:59,640
Hi, did you guys do this example plus ten

4007
03:46:00,040 --> 03:46:06,560
plus then what was the output this
what was the output?

4008
03:46:06,560 --> 03:46:09,480
E was becoming high ten. Ten.

4009
03:46:09,600 --> 03:46:12,320
Right. Why?

4010
03:46:12,320 --> 03:46:16,920
Because anything this
anything you are touching to a string.

4011
03:46:17,080 --> 03:46:17,800
Right.

4012
03:46:17,840 --> 03:46:21,480
Whether the string will be on the left
or whether the string

4013
03:46:21,480 --> 03:46:25,480
will be on the right, it becomes
one big string in one big string.

4014
03:46:26,040 --> 03:46:28,680
Completely brain you but one big string.

4015
03:46:29,080 --> 03:46:32,920
So now if you say, Hey,
if I want to enter a string

4016
03:46:33,480 --> 03:46:38,080
and then double, right, so then what
it will be you need to capture.

4017
03:46:38,160 --> 03:46:42,240
You need to capture it as a string
if you want to capture them together.

4018
03:46:42,520 --> 03:46:44,080
Okay?

4019
03:46:44,080 --> 03:46:46,560
The one the only difference
I will show you this.

4020
03:46:46,560 --> 03:46:52,160
The only difference
you will see, for example, right.

4021
03:46:52,160 --> 03:46:54,480
Well, then let me run my item.

4022
03:46:54,560 --> 03:46:56,840
What I want to buy. Right?

4023
03:46:56,840 --> 03:46:57,840
I want to.

4024
03:46:57,840 --> 03:46:59,840
Here, please enter.

4025
03:46:59,840 --> 03:47:02,560
You want item
you want to buy? I want to buy

4026
03:47:03,760 --> 03:47:05,840
iPhone 13, right?

4027
03:47:06,240 --> 03:47:07,680
iPhone 13.

4028
03:47:07,680 --> 03:47:09,000
It is a string, right?

4029
03:47:09,000 --> 03:47:10,440
It is a string.

4030
03:47:10,440 --> 03:47:13,560
Now, when I hit enter, right.

4031
03:47:13,560 --> 03:47:15,240
Okay. Now it gives me wrong issues.

4032
03:47:15,240 --> 03:47:18,680
But what happens in here
is what happens in here

4033
03:47:20,480 --> 03:47:22,520
when you try

4034
03:47:22,880 --> 03:47:27,120
when you trying to enter the any string.

4035
03:47:27,120 --> 03:47:30,120
But that will have spaces basically

4036
03:47:30,120 --> 03:47:34,800
when your string value
is going to be more than one word.

4037
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:37,800
Okay, then your next method,

4038
03:47:38,040 --> 03:47:40,960
then your next option
not able to capture it.

4039
03:47:41,680 --> 03:47:44,120
If you have a sentence right, think or

4040
03:47:44,160 --> 03:47:48,320
if you want to capture more than one word,
more than one.

4041
03:47:48,320 --> 03:47:51,480
What is going to give you
a different option?

4042
03:47:51,600 --> 03:47:52,120
Okay.

4043
03:47:52,160 --> 03:47:54,360
It will give you different option.

4044
03:47:54,360 --> 03:47:56,280
It will show you a different option. Okay.

4045
03:47:56,280 --> 03:48:01,680
But just make sure this is the help
of next can capture string field space.

4046
03:48:02,720 --> 03:48:03,240
Basically.

4047
03:48:03,240 --> 03:48:05,640
What are we saying in year

4048
03:48:05,640 --> 03:48:06,640
one word,

4049
03:48:07,560 --> 03:48:10,800
one where you can double captures one

4050
03:48:11,880 --> 03:48:14,880
one double valid

4051
03:48:14,880 --> 03:48:17,600
integer captures you one

4052
03:48:19,800 --> 03:48:23,040
can do that. Now

4053
03:48:23,040 --> 03:48:26,320
if you want to capture a sentence, right?

4054
03:48:26,520 --> 03:48:30,640
If you want to capture a sentence,
scanner has different option, right?

4055
03:48:30,800 --> 03:48:34,600
Let me show you that option and
we will repeat the quotes of this, guys.

4056
03:48:34,600 --> 03:48:35,880
It will stay in your head. Yep.

4057
03:48:35,880 --> 03:48:37,920
It will have the option next.

4058
03:48:37,920 --> 03:48:40,640
Like okay, let me do first

4059
03:48:46,880 --> 03:48:48,440
and then.

4060
03:48:48,440 --> 03:48:50,400
Okay. Right.

4061
03:48:50,400 --> 03:48:52,600
Same thing. Name

4062
03:48:58,760 --> 03:49:00,600
anything Repetitive line.

4063
03:49:00,600 --> 03:49:01,560
Repetitive line.

4064
03:49:01,560 --> 03:49:03,800
So what we will do will be scanner, right.

4065
03:49:05,320 --> 03:49:07,560
And every time
I try to give different names

4066
03:49:07,560 --> 03:49:09,240
I will try to give different meanings.

4067
03:49:09,240 --> 03:49:10,760
Depend on the scene. Right.

4068
03:49:10,760 --> 03:49:15,040
So this way you'll get the logic logic
instead of the memorization.

4069
03:49:15,040 --> 03:49:16,080
Right? You

4070
03:49:17,520 --> 03:49:19,880
scanner and then

4071
03:49:25,320 --> 03:49:25,920
let's

4072
03:49:27,200 --> 03:49:30,240
add something import
because it's a new class

4073
03:49:30,520 --> 03:49:32,320
and you want to use scanner again,

4074
03:49:32,320 --> 03:49:36,480
we will have to import
come on, shift or control shift all right.

4075
03:49:36,480 --> 03:49:39,480
Now I want to say, hey

4076
03:49:40,480 --> 03:49:43,440
is in their sentence is

4077
03:49:43,440 --> 03:49:44,520
syntax

4078
03:49:46,800 --> 03:49:50,640
in sentence. Now,

4079
03:49:50,680 --> 03:49:56,040
if you want to capture an entire sentence,
the scanner has an option for it.

4080
03:49:56,200 --> 03:49:58,920
And as Angelica said, it will be in that.

4081
03:49:58,920 --> 03:50:01,000
And will just type next.

4082
03:50:01,000 --> 03:50:04,040
No, instead of the just next
we will see next line.

4083
03:50:04,560 --> 03:50:07,680
So next line,
what it does, it equals to capture

4084
03:50:07,760 --> 03:50:11,800
entire line
that you will enter in your console.

4085
03:50:12,360 --> 03:50:13,600
So now

4086
03:50:14,240 --> 03:50:16,440
and if it's a line, right remembers,

4087
03:50:16,440 --> 03:50:19,440
if it's a line that will have combination

4088
03:50:19,680 --> 03:50:23,560
characters,
pieces, numbers, it still will be

4089
03:50:24,720 --> 03:50:25,080
write

4090
03:50:25,320 --> 03:50:31,280
string.

4091
03:50:31,280 --> 03:50:34,320
And then let me just print

4092
03:50:37,120 --> 03:50:42,200
like, let me try one

4093
03:50:45,920 --> 03:50:47,760
means enter any sentence.

4094
03:50:47,760 --> 03:50:49,960
Oh, no dice.

4095
03:50:49,960 --> 03:50:56,360
Right now I can enter like go
my next line was able to capture

4096
03:50:56,360 --> 03:51:01,800
entire line including space right now
would say any sentence

4097
03:51:02,760 --> 03:51:07,440
I am very happy to be

4098
03:51:08,560 --> 03:51:10,440
like, okay,

4099
03:51:10,440 --> 03:51:14,400
so now your next line is able to capture
internally.

4100
03:51:14,680 --> 03:51:15,160
Okay.

4101
03:51:15,920 --> 03:51:18,600
You can enter combination of

4102
03:51:20,040 --> 03:51:23,920
double values with a string
because you know going to happen,

4103
03:51:24,120 --> 03:51:28,960
everything will be tracked as a string and
it will be stored inside sphere, right?

4104
03:51:29,400 --> 03:51:32,760
Where if I'm going to use next,
that's what you guys will see.

4105
03:51:32,760 --> 03:51:34,800
Now I'm going to use next, right?

4106
03:51:35,320 --> 03:51:37,400
I'm going to say hello

4107
03:51:38,520 --> 03:51:40,680
floating, right? They go right.

4108
03:51:41,040 --> 03:51:43,320
If I'm using units next

4109
03:51:44,160 --> 03:51:48,720
is able to capture
only only the first word till space.

4110
03:51:48,840 --> 03:51:52,920
That's why if you have a long
sentence this always go for a

4111
03:51:58,920 --> 03:52:01,000
way to capture to

4112
03:52:04,520 --> 03:52:06,600
capture for

4113
03:52:06,600 --> 03:52:16,440
more than one or two.

4114
03:52:16,440 --> 03:52:20,400
You must be most of the time you guys
will be capturing either one string value

4115
03:52:20,720 --> 03:52:24,120
or either one integer.

4116
03:52:25,200 --> 03:52:25,920
Any questions?

4117
03:52:25,920 --> 03:52:45,280
This any questions?

4118
03:52:45,280 --> 03:52:48,200
Was the wording on the line

4119
03:52:48,200 --> 03:52:51,240
or is just because

4120
03:52:51,240 --> 03:52:53,360
again, that's a non primitive type.

4121
03:52:53,360 --> 03:52:56,640
What we will have to do,
guys, we'll just have to close it.

4122
03:52:57,000 --> 03:53:00,920
We will just have to hold the option
to close it.

4123
03:53:00,920 --> 03:53:03,960
So but this is not
this is not mandatory for now.

4124
03:53:03,960 --> 03:53:05,000
Just leave it.

4125
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:07,720
No, just think.

4126
03:53:07,720 --> 03:53:10,080
But if you want to use calls, we can use
this can be

4127
03:53:12,000 --> 03:53:12,800
all right.

4128
03:53:13,680 --> 03:53:15,360
Let me see.

4129
03:53:16,240 --> 03:53:17,400
So here is right.

4130
03:53:17,400 --> 03:53:19,920
So here I'll fix it the little bit to it.

4131
03:53:19,920 --> 03:53:22,280
Strings we use next. Right.

4132
03:53:22,600 --> 03:53:27,360
I'll add that if you want to read
the entire line re not numbers.

4133
03:53:27,680 --> 03:53:31,720
Next integer decimal values double if.

4134
03:53:31,720 --> 03:53:36,240
You want a single character,
you will have to use this right drag.

4135
03:53:36,280 --> 03:53:38,680
You try to practice with them.

4136
03:53:39,120 --> 03:53:41,680
And what I'll give
you guys, I'll give you an

4137
03:53:43,120 --> 03:53:44,520
sast.

4138
03:53:45,040 --> 03:53:46,240
I'll give you five tests.

4139
03:53:46,240 --> 03:53:48,240
Actually, probably five. Six. Okay.

4140
03:53:48,720 --> 03:53:52,440
So all of this is this
you have to use scanner.

4141
03:53:52,440 --> 03:53:55,920
And now because we learned scanner
we will combine it

4142
03:53:55,920 --> 03:53:58,760
with our nested E right or with our eve.

4143
03:53:59,120 --> 03:54:02,000
Well it, it will be nested right.

4144
03:54:02,000 --> 03:54:06,120
So in here you'll want specialists
you need to ask user what is the amount of

4145
03:54:06,120 --> 03:54:07,400
loan is needed. Right.

4146
03:54:07,400 --> 03:54:10,080
So now you do not want your heart code.

4147
03:54:10,080 --> 03:54:13,080
The value double or equals to this, right?

4148
03:54:13,440 --> 03:54:16,480
So now you can enter loan anyway, right?

4149
03:54:16,480 --> 03:54:19,720
Whatever value
you want with the help of scanner, then

4150
03:54:19,720 --> 03:54:22,840
capture it and then you guys
will true in your if condition.

4151
03:54:22,840 --> 03:54:25,480
Hey eve email that you enter.

4152
03:54:25,480 --> 03:54:28,080
It is less than 200,000.

4153
03:54:28,120 --> 03:54:30,680
You'll give the money,
otherwise you won't be right.

4154
03:54:30,840 --> 03:54:32,400
So what do you will use?

4155
03:54:32,400 --> 03:54:33,920
You will use your if condition.

4156
03:54:33,920 --> 03:54:36,960
And then here you guys are thing you guys.

4157
03:54:36,960 --> 03:54:39,360
We will need to see
what kind of condition you will use.

4158
03:54:39,840 --> 03:54:43,120
But all this test, they will be using it.

4159
03:54:44,120 --> 03:54:45,880
They all will be using scanner

4160
03:54:45,880 --> 03:54:48,600
with the combination of then this
that is okay

4161
03:54:50,400 --> 03:54:51,040
all right.

4162
03:54:51,040 --> 03:54:51,960
I think

4163
03:54:54,600 --> 03:54:56,400
I'll give it to you right now.

4164
03:54:56,400 --> 03:55:00,200
So try to complete it by tomorrow class
because tomorrow classes

4165
03:55:00,200 --> 03:55:04,360
also guys will be very interactive
for tomorrow class.

4166
03:55:04,360 --> 03:55:06,080
What I will ask you guys, please,

4167
03:55:06,080 --> 03:55:09,040
please make sure you look over
the logical operators.

4168
03:55:10,000 --> 03:55:10,920
Okay.

4169
03:55:10,960 --> 03:55:15,000
And then and then tomorrow
also that there will be more tasks

4170
03:55:15,000 --> 03:55:16,920
that you will have to do. Okay.

4171
03:55:16,920 --> 03:55:20,320
So it's very they're very practical

4172
03:55:20,320 --> 03:55:23,160
today, so they won't be you, do they guys?

4173
03:55:23,160 --> 03:55:24,920
What will be all this assignment.

4174
03:55:24,920 --> 03:55:27,480
So this way you can practice, right.

4175
03:55:27,480 --> 03:55:29,560
Well well, good.

4176
03:55:29,560 --> 03:55:32,800
If you have any questions,
please ask me them. Now.

4177
03:55:33,400 --> 03:55:36,240
If you don't have any questions, guys,
I'll upload the code.

4178
03:55:36,520 --> 03:55:38,880
But please, please, please
make sure you practice

4179
03:55:38,880 --> 03:55:41,680
and look into the new material
that will be there tomorrow.

03:55:42,040 --> 03:55:42,360
Right.

4181
03:55:43,800 --> 03:55:44,320
All right.

4182
03:55:44,320 --> 03:55:46,200
I'm very I'm very happy to see you.

4183
03:55:46,200 --> 03:55:49,960
It's actually not fun of being sick
because I enjoyed teaching.

4184
03:55:49,960 --> 03:55:53,880
And actually now I was scared a little bit
by the end of the class.

4185
03:55:53,880 --> 03:55:55,280
I actually feel better.

4186
03:55:55,280 --> 03:55:57,840
So I will take some right now.
