1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,320
All right, guys.

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,880
Good to see

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,680
all the great

4
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,560
orchestra.

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,320
How have you been?

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,440
Great. So

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,240
in this class, when I'm seeing the way
that you are on the right.

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,080
But believe me, the level of operations

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,280
you guys are doing great
now is just tremendous industry.

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,120
Even after eight or nine years,
people do not have

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,400
this much experience,
this much in-depth knowledge.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,440
What are instructors
are giving you? Right.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,520
It's just intangible.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,160
But issue,

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,520
you just need to look on this thing.

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,680
Right.

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,320
Captured every single thing.

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,280
What I what we are seeing,
what we are teaching yet in the class

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,080
I will try to get a couple of students
from best right

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,880
one more time so that they will share
that experience with you.

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,800
Great diva in your place.

22
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,960
What we taught them, how they

23
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,600
absorb all of those things.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Great. How they implemented those things.

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,480
Those are completion of their classes
in the interviews

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,200
and see they are on the job.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,080
They all a majority of the great.

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,360
I already got the job so intimately.

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,560
We have to create the job, right.

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
That is the main point we have to get.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,880
The job market is extremely good.

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,720
By the time you beat the market rate in
one would maybe the majority.

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,800
Maximum one month,
one one half month in the market.

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,720
I want you maximum.

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,680
I would make the majority of you
to get the job

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,080
in. When there's a majority of you.

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,840
It means in the first month
majority of you

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,960
should get a job.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,840
And for that time is not after one month.

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,160
Time is now.

41
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,440
Time is now.

42
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,280
Trade.

43
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,600
You should start working.

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,120
You should start revising.

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,240
You should start understanding and
everything practicing from now onwards.

46
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,760
I've been repeating the same points
again and again.

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,200
Reach out to me and each of us that
they don't want to reach out to anyone.

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,960
And even if you think, No, we need clear
this.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't come up.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,600
It come to us, ask us. Right.

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,000
We have your dogs
and we will clear your for sure.

52
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,880
But for that
you have to come up with for us.

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:19,800
Okay, fine.

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,960
Let's start last.

55
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,120
There's work
we're going to get for the class.

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,280
One will translate further

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,720
for new topics, right?

58
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,600
I hope majority of you
will have already downloaded this.

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,160
Postmarked majority of you believe.

60
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,680
I already share that
with you. You got enough time

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,720
for that?

62
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,320
Nice.

63
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,160
Amazing.

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,120
Okay, students, tell me, what is

65
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,720
great.

66
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,000
Does it still announce that

67
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,920
if someone asked you in the interview,
what is EPA telling?

68
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
Vagueness

69
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,120
Finish Excellence starts on Twitter.

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,680
It is a vacation

71
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,920
programing

72
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,760
interface

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,160
right now.

74
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,280
Why? We use application
programing interface

75
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,880
basically basically to

76
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,040
constantly improve chance

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,440
to meet the information

78
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,040
being applied.

79
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,440
Some order

80
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,160
to try and sponsor with the information
right or establish the connection

81
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,000
in between plane

82
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,040
connect.

83
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,320
Now here, connecting everything together,
booking

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,960
a B.A.

85
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,720
connects everything together,
no connect systems

86
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,280
together, right

87
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,240
to transmit the information would

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,920
not indicate what is claimed

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,640
release what is claimed.

90
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,680
You are not the one

91
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
x first.

92
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,520
What is server

93
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,640
of one who

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,640
forms do the request

95
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
that is born but exactly

96
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,800
file so in simple language.

97
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,320
In simple language

98
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,440
EPA is generally used to transmit

99
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,120
the information between client and server.

100
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,840
The client. Right.

101
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,200
When we talk about information,
what plane say we call it request

102
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,120
and the information plane to the seat
or server sent,

103
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,840
call it response simply.

104
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,800
Next question is my

105
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,640
why do we need it?

106
00:06:49,800 --> 00:07:03,080
Is my post

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,760
to do

108
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,600
to communicate

109
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,800
systems.

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,760
It could not in

111
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,520
different programing language

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,560
communicate

113
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,000
the systems developed in different
programing languages.

114
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,680
We need API now.

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,600
There are so many reasons.

116
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,440
Three dinners, food.

117
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,000
There are so many reasons rate.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,520
The most reason is security. Why?

119
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
Because no one wants to share their data
with us.

120
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,000
No one wants to share that.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,760
Everyone wants to share
their data momentarily.

122
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,240
So how we can do that?

123
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,920
We can simply exist
a particular piece of information

124
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,760
from their database
based on the search we are trying to make.

125
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,280
Right.

126
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,200
Based on the search we are trying to make,
we are going to get

127
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,080
that particular piece
of information from the database.

128
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,000
So how we can get that particular piece
of information via API.

129
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,600
So at the same time, API API enhances

130
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,640
security, security of data.

131
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,840
You you

132
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:36,040
enhance the security of data, right?

133
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,320
Relays API enhances security, greater

134
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,880
by after this.

135
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,400
Next thing

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,040
here,

137
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,200
when we talk about client and server side,

138
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,600
we are going to talk about

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,280
server

140
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
architecture.

141
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,440
Generally, when we talk about blank server
architecture,

142
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,240
how many types of architectures
we have claims and a

143
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
we have one architecture

144
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,120
lead first one be an architecture.

145
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:34,440
What does it mean?

146
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,160
What does it mean?

147
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,120
This would be an architecture
all in one place.

148
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,800
It means my presentation. In

149
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,560
my presentation is

150
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,360
my application layer and data layer.

151
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,880
All three layers are company, but in

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,880
one machine quality

153
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,320
because it won't be an architecture.

154
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,200
Yes, I think the best example is

155
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,000
if you complete blank,

156
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,560
then the next one we are going to
talk about is architecture.

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,680
That is

158
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,320
to do architecture means presentation,
layer

159
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:33,240
it One place, authentication

160
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,080
and data.

161
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,160
Now available

162
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,400
under the buildings

163
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
and that piece rate

164
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,560
application and data layers available in
another presentation here will available

165
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,200
one piece of this type of architecture,
we call it to be an architecture.

166
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,560
The best example is

167
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,480
guys is the best example is

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,880
Domino's Pizza, right?

169
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,080
Exactly.

170
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,280
Domino's for instance, where does this the

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,440
high end?

172
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,280
Jimmy?

173
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,440
I think my answer to your question right
wasn't really answered yesterday.

174
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,960
Sorry I was so busy today.

175
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,040
I wouldn't ask you for that.

176
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,520
You got that answer

177
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:50,080
of one right?

178
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,600
So today's.

179
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,760
But yesterday,
if I answered right lady to anyone

180
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,560
because I couldn't see my leg.

181
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,280
Right.

182
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,280
So that's why
I was actually actually engaged.

183
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,120
That's one point.

184
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:13,280
So now when my presentation, my indication

185
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,120
near my mind is that if

186
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
all are

187
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,320
delivered

188
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,400
in different places,

189
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,240
then we call it 3D architectures, right?

190
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,400
So the best example is

191
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,800
Facebook, Amazon,

192
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,360
Instagram, etc..

193
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,440
Is this going to increase

194
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
one then?

195
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,760
Then we discussed one
really important point.

196
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,520
If you remember,
we discussed one very important point.

197
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
The point was

198
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,720
operations.

199
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,520
We perform operations we perform

200
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,720
using selenium pre

201
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,200
you are using selenium.

202
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,400
For what reason?

203
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,640
They're used by Mussolini. One

204
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,840
is doing fine.

205
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,120
But what

206
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,680
load testing.

207
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,040
Excellent.

208
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,720
Excellent.

209
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,800
Then is

210
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,120
really

211
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,120
they we use selenium to perform.

212
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,360
To perform

213
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840
functional functionalities

214
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,240
on a simple UI testing,

215
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,240
printing, testing, rate printing testing.

216
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,400
We use selenium

217
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,680
replace what ever

218
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,760
we see,
whatever we observe on to the screen.

219
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,200
We used to automate.

220
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,840
We use selenium to automate
that particular part which we can see on

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,840
the screen.

222
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,280
So what you see on to
the screen is a UI on the screen.

223
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,960
This is the print
and this is the presentation layer.

224
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,800
So we always interact
with the presentation.

225
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,880
Then on a
UI part on the screen using selenium,

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,040
we are to make this
particular version correct.

227
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,600
So now when it comes to automate web
based application on screen,

228
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:14,320
that is the UI,
but we perform basically for operations,

229
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,640
create, retrieve, update,

230
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,400
be, create, daydream update, delete.

231
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,160
Is that correct?

232
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,800
Why now?

233
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,800
Tell me why we used my sequel workbench

234
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,680
Reach database.

235
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,160
I simply make it for

236
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,880
for database testing.

237
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,160
Great database testing.

238
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,920
We need my sequel workbench.

239
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,560
So we work with my sequel
workbench here cutting.

240
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,560
So yet also we perform basically

241
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,240
for main operations, grid operations.

242
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,880
Is there anyone who does, who doesn't know
what is the meaning of this

243
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,560
great operation?

244
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,160
Is that anyone

245
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,160
knows?

246
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,480
Is that anyone who has no idea
what great operation

247
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,440
means?

248
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,360
Nice.

249
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,640
I was thinking if there is anyone.

250
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,040
Yes, I am getting I was about to call

251
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,440
in is the upgrade

252
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,680
so politely agreed.

253
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,960
Otherwise do not raise their hand
and the moment they raise their hand.

254
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,360
This is the last of all

255
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,600
boring learning with complete fun.

256
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:25,680
You will get the maximum,
the maximum of the class.

257
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,360
Right?

258
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
If I just keep explaining the things,
it makes you bored.

259
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,240
It leads to some boredom rate.

260
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,920
That's why it's better to keep in mind.

261
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,000
We like to keep the in my hand
deep under me.

262
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,560
I want them to get in my right.

263
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,360
And this

264
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,520
right,

265
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,920
you either learn it
or you don't have any any of that option.

266
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,960
Getting

267
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,280
this point.

268
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,080
Nowadays, I'm kind of with the the

269
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,440
you have to follow

270
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:08,400
what I'm saying.

271
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:17,760
I gave him a license to carry
in the class.

272
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,960
We never know.

273
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,360
We never know when we needed trade

274
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,760
the way we got one instruction right

275
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,720
Couple of minutes back
you script came into the class is it.

276
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,120
He shared the recording as
possible non loop escape by

277
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,960
one else I need

278
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,120
trade I need I should call in

279
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,000
is in that case

280
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,120
getting movement

281
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,040
in without any should upload them.

282
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,680
We have.

283
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,320
There is only one king.

284
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,320
Sometimes we have to claim a territory.

285
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,600
It is also important

286
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,720
scary.

287
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,080
Welcome to scary helps to find.

288
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,960
So now when we perform
the same operation on the printing,

289
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
we perform
the same operation in the banking.

290
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,200
So the point is very simple
to understand that in the middle, bear

291
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,720
in the middle man.

292
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,000
This really hour when we talk about API,
we are going to perform

293
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,720
same operation.

294
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:52,160
We are going to perform the same
operation, correct, of operations.

295
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,200
So now school is very clear.

296
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,360
We will use API to perform
great operations

297
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,240
or either we are going to earn
a new record in the database

298
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,200
and we divide or we are going to retrieve
the information from their database.

299
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,160
In my order,
we are going to delete some information

300
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,240
from their database and verified
or we are going to edit

301
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,080
some information
in the existing record of the database.

302
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,440
And we

303
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,600
these are the four things.

304
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,280
These are the four things we, we

305
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,520
connect.

306
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,800
Not to me is that it is undeniably

307
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,920
excellent.

308
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,040
Excellent.

309
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,480
Coming to you.

310
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,840
This will make you personally

311
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,080
great just to make a list of the students

312
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
I'm going to do is

313
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,280
fine.

314
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:12,160
All right, so now,
now see, now see one very important point.

315
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,440
Actually, I'm actually implement.

316
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,840
So now let me open this

317
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,840
for me.

318
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,240
I think may definitely

319
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,360
99% in May and

320
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,720
right now noticing
welcome the moment that they did

321
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,680
And then if I bring a few issues
all over job credit

322
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:57,760
with see you next week.

323
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,800
Definitely definitely

324
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,680
excellent.

325
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,520
Yeah right.

326
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:20,880
What do you mean?

327
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,840
All right.

328
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,720
So now, now, here.

329
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,680
You see.

330
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,200
Yeah.

331
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,880
Zimmerman coming.

332
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,960
Be ready with that

333
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,840
bleed.

334
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,320
I still. I still remember that. Great.

335
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,200
Oh, Andy and Glean
was that played along with there being

336
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,480
some mix of good I would see mix of both

337
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,520
majority of things
90% business 10% obligation

338
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,760
I would see

339
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,760
when he has

340
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,840
the main intention
is to meet with the people because no

341
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,720
not of not of quantitative use.

342
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,280
Lot of I would say majority of my
what exploited me was some dip

343
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,760
and keep asking the same question
haven't you coming there?

344
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,440
So there's what

345
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,400
Definitely.

346
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,320
Yeah definitely.

347
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,000
It would be an honor for me. So

348
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,320
there you go.

349
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,760
There you go.

350
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,320
Yeah. Yammer. Right.

351
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,600
But I would not sleep because
I don't consider this as my business.

352
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,080
Right?

353
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,640
This is my network. Uh,

354
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,320
no, because it is very difficult
for us. Not.

355
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,680
That's very difficult for us. That's what

356
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,360
friendly.

357
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,840
And when it comes to read my network.

358
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,920
Read.

359
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:04,720
See, let me tell you one thing.

360
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,960
You see.

361
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,840
Exactly. Exactly.

362
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,000
Now, here, you see,
I open the calculator, right?

363
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm. I'm trying say, well, I'm trying.

364
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,200
When I put two plus five

365
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,560
in this calculator and put do

366
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,120
plus five, it gives me

367
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,160
similar rate.

368
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,520
Let's it give me seven.

369
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,440
So now tell me, do I need internet

370
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,320
connection. No.

371
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,920
Somewhere in the banking,
somewhere in the bank.

372
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,560
It would depend. It a 2 to 5

373
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,600
and give me the reason then this kind of

374
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,080
API did this, this API

375
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,600
did this onboard

376
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,640
at the same time.

377
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,200
Mostly
one thing very crusty at the same time.

378
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,720
If I go here and outside

379
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,240
guys can

380
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,160
now take me here

381
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:30,120
here on the Skyscanner.

382
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,440
Here on the Skyscanner.

383
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,920
If I tried to search something
you don't need internet on Mark

384
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,440
Gates to search something on Skyscanner.

385
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:57,280
Do I need internet or not?

386
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,920
We need it, doesn't it? Right.

387
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,480
We need Internet.

388
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
So now.

389
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,280
Now, how is it possible?

390
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,360
How is it possible

391
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,440
then in one place? API

392
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,320
doesn't require

393
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,400
internet

394
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,040
in another place,

395
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:28,520
API requires, isn't it?

396
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,840
It one place.

397
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,760
API is working without internet,
but another place API

398
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,520
needs internet connection to function

399
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,560
and you see the difference.

400
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:48,600
These two types of API.

401
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,160
Guess the really interesting topic
I'm about to touch.

402
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,480
There's a mosquito industry
attempting to explain you.

403
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,240
So now.

404
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,160
Now remember

405
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,200
two types of API seeing J.A.

406
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,680
will give you the examples over
Deal architecture radio in this way.

407
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,080
Microsoft think this is the example
of your one near architecture.

408
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,400
Your calculator is the example
and all the big stop application

409
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,760
is standalone application.

410
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,960
These are the example of your is of
the examples of your one bit architecture.

411
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,840
Great.

412
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,440
So now you see this two types of API,
everything,

413
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,000
two types of API,
you see the one which needs internet

414
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,960
and the another one
which to me doesn't need internet current.

415
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:52,480
Now. Now listen carefully.

416
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,400
API is

417
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,080
which are just

418
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,000
post big

419
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,960
over the domain

420
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,480
are called

421
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,040
Gibson.

422
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,600
So how many of you guys ever

423
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,520
heard this term services?

424
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,400
Yes Amazon web services.

425
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,720
What does it mean?

426
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,160
Amazon provides some of its services.

427
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,800
So Web services
simply means you need Internet connection.

428
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,200
And these web services
connect multiple systems

429
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,160
because services are nothing but the API.

430
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:42,960
Right.

431
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,440
And what API does
It establishes the connection

432
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,680
between the two systems
developed in the different languages.

433
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,760
Great

434
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,360
trade, Great.

435
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,560
So now APIs,
which are hosted over the Internet,

436
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,600
we call them Web services.

437
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,240
So for example, if I start something here,
if I start something

438
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,840
here, let's say Google, great,
I open Google map.

439
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,080
It connected me to Google
Maps, click here.

440
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,720
It takes me to this particular
place on Google Map

441
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,840
Connect.

442
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,760
You see,
it took me to this place on Google map.

443
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,600
Great.

444
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,680
So how their data is being transported,
how it is connecting

445
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,520
to the Google, to the Google
map, to the Amazon, to all the places

446
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,560
via via his web services.

447
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,120
Right.

448
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,080
So we are able Israel.

449
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,120
So which APIs?

450
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,320
Now we are talking about the EPA,
which is a wireless Internet connection

451
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,040
so that NEPA is required
Internet connection.

452
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,000
We call them web services,
great web services.

453
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,160
First thing understood what is up.

454
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,400
So in this case, people think so.

455
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,440
When one says if a services does it
only with API.

456
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,280
Yeah.

457
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,440
Web services that is a part of API.

458
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,720
API is a pending web services, a changed

459
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,600
that API is a parent web
service is a trade outlet.

460
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,160
How should

461
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,840
let me put this one here if I

462
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,400
take would be into the

463
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,240
on called

464
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,040
services Oracle web services

465
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,800
right now you see this

466
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,280
Google example
I gave you for web service, right.

467
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,840
For Web services.

468
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,360
This is also EPA, the calculator example

469
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,560
I gave you right there.

470
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,640
It is also API or any.

471
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:02,960
Yeah.

472
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,800
Alex So you can study that example, right?

473
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,040
I will give you one
map 1 to 1 map example.

474
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,480
Also that map. The map, right.

475
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,480
You will see how I'm going to great
how this that maybe it will not work

476
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,360
without it.

477
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,000
I will tell you that is create
non web services but still API.

478
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,840
So remember remember the point

479
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,760
all maps that have says are APIs

480
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,320
but all it is are not

481
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,280
web services.

482
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:38,760
Right.

483
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,720
Let me read this definition some bridge
that is very important point where this

484
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,240
all services

485
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,360
it a part on

486
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,480
if the ends are non

487
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,920
non services

488
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,200
make sense based

489
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,720
off it

490
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,680
perfect so now now we are going to focus

491
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,360
we are going to focus only on one part,
only on one part.

492
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,600
And that part is

493
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,520
services.

494
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,520
It means only the part of API
which are hosted over the internet

495
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,000
because the API doesn't
require internet connection.

496
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,280
What we can do with those,
we shouldn't do anything.

497
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,360
We cannot do anything
and we don't have to deal with those.

498
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,120
It is only web services.

499
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,480
Only web services because we are going
to test something over the Internet.

500
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,800
All right.

501
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,760
All right. Based now.

502
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,480
So even
even if someone asked this question, hey,

503
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,480
you know, that sort of services
just before this point,

504
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,160
if someone would have asked,
you would have answered no. Now,

505
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,400
if someone asked to do you to Web services
to think what would be your answer?

506
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,720
Yes, I'm services testing.

507
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,880
Tell me which web service
you want me to test.

508
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,400
I will do that.

509
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:25,560
Great, great.

510
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,200
Nice.

511
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,600
Let's proceed further.

512
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,480
Now, when we talk about Web services.

513
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,560
Right, Region
really have two types of Web services.

514
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,240
How many types of Web services
we have based

515
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
two types of services.

516
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,480
What are those two?

517
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,800
See the first one, because it is

518
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,000
RESTful Web services

519
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,600
and the second we call it

520
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,440
superb services.

521
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,680
We have restful
and we so have never had this

522
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,320
donkey's soup interest

523
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,960
in your.

524
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,600
Even if you heard trade, you always
see what is this support is these rest.

525
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,640
So web services
are basically of two types.

526
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,400
Great

527
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,360
services are basically two types
of list food and soup.

528
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,600
And this is what everyone

529
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,600
restful and soup.

530
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,240
What is the full form?

531
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,240
What is the full form?

532
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,160
The presentational

533
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,800
stage runs

534
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,560
the presentation straight lines.

535
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,720
But and this one is simple

536
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,400
object

537
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,480
exist for

538
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
simple object access protocol.

539
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,920
The presentation is to transform
two things.

540
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,080
Two things

541
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,640
extrude

542
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,800
majority of time,

543
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,600
99% of time in the application rate
we deal with,

544
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,840
we deal with

545
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,520
just services.

546
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,880
So here in this session
also we are going to focus on

547
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,440
we are going to focus on just right.

548
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,600
We are going to focus on the rest.

549
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,960
There are

550
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,600
some obvious reasons of this.

551
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,840
The first reason I'm telling you, right,

552
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,000
the first reason you install

553
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,960
install, basically

554
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,280
whenever we get the data rate,

555
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,520
it takes more bandwidth
to transfer the data.

556
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,680
And if we need more bandwidth, simply
it needs more time to better

557
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,480
travel light because the information
this group gets right.

558
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,760
It is it gets a lot of information.

559
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,400
It gets a lot of information.

560
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,960
Right.

561
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,240
And if it gets not enough information,
it takes a lot of time.

562
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,560
And only one language it accepts it is in

563
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,000
which language it accepts

564
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,880
which language it accepts,

565
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,200
examine.

566
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,080
However,

567
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,680
however, when I will definitely give you

568
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,080
other graphical representation
of the dismal graphical examples.

569
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,320
Now see here in RESTful in restful

570
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,920
at rest.

571
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,880
So it accepts only externally.

572
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,520
It accepts examine

573
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
Jason

574
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:04,200
next HDMI

575
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,400
and you'll see all this accepted.

576
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
My opinion is

577
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,640
this to accept only x okay.

578
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,760
Because
because it has a lot of information.

579
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,080
It takes time.

580
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,640
It takes buying

581
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,440
coupons for their data

582
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,920
and takes more bandwidth transfer data.

583
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,680
X-Mode.

584
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Basically this one, this one provides
less information, right?

585
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,680
But relevant information.

586
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,440
So that's why it takes less
bandwidth required

587
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,280
less time to transfer their data, right?

588
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,600
So takes

589
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,600
less time to transfer their data.

590
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,400
Three days.

591
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,960
The only thing the only example,
the only example

592
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,000
which I can see in which so is better is

593
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,880
soup is more secure than rest.

594
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,720
Soup is more secure than rest.

595
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,520
So who uses soup?

596
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,000
Majority of time
banking applications uses soup.

597
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,080
Who uses soup Banking applications
uses soup only because of safety.

598
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,280
So for them, even the application,
if it is taking time, me

599
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,920
give you the real name
example of what you see here.

600
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,640
If I search for Google,
how much time it took

601
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,040
to open the application,
how much time it took fast?

602
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,040
What if I search for ICICI Bank?

603
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,960
See, it is taking time to load the BBC.

604
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,120
It is taking time to learn a bit.

605
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,880
And now we get this
particular page, correct?

606
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,640
Correct.

607
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,560
So even if
there are differences in minutes against

608
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,600
but still it does taking time.

609
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,440
So I just to give you one simple example
there you see a lot of examples, right?

610
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,360
If you perform hundreds of operations

611
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,480
every time you get this example,
you see the difference.

612
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,280
You see the difference in between this

613
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,800
and this.

614
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,240
Probably one.

615
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,560
So we are going to work with rest.

616
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Okay?

617
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,520
Okay.

618
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,040
We are going to work with the rest.

619
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,040
No lipstick. Very good example.

620
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,920
Now one starts

621
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,840
first thing.

622
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,760
What all are the things I need

623
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,880
to communicate over the internet?

624
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,320
That is more important point, right?

625
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,960
This is more important.

626
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,600
Playing with a list full API.

627
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,680
Right?

628
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,480
So when we talk about restful API, right?

629
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,120
When we talk about API spaces,
I need complete address.

630
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,520
What I need, I need complete address.

631
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,880
For example,

632
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,160
you are it is not a complete you're
just that's what I'm telling you now.

633
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,120
See if I ask is he his email.

634
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,920
So what would his demands? U.S.

635
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,880
Why the

636
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,680
demands in U.S.

637
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,040
now in U.S.

638
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,680
is the mother only one who lives there?

639
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,360
It was.

640
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,200
He must have. I live in U.S.

641
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,520
Is it a complete answer me.

642
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,320
I be able to find the mother Mandarin.

643
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,640
You will see. No.

644
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,160
Right then it's.

645
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,520
And then Z was his own.

646
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,880
I live in Arizona, in Phenix, Arizona.

647
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,120
Maybe you visit Phenix, Arizona.

648
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,560
Now tell me

649
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,920
one. Arizona.

650
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:15,880
Also in Arizona also is the one only one?

651
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,160
No, we

652
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,600
I would ask

653
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,000
will get in Phenix
what is your house number?

654
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,280
Is this 2048204?

655
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,240
Is it fine now in U.S.

656
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,520
in U.S.

657
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,240
made in U.S., in Phenix, Arizona,

658
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,720
the house number is 204.

659
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,880
There I can find Zima or not do. Yes.

660
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,880
If I go if I go to his house read,

661
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,720
someone will definitely ask,
You want to see who you want to meet

662
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,120
because the email is also there.

663
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,040
Silver is also correct.

664
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,880
So I have to say.

665
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,000
All right, I need Zima.

666
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:22,800
You need nice

667
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,680
given get to get re enforce fine.

668
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,640
Nowadays. Great.

669
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,640
So I found Galen K to get three gift
for Sylvan Zimmer,

670
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,880
the beautiful family of six people
right now

671
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,520
they ask We want to meet as a zima
so now see not understand is exempt

672
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:49,840
but incorrectly in state in house

673
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,680
in house
I have provided this particular point

674
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,360
in okay in this in this particular one
I want here and work here.

675
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,120
I want to meet this person correct

676
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,160
for me.

677
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,440
Excellent.

678
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,960
So what

679
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,520
29 zero.

680
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,840
You will see undisputed champion.

681
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,480
Right.

682
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,640
So now, now, here you see,
I give this complete entry state.

683
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,720
I give this complete.

684
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,800
It was even if I missed some the

685
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:30,800
Yes, yes.

686
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,600
I am both Conor McGregor, Dustin Pryor

687
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,440
and Habib Konate and then Dustin

688
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,400
White.

689
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,120
So now here you see
when I give the completed list

690
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,400
then only I will be able to identify
this particular address.

691
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,880
Right.

692
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,080
I will be able to meet this guy, otherwise
I wouldn't be able to make this correct.

693
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,120
And then it sees the same thing
in the news.

694
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,080
Is, all right, you know what part point
that part is not enough

695
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,680
in that part unit
that you have this part. Yes.

696
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,040
So what is this part?

697
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,200
This part of this part?

698
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,240
Is this what we need to understand?

699
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:11,880
All right.

700
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,240
Now, let's consider this
the example in call minus

701
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,640
worst case, practically understood
what I am trying

702
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,280
to explain how to make the computer this.

703
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,400
Now, see this example
in technical aspects. Now

704
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,600
we talk about Amazon database.

705
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,080
Great. Simple.

706
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,200
We are going to talk about
Amazon database.

707
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,000
So when you try to exist is Rigzone
database for first word, you need

708
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,840
most words you need address of the server

709
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,960
address of this network

710
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,160
or we simply called database.

711
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,320
Right guys

712
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,280
address this are what our database

713
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,120
posting when when we reached in this point

714
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,120
when we reached this point in Amazon.

715
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:10,640
So what
tell me how much information is available?

716
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,160
A lot of information.

717
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,920
We don't want it. How much?

718
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,200
So we need only the information.

719
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,000
We need
only the information which we want.

720
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,400
Which we want.

721
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:29,080
So for example, it says, okay, fine,

722
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,040
little habibur

723
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:45,000
excellent.

724
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,120
BUPA Superb.

725
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,840
All right, so now see here
address of the server, right.

726
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,640
First thing.

727
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,960
But in this address, in this address,
if I see I want to access users,

728
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,800
then what would Amazon ask?

729
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,040
Amazon ask.

730
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,440
Well, I have existing user.

731
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,840
I have guest user, I have new user.

732
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,240
I have prime user.

733
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,880
Which one you want to access

734
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,520
in. My point is

735
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,720
it is existing
user, new user, guest user, prime user.

736
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,480
All kinds of users are available
in database or not installed in me.

737
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,880
So only if you see
only if you see I want to access user.

738
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:35,360
Is this the complete answer?

739
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,920
No. Right.

740
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,040
Then you say already
I want to access existing user

741
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,480
which when you take an

742
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,160
existing user.

743
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,400
So now again Amazon ask Will I have

744
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,280
five millions existing users,

745
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,560
I have five millions existing user
You want to get the information

746
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,080
of all the users
or you want any specific user,

747
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,080
any specific

748
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,400
rate. It's the same.

749
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,920
I reached the my house,
but there are six people

750
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,760
that are asking you want to meet who
we all are human beings.

751
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,320
Which human being
you want to me then I, I specify.

752
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,440
I want to read Z1 right then only again
read similarly.

753
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,280
What are the things we need?

754
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,720
What are the things we need?

755
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,840
First, we want address of the server
in terms of API trade.

756
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,960
The next thing in this address
where my EPA is available.

757
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
So I need API location.

758
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,400
I need API location in the server

759
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,360
and under the API location.

760
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,040
What it would be operation.

761
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,040
I want to put a form I need take point.

762
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,080
I need that point. Understood.

763
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,280
So how many things
we need to make this complete address?

764
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,440
We need address of the server.

765
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,320
We need API location.

766
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,120
We need the point in
API location, which I want to

767
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,040
getting my .33.

768
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,160
I'm I'm
just I'm just coming to the window to.

769
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,520
So now now when we talk about
technical aspects,

770
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,560
we colleague

771
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,360
base you are I

772
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,760
what we call it based

773
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,880
what we call it based You are.

774
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,440
I am.

775
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,080
Okay.

776
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,320
Now remember this.

777
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,840
You are I distance for uniform

778
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,200
resource

779
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,440
Identifier.

780
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,720
Uniform Resource Identifier.

781
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,040
Already this

782
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,600
one student's uniform Resource identifier

783
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,920
right now.

784
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,160
See Now, see what is this
uniform resource identifying?

785
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,800
What is this?

786
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,800
This You are I is this.

787
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,080
You want to consist of three things.

788
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,680
Consist of how many things

789
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,480
consist of three things.

790
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,360
The first is

791
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,680
address of those that are not.

792
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,200
What is this
address on the server liquidity?

793
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,440
If I open this
part, see if I open this part

794
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,240
Google dot com.

795
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,120
Can you see two in

796
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,320
everyone's is Google Street.

797
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,320
But do you know that this Google dot com

798
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,280
is just a domain name which we see here

799
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,600
which we see here.

800
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,760
This is just a domain
name read on for example Amazon bought it

801
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,880
so this Amazon dot is just a domain
name in banking.

802
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,160
In banking, great.

803
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,680
On the Indian side, what is going on

804
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,680
right this Amazon not in our

805
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,120
is Google dot com is linked to one address

806
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,920
for example 198.192.8.1

807
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,680
or 192.198.4.3.

808
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,360
This is what we call in normal language
IP address

809
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,880
or we colleague

810
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,560
address of the set of

811
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,280
what we call it,

812
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,520
address of the service right now.

813
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,800
Now, if you ask me this one website,

814
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,400
I said yes, I do have said
give me the name of your website.

815
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:14,160
And I said 62.347.32.1.

816
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,760
How it sounds.

817
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,440
Would you be able to identify
would you be able to see me?

818
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,760
No link, No.

819
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,960
Instead, if I say hey, just going to
WW dot com

820
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,480
easy or not, which one is easy.

821
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,960
12% dot com or 34.237.1.

822
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:44,000
something you know so remember remember

823
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,160
we provide this thing
for our understanding

824
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,120
otherwise this part is more than enough
to search anything.

825
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,160
Let me show you this.

826
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,320
Do you see here we provide a chain.

827
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,200
So index dot make this part.

828
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,320
You are using this

829
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,040
now see you find idea three dot.

830
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,720
You see

831
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,520
I'm forwarding IP address in the moment.

832
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,200
I provided this IP address.

833
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,840
It is opening the same application.

834
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,240
It will going to open
the simple application

835
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:27,600
opening plan.

836
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,400
It will open the same application
which I see it opens.

837
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,120
Let me open this page

838
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,040
right

839
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,720
here.

840
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,880
API and an API.

841
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,880
If I open anyone using this page

842
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:49,040
and this page, read this page in this page
what are seen.

843
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,000
But the difference is it one place
I have been to this particular

844
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,840
domain name,
this particular name and it one say

845
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,160
we went to this particular lawyer
IP address.

846
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,960
You see, I built this.

847
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,280
All this information can be found here.

848
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,760
The same information can be
found here also.

849
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,160
So what is the meaning of

850
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,080
basically
this part is for on understanding,

851
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,880
but in actual it is linked to this part.

852
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,280
It is linked to this part.

853
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,920
Now, let me give you this example here.

854
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,280
See, I'm going to read

855
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,440
can you see the IP address of Google?

856
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,160
It means when you read Google dot com,
it is linked with this.

857
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,400
8.8.8.8.

858
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:45,800
Right.

859
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,520
It is

860
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,480
linked with this IP address so intimately.

861
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,240
We are trying to excuse this server.

862
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,960
We exist this server.

863
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,960
The information is coming
from this particular location.

864
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,440
Whenever we name google dot com

865
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,840
understood.

866
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,760
And this phenomena,
this phenomena of linking your IP address

867
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,080
to your name, this name we call it the

868
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,000
and is domain

869
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,080
name somewhere

870
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,720
industrial not our

871
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,360
now how domain name server works everyone

872
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,480
everyone understood
the concept of DNS based

873
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,880
nice place.

874
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,360
So now we were talking about BS.

875
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,080
You are right.

876
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,280
So the first DNS is the number of number
or the name domain name.

877
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,040
See domain names.

878
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,920
So it is name of mistake.

879
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,120
Now see based you are anytime, sir.

880
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:08,640
Here we need three things

881
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,320
because you are right and you want to know
what is the difference.

882
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,920
Remember the first thing that I see

883
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,920
address of the server?

884
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,520
Address of the server is nothing but

885
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:24,720
base.

886
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,160
You are in. Base you are.

887
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,880
And so if you go here
and if you see right Amazon,

888
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,160
so this is your base,
you want to write this, you want to

889
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:41,120
it means the address of the server
now, now in this format,

890
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,240
if I want AC, if I want refrigerator,
if I want mobile,

891
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:50,440
if want laptop, if I want curtains,
if I want one wallpaper, write

892
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,640
anything, whatever the things they need,

893
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:58,320
they are separate departments
available in this particular interest.

894
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,680
Right.

895
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,360
Right.

896
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,040
If I want to purchase,
let's say clearance a store, click here.

897
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,400
The moment I click you see this
you are in changes

898
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,280
this you are an Amazon don't intend use
to Amazon in slash something

899
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,120
something can you create this

900
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,640
Hello you may see something

901
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,440
now similarly if I click on mobile

902
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,320
again, it changes to mobile phones.

903
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,960
Then you see

904
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,280
again it changes to mobile phone.

905
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,960
So when you talk about
when you talk about base you are in,

906
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:47,560
it means we are talking about
only this part, only this part.

907
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,600
Read the address of the server,
the address of the server.

908
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,040
Then how about this?

909
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,800
The remaining part?

910
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,800
What about this remaining part?

911
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,880
If you see here, if you see here,
if you talk about base you are in

912
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,080
and this is the base you it
then what about this part?

913
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,040
What about this part?

914
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,280
Understanding two points
with the two points.

915
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,520
See? Great.

916
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,640
So now come, now, come here.

917
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,640
This you are listing for your uniform.

918
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,640
Uniform

919
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:28,320
Resource Locator.

920
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,680
First thing
we got this address of the server.

921
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:37,840
But for this address of the server
is not enough.

922
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,440
This address of the server is not enough.

923
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,920
Again, just consider the example of email.

924
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,920
Amazon.

925
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:44,200
Right?

926
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,640
You want to access the users
so all the users available which users

927
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,320
you want.

928
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,640
Similarly, we we already exist
the address of the server.

929
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,320
It means the database, but in database
what information we need.

930
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,920
So we call it

931
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,640
a by location

932
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,400
location of a being.

933
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,320
Yes. Correct.

934
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,840
If you want to access Amazon in the U.S.,
you have to use Amazon dot com.

935
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,560
If you want to use in Canada,
it would be Amazon.

936
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,600
But see if you want to use it in India
Amazon

937
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:24,880
not and if you want to use in Australia
Amazon not EU

938
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,680
if you want to use it in Pakistan
Amazon don't be like this.

939
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:34,760
Okay, fine.

940
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,160
So now see guys in this address, I'm

941
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,080
saying wherever a browser available,
a browser are available,

942
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,160
just take me to that
particular place. Why?

943
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,800
Because why I am here.

944
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,880
We are here to perform this on

945
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,840
to perform testing on

946
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,760
API. One has seen

947
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,560
we have been doing it
right from last for 5 hours.

948
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,680
The last time
one in the afternoon is three.

949
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,320
So API three we need API location.

950
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,120
So now,
now you see, now you see if I go here

951
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:23,880
at this point,

952
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:32,920
if I go back, see

953
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,040
if note of information is available,
this is the address of the server.

954
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,920
Right. This is the address of the server.

955
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,160
Now in this address of the server,
I need API location.

956
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:49,120
So you see everywhere,
even in a development for the application

957
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:53,040
or in any other application,
if there is API exist,

958
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,120
there will always be a place
or the IPAS separately.

959
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:03,240
So here if I click on API,
this is the API location.

960
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,320
So now you see in API, in API,
this on are the person.

961
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,560
For example, API is the

962
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,880
host of Zebra, Zimmer's Houses API.

963
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,360
Under the house
we have given Q2, Q3, Q4 segment Z, Ms.

964
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:20,520
six Great.

965
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,240
Similarly for creating the employee,
creating the user, deleting the employee

966
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:29,040
employment status to generate the token
one employee, all employee.

967
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,000
So many things,
so many things are relevant.

968
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,560
Which one you want to use,
you want to use create user.

969
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,480
Go ahead and call this one
you want to use create employee.

970
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,280
Go ahead and call this one.
You want to generate the token.

971
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,000
Go ahead and call this one like this
kind of stuff.

972
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,320
Management. Right?

973
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,360
So this is what we call point.

974
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,960
Remember the point
I was telling the third place,

975
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,520
the third the supporting record
address of the server

976
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,760
and that it was the server
API location under API location.

977
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,160
Third thing is, third thing is

978
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,440
and one third thing is endpoint.

979
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,760
So now now
when we have these three things together

980
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,320
and what are these three thing base
you are by less

981
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,480
API location,

982
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,520
less endpoint, we call it

983
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,480
because you are I

984
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,000
and we need this base
you are to perform on the API

985
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,040
is to

986
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:38,880
industrial

987
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:49,680
base.

988
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,760
Any question in this

989
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:02,120
question.

990
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,080
No question

991
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:10,480
dummy.

992
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,560
Nice.

993
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,120
Can we make our first request for you.

994
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:22,120
Opens index with the numbers that is
not designed the Yeah because I did

995
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,480
I didn't rent to this particular point
to see

996
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,440
I'm I'm coming to that on
this is the swagger one if you see right

997
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,280
so I got Ed so here
I didn't go to this bigger Ed part

998
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,840
if go from here and you click here right
then it comes to this particular point.

999
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,200
You see

1000
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,160
now you got

1001
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:52,560
using

1002
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:58,200
actually, yeah.

1003
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,480
Please ask the endpoint, the end point.

1004
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,960
You will understand what I will
explain to you.

1005
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,880
I will explain the endpoint.

1006
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,840
Nobody wanted use it.

1007
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,400
These are the endpoint,

1008
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,560
these are the ones that every day
you don't really

1009
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,680
about the endpoint how endpoint looks

1010
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:21,000
and excuse ask, yes, after 2 minutes

1011
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,400
I, I may die
all of my horses for 15 minutes

1012
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,560
so they won't run anymore.

1013
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:35,240
14 minutes.

1014
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,640
How much, how much course covered in views

1015
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,400
soon it was a giant dot
com or it similar to it.

1016
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,800
It seems that

1017
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,040
it is still

1018
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,400
basically this index Italian protocol.

1019
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,480
But why it looks different

1020
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,000
and it doesn't look difference.

1021
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,800
You see here it's all about picking
this particular part in consideration.

1022
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,680
Let me show you if you talk about this
particular one in this particular point.

1023
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:10,920
Right.

1024
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,200
See if I'm taking this particular point,
then what would happen?

1025
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,760
See what is what it is opening

1026
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,760
this big
server configuration works, right?

1027
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:37,080
And if I take this particular one,
this will also give me the same thing.

1028
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,640
See this part to see read

1029
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,640
this part is in and this part is it.

1030
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,720
So this is just the address of this one.

1031
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,120
It takes you to the same place.

1032
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,000
It also takes you to the simplest
understood this

1033
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,000
and this will this not

1034
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,480
great,

1035
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,640
great. Let's take a break.

1036
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,160
You're going to get into base.

1037
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,960
You are right means this you are helpless
API location plus end point it.

1038
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,080
Let's take a break for 15 minutes because

1039
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,960
everyone understood this
This you are really what is this?

1040
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,600
You are

1041
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,840
everyone understood this API location also

1042
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,600
right

1043
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,440
now let's talk about this endpoint.

1044
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,880
What is this endpoint?

1045
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,160
So you see

1046
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,160
all their databases available

1047
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,360
and they will look forward

1048
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,080
something like this,

1049
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:50,520
something like this, correct.

1050
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,640
Replace columns and rows and everything.

1051
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:59,600
So now, for example,
if I want to add existing users, right,

1052
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,360
so all their data related to existing
users might be available in this one call

1053
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:05,720
rate.

1054
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,920
So here on their data
for existing users of

1055
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,280
right

1056
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,040
in this particular one,
all the new users available

1057
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,240
in this column,

1058
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:21,040
my biggest users are available, but

1059
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,360
in this column my prime users available

1060
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:31,360
guys getting my point.

1061
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,080
Hello

1062
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,600
students.

1063
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:41,640
That's how things work in this table
platform and data available, right?

1064
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,040
So fine.

1065
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,440
You came into the database, right?

1066
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,320
In database.

1067
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,840
Multiple people that have

1068
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:51,360
multiple tables are available right?

1069
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,320
When you spawn. Maybe.

1070
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,000
Let's see for composer,

1071
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,400
one is for legacy development,

1072
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:04,920
one is for let's see, eBay
and this whole information,

1073
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,640
there's a whole tables are available
in one set of one.

1074
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,360
There it is. Mine.

1075
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:12,600
There
it is. My database or simple language.

1076
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,160
So so first first I came to base.

1077
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,480
You are in Firebase You wanted.

1078
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,840
I came to this one right?

1079
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:33,440
This under this server.

1080
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Under this server.

1081
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,480
I need API location.

1082
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,120
So I have compose I have developed.

1083
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,480
I have API. I have compose.

1084
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,480
I have developed API.

1085
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:48,800
Right.

1086
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,680
Great piece.

1087
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,760
I have these things.

1088
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,520
So now the second part API location means
I'm going to hit this particular mark.

1089
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,040
This particular part,
I'm going to leave this part.

1090
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,280
Leave remaining part.

1091
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,520
Just started on

1092
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,720
this target on one bar.

1093
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:09,120
That is this one correct.

1094
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:12,720
Now in this part also my people

1095
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,720
roles are available for existing user

1096
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,040
new user, guest user, prime user.

1097
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:23,800
So if I want to use their
data only for existing user,

1098
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,120
I have call this particular time

1099
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:32,840
if I want to existing permission
or delete the information

1100
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:36,520
or update the information
or to add a new user,

1101
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,040
I have to on this particular point,

1102
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:45,840
getting the point of this in IPA location,
we have multiple points right?

1103
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,200
You cannot save new user in existing one.

1104
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,960
You can also just use a new one for the

1105
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:56,360
for destroying the guest user
to play with their data.

1106
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:00,320
For the guest user, you have to connect
with this guest user point

1107
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,840
If you want to play with the data
for the prime user,

1108
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,000
you have to connect with
this primary is point understood

1109
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,200
and this provides.

1110
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,280
This is like Zimmer's home
in Zimmer's house.

1111
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,600
We have given it to get tricky for Zima.

1112
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,800
You want to meet Zima,
so you have to connect with Zima latest

1113
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,560
industrial.

1114
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,960
So when we talk about this particular
existing new

1115
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,360
guest and brain, what are these?

1116
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,520
These are and points.
These are end points.

1117
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,000
So this complete server is the address,
the server

1118
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:40,960
in the address on the server,
we have multiple tables under this table.

1119
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,200
One is API location.

1120
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,400
Under API locations via multiple points.

1121
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,760
In these multiple points,
if we connect with anyone,

1122
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,040
this is what we call API end Point.

1123
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,640
Now what did anyone

1124
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,040
know? Understood.

1125
01:09:58,040 --> 01:09:59,640
What is the point

1126
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,880
right now?

1127
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,640
Now see Nazi

1128
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,400
so far

1129
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:24,280
based.

1130
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,840
You are a concept player

1131
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,840
API location concept player

1132
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,040
right.

1133
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,400
API location once player

1134
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:39,240
then endpoint concept

1135
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,480
and one conceptually is great.

1136
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,440
These three things
we will get the final product called base.

1137
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,000
You are right, which we will be using
for API testing purpose.

1138
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,000
Understood. Now let me show you.

1139
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,200
Let me show you all these things,
all these things.

1140
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,360
Remember, whatever the things

1141
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,240
we need to make the request.

1142
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,800
Guys, what are we doing?

1143
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,760
Basically, we are planning to say
that exist as a client right?

1144
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,480
So to send a request, I needed it. Simple.

1145
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,560
If I need to send a postcard
to anyone, what

1146
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,680
I need,
what I need is to send a postcard address.

1147
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,760
Right. So if you tell me. Okay, fine.

1148
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,280
The address is USD,
incomplete is a no no, no in U.S.

1149
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,080
and New York.

1150
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,360
Again, don't.

1151
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,440
Now, you said it was it for House number,

1152
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,040
some X-Y-Z Street,

1153
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:38,640
Brooklyn, New York,
United States along with the zip code.

1154
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,280
Now this is completed completely correct.

1155
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,680
So similarly,
if you said this, you wouldn't.

1156
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:44,760
Okay, sorry.

1157
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:49,320
You are it is fine incomplete API location
find incomplete

1158
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,600
end point API location
because you are in the desert

1159
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,040
of this are now completed

1160
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,720
now completed this.

1161
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,920
So pretty quickly we found the house.

1162
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:05,880
We found the house in which whatever
we want to do, we can go the right.

1163
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,520
So now coming back to the point,
we are going to do

1164
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,120
just four things
clear operations right on this address.

1165
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,880
What kind of operations
we are going to make.

1166
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,960
Right. We will see.

1167
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,960
We will see this.

1168
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,720
All right.

1169
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,600
So now you see

1170
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,840
what I'm going to explain here Right

1171
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:29,360
at this particular point
when we made this, you are I.

1172
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,040
So how we select this end point, right.

1173
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:36,320
What is the API location?

1174
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,640
What is the base you are in?

1175
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,320
What is the base you are? I train.

1176
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:43,560
What are the other ingredients?

1177
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,720
Need to make a request.

1178
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:48,120
How we understand all these points.

1179
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,920
How we understand all this points.

1180
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,520
So here to understand all of this points,

1181
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,440
we need to follow one document
and then document.

1182
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,680
We go

1183
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,760
swagger.

1184
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,760
You can consider this like there is API

1185
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,280
documentation or in non normal language.

1186
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,920
I would say it is API.

1187
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,560
I would

1188
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,320
this swagger document in the studio.

1189
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,760
This swagger document is nothing
but the API Bible.

1190
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,240
It gives us
the complete information. Right?

1191
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,680
So if you go into the industry,
if you start working

1192
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:32,280
on any of the projects,
you will get one document called Swagger.

1193
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:37,080
Once you get this swagger document,
that complete information is available.

1194
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,000
We just go through the information,

1195
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,440
you just read the information,
you understood everything you understand

1196
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,760
every single point you make, request,
what kind of response you will get.

1197
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,200
You will get that response
also from the beginner part.

1198
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:53,480
All these things, all these things,
whatever I am explaining,

1199
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:58,680
you can do all these things from there on.

1200
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,200
You can do all these things from there.

1201
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,840
Only understood.

1202
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,320
So now let's see how we read this

1203
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:11,200
particular swagger document,
how we did it.

1204
01:14:11,480 --> 01:16:47,440
Okay, Just don't.

1205
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:59,000
All right?

1206
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,720
Always think of big who hanoch who

1207
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:06,960
is it

1208
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,520
you want to You are to remember
we have already discussed it.

1209
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,400
Guys.

1210
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,760
You are I and you are in.

1211
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,720
You are only you are.

1212
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,240
And these are two different things, right?

1213
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,560
You are and is a part of you are I

1214
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,000
uniform Resource Identifier

1215
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:29,520
and Uniform Resource Locator do things.

1216
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,600
Uniform resource
locator is the basic allocation

1217
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:36,640
where we have the complete
the address of the sort of what you are.

1218
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,600
I is the complete address,
the complete address read

1219
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:45,520
in that particular of in this particular
point on particular table,

1220
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:48,480
we are going to perform this operation
Desert Bitcoin based.

1221
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:53,040
You are a moderate, so you are
it is a small fortune.

1222
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,240
You are is a complete is

1223
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,120
not understood.

1224
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,520
You know they are they are from
last two years have seen great.

1225
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:08,120
The guy said we bring this at least
three times for the last two years.

1226
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:10,320
They told care of their families
and everything.

1227
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,720
They do care of other peoples.

1228
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,040
They always go out, they always take care
of people and everything.

1229
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,120
So is and it is pretty genuine

1230
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,600
because in the country of 1.4
billion, 1.5 billion people.

1231
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:21,840
Right.

1232
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,160
But you see people
every minute, every state, hundred billion

1233
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:27,360
there.

1234
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:31,560
So you to make them aware,
basically you have to go out of your home

1235
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,200
right.

1236
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:40,680
And they can never be certain
digital access.

1237
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,400
Got it.

1238
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:43,440
Fine.

1239
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,720
So now now let's see, guys, how rigid

1240
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,960
these particular documents

1241
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,640
I have already written

1242
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,640
in the notes I've already written.

1243
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,480
This is a result.

1244
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,880
This are going to be as you are, a

1245
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,200
plus location of API plus in point.

1246
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,360
This is your you are
what else you want me to read

1247
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:10,840
in stone.

1248
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,240
I think if you don't read it any.

1249
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,680
Yeah, that's fine.

1250
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:18,680
That's really fine.

1251
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,120
All right.

1252
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,760
So guys, now see how we can read
this particular document.

1253
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,400
Great swagger.

1254
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,040
So now, now, if I open.

1255
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,480
If I open. Right.

1256
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,280
If I open this particular document. Okay.

1257
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,800
If I open this particular
document, swagger So now can you see

1258
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:43,320
this is basically you are
and it is available here.

1259
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,240
The very first thing

1260
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,560
it is you guys

1261
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,360
this is this.

1262
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,440
You are l right.

1263
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,320
This is this you are in.

1264
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,240
So now now remember

1265
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,320
here when we talk about base,

1266
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:08,640
you are and it has two meanings.

1267
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,280
First, do you want it?

1268
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:16,040
Second, your location of input.

1269
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,920
Remember two parts we discussed

1270
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,040
this you are plus locational API

1271
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,320
base your plus locational API.

1272
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:33,360
Even if you connect the two things
together, it still it is base you are in.

1273
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,760
And then and then after base you are.

1274
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,800
When you connect this with end point.

1275
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:44,880
With end point, then it becomes base
you are all right.

1276
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:49,480
So these two things
you are in any location of API,

1277
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:53,040
you can find it here,

1278
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,080
you can find it, you can you see

1279
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,520
till this point, in this point,
what is this?

1280
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,400
This is your base. You are in normal.
You are in.

1281
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,160
And what is this index API slash eBay.

1282
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,920
This is your this is your API location.

1283
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:10,920
Guys, can you

1284
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,760
see this is your you are in
this is your API location.

1285
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,760
Do this available here. Great.

1286
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,480
So let me copy this post.

1287
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:22,680
Let me put it somewhere
so it won't be difficult us to investor

1288
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,640
rate so base you are less

1289
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,880
vacation or

1290
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,120
recorded this way.

1291
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,080
Well now after this.

1292
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,400
After this you'll see it says

1293
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,800
for creating user end points

1294
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:46,520
slash API is for generating a token file

1295
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,640
is games is a steep fine.

1296
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:51,440
I will tell you this

1297
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,600
you see create user

1298
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,080
available here again you see so
for creating the user, we have to use this

1299
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:03,720
for generating the token, have to use this
for creating all the employee details.

1300
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,200
We have to use this.

1301
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:09,600
Forget one employee, we have to use this
for getting the job title.

1302
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,400
We to use this for getting employment
status, use this,

1303
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:18,080
create employee,
use this, create user and create employee.

1304
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,840
I give you the difference
in these to update employee

1305
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,880
the employee
update partial details of the employee.

1306
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:30,960
So now you see to perform
different types of operations.

1307
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:36,440
To perform different types of operations,
we need to create different endpoints.

1308
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:41,200
Can you case
we need to different endpoints

1309
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:41,920
going

1310
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,800
right now?

1311
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,320
Now imagine the example in our district,
the example which I gave you

1312
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:59,200
in database of Amazon training, right?

1313
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,680
BHP So this is the endpoint,
This is the endpoint.

1314
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:07,440
So they develop like BHP with the endpoint
with their SPI, we have to use it.

1315
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:08,960
No issues

1316
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,360
on its development,

1317
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,880
not arguments.

1318
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,000
This autoresponder,

1319
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:18,120
this.

1320
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,880
But I will tell you this totally.

1321
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:22,160
I will tell you this also

1322
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:25,040
this law human rated,

1323
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,560
how really open this speech will define

1324
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,720
I shared this in the chat

1325
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:52,200
in some video as this changes,
I open this speech, open this speech.

1326
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,480
So now now here we have to read we have to
read this complete information point.

1327
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:02,400
Now you see we have address of the server.

1328
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,480
That is basically what

1329
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,920
we have right now, API location,
good things.

1330
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:12,000
And the third thing,
the third thing we have is end point.

1331
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,960
So it says it says you have endpoint here.

1332
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,480
Can you see slash create user.

1333
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,960
So if I want to create user, I have to use

1334
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:26,080
this is beside big role in API location.

1335
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,000
This is specific table.

1336
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,440
We all the newly created
user will be stored straight

1337
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,480
if I want to access, get unemployed
and try to create user data.

1338
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:39,520
It will not allow

1339
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,760
every single place, every single place

1340
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:47,160
as it's already defined location in DPA.

1341
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:47,920
Okay.

1342
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,120
Okay guys.

1343
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:54,520
So for example, if I want to take this
particular part, what should I do?

1344
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,560
I have to copy the endpoint
to create the user.

1345
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:04,200
I have to copy this endpoint
and then I have to edit, you see.

1346
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,960
So I added this point to

1347
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,480
now you'll see

1348
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,280
this first part is my base you are in,

1349
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,040
this second part is mine.

1350
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:18,880
The second part is my location of API

1351
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,280
and this third part is my third

1352
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,920
part is my API endpoint.

1353
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:31,960
Right?

1354
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:32,200
Right.

1355
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,560
This one

1356
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,720
not understanding

1357
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:57,400
another more.

1358
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:02,760
Another important point
which we are going to touch based on this.

1359
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:08,160
If you want to live in use,

1360
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:12,000
you have to follow all the rules
and regulations of the U.S.

1361
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:22,240
government or not.

1362
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:25,120
You have to read.

1363
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,640
If you don't follow, then what I'm

1364
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:33,360
the for.

1365
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,280
Basically
it will not allow you to leave the great

1366
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,160
read.

1367
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,800
Similarly, if I want to live in

1368
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,640
India without initiative
or don't I have to follow

1369
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:55,280
the rules made by Indian government
on our Constitution.

1370
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,320
But I have to follow my Constitution

1371
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,960
similarly.

1372
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,800
Similarly, if I want to do a business
in India,

1373
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:08,040
I have to follow all the business rules
defined by the government.

1374
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,800
If you want to open your own business
in the US, you have to follow

1375
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:15,360
all the rules
defined by US government for the business.

1376
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,640
But it

1377
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,600
similarly similarly,

1378
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:28,440
if I want to interact
with some application on to the Internet,

1379
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:32,120
I have to follow the rules
and the guidelines

1380
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:35,480
defined by the internet.

1381
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,240
It will never happen that I can.

1382
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:43,720
I can interact with any of the application
on the internet according to my will.

1383
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,360
I cannot do this.

1384
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:48,360
I have to follow the protocols.

1385
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,800
I have to follow the rules,

1386
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,760
the regulations, the policies,
the procedures of the Internet.

1387
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:54,960
So what is this?

1388
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,520
Rules, regulation, policies, Procedures.

1389
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,560
The protocol on Internet, we call it.

1390
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:10,160
We call it.

1391
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:15,240
You might have seen multiple times
this GDP with every user.

1392
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:19,680
You would have seen this content.

1393
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:23,280
Everyone can see HDTV.

1394
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:28,920
What does it mean, Hypertext

1395
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:34,000
doesn't matter
whether it is secure or not.

1396
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,440
Transfer

1397
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,080
protocol

1398
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:41,040
just now here,

1399
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,240
sometimes you come across HD, PBS also.

1400
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:49,480
What is this is this is a for security.

1401
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,760
This is transport secured.

1402
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,120
If this is available
with your applications, you are it.

1403
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,720
Your application is secured.

1404
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,480
If it is not available,
your application is not.

1405
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:03,000
So you find you're not going to bother
about this security.

1406
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,120
But as of now,
we are going to focus mainly on

1407
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:08,440
this duty.

1408
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,600
People should

1409
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:19,440
be strictly proportion understood.

1410
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:24,120
So hypertext transfer Protocol
three workers protocol

1411
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,520
is it says, Hey,

1412
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,520
I will allow you to communicate
with my people

1413
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:34,480
applications over the Internet right.

1414
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:38,520
We can communicate,
we can indirect the application

1415
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:41,040
rate with the applications,
with the website,

1416
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,120
with the website over, the Internet
using one protocol.

1417
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:50,640
The mean protocol is hypertext
transfer protocol, right?

1418
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:54,880
So how we follow this protocol,

1419
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:58,440
how we follow these protocols,
we have certain metrics.

1420
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,480
We have what

1421
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,520
methods

1422
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:08,640
or recorded functions.

1423
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:10,800
We have methods for functions in

1424
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:15,240
certain methods
or certain functions in it.

1425
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:19,600
We have understood
everyone so is GDP methods.

1426
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,240
What is GDP functions?

1427
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:27,120
We need to concentrate in order
to communicate, in order to connect

1428
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,720
with the website over the Internet
Hypertext

1429
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,400
Transfer Protocol.

1430
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,240
Okay.

1431
01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:40,840
It's prudence.

1432
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:41,640
Does it make sense?

1433
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:46,120
What I'm seeing?

1434
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:46,720
Fine.

1435
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,960
So now, now here we are going to.

1436
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,160
Yes, yes, yes. Everything is on Twitter.

1437
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:59,160
Everything is on speculation,
like concerts, videos

1438
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,280
available, everything.

1439
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,680
So now see

1440
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:04,920
Gregg

1441
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,160
closed operations.

1442
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:09,800
What does it mean?

1443
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:10,880
Create

1444
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,760
the big

1445
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,480
B? Really great.

1446
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,200
I see.

1447
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:26,520
He is GDP.

1448
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:29,400
I want to perform these four operations.

1449
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,960
These four fine.

1450
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:36,360
So we have to follow some function,
some methods of GDP.

1451
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:41,400
When I say, hey, I want to create
a new record in the database.

1452
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:45,000
So HDTV protocols is all right,
you can do this.

1453
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,640
You have to follow my one method.

1454
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,520
The method name is

1455
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:59,640
most regrettably, you are correct.

1456
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:00,720
Correct.

1457
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:05,280
Then then I said, Hey,
I want to retrieve a record,

1458
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,680
want to get some information
from their database.

1459
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,880
So this is
you have to call my gate method.

1460
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,240
If I have to update something,
if I say I have to update

1461
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:23,000
something in their database,
it is all my method.

1462
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,960
It is put.

1463
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:29,120
If use it, I have to delete
something from the database.

1464
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:33,840
It says you have to call my method,
which is being

1465
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,960
so boost gate put delete,

1466
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,160
not pull it.

1467
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:48,040
Still you are in this good
pull get push did origin master

1468
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:52,040
get commit minus then good push minus
your origin double course

1469
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:56,400
message of the minus message is till you
you're in that point

1470
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:02,240
good as good stash
did add once to get clone

1471
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:06,160
you are in
good push You're still playing this

1472
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,840
The API command

1473
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:16,680
will not batch also update your batch.

1474
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:19,000
I will tell you it is for partial update.

1475
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,760
I will tell you they don't ready.

1476
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:22,800
But right now
we're not going to focus on that.

1477
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,080
But that is not that when need reading.

1478
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:30,600
These four are essentially so I will feed
you only the things you can digest.

1479
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:34,400
As of now, overfitting
doesn't make any sense

1480
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:50,320
otherwise in desert is one thing
and nothing else made fun.

1481
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,680
So now these are based GDP metrics,

1482
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,720
which we are to call

1483
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,960
for particular reasons,
for particular brand of operations.

1484
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,040
Right.

1485
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:03,720
Let's good on swagger

1486
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,840
now first come we can put it

1487
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,040
people protocol

1488
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,240
allows us

1489
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,240
to do

1490
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:26,840
good science

1491
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:32,240
over that
we communicate over the internet.

1492
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,920
Great So here to be forced

1493
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:37,040
would

1494
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,760
be great.

1495
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:46,000
Is now

1496
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,080
you'll see here
this document is very simple.

1497
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,720
It is just endpoints.

1498
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,240
So to create a user first,

1499
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,520
first, tell me one thing on this index.

1500
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,560
A job application.

1501
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,840
If you want to add a new user,
if you want to delete a user,

1502
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,800
if you want to approve the leave,
whatever the things you want to do,

1503
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:10,080
you need to have first.

1504
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,000
One is special type of user.

1505
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,320
What does that user can
everyone can everyone at the employee?

1506
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,800
No, only a green get empty.

1507
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,760
The employee only admin can delete
the employees.

1508
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,600
Only admin can approve the leave
and everything.

1509
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,200
Right.

1510
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,680
Only admin can do it.

1511
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,000
Not everyone can do it. Right? Correct.

1512
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,600
So this is the difference in between

1513
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,480
creating an employee
and creating an admin user.

1514
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,680
Creating an enemy needs that.

1515
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:44,600
So when we talk about this, create user,
it means first we are creating

1516
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,560
an inconvenience.

1517
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:47,640
What we are

1518
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:53,680
doing, creating an enemy new user.

1519
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:57,960
Right now, if we talk about the common
nouns are common terms.

1520
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:01,560
So we had been talking
about this particular part.

1521
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:05,640
If I want to add a new record
in their database,

1522
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:09,880
we call it Create operation.

1523
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,400
Great. Yes, from great operation.

1524
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:15,680
The first one is one create
to create means simple.

1525
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:19,160
I want to add,
as I want to add a recording database,

1526
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:25,120
I want to add something in the database.

1527
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:35,360
Is this correct?

1528
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:41,720
So now, now see another thing,
another important thing here.

1529
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,080
When I said business, you are right

1530
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,560
with little malaise.

1531
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,680
What is with you are

1532
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,200
my you are

1533
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:56,760
less my evaluation, less my endpoint.

1534
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:57,360
Right.

1535
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:01,160
This is the place I got.

1536
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:05,400
This is the place
I got where I can create.

1537
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,360
Where I can create. It means

1538
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,120
right.

1539
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:16,320
This is the table I got that I can create
the admin user, correct or not.

1540
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,080
Tell me
this is the place where I can create.

1541
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,160
It means read click No.

1542
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:27,240
Now to add a something in that database,

1543
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,520
to add something in the database

1544
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:33,400
to create a record in their database,

1545
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:36,280
I need to have something in my hand
first or not.

1546
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,960
This is just the address.

1547
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,560
This base, you are right,
is nothing but the address.

1548
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:45,760
So I need something to edit or something.

1549
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,400
It's simple.

1550
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:50,240
Like if I want to give you $100 first,
I should have hundred dollars

1551
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:50,840
in my pocket.

1552
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:55,120
Then only I can give it to.

1553
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:57,480
If I don't know, hundred dollars,
how will they give it to you?

1554
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:58,160
Right.

1555
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:00,280
So first I should have something.

1556
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,440
Then I can add it to the database. Right.

1557
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:08,080
So that something in
API language is nothing but

1558
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:16,040
the bank

1559
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,160
pain, or we call it

1560
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,680
body, what we call

1561
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:31,440
that is what we call it, body cutting.

1562
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,200
So remember, remember one thing

1563
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:40,320
whenever, whenever
you want to add something in the database,

1564
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:44,520
you always need body,
you always need a payload.

1565
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:45,720
Because if you don't

1566
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:49,240
have something in your body,
what would you add in the database?

1567
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,080
This base you want to is just the address.

1568
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,320
Address doesn't mean body on that address.

1569
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:58,160
If you want to add something,
you have to add something additional.

1570
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,800
Not anybody who gets something
from their database,

1571
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:06,920
but anybody.

1572
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:08,640
No plate.

1573
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,320
So forget operations
to retrieve operations.

1574
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,800
We are going to fetch the records.

1575
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,320
Why would we need a body?

1576
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,680
We don't need a body.

1577
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:19,080
Maybe we use brain for them. Exactly.

1578
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:20,280
Exactly.

1579
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,000
This is something

1580
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:24,840
we have been missing from last for months
and be interpreting this point.

1581
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:31,040
All the geniuses, Einstein, by the name of
beautiful, instant, brainless

1582
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:41,880
cutting.

1583
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,560
So now this billion auto body,

1584
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,920
we need to create a record
in their database.

1585
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,200
But to get something from their database.

1586
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,360
You don't need this.

1587
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,560
You don't need body getting So right now,
because we are going

1588
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:58,360
to create a record in the database,
we need all these things.

1589
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:00,480
So let me put all these things here.

1590
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,840
One by one, which we are collecting,
we are putting.

1591
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:06,320
So I'm going to write here to do

1592
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,720
this is the very first request
to let me write

1593
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,240
a proposed request

1594
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,560
for API, which we are making.

1595
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,520
So what honorable components
we need the right components

1596
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:24,600
we need to make components.

1597
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:27,400
We need to make

1598
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:30,160
forced linguist, right.

1599
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,480
So here what we are going to do,
we are going to create

1600
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:37,080
and it means user

1601
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:39,640
based,

1602
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,600
we're going to create an admin user.

1603
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,640
So we need, we need base.

1604
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:48,040
You are I.

1605
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:52,040
So to do that base you are
I need three things.

1606
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:55,600
It is address of this API location

1607
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,280
in the endpoint this is we already got.

1608
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:01,640
Then we need another thing that is my

1609
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:04,520
it is my payload.

1610
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,480
It is my payload

1611
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,600
or simple language recorded body.

1612
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:13,360
Remember remember we discussed this point.

1613
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,240
Remember this we discussed this point.

1614
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,400
What is that point?

1615
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:18,920
We are going to use?

1616
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,840
Which web service

1617
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,280
API is already web service

1618
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,760
in the Yes, we are going to use rest.

1619
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:38,400
We have to list will install

1620
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,600
and we will going to work mainly
with just right.

1621
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:46,400
So now in the rest
trade in the rest services.

1622
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,520
I told you it exists JSON,

1623
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:54,600
XM and text HD and remember

1624
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,720
remember Jason HD and will examine
text etc.

1625
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,840
so many languages it used reused.

1626
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:09,120
We use decent language,
we use just the language

1627
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:14,840
JSON language to break the body

1628
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,920
right. Body.

1629
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,800
It is a unique map so nobody read the word

1630
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:24,240
plane is

1631
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:27,160
so now see how we arrange some languages.

1632
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,680
Really easy.

1633
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:31,880
We are not going to write this first.
Come here.

1634
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:35,080
Going to swagger.

1635
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:39,160
So now what example Google disturb
the user who registered the user.

1636
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:43,000
Maybe you'll see on Facebook
if you want to register yourself

1637
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:46,080
what are the fruits you need to see

1638
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,040
who restored

1639
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:53,440
the user
to create a new user in Facebook working.

1640
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,560
What are the rules you need?

1641
01:42:55,560 --> 01:43:00,000
Maybe first name, last name, email,
password of birth,

1642
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:05,280
something like this.

1643
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,520
Similarly, if you go on to the Amazon

1644
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:12,840
to register a user, you need just a phone
number, mobile phone number.

1645
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:13,480
Right?

1646
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,520
If you provide your mobile phone number,
that is enough to register yourself

1647
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:18,360
or even

1648
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:19,960
read.

1649
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,680
If you talk about some

1650
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,440
website, for example, Skyscanner,

1651
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,120
that if you want to register your search
so you can simply provide your name

1652
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:32,280
and your email or name
or your phone number, it

1653
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,600
it means pre-registering
the users on different forms, right?

1654
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:44,800
And according to the platform, we are
changing, we are changing the concept.

1655
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,040
The form is not same everywhere.

1656
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:50,040
Someone is asking your first name
with a name.

1657
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:52,440
Last name
someone is asking just your phone number

1658
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:56,920
or someone is asking just your phone
number or email with your ID and password.

1659
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,000
It is changing. Fine.

1660
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,720
So how would we know?

1661
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:02,760
Third way Creating the body.

1662
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:05,760
What all are the things I need to think?

1663
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,960
What all are, the things I need to change
to create the use and what I need.

1664
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:13,200
The body I do. So who we deal with this?

1665
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,120
These are the information we need in
the body.

1666
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,800
Who is going to tell me this

1667
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,600
claim

1668
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,240
which claimed

1669
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:32,240
development?

1670
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,960
We have nothing for developers.

1671
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:41,680
We have just one document called Swagger.

1672
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:44,120
We have just one document called Swagger.

1673
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:48,480
Now, if you come here on to the swagger,
you see

1674
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:52,200
which request
we are going to create for creating user.

1675
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:54,840
This one, correct?

1676
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:55,760
Correct.

1677
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,440
Click on this.

1678
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:59,640
Click on this.

1679
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:03,160
Now you see it says This end Point

1680
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:05,880
will create a user.

1681
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:08,200
This End Point will create the user.

1682
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:10,200
So this is the end point you use.

1683
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:14,520
It will create the user
lost values in spring.

1684
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,240
For me, it says everything in detail,
boss values in the string for

1685
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:22,600
it says here, see it says body.

1686
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:26,640
And then when it is required,
what does it mean?

1687
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:31,680
If you want to send something, create a
new record in the database, you need body.

1688
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:35,640
So we have to send
body because can you create?

1689
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,160
We have to create

1690
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:41,760
body now in body
what all are the things we need.

1691
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,360
So we need name, we need email,
we need password.

1692
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,560
Can you see this?

1693
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:53,040
We need a name, we need email,
we need password

1694
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:59,120
and in which form key and when the key
and when the key and when did right.

1695
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:03,440
So this is my decent one week
This is my decent forward.

1696
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:05,960
How would we know
this is my Jason Baldwin.

1697
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:10,920
You see it

I will tell you what this connection,
normally we can do that.

1714
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,600
First, select this plus icon.

1715
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,520
And you see it gives you new collection
here.

1716
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,960
It gives you a new collection.

1717
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:44,320
So change the name to its index match.

1718
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,360
And then when you've been

1719
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:54,120
index match 11 API dynamic

1720
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,880
renaming race

1721
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:04,720

1723
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,360
opening

1724
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,720
opening and it says this collection

1725
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:18,960
is empty and request to start working.

1726
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,120
How many of you got this message

1727
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:25,800
meet.

1728
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,560
Meet me so many.

1729
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:34,040
Okay, now

1730
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,120
now remember, remember,

1731
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:40,800
I believe everyone uses zero.

1732
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,720
Everyone use cheetah print

1733
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,080
in general do we

1734
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:54,120
have is super.

1735
01:48:54,120 --> 01:49:01,200
I got this.

1736
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:03,640
You need to use selected this API.

1737
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:05,960
You have to select this collection.

1738
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,320
Click on connection not on maybe interest

1739
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:09,880
rate.

1740
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:13,960
You selected this API
so that's why you're getting this pass.

1741
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:17,320
You have to select this connection
and then you find this.

1742
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,440
So now Bennie intends

1743
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:30,200
to shoot what you have.

1744
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:31,240
What do you have in collection?

1745
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:33,840
This is to get this simple.

1746
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:38,760
Come on.

1747
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:42,920
All the dislike posters,
all the Nasdaq posters tell me what

1748
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:49,640
we having best suit.

1749
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:52,440
This case is great.

1750
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,960
Similarly
to keep to keep all the best cases based.

1751
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,200
One place
we need best suit in the stream manner

1752
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:04,440
if we have so many API request.

1753
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:10,120
So to keep that exist in one
place, we need collections

1754
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:12,840
industry.

1755
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,000
The curmudgeon

1756
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:19,200
having multiple list exists
to put all of them in one place.

1757
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:21,520
We need more. We need best suit.

1758
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:26,600
Similarly, having multiple API equals
to keep all of them in one place.

1759
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:29,480
We need we need collections

1760
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:34,320
so far.

1761
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:41,160
So should we proceed further.

1762
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:42,320
Nice.

1763
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:46,560
So now we are going to create
are forced to request to create a user.

1764
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,840
So click on add request,
click on add request

1765
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:55,680
and here you'll see it is asking great.

1766
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:58,000
It is asking for this new request. Fine.

1767
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,880
So This request a name you need to change.

1768
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,000
Click on this icon and change it.

1769
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:04,920
This request name.

1770
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:10,400
Do it to me So

1771
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:16,480
create a mean user.

1772
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:21,520
Read today's what we are going to do.

1773
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:25,560
So name should be self-explanatory right
next time.

1774
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:26,480
If you did that,

1775
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:29,800
you should be able to understand
while reading the name of the request.

1776
01:51:29,800 --> 01:51:31,920
Okay.
This is the request. We are doing this

1777
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,360
you can use which gives also.

1778
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,120
Right.

1779
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:42,480
But I would prefer
to write a user like this.

1780
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,160
So it is very easy to understand.

1781
01:51:44,160 --> 01:51:45,520
I prefer like this.

1782
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:48,600
Yeah. Create admin users.

1783
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:50,640
Now you'll see admin user created.

1784
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,920
Correct?

1785
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:56,640
Correct. Now.

1786
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:01,520
Now the first thing,
the first thing we need is are base fuel.

1787
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:03,960
So the you this is our base.

1788
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,760
You want to

1789
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:07,240
the you this is our base.

1790
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:09,880
You want it right.

1791
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:11,520
Let's take this base.

1792
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:26,360
You want to be from the US.

1793
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:28,120
So we need this base.

1794
01:52:28,120 --> 01:52:31,080
You are an and we copy this.

1795
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:33,800
You are in base treated here.

1796
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:35,520
This is my base.

1797
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:40,560
You Are I my You are plus my API location

1798
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:45,840
plus my endpoint
plus my end point three things we need

1799
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:56,400
I shared already in the chain.

1800
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,600
If you check

1801
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,200
base, can someone please check?

1802
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:18,240
I have already shaded

1803
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:20,280
in the check in the zoom

1804
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:26,280
chat. Yes.

1805
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,840
You'll get to your
if your request is not correct

1806
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:32,640
because you have two slashes
you have to slash after.

1807
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:35,600
If we keep it to one

1808
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:47,960
to just one read.

1809
01:53:47,960 --> 01:54:04,160
Everyone got this point.

1810
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:11,400
Should we proceed further?

1811
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:14,080
Great. So now we got first thing.

1812
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:16,040
The second thing.

1813
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:18,200
The second thing, it is still this point.

1814
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:21,000
It says because

1815
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,960
it says post.

1816
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:27,520
What is this post?

1817
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,120
What is this post, guys?

1818
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:33,360
This post is my HTP method

1819
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:36,200
is TTP method.

1820
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:38,640
So click here under dropdown,

1821
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:41,760

1823
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:47,560
how easy this tool is.

1824
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:49,520
Select post method from here

1825
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:53,520
one word.

1826
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:56,000
Just think about my situation that

1827
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,400
I make poor decisions.

1828
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,240
Hold it.

1829
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:03,360
And people like him, right?

1830
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:04,920
They come from nowhere.

1831
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:07,640
All the late hits

1832
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,320
certainly

1833
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,520
it happens here.

1834
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:18,280
It see, see

1835
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,680
geniuses

1836
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:30,000
there also, Einstein, I'm telling you.

1837
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,640
And if you tell them that, hey,

1838
01:55:33,120 --> 01:55:33,920
if you tell them that.

1839
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,240
Hey, don't make noise.

1840
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:39,560
No silver, no No, no,
This is not good at all.

1841
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:42,120
This is not cool.

1842
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:43,800
They are like

1843
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:48,240
they are like shopkeepers.

1844
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:53,360
They are not cool ones, normal citizens.

1845
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:56,920
I see a lot of reasons
you find one, right?

1846
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,360
You try to find one.

1847
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:00,840
You'll get 1000 in India.

1848
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:01,480
Yeah.

1849
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:04,280
So now.

1850
01:56:04,280 --> 01:56:08,000
Now you'll see.

1851
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,080
No, not yet. Not it.

1852
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,360
Hold your horses

1853
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:13,920
for your horses.

1854
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:18,120
So now, see, this is just the address
we have so far.

1855
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:21,360
I told you we need to add a body.

1856
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:23,760
It is body but is below

1857
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:26,400
right now.

1858
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,720
We noted below.

1859
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,000
We don't have body.

1860
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,040
So first we need body.

1861
01:56:31,040 --> 01:56:33,240
First we need field. Correct.

1862
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:37,920
So you see method
I selected name, I give you what?

1863
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:40,000
And I provided you what?

1864
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:44,000
I provided.

1865
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,480
It was get it, get it.

1866
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:49,320
They will give you a guarantee
and they will to wait. Now,

1867
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,080
if you don't do this before,
if you tell them this,

1868
01:56:54,080 --> 01:57:04,000
they will give you a guarantee.

1869
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,200
All right. Now,

1870
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:12,240
now, now, after this,
after this particular point

1871
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:17,320
we have based you on and we have a GDP
method, we provided the mean.

1872
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,040
And the next thing is to provide the body.

1873
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,360
The next thing is to provide the body.

1874
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:26,080
So just take the body from it.

1875
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,200
Just take the body from here. Right.

1876
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,960
And put it here like this

1877
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:32,840
name.

1878
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:35,160
Let's create a mini user. This is mean.

1879
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:39,120
We will use grade for our complete API
as did this.

1880
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:44,280
Edwin Munoz
So tell me, who wants to become an enemy?

1881
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:51,880
Who wants to become an enemy?

1882
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:52,720
I mean, do.

1883
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:54,920
It means Lobo and Zema

1884
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:59,440
being three, four and five then is

1885
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:02,880
let me create a new element.

1886
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,960
See Lobo, Zema then this Aisha

1887
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:09,920
and any

1888
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,360
No. One

1889
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:17,000
less than it, it sounds like.

1890
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:18,440
No, no, no.

1891
01:58:19,480 --> 01:58:20,760
So here,

1892
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:25,080
here, here

1893
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:28,760
it. Right, Exactly.

1894
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:29,280
Now, here.

1895
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:32,080
I'm going to raid list in the raid.

1896
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:34,080
One, two, three dot com.

1897
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:36,600
Any user I can make,

1898
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:37,920
any user I can integrate.

1899
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,280
So e-mail list in the raid 123.

1900
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:45,720
com and then the password and I'm
going to provide best in the right.

1901
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:47,840
One, two,
three. Right. Just give me a moment

1902
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:08,200
now you'll see guys

1903
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:12,600
raid name email and, password raid.

1904
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:16,320
These three things
we have provided in Jason Volmink

1905
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:19,920
which forward is this?

1906
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,480
Which format is this next?

1907
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:24,000
This is JSON format.

1908
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:44,920
Just give me.

1909
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:46,280
All right, fine.

1910
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:51,760
So now, now we have this Jason Monty
with this, but we have a Jason body.

1911
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,040
We just got it.

1912
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:59,240
And here here we have to
we have to provide this name,

1913
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,880
email and password rate

1914
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:06,080
is name, email and password in JSON form.

1915
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:08,040
So this is my body.

1916
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:18,240
No secrets, right?

1917
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:21,280
Let me copy this.

1918
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:25,320
Go here now C go here, go here.

1919
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,680
See body

1920
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,600
click here on body guys.

1921
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:34,200
Now focus on this is the body select.

1922
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:40,880
You'll see multiple forms
none form data w WW form.

1923
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:45,120
You are an encoded raw binary graphic.

1924
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:45,520
You will

1925
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:47,880
raid.

1926
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:50,640
We have all this available from here.

1927
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,200
From here we have to select raw

1928
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:57,760
what we are against

1929
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:06,360
the raw read in raw in raw.

1930
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:09,120
We are going to select our dropdown

1931
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:12,480
and from this dropdown select JSON

1932
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:17,280
in a c sml html text in JSON

1933
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:20,800
that, we will so select Jason from here,

1934
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:25,840
select JSON from here

1935
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:27,400
in order

1936
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,720
for this tool.

1937
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:35,760
So when you select
the Jason from here is the body

1938
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:38,400
which we provided to see the body, we have

1939
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:42,640
the bodies available here.

1940
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,560
Name, email, password.

1941
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:50,560
Three things We have found a great
Did you see three things

1942
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:53,440
we found the name imminent password
in the body,

1943
02:01:54,600 --> 02:02:14,760
correct?

1944
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,440
All right, fine.

1945
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:18,640
At least he makes someone happy

1946
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:21,640
all the same.

1947
02:02:21,640 --> 02:02:22,760
It's okay.

1948
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:24,680
I'm telling you not to do this.

1949
02:02:24,680 --> 02:02:26,760
Does not register.

1950
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:28,280
Don't use right now.

1951
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:30,680
Read, write otherwise.

1952
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:34,040
Yeah. Otherwise you know it like we did.

1953
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:36,240
Like you all did indeed. Human classes.

1954
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:38,240
I still remember. Don't do this. They go

1955
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:43,120
vague.

1956
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:46,840
So first name, email and password.

1957
02:02:46,840 --> 02:02:49,200
Three things, right? All the components.

1958
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,920
We are focusing these three things
we have got.

1959
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,520
You are? Well, we have got

1960
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:56,560
most method.

1961
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:57,840
We have got

1962
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,440
right now after this.

1963
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:06,120
Should we put are all components known as
well this is this is the method defined.

1964
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:06,840
Right. See

1965
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:11,240
what swagger seems to be able to follow
so it crosses name, email and password.

1966
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:15,160
So we provided here
name and password in the morning.

1967
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:16,400
Can you see

1968
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:27,480
can you see?

1969
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:28,240
Yes. Correct.

1970
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:32,480
Only change the values don't change
this part under it will not work.

1971
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:36,600
This is the main
everything read the body defined.

1972
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:37,840
The body defined

1973
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:41,600
when creating the required and replaced
so we can not change the requirement.

1974
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:44,280
It should be seen. It should be as it is.

1975
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:49,760
It should be as is understood.

1976
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:56,960
It destroyed everyone. Yes.

1977
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,200
Yes. Correct.

1978
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:01,520
So now, now see one more point here.

1979
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:04,560
It says only there is content type.

1980
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:07,800
What is the parameter content to be read?

1981
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:13,560
So when we talk about content,
I remember we are building to our request.

1982
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:17,640
We are saying this to our requested hey
request, I'm going to give you a heads up.

1983
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:18,520
What is the hype?

1984
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:21,240
So the heads up is the body
which I'm transcending.

1985
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,240
This body is not descending.

1986
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:25,720
The body which I'm sending.

1987
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:27,960
The application is all descending,

1988
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:33,080
correct?

1989
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:33,520
Correct.

1990
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:35,920
The body
and sending the application is up.

1991
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,400
Jason I'm fine.

1992
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:42,120
So now here comes
and whenever we have to provide

1993
02:04:42,280 --> 02:04:44,880
any heads up going to is

1994
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:47,560
going to

1995
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:58,440
go is going to hit us right

1996
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:02,160
in headers here we are going to write

1997
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,320
what is the header

1998
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:09,520
content type, content type

1999
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:13,800
and after thing, time after content type,

2000
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,760
we are going to write here the value

2001
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:22,920
so the values application slash Jason,
you see this, then this information

2002
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:26,400
also we got from here only the content

2003
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:28,080
can you see this

2004
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:34,080
right?

2005
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:37,600
So now we have headers, we have body

2006
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:42,240
we have base, you are right,
we have methods selected

2007
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:48,240
everything we have read it, just click
send to get a response I Einsteins.

2008
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:51,960
We don't play consume response. Wait,

2009
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,080
hold your horses.

2010
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:57,800
Can you go back to the point
this is the header

2011
02:06:02,640 --> 02:06:05,520
I know the moment the
why is it click send to get response.

2012
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:06,960
Everyone will send a response.

2013
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,720
Everyone click on Blainey.

2014
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:18,240
That's one.

2015
02:06:18,240 --> 02:06:20,760
What did you do in body?

2016
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:21,360
Alright.

2017
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:23,400
So in body we provided the body.

2018
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:24,600
Simple, right?

2019
02:06:24,600 --> 02:06:26,880
We provided the body. Correct.

2020
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:30,400
This body
we got from here we go from here.

2021
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:34,160
You see this body we got from our. Yep.

2022
02:06:34,360 --> 02:06:35,760
From our swagger document.

2023
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:37,880
So from there we prevented colleague.

2024
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:39,960
You understood

2025
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:52,200
there are certain forces

2026
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:56,280
way that badge page have already
given the link for their trade.

2027
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:58,080
This beach link

2028
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,040
I think of.

2029
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:03,880
Can someone be sure the link of this page
once again in the group so now we can

2030
02:07:03,880 --> 02:07:05,600
have this. There you go.

2031
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:07,560
This will need

2032
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:13,160
that you to get this.

2033
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:15,600
Fine, fine.

2034
02:07:16,200 --> 02:07:16,680
So far.

2035
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:18,040
So what everyone

2036
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:37,440
now it just click send to get a response

2037
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:40,000
how we can next we're going to chat.

2038
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,200
Is it open source?
Yes it is open source thing.

2039
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:43,880
It is available every minute.

2040
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:46,360
Whenever you get is a very glad
I mean to test.

2041
02:07:46,360 --> 02:07:48,720
So one day
your developer will give you a link.

2042
02:07:48,720 --> 02:07:59,840
The moment you open the lead, you
you'll find all details in this document.

2043
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:06,720
Why do contain it?

2044
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:10,880
But yes, you need to type correct and
you don't even need to type everything.

2045
02:08:11,120 --> 02:08:14,280
It's private input.
So again, it is correct.

2046
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,800
It depends on company to company.

2047
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:20,400
When we hear you don't have to type,
you got this data already.

2048
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:21,400
Just just here.

2049
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:25,240
It contains select from the drop down
by to take a greeting.

2050
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:26,160
I don't get this

2051
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:31,960
when everything is
available, you don't have these doing it.

2052
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:34,960
Okay.

2053
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:39,000
All right, guys.

2054
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:42,040
So now see, it's just click
send to get response.

2055
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:44,920
Right click send to get a response.

2056
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:49,760
But we don't know what response
we are going to get anything right.

2057
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:53,520
And we can verify anything because we
don't know what to verify, what to check.

2058
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,520
Correct?

2059
02:08:56,520 --> 02:08:57,360
Correct.

2060
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:00,920
Right now we don't know what to verify.

2061
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:04,280
So even if it is redundant, great idea.

2062
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:06,600
We see how it's verified. Great.

2063
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:07,760
It says, Hi, Asia.

2064
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:11,600
Well, it is nothing to do
even though the response rate.

2065
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:13,200
But we will verify.

2066
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:17,440
So first we need to understand
what response we should expect here.

2067
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,760
This is very important thing.

2068
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:22,080
What response we should expect here.

2069
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:25,040
We have to check this.
I will take this list. We

2070
02:09:30,560 --> 02:09:32,920
have you ever seen this part 404

2071
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:37,520
in any application?

2072
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:45,920
What does it mean?

2073
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:49,640
Which normally is when

2074
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,480
it's this page not found.

2075
02:09:51,480 --> 02:10:02,960
This is based not on 4034 wouldn't

2076
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,080
exist in foldable zero

2077
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,400
bad request rate.

2078
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:14,760
The moment we see 404 it simply means
begin or region or phone that I got.

2079
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:16,600
It means page is not delivered.

2080
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:17,520
Correct?

2081
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:19,440
Correct

2082
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:21,760
Right.

2083
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:22,680
So what is this?

2084
02:10:22,680 --> 02:10:25,280
404403400.

2085
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:40,480
What is this?

2086
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:43,680
This is what we called H 50 B is

2087
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:46,960
status code Internet protocol.

2088
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:47,760
Right?

2089
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:50,840
So according to the protocol
gives you some good

2090
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:54,000
and those code gives you the information.

2091
02:10:54,240 --> 02:10:58,240
So what example,
if you are creating a data

2092
02:10:58,240 --> 02:11:03,360
or creating a report in the database,
if records created successfully

2093
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:05,720
and gives you one special code

2094
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:08,360
if you agree.

2095
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:11,000
So no, not one bit. There is a problem.

2096
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,840
If you're not listening completely,
then you give wrong answers late.

2097
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:19,680
If you get some information
from the database it gives you one

2098
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,080
special code.

2099
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:24,240
If you get some
and it gives you some special code,

2100
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:28,880
if you provide wrong input,
it gives you a present wrong request.

2101
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:31,240
It gives you some special code, right?

2102
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:36,480
So remember, we have five cities
one, two, three, four, five.

2103
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:38,760
You see, all the codes are available.

2104
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:41,880
00101102103.

2105
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:44,960
However, I will I will

2106
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:47,720
go double zero is past.

2107
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:48,680
Yes, that's fine.

2108
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:49,680
Let me explain.

2109
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:53,120
But we not talking about
past is of no see here.

2110
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:57,360
I advise you to focus on majorly
two cities

2111
02:11:57,960 --> 02:12:01,400
200201202203204.

2112
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:03,040
That is success.

2113
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:08,160
It is in 4210401402403404.

2114
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:11,600
Be failure cities Arab citizens success.

2115
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:15,760
It is because majority of times
99% of times

2116
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,960
we focus on two part the post is success
and the second is failure.

2117
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:22,280
All right, so this data is good.

2118
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:26,480
We should be aware about here
is this Boulevard zero.

2119
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:27,800
Okay.

2120
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:30,720
Indicates that the greatest has succeeded

2121
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:35,440
to zero one created indicates

2122
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:41,000
that the request has succeeded
and that new resource has been created.

2123
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,320
And that is everything.

2124
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:46,480
So tell me now if I'm going to create
a new record in the database,

2125
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:53,280
be like zero zero or will get will do
21201 created.

2126
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:58,200
This is what we will get right
if my request is successful.

2127
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:01,560
But if my request is not successful,
what would happen?

2128
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,200
See valid request for double zero.

2129
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:07,760
That request
could not be understood by this.

2130
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:10,920
So what it means
we are putting some incorrect data.

2131
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:12,480
It means

2132
02:13:12,480 --> 02:13:16,560
requesting some incorrect data
for zero one unauthorized.

2133
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:21,160
It means you don't have a permission
for zero domain statement required.

2134
02:13:21,520 --> 02:13:24,560
You are trying to access something
that is having a billion gateway,

2135
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:26,240
but you are not making any payment.

2136
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:29,440
You can do this open required.

2137
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:30,480
Maybe not

2138
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:36,200
getting similarly for zero trace
or with an unauthorized request.

2139
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:41,120
You can't access to this particular one
right?

2140
02:13:41,120 --> 02:13:45,440
404 page not found for zero five matter

2141
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:50,680
not allowed for example instead of post
you rate so be USD.

2142
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:51,480
No, it's okay.

2143
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:54,600
Maybe somebody in stone can do this.

2144
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,160
We know, right?

2145
02:13:56,160 --> 02:14:00,360
So if you put is ability
it says 405 method not been known

2146
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:04,440
this way postman knew
that even people will make mistake

2147
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:08,880
even rate writing this part
so they already provided everything

2148
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,240
drop down so your next time you don't need
to pay just to select from the dropdown

2149
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:17,320
because they know all nine states
are going to use this post coming to

2150
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:20,520
this code base.

2151
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:25,240
So now tell me if I am going
to create a record in the database,

2152
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:29,240
if I'm going to create a record
in database,

2153
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:31,560
what response should make

2154
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:37,560
go to

2155
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:39,240
correct?

2156
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:41,520
So what response should be expected
based on me

2157
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:46,080
to zero one ready to send the request?

2158
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:47,360
Now everyone

2159
02:14:49,080 --> 02:14:50,120
shall meet

2160
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:55,680
that you call

2161
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,960
that email address
you entered is already registered.

2162
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,000
Fine.

2163
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:29,440
So let's do this and as the neat

2164
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:32,080
and find thing

2165
02:15:34,080 --> 02:15:36,000
now you see

2166
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:38,040
now you see

2167
02:15:38,600 --> 02:15:41,520
it says is status 201 created

2168
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:48,880
also one we don't have this one user
within the database

2169
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:52,960
we do have this user email right
instead of mandatory

2170
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:56,880
because I changed everything
before sending correct command.

2171
02:15:57,400 --> 02:16:00,840
So now you'll see we got to zero one
and it says that your request

2172
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:05,640
has been fulfilled and reserve date
in a new resource being created.

2173
02:16:07,040 --> 02:16:09,200
Read new resource been created.

2174
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:13,080
So we are adding a user and here
you see the message, see user

2175
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:16,000
and the user details are this.

2176
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:22,240
So this is that email
and the password for the user.

2177
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:25,880
This is the email and the password
for the means of can you see this?

2178
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:26,800
Everyone

2179
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:36,880
right

2180
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:41,560
now, now here, now here.

2181
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:45,840
You see this is this is status code.

2182
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:49,560
This is one of the one
the verification points

2183
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:52,560
we have in the application,
One of the really big points,

2184
02:16:52,560 --> 02:16:55,760
not all the verification points is go
ahead.

2185
02:16:56,160 --> 02:16:57,040
Go ahead.

2186
02:16:57,240 --> 02:17:00,360
Change email and try to do this memo.

2187
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:02,600
And we just discussed this point.

2188
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:05,000
That's why I always explain. Right.

2189
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:08,200
I always request please listen to me
what saying

2190
02:17:08,680 --> 02:17:10,920
It says the email and it is to read.

2191
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:12,120
Great.

2192
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:16,960
This is the email address
indeed is already registered.

2193
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:17,960
I changed it.

2194
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:22,480
I told you to change it is still are using
the same one which I'm using.

2195
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,360
How will it work

2196
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:26,160
guys?

2197
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:31,720
Did I tell you to change?

2198
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:36,840
It could be anything.

2199
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:38,400
It could be any one.

2200
02:17:38,400 --> 02:17:41,600
123. Eliminate that it gmail dot com is

2201
02:17:41,840 --> 02:17:44,520
and any that it will be three dot
com something like

2202
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:50,360
I'm getting the 400
and so this is bad request

2203
02:17:50,640 --> 02:17:54,760
maybe you you should check your bot
whether this is not correct

2204
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:58,080
or whether this is not correct
or maybe this is not correct.

2205
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:00,840
These are the two three things
you need to check. Next

2206
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:05,560
request and I would check the connection,

2207
02:18:05,560 --> 02:18:07,720
whether it is connected
to it, intended or not.

2208
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:10,200
They all look at it.

2209
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:11,240
All right,

2210
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:13,280
fine.

2211
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:21,880
Then why?

2212
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:22,520
Fine.

2213
02:18:22,520 --> 02:18:26,320
So now, now, see here,
when I sent this request.

2214
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:32,040
Right When I sent this request here,
I got this data, I got this response.

2215
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:36,880
So the upper body is the request body
and the lower body is the response body.

2216
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:38,200
This is a response when you guys.

2217
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:41,240
Okay. All right, guys.

2218
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:45,160
This is the response body and

2219
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:50,520
from sort of what it is coming gudi
this is the response we from the server.

2220
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:53,560
This is the data we sent as a client.

2221
02:18:53,840 --> 02:18:55,760
This is we got from the server.

2222
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:59,840
And now you see if you want to see
this data in a similar format,

2223
02:19:00,240 --> 02:19:04,240
see this is a make symbol for
if you want to see in decent format.

2224
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:08,600
This is just an ordinary text
for make this text for me.

2225
02:19:08,880 --> 02:19:13,440
You can this data for me
also the one you received or read.

2226
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:15,680
Second thing.

2227
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:16,840
Second thing.

2228
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:19,520
This is one of the verification points.

2229
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:22,600
One of the verification points
we got here.

2230
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,760
These are the things
also we can check now.

2231
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:26,640
You see

2232
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:30,280
socket initialization done,

2233
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:34,720
DNS lookup, DCP handshake,
transport starting download.

2234
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,800
So see how much time it took
to download for milliseconds

2235
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:42,040
and how much time to transfer

2236
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:44,760
just 625 milliseconds increment

2237
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:47,560
6 seconds straight 6 seconds.

2238
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,840
Now you'll see the overall size is just

2239
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:54,080
620 x 620.

2240
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:59,760
Wait, I told you the rest list
requires minimum bandwidth.

2241
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:03,400
That's
why data constant is very easy right now.

2242
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:07,640
Just imagine the condition
if you want to create an admin user

2243
02:20:07,640 --> 02:20:15,480
from the selenium
how much time it takes, open the browser.

2244
02:20:15,480 --> 02:20:18,600
Navigating to that
you are entering the information,

2245
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:23,600
getting the message, read
it listed times more time than this one.

2246
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,720
But if you send API how much time

2247
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:29,000
the API needs just 9 seconds.

2248
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:35,520
That's
why API is the fastest form of testing,

2249
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:44,960
fastest form of testing understood this.

2250
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:47,440
This is our first request which we made.

2251
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,680
We got the data, we got desert.

2252
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:53,040
I showed you how to read the results
in API.

2253
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:53,760
Be automated.

2254
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:55,760
Yes, an API can be automated.

2255
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:58,480
We will do the automation with

2256
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:09,000
already iso I think.

2257
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,680
And then from my side for this session,
if you have any question, please ask

2258
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:15,080
or else we can wrap up the class now.

2259
02:21:15,800 --> 02:21:16,440
Thank you.
