1
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,880
All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,320
All right.

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,240
For every day, right.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,240
705 every day.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,960
Good.

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,320
All right, guys.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,360
Good evening, everybody.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,520
How is everyone doing?

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,440
I hope everyone is doing good.

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,200
Yeah.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,840
I hope you guys got everything from GitHub
and canvas, right?

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,520
Because I uploaded it today.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,160
I pushed the code
and I uploaded two classes.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,720
Two slides for selenium.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,800
Okay, good. Yeah.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,440
All right.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,960
Okay. I hope.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,440
I hope you had fun yesterday, guys. Okay.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,560
We're going to continue
learning more stuff today about selenium.

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,440
And I hope you guys did some research
for today's class.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,800
And we will start by doing some recap.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,600
Okay.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,360
So, what did we do last class, guys?

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,840
What did we do

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:39,120
yesterday?

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,960
Okay, so we started

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,080
the first class of selenium
get versus navigate.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,840
Right will launch the browser,
launching drivers,

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,680
navigating to the websites right quick
versus closed.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,680
Okay.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,480
We'll learn about set properties
and the methods.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,040
Okay, that's very good.

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,720
So before we do anything right, so when we
create a class, we import everything.

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,400
We import our libraries,
we import our drivers.

35
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,440
When we have a class
before we dive into coding,

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,200
we need to set our properties right.

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,360
So what do we have
in our properties, guys?

38
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:37,320
What do we need to mention
inside the properties?

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,640
The driver we're going to be using
and its location.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,360
Right? So we're setting the properties.

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,200
We're telling Hey, I'm using the chrome
driver and here is where it's located.

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,040
Right.

43
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,440
And then afterwards
we can launch the browser.

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,160
We can navigate to, to any website we want

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,280
and then perform any actions accordingly.

46
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,000
Right.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,120
What else did we learn?

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
So we navigated to the website.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,280
We move back and forth right? We quit.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,400
We closed the browser.

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,120
What else, guys?

52
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,920
Okay, so parsing this thread, right?

53
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,760
So that's one of the things that we learn.

54
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,520
We also learn how to maximize and make
the make the browser full screen, right?

55
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,480
Also learn how to refresh the page.

56
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,520
Okay. And what else, guys?

57
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,240
What else?

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,000
What did we get
when we first navigate to the

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,240
to the website?

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,160
What did we get from there? Exactly.

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,200
So we got the title.

62
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,920
And what else?

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,920
And the current. You're up. Right.

64
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,120
So let's let me actually create

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,240
a new package in here.

66
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:05,680
Um, class.

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,920
There are two, right?

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,120
And I will create a new Java class in here

69
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,720
and just name it as recap.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,760
Cancel this.

71
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,480
All right.

72
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,160
And I hope everyone,
everyone resolved their yesterday's issues

73
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,160
with all the libraries
and all the drivers and everything.

74
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,600
I hope

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,200
everyone has their selenium and drivers

76
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,800
up and running.

77
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,160
Okay.

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,400
I don't want anyone to be behind that
because this is the second class.

79
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,880
This is where we start interacting with
the browser, with the websites themselves.

80
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,160
Okay.

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,320
That's that's really important today.

82
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,120
Okay.

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,120
So, okay, So yesterday

84
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,840
what we said
was we set the property first, right?

85
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,040
So system

86
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,280
that we set the property

87
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,120
and then and the first argument,

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,440
what we've done is web driver

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,600
Chrome driver.

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
All right.

91
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,880
And in the second one

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,680
we had the drivers

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,560
chrome driver

94
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,520
Right.

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,480
So now after we set the properties,
what is our next step,

96
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:32,160
guys?

97
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
Create an object, right?

98
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
So let's go ahead and do that.

99
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,680
Web driver.

100
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,280
Driver
is equal to new chrome driver, Right.

101
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,480
So what is this line ten going to do,
guys?

102
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,280
Is this going to launch the browser or no,

103
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,560
it will open the browser,
but it will not navigate to anywhere.

104
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,680
Right.

105
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,960
So let's go ahead and navigate
to, let's say, Facebook.

106
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,120
Okay.

107
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,280
So driver that get

108
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,120
and we can do it.

109
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
I think we can do this. Be right in here.

110
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,000
So let's see how that's going to work.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,760
So what is what do we want to do next?

112
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,280
So I navigate it to the website.

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,120
What do we want to do next

114
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,440
before we even do anything
on that website?

115
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,200
Guys, when we're navigating
to the Facebook right now.

116
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,560
So there we go.

117
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,120
So what we want to do,
we want to maximize our screen, right?

118
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,680
So what I'm going to do simply driver

119
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,400
that manage my window

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,040
and I will be maximizing it.

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,120
Right? Okay.

122
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,360
So now what I want to do, guys,
I want to verify the title again.

123
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,920
So right now
we won't be using any assertions.

124
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,760
We will be just simply using the if
conditions that we've learned from Java.

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,880
Okay.

126
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,840
So what do I need to do?

127
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,320
First, I want to verify the title in here
so we maximize the window.

128
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,880
How do I get the title, guys?

129
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,760
How do I have the title in my coat?

130
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,640
Simple, right?

131
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,200
So I'm using the driver
object in here again.

132
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,840
And what I do, I get the title.

133
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,440
What am I getting in return in here

134
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,920
is string, right?

135
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,160
So what I will do

136
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,960
string title

137
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,240
is equal to this.

138
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,240
So now let's actually go in here

139
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,680
and navigate to Facebook.

140
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
Okay, so this is my Facebook.

141
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,640
I want to verify if the
if we have the right

142
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,640
if we have the right title.

143
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,560
Okay. How do we want to do this?

144
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:18,600
How do we want to approach this?

145
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,320
We can use a NEF condition, right?

146
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,480
So if my title

147
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,480
let's do it ignore case
or let's just do equals, right.

148
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,600
So that we are we are 100%

149
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,960
what's called Sure that everything,

150
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,360
even if it's capital letter
or not capital, it doesn't really matter.

151
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,080
Everything is equal as my title,
which I got right.

152
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,600
So I think it is Facebook

153
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,840
log in or

154
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
signup, right, if I'm not mistaken.

155
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,760
So once that condition is matched,
what I will do, I'm

156
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,600
just going to simply print out that

157
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,280
title is correct.

158
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
And if it's not,

159
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,760
then I'm going to have another condition
in here.

160
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,680
Right.

161
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,280
What I will do,
I'm just going to print out

162
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:36,240
that title is wrong.

163
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,840
It's correct and it's wrong.

164
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,480
And after I did that, what I want to do,
I want to terminate the

165
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,040
my execution
and I want to close the browser.

166
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,960
And what I simply do is here

167
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,720
I will simply add the driver that quit.

168
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,920
Right.

169
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,800
Okay.

170
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,520
So let's do actually that.

171
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,720
So after I maximize my window,
I want to wait for 2 seconds.

172
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,280
Guys.

173
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:11,320
How would I do this?

174
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,880
I can use the threat dot sleep.

175
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,280
Right?

176
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,840
So I want to pause my execution
for a couple seconds in here

177
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,040
after I maximize my window and only

178
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,200
then start getting the title right.

179
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,160
So what I will do in here
throughout that sleep

180
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,800
and this exact millisecond,
so I'll put 2000

181
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,640
and I will just add an exception
to my method signature.

182
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,960
Okay.

183
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,840
Any questions before I run this?

184
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:49,600
Guys?

185
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Okay, cool.

186
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,040
All right, so let's run
this and see if this is going to work.

187
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,120
Okay?

188
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,480
All right. Running this.

189
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,760
Let's say.

190
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,840
Okay now. Oh, it maximize over here.

191
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,560
Okay.

192
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,000
The title is wrong. What's going on, guys?

193
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,600
So it maximize over here. Guys,

194
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
I think
this because this one is my main screen.

195
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
That's why it maximized here.

196
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,720
But I'm pretty sure you guys should get
this one as well.

197
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,520
What's wrong with this? Why?

198
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,240
It's skip this one.

199
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,400
Why did our what's called
why did our condition

200
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,440
not meet?

201
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,840
Because the condition is false.

202
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,680
Where

203
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,360
what is the.

204
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Did we make a mistake in here?

205
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,160
Let's go and see here.

206
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,120
Yeah. Okay.

207
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,800
Okay. This one.

208
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,560
This one should be capital.

209
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,080
Okay?

210
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,400
That this one should be capital.

211
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,840
So let's run it again and see

212
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:11,880
if this is going to work.

213
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,480
There we go.

214
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,880
So it maximized over here. It closed.

215
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,720
Oh, is still wrong.

216
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,280
Okay, sign up.

217
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,800
Okay. You is capital as well.

218
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,320
Okay.

219
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,640
Rerunning it again
until we have the correct title.

220
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:28,920
Okay.

221
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:36,880
So let's see.

222
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,520
Okay.

223
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,040
How do we know if the title
what the title is, guys?

224
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,120
So now the title is correct.

225
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:53,280
Where do we get the actual title from?

226
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,120
It's on the tab, right?

227
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,920
So if you look at the tab right here,
so this is your title.

228
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,040
Whenever wherever you navigate,
you will have a title of that page.

229
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,680
Okay, So this is your you are all in here
and this on the tab will be your title.

230
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,920
Okay. All right.

231
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,120
Any questions, guys?

232
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:28,880
Before we move on to the next topic,
you guys have an issues with audio

233
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,120
or it's

234
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,000
Hello, everyone.

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:59,360
Okay, that's not good.

236
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:16,400
Okay, let me see.

237
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:27,120
Is this better, guys or no,

238
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,040
that sounds better or worse

239
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,360
because I changed the microphone.

240
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
So let's see.

241
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,400
Okay, Way better.

242
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,480
Okay, good.

243
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,320
Okay.

244
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,360
All right, cool.

245
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,840
Okay, guys.

246
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,680
So let's continue with some new stuff.

247
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,640
Okay. So let me go back here

248
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,280
to. Okay, I hope you guys did

249
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,960
some research on what is the web element
and the locators and selenium.

250
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,880
Okay.

251
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,880
So anyone any guesses

252
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,040
what is an element, guys,

253
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,960
what is an element in selenium?

254
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,960
What do the notes,

255
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,320
what is a web

256
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,040
element?

257
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,520
Anything we see on the page is considered
to be a web element, right?

258
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,200
Anything present on the web page,
like the text boxes.

259
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,240
Like the buttons,
like the links, dropdowns, checkboxes.

260
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,640
Right?

261
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,960
Anything we see on
the web page is considered

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,920
to be a web element, right?

263
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,640
So anything we see on

264
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,680
the Web page

265
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,640
is considered to be a web element.

266
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,440
Okay, So example

267
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,920
here, buttons, text boxes,

268
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,120
checkboxes. Right.

269
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,200
Any links?

270
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,120
Okay. So let's go in here.

271
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,760
Let's go here. So

272
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,040
anything we

273
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,280
see on this page right now,
this is the button.

274
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,640
This is the link, right?
This is another button.

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,240
These texts, even
even if they're not clickable

276
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,920
and just showing anything,
these are considered as elements as well.

277
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,080
Okay.

278
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,480
Even though you can't perform

279
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,320
any actions on those,
they are considered as elements as well.

280
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,880
So where do we see any text boxes? Guys

281
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,200
there we see any text boxes

282
00:16:50,200 --> 00:17:00,600
on this page, email and password.

283
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:00,920
Right.

284
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,160
Text boxes are where we type in something.

285
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,400
We type in some text in there. Right.

286
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,880
So these are considered as the text boxes.

287
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,160
Okay.

288
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,800
So for us guys, in order

289
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,120
so manually,
if I want to do anything in here,

290
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,720
we have a keyboard
we can navigate with our cursor, right?

291
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,560
So and come here, type it in here, type
any password,

292
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,000
click on the log in right or click
forgot password.

293
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,040
So this is how everything
manually works, right?

294
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,320
But in order for us to write a logic

295
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,120
by using selenium,

296
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,960
we need to interact with each
and every element separately.

297
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,280
Okay.

298
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,080
And in order to do this, we need to
interact with something internal.

299
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:00,800
Okay.

300
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Something
internally built in in the browser.

301
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,200
Okay, so what I will do right now in here,

302
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,000
I will go ahead and right click in here,
Okay?

303
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,720
Right click on any place at the web page.

304
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,200
And I will open up one window
where we will be interacting

305
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,040
with each
and every web element on the page.

306
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,760
Okay.

307
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,720
So I will right click and go to inspect.

308
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,560
Okay, So I'll click on Inspect.

309
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,080
And now you can see there's
a lot of different code in here.

310
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,960
There's something in here, right?

311
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,720
So we have a separate window
opening up on the right side of the page.

312
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,120
Okay.

313
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,680
So what I'm going to do,
I'm actually going to move this

314
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,800
to the bottom of our screen.

315
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,440
Okay.

316
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,800
So if you go to the
to these three dots, click on those.

317
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,920
You will see the dark side in here.

318
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,280
Okay. So

319
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,520
I will go ahead and click on the dock
to bottom.

320
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,800
Okay.

321
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,600
And everything
will get moved to the bottom.

322
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,080
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

323
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,120
So this is going to be better
for us to learn and to manipulate

324
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,920
with all the elements. Okay.

325
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,160
I hope everyone is following
and everyone is understanding

326
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:33,360
what is going on.

327
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
Okay, right click inspect, guys.

328
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,520
And then if you want to dock it
to the bottom,

329
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
what you can do, click on these three dots

330
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,600
and then choose
whichever way you want to dock it.

331
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,360
Okay?

332
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,520
So you can dock it to the last
or you can dock it to the right.

333
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,720
It doesn't really matter
or you can get to the bottom.

334
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,120
So for me,
I like to dock it to the bottom.

335
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,200
It's better for me to manipulate

336
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,640
with everything
and to manipulate with the elements.

337
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,440
Okay.

338
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
He used to do it. Okay. Okay. That's good.

339
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,560
That's good. Almost.

340
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,520
Almost a hacker.

341
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,120
Okay.

342
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,920
All right. Okay.

343
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,320
So now.

344
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,440
Now we started to

345
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,760
install protecting this page.

346
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,920
Okay, So now we can see
what is how the page is written,

347
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,800
how the page is designed.

348
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,600
Okay, so

349
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,360
what?

350
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,840
So anyone knows? What did we just open?

351
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,680
What is this window, guys, Source code.

352
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:55,800
Okay, h html.

353
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,760
Okay, that's very good.

354
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,800
So we see an h HTML code in here, right?

355
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,960
Okay. That's very good. Okay.

356
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,320
Source code, frontend code.

357
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,400
Okay.

358
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,320
Anything else?

359
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,120
Okay, so there is a couple different names
for this.

360
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,160
Okay.

361
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,680
So this is called a DOM.

362
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,760
So Dom is Dom stands

363
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,440
for document object model.

364
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,880
Okay.

365
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,440
So it's we can see the HTML,
how everything is designed

366
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,880
and you can see the SS in here,
how the frontend developers

367
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,720
design it and the padding,
the background, the font and everything.

368
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,200
But we won't be really using
any of the CC.

369
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,480
We will mainly be working with this HTML
inside our DOM.

370
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,480
Okay, so let's go ahead in here

371
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,800
and put So does
anybody know what HTML stands for?

372
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Guys?

373
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,000
Yeah.

374
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:22,920
So Google it.

375
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,000
Let's see.

376
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,400
Okay.

377
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,480
Hypertext markup language.

378
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,400
Right? Okay,

379
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,200
good.

380
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,400
Okay, So hypertext

381
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,080
markup

382
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,920
language.

383
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,040
Okay.

384
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,480
All right. And then so what?

385
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,000
What is Dom?

386
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,960
So we set it stands for document
object, model, right?

387
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,760
So this Dom is an internal browsers view.

388
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,800
Okay.

389
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,480
So this is an internal view
of the web page of the OC.

390
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,160
Dom That's good.

391
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,760
That's a good one.

392
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,600
Yes, exactly.

393
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Okay.

394
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,880
All right.

395
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,720
So let's put it here. Now.

396
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,640
Stands for

397
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,000
document

398
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,560
model, right?

399
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,640
It is.

400
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,040
It is the

401
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,520
browser's internal

402
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,200
view of the web page.

403
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,920
Okay.

404
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,080
It is also called as developers Tools.

405
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,920
Okay.

406
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,480
So also of

407
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,400
developers

408
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,120
tools.

409
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,520
Or you could just say, yeah, it's

410
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,240
all right.

411
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,080
Okay, so let's go one by one.

412
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,560
So why, why does he call as document guys?

413
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,040
What?

414
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,480
What does it mean that what,

415
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,280
what does it mean that it's document guys,
Where do we see a document in here.

416
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:35,960
Guys, when we inspect the page.

417
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,200
This text. Right.

418
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,520
So here,
this is considered as one document.

419
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,200
Okay, So one page, one page that we see

420
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,200
on the web page is considered

421
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,840
in here as a HTML document.

422
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,560
Right?

423
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,600
So it can be actually stored as

424
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,520
any document can be stored, any document

425
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,720
as PDF Excel or anything.

426
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,880
But here it is stored as an HTML.

427
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:25,840
So why the object guys?

428
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,760
Why that object?

429
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,040
Any guesses? Guys,

430
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,400
let's go back in here

431
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:42,720
so we can run this.

432
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,200
Every element sends unique.

433
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,400
Some of them, yes, some of them unique.

434
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Not all of them are unique, but

435
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,520
as object, we mean each

436
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,720
and every line of code in here,

437
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,280
each and every line inside

438
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,600
the HTML will be considered as an object.

439
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,720
Okay, so here

440
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,200
any line in HTML

441
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,080
is considered as

442
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,360
object. Okay.

443
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,320
And then the last thing is why model

444
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,240
guys, we're not going to learn HTML,

445
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,920
but we will be browsing the HTML
to interact with that web elements.

446
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,760
Okay.

447
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,960
Okay. Anyone?

448
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,920
Any idea why it's a model?

449
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:50,800
Guys?

450
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,920
What does it mean in here?

451
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,400
As we say, it's a model.

452
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
It's like a template.

453
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,240
Right? Exactly. It's a layout, right?

454
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,600
It's a blueprint.

455
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,440
That's exactly what it is. Right?

456
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,760
It is just the layout of this HTML
file in here.

457
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,040
Okay.

458
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,040
So it is just the

459
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,800
layout of the HTML.

460
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,920
That's what it is.

461
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,360
So we know how to open up a DOM in here.

462
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,560
We know how to inspect
and we know how to view

463
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,320
an internal

464
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,160
HTML of any page of the website.

465
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,800
Right.

466
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,400
Okay,

467
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,240
so now guys in here,

468
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,200
so we opened up the dev tools in here
we see the HTML.

469
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,440
So now what we can do, we can start
interacting with the web elements.

470
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,560
Okay, So let me check

471
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:55,440
one thing in here.

472
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,160
Okay?

473
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,480
So before we interact

474
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,760
with the elements, guys,
I want to go over the locators.

475
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,600
Okay.

476
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,720
So did anyone do a research?

477
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,040
What locators are in selenium and
what kind of locators we have in selenium?

478
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,760
That's

479
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,640
okay.

480
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,760
Experts says okay,

481
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,120
okay, so we have eight locators, right?

482
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,320
Class tag name. Okay.

483
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,080
So before we move into what kind of
locators we have, what is a locator,

484
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,160
guys, that help

485
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,320
navigate
where you want to do your execution?

486
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,040
Oh, yeah. Kind of makes sense. Yes.

487
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,080
So the locator is the address, right?

488
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,480
Or position of the web element
You want to interact with.

489
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
Okay, so let's put it here.

490
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,840
Locator, do

491
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:14,000
this is an address or a position,

492
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,160
right?

493
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,320
Address for web element.

494
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,160
Right

495
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,840
position of an element.

496
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,040
So it's basically an address or a position
of the web element on the web page.

497
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,720
Right. So on the

498
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,520
Web page.

499
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,280
Okay,

500
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,800
So what why do we need the locators
in selenium, guys?

501
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,760
What do we have to do with these

502
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,960
two command?

503
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,080
Okay.

504
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,880
Anything else?

505
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,320
Use them to navigate.

506
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,280
Okay.

507
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,120
Want to interact? Right.

508
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,760
So we use the locators to identify, right.

509
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,240
To locate
or to interact with the web elements.

510
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,440
Okay.

511
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,320
So is

512
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,440
used to locate or

513
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,600
or identify

514
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,520
web elements on the web page.

515
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,440
Okay. All right.

516
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,280
This is clear.

517
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,880
Right, guys?

518
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,040
So we have locator is an address
or a position of a web element

519
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,080
on the Web page.

520
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,120
And it is used to locate or identify
the Web element on the Web page.

521
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,480
So now let's talk about the locators
themselves.

522
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:51,720
Okay.

523
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,320
So some people say
there are eight locators, right?

524
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,000
So eight

525
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,720
eight locators.

526
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,040
So what
do we know about the locators, guys?

527
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,480
So we said eight.

528
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,040
Which ones

529
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,480
ID, ID

530
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,320
name, what else?

531
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,080
So let me actually put it down here. I.D.

532
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,320
We got name in here.

533
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:24,600
Okay.

534
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,880
With that tag name.

535
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,240
Okay. Tag name.

536
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,880
What else?

537
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,200
X path.

538
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,960
X path.

539
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,640
Okay, So tag name, link tags, partial link
text.

540
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,240
Right. Okay.

541
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,440
So link, say link text.

542
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,320
Well, so have

543
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,520
partial link text.

544
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,640
Right. So we got six in here.

545
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,800
We have CSF selector

546
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,680
and there's one more guys.

547
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,200
There is a class name.

548
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,360
Absolutely. Right.

549
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
So class name.

550
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,120
Okay, so eight locators. Right.

551
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,880
So this, this is one of the interview
questions, guys.

552
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,280
So do not forget you might get this

553
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:25,120
if you have an interview
and they ask you about the

554
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,640
any questions from selenium,
they might start with this question.

555
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,200
Okay.

556
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,840
So how many locators do you know
in in selenium?

557
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,120
So you start with we know it
locators in selenium, ID name tag, name

558
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,240
X Path link tax, partially tax

559
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,720
test selector and the class name.

560
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,760
Okay.

561
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,920
So eight locators
we're going to be using to locate

562
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,080
and identify the elements
and we will be interacting with those.

563
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,520
Okay, So let's go down here.

564
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,640
Let's see.

565
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,400
All right.

566
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,320
So let's take a look at the sample.

567
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,240
This let's take a look at the sample.

568
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,320
So this is an HTML in here.

569
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,880
I hope everyone can see this. Right.

570
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,800
Let me zoom in a little bit.

571
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,120
Okay.

572
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,840
All right.

573
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,480
So in HTML, guys,
we see some different colors, right?

574
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,480
So let's go back. Oh, not here.

575
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,800
Let's go back in here. Okay.

576
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,160
So if you look at this, you can see
different, different colors, right?

577
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,280
So we can differentiate
everything that is in here.

578
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,320
Like, like in the coding in Java,

579
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,280
you see the keywords in different,
different colors, right?

580
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,320
So that you can differentiate them.

581
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,000
So it is the same way in HTML as well.

582
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,840
So you see the purple tag, the purple

583
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,560
keywords,
you see the brownish orange, right?

584
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,920
And we see the blue in here,
we see underlined in here, right?

585
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,120
So we'll be talking
about those right now. So

586
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,080
when you see the purple

587
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,120
back here, when you see the purple ones
in here, Right.

588
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,200
So what they mean is they mean the tags.

589
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:15,880
Okay.

590
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,280
So Dave, script body

591
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,360
spans, script or link or what?

592
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,280
What else do we have in here? IMG Right.

593
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,000
They are all HTML tags.

594
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,200
Okay,
so let's take a look at the slide in here.

595
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,880
So now if you look at so here they,

596
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,760
they probably use different theme,

597
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,480
but let's go back to our Facebook.

598
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,880
So if you look in here, you see this
graph, you see this style source class.

599
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,080
They are all brownish and
it's a little bit orange or brown, right?

600
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,160
So whatever you want to call this.

601
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,760
So these are called as attributes.

602
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,400
Okay.

603
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,360
So if you look in here,

604
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,680
you can see this
the value, the name, the I.D.,

605
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,600
the address,
these are all called actually views.

606
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,320
Okay.

607
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,640
It's hard if you're colorblind. It's okay.

608
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,200
Just know that the first one is always
will come with tag name.

609
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,240
The second one you will have an attribute.

610
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,840
And after the equals sign
and inside the double quotes,

611
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,640
you will see the attribute values.

612
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,080
Okay.

613
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,840
Exactly.

614
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,440
This is an opening tag,
and at the very end you will see

615
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,560
the closing tag as well.

616
00:35:47,600 --> 00:36:02,040
Any questions on these guys? Yep.

617
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,920
It's like a code, right?

618
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,960
I mean, it is a code.

619
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,720
It's an HTML, right?

620
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:16,080
The red one are tags. Yep.

621
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,680
Opening and close.

622
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,000
Okay.

623
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,960
So or actually

624
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,160
it's just for HTML

625
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,680
scripting meaning in here.

626
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,600
So if you say purple

627
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
tags.

628
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,120
Right.

629
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,280
And then we have brown,

630
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,360
they're actually dudes.

631
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,040
Then I think with blue, which are

632
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,760
attributes values.

633
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,480
Okay.

634
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,560
Red is the tag.

635
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:07,080
Exactly.

636
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,360
But they're all the same. Yeah.

637
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,840
The reason you see here as red, because

638
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,080
in the sample here
they use a different theme.

639
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,400
Okay, so there are different
different things that you can use.

640
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,240
Mine is here. It's a default one.

641
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,200
So that's why we have this.

642
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,520
Okay,
so sometimes you have a black background

643
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,640
for your chrome,
you want to change your background.

644
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,360
So all those will be
will be implemented in your HTML.

645
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,720
What's called HTML
colors will change as well.

646
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,320
But the default ones,
if you use a default browser

647
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,760
chrome theme, that means that you will see
these colors in here.

648
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,360
Okay.

649
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,200
Yeah. Most yeah, exactly.

650
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,680
Most colors will do that.

651
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,320
And this is for developers.

652
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,920
We can use it to an intelligent actually.

653
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,640
But whenever
you are locating any elements for us, it's

654
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,000
I think for me personally,
I use this white one.

655
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,720
So this is
this is pretty good for me or is just me.

656
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,200
I just

657
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,320
got used to this one.

658
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,200
It's a preference, right, guys?

659
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,640
So it's a preference
so if you want to use a dark,

660
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,920
dark mode, that's fine.

661
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:35,520
You can do that as well.

662
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,360
All right.

663
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,040
Any questions before me?

664
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:53,720
Before we move on, guys?

665
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Questions. Okay, good.

666
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,280
All right, so

667
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,320
let's then get into some coding.

668
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,600
Okay.

669
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,200
So now, guys, what we want to do in here,

670
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,560
since said we will be using those locators

671
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,120
to locate the element
and to interact with them.

672
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,080
Right.

673
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,320
So I need this Dom to locate them first.

674
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,160
Okay.

675
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,760
Before I write any code,

676
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,720
I need to locate the element
that I want to interact with.

677
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,600
Okay.

678
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,920
So what we're going to do in here, guys,
so we will be navigating to Facebook.

679
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,400
We're going to enter some text in here.

680
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,120
We're going to enter some password.

681
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,200
And what we're going to do,
we will clicking on a log in in here.

682
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,880
Okay.

683
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,800
Sounds like a good plan right now.

684
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,560
So but we won't be doing it manually.

685
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,920
Obviously,
we will be writing the logic for this.

686
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,200
Okay.

687
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,560
So first of all, guys, so me, in order

688
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,440
to start locating any element,

689
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,160
I need to click on this one here.

690
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,480
There's a small arrow at the very,
very left side of the DOM at the very top.

691
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,080
Okay, so just click on that, guys.

692
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:16,120
Just when you click
and when you start moving your cursor

693
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:21,520
over the elements,
you can see that your your HTML is moving

694
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,520
and your elements are getting highlighted.

695
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,040
Okay, I hope everyone did that.

696
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,520
And you can see what is going on in here.

697
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,480
Do you guys have any issues?

698
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,280
Just let me know.

699
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,520
I'll go over again.

700
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,600
Okay, good.

701
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,680
So now our first priority.

702
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,560
What am I entering first in here?

703
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,280
Guys, I want to enter my email,
my password, and click on log in.

704
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:56,920
So my first priority
is to locate the email textbox.

705
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,720
Right.

706
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,440
So what I will do, I will just go on

707
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,760
top of this email text box
and what I will do, I will click on.

708
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,600
Okay.

709
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,480
When I click on it,
take a look at the HTML now guys.

710
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,840
So it is highlighted right now, that line
that is highlighted,

711
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,800
it is all the attributes

712
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,080
that belong to that specific textbox.

713
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,800
Okay, I help everyone have this.

714
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,440
Everyone has the same output
as me in here.

715
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,040
Highlighted one line
and highlighted the text box of email.

716
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,560
Okay.

717
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,840
Is everything clear, guys?

718
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:43,000
Am I going too fast?

719
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,200
Okay, good.

720
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,840
All right,
so now what I need to do in here, guys.

721
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,120
So now please pay attention on

722
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,680
on what we're seeing right now.

723
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,920
So now we have input in here,
which is our tag name, right?

724
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,560
So we have type.

725
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,000
So now is class one of the locators
that we have gone through?

726
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,560
Guys?

727
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,480
Yes. Right.
So we have a class name in here.

728
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,240
So you see guys so now we trying to locate

729
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,560
these elements
by the locators that we have.

730
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,600
So we have class in here.

731
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,680
So we have a name, right?

732
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,800
So if we look at the locators,
we have name as well, Right?

733
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,120
So we have name in here.

734
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,320
We also have an I.D. in here.

735
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,240
Okay.

736
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,600
So if I go back first locator
that I put in here is the ID, right?

737
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,760
So we have ID, I don't think we have tap
index and that's it.

738
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:49,720
Right?

739
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,960
So so one element
that we have right now for this

740
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,360
email textbox, we have three different
locators available.

741
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,720
Okay.

742
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,200
So, so we can use any of those
three locators

743
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,920
to locate the this element and perform
any actions.

744
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,880
Okay.

745
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,120
So now let's go back to our

746
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,680
what's called the intelligent
and let me create

747
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,240
one Java class in here.

748
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,640
Okay.

749
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,320
So let's do locating

750
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,000
elements.

751
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,680
Okay?

752
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,160
The main method in here.

753
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:38,600
All right.

754
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,800
So first of all, what do we need to do,
guys, before we start

755
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,680
launching the browser
or performing any actions

756
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,280
or navigating to any website,

757
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,280
we need to set the property
right to system the set property.

758
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,640
We have web driver,

759
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,800
chrome driver, and then

760
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,040
drivers, chrome driver.

761
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,800
Right. So now we need an object

762
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,000
driver.

763
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,320
Driver is equal to new chrome driver.

764
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,640
Right.

765
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,600
Okay, so we have this chrome driver.

766
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,360
So now what we need to do,
we need to navigate to that page, right?

767
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,880
So we're not
we need to navigate to the Facebook page.

768
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,600
So I'm using this guy in here, driver

769
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,640
that get htp

770
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,800
to the dot com.

771
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,280
Right?

772
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,600
And then I'm not going to

773
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,920
I'm not going to maximize it
because it's going to move to this screen.

774
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,200
But you can go ahead and maximize
this screen.

775
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,760
It's fine. Okay, guys.

776
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,200
So I'm not going to do it because I have
to be moving around with those windows.

777
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,680
Okay. All right.

778
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,960
So now

779
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,160
before we locate any element, cars,
we need to pay attention

780
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,840
for which locators
we can use on this element.

781
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,080
Okay, So we set that.

782
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,280
There are three different elements
in here.

783
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,040
I mean, locators, right?

784
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,560
The class name and I.D.. Okay.

785
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,880
So whenever you start
locating any elements, okay,

786
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,000
you need to

787
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,800
attention
first if that element has an I.D..

788
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:35,880
Okay.

789
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,840
Because I these are always unique.

790
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,520
Okay.

791
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,720
So from the locators, whenever you start

792
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,520
locating an element,
you need to first pay attention.

793
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,120
If that if that element

794
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,560
has a locator of I.D., if it has an ID,

795
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,840
that's Dom deal,
you can go ahead and use that ID

796
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,720
and locate this element.

797
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,000
Okay.

798
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,520
Is that clear, guys,

799
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,960
IDs are always unique, but
I'm going to tell you a little bit later,

800
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,240
some cases
that they might not be unique, but

801
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,000
for now,

802
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,440
let's use the ID in here.

803
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,600
Okay.

804
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,120
Class, no, class is not going to be more
unique now, guys.

805
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,680
And we will see in the future why class?

806
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,560
Class names are not unique.

807
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,320
Okay. All right.

808
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,640
So now, guys, whenever you located
this ID locator,

809
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,840
what you need to do is
you need to capture its value.

810
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,800
Okay, so I have an I.D. in here.

811
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,160
I need to capture its value. Okay.

812
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,720
So the value of my ID is email.

813
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,200
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to copy this file.

814
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,960
Okay? So once I copied this,

815
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:09,800
I'm going to go back to my intelligent
and now I will start

816
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,320
locating that element.

817
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,520
Okay, so how am I going to do this?

818
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,720
It's simple.

819
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,040
So driver dot find element.

820
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,680
Okay to find element,
it's going to ask me,

821
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,880
are you finding an element,
but which locator do you want to use?

822
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:36,320
And then what I will do in here,
I'll put by and there is an I.D.

823
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,120
in here.

824
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,280
So if you look down guys, there is name X

825
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,800
path, link
tags, class name, CSF, selector tag, name.

826
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,800
All the locators that we talked about.

827
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,840
Okay, so in this case, I am finding that

828
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,800
element by the given ID inside the HTML.

829
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,440
Okay.

830
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,760
So I'll do my ID
and I will paste that value in here.

831
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,240
Okay. Any questions, guys?

832
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:14,080
Is this clear?

833
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,880
Yes. Selenium.

834
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,840
Yeah, it is easy
because it's straight English, right?

835
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:23,800
So it's not it's not that difficult
to understand you finding an element.

836
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,040
What locators you using or by what you're
finding, you finding it by the ID

837
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:36,040
and you just need
to input the value of that item.

838
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,520
How can you copy that element?

839
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,240
You mean the

840
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,000
this this value?

841
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:46,480
Yeah.

842
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,760
You could just type in email.

843
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,240
Yeah. Yeah. Guys,

844
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,560
you could just go ahead and type in here.

845
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:51,960
Email.

846
00:48:51,960 --> 00:49:00,040
That's fine.

847
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,400
Yeah.

848
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,000
Just double click on the value
and it's going to, it's going to select it

849
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,320
and you can just right
click and copy. Yes.

850
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,880
As long as you don't have any typos
guys in here, that is fine.

851
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,480
You can Typekit in manual.

852
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,800
Okay. All right.

853
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,320
So now what we did is
we found that element.

854
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,800
Okay? So we found that element.

855
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,360
So now I need to perform some actions.

856
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,360
Okay.

857
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,320
What what kind of actions
are we performing in here, guys?

858
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,800
What do we need to do?

859
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,920
So we found that element. Okay?

860
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,640
We found that textbox.

861
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,760
We need to enter our tax. Right?

862
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,880
In this case, we need to enter our email.

863
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,400
Right. So now, in here

864
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,960
it is
pretty straightforward what I will do.

865
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,320
I found that element.

866
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,320
Now I will need to send some keys in here.

867
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,680
So when I click on Dot, you can see that
there's a method called sent keys.

868
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,080
Okay, so I'll click on this.

869
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:17,760
So inside the parentheses I'll open
and close the double quotes in here

870
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,960
and you can give any email,
you can give it a fake email guys.

871
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,240
Donald if you want to,
if you want to use your own

872
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,880
email,
that's fine, but I'll just give it here.

873
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,520
Anything.

874
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:30,160
Right.

875
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,240
Syntax, whatever it is, dot com. Right.

876
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,520
So this is

877
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,960
how we will be entering

878
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,880
any text on the text boxes.

879
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,000
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

880
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:52,080
Any questions on this?

881
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,000
Okay, so now what
we're going to do, let's actually

882
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,000
let me actually run this.

883
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,240
Okay.

884
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,560
So what I will do, All right,
click on this and I will run it.

885
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:16,040
Okay, there we go.

886
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,600
So we navigate it to Facebook.

887
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,560
We navigate it to Facebook.

888
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:28,200
What we did Will located that element
and we entered that text

889
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,320
inside that exact textbox.

890
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,840
Okay.

891
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,080
Pretty cool, right, guys?

892
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,080
So now we learn how to actually type

893
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,680
inside any text box

894
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,520
on any web page, right?

895
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,600
So the text that I gave in here, it's

896
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,680
actually the same text
that we have in here.

897
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,480
Okay.

898
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,600
I hope you guys are having the same output
as I do.

899
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,640
If you are having any issues,
please send a screenshot

900
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,520
so that we can take a look at this.

901
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:12,720
Okay.

902
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,760
Okay. So you're getting in on it.

903
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,240
Are you getting a an error
because you did find elements.

904
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,000
Okay, so do find element.

905
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,080
It's not plural. Okay. It's singular.

906
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,880
So if you do, if you do find elements,
then you're going to get an error.

907
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:38,640
But you need to do find element.

908
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:47,120
Okay, guys.

909
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,200
Okay, guys, please pay attention in here.

910
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,040
You need to do find element.

911
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,920
We're trying to locate only one element,
guys.

912
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,560
Okay?

913
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,920
So find element and then send keys

914
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,720
was the last

915
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,920
for before I type in email sent keys.

916
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,600
This is this is.

917
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,240
This is auto generated
guys this is keys to send.

918
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,360
This is auto generated. Okay.

919
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,320
Don't really pay attention to that.

920
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,560
All right, guys, any questions?

921
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:59,680
Is everyone having the same output?

922
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,920
All right. Okay.

923
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,280
So now it's time for us to go ahead

924
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,880
and enter our password.

925
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,240
Okay.

926
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:28,880
So I need to see your whole.

927
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,760
I need to see the whole error.

928
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,080
Okay?

929
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:40,160
I need to see the top of the error.

930
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,440
In fact, there's something wrong with the

931
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,600
you missed that. Easy.

932
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,480
Okay, So you're using you using a windows.

933
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:56,880
You need to use the XY.

934
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,800
Okay.

935
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,080
Okay.

936
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,760
If you're getting the character sequences,
that's fine.

937
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,880
That's fine, guys. There's no big deal.

938
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,920
Okay, so now let's
go ahead and locate the password.

939
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,080
TextBox.

940
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,800
Okay, so what I do again,
guys, click on the arrow.

941
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,040
Okay, in here.

942
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,720
Now I need to navigate my cursor
to this textbox

943
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,600
because I need to locate this exact
password.

944
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,160
TextBox. Okay.

945
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,400
So when I do that, click on this

946
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,000
and let me see.

947
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,920
And then you will see this line getting

948
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,760
highlighted in here.

949
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,640
Okay.

950
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,480
I hope everyone is at the same page, guys.

951
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:56,160
And is anyone behind?

952
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,120
Okay, good.

953
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,160
So now what do we have in here, guys?

954
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:08,600
What kind of locators
we have for this element?

955
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:14,680
We have ID, we have name,
and we have the class, right?

956
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,880
So three of those.

957
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:21,720
So which one we want to use now, guys?

958
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,960
So whenever you see an ID,
look a go with I.D., right?

959
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,880
Because it's unique
and it is very reliable.

960
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,240
So let's go ahead and copy
the ID value in here, okay.

961
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,280
And go back in here.

962
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,960
So what I need to do,
I need to find that element right?

963
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,440
So driver, the

964
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,080
find element, what am I finding it by?

965
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,440
I am finding it by I.D., Right.

966
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,800
And then I'll pass that value.

967
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,600
So what am I doing with this password?

968
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,880
TextBox guys.

969
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,080
I located it.

970
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,760
Now, what is my next step?

971
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,280
I need to send the keys. Right.

972
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,680
So that

973
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,800
send keys.

974
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,320
And here I just.

975
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,520
I'm just going to send any password
in here.

976
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:15,720
Okay.

977
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,400
All right.

978
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,840
So let me run this

979
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:28,200
and see what's going to happen.

980
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,640
And launch this.

981
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,960
Go to Facebook. There we go.

982
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:40,320
So we entered our email
and we entered our password.

983
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,880
Right. Pretty cool.

984
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,240
Everyone should have this output.

985
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,040
So whenever you run your code,
you need to see your email

986
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,360
and your password in here.

987
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,160
Okay?

988
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,320
Really cool.

989
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:55,920
All right.

990
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,200
Nice.

991
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:04,320
Okay.

992
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:04,760
Okay.

993
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,840
So now let's click on log in.

994
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,640
Right.

995
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,160
So how do I,
how do I locate the element first?

996
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,880
Guys?

997
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,880
What do I need to do
in order to locate the element

998
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,720
first

999
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,320
click an arrow right in here,

1000
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,280
go to this log in button
and then click on this.

1001
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:38,200
Okay.

1002
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,160
So now in here, how many of

1003
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,640
how many locators do
we have for this element?

1004
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:52,000
Guys, we have class name and ID, right?

1005
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,560
So in this case,
so we use IDs two times already.

1006
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,920
So let's try to use a name. Okay.

1007
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,480
So what I will do and here I'll copy the

1008
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,400
the value for the name locator.

1009
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,160
Okay, so I'm going to copy this.

1010
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,840
I'll go back to my intelligence.

1011
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,800
What I will do is the same thing.

1012
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,200
Driver, that fun element.

1013
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,800
But this time,
what are we finding? Goodbye.

1014
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,320
We finding it by name, right?

1015
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,720
So not ID, we will be finding it by name

1016
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,840
and then I'll paste this in here.

1017
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,880
So now, in this case, guys,

1018
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,200
we don't have to send anything
because it's a button, right?

1019
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,160
We don't have to enter any text.

1020
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,360
So pretty straightforward.

1021
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,720
We need to click on it right,
in order to log in.

1022
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,160
So I'll do that

1023
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:49,920
click.

1024
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,680
Okay.

1025
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,920
Pretty easy and straightforward
if you want to send any text and keys.

1026
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,760
If you want to click, click, okay, easy.

1027
00:59:59,640 --> 00:59:59,920
Right?

1028
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,600
So let's run this and see if.

1029
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,760
This is going to work.

1030
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:16,920
Okay, there we go.

1031
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,760
So entering this, there we go.

1032
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,480
So we clicked on log in.

1033
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,080
So obviously those are not
the real credentials that I pass in there.

1034
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,640
So this one goes to the email, you enter
these and connected and all that stuff.

1035
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,120
So this is expected.

1036
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,760
So that means we entered our email,
we entered our password

1037
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,280
and we clicked on log in.

1038
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,520
Right?

1039
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,600
So if you enter the valid credential,
you have to log in.

1040
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:50,760
But if you didn't, then
you should be navigating to this page.

1041
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,440
Okay,

1042
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,480
Nice.

1043
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:59,320
Okay.

1044
01:00:59,320 --> 01:00:59,880
All right, guys.

1045
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,640
So if you are
now let me tell you one thing.

1046
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,560
If you are logging in,
what the valid credentials

1047
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,600
are, sometimes since it's

1048
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,240
an automated thing that is going on
and you can sit in here.

1049
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,480
So Chrome is being controlled
by automated test software,

1050
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,400
Facebook might think that it's a robot
or anything is hacking your account.

1051
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,400
Okay, so b b

1052
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,440
what's called beyond the look out on that.

1053
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,800
Do not log in with valid credential
a lot of times.

1054
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,600
Okay.

1055
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,400
So you might have some problems
after that or your account

1056
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,680
might get locked
or anything like this. Okay.

1057
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:43,160
So you might log in once or twice,
three times, five times,

1058
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,000
or maybe if you
log, you keep logging in that

1059
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,760
they might
think it's a robot or something,

1060
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,360
so they might lock your account.

1061
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,760
So be careful.

1062
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,480
Okay?

1063
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,480
All right.

1064
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,960
Okay, guys, any questions

1065
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,680
or key?

1066
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,600
There is no hierarchy.

1067
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,280
Okay.

1068
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,080
But as I said,
the ID is the most reliable.

1069
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,880
We will be going over to assess
and other locators,

1070
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,840
but the most reliable for now is IDs.

1071
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:40,720
Okay.

1072
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,680
All right.

1073
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:55,000
So if the element didn't

1074
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,240
if you didn't type the values correctly,
yes, your test will fail.

1075
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:06,000
Okay, So let's say we typed in here
the wrong password.

1076
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:06,600
Okay.

1077
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,320
So while we and let me run this

1078
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:20,320
and let's see what's going to happen,
okay.

1079
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,360
Running this guy.

1080
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:23,760
So there we go.

1081
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,480
So we entered that email,
but it didn't enter the password.

1082
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:27,920
Right?

1083
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,400
So let's take a look
at what we've got in here.

1084
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,600
So we got an exception, right?

1085
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,560
So it says no such element exception.

1086
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,320
That means that the given

1087
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,080
the given attribute value doesn't exist.

1088
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,320
Okay.

1089
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:50,960
So it says unable to locate an element
with the selector of this one.

1090
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:52,800
Okay.

1091
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,520
So that means there's something going on
with your locator.

1092
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,640
You need to check your locators. Okay.

1093
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,720
If you get the no such element exception,
that means

1094
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,760
you need to go back and check
all the values that you have.

1095
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,640
Enter.

1096
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,440
Okay.

1097
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:25,240
Any questions, guys?

1098
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,520
The exception is human in general.

1099
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,960
What kind of exceptions we might face?

1100
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,080
Or are you talking about this
specific exception?

1101
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:48,120
The exception that we got?

1102
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,760
Oh, how many are there?
A lot of exceptions, guys.

1103
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,200
There's a lot of exceptions.

1104
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:57,040
So in Java, guys, when you start handling
the exceptions, you will see

1105
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:01,080
you will see a lot of exceptions in here
and how to handle those.

1106
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:01,840
Okay.

1107
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,480
So I think those are going to be
the last classes of works of Java,

1108
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,160
if I'm not mistaken.

1109
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,040
Yeah, that's fine.

1110
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:15,600
If if the output is less than
mine, that's okay.

1111
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,000
All right.

1112
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:17,520
Okay, guys.

1113
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,080
So now what I want to do.

1114
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,640
So we entered something in here, right?

1115
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,040
We entered something in here.

1116
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:28,200
So now when I click on, log in,
it shouldn't log in.

1117
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:34,320
Of course.

1118
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,920
What is.

1119
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,240
Wow. Okay.

1120
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,600
Wow. This is.

1121
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,560
Is this serious?

1122
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,040
Okay, that's not with.

1123
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:49,960
We're just hacked.

1124
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:54,240
Okay, This is ridiculous.

1125
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:59,360
Okay, This one is funny.

1126
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,120
I was not expecting this, okay?

1127
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,120
I didn't know there was a user like this.

1128
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,920
Okay.

1129
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,840
Okay.

1130
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,440
There we go. So let's do this one. Okay.

1131
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,200
I hope there's no

1132
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,080
there's no user like this.

1133
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,560
Okay, now.

1134
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,680
Okay, now, now we're talking.

1135
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,080
Okay, so now when we

1136
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,800
when we go to this page right

1137
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,160
When we go to this page,
what I want to do,

1138
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,040
guys, I want to click on forgot password.

1139
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,840
Okay, so

1140
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,600
now let me click on this arrow again.

1141
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,760
Right.

1142
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,520
Go ahead and click on forgot password.

1143
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,920
So now let's take a look

1144
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,120
at the edge HTML in here.

1145
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,560
What kind of locaters

1146
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:06,720
do we have in here?

1147
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,080
So we have class name, right?

1148
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:13,200
I don't see any IDs.

1149
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,240
We have only class, right?

1150
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:22,600
So we have on the class
and we also have one more locator in here.

1151
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,760
Okay, So what is this, guys?

1152
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,080
Is does anyone know?

1153
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,760
So the log in is the button, right?

1154
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,720
So what is this forgot password for us?

1155
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,760
It's a link. Right?

1156
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:42,120
So for you to make sure it's a link,
you need to look at the HTML.

1157
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:42,960
Okay.

1158
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,240
So if you look at the HTML
and that specific element has an eight tag

1159
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:51,960
that is going to be a link, a hyperlink.

1160
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,880
Okay, So you can see the link over here.

1161
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,480
So if you click on this forgot password,
this is where it's going to take you.

1162
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,280
Okay.

1163
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:07,680
So, so this link, what we have,
we have a text.

1164
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:13,320
Okay, So now let's go back to our locators

1165
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,560
and let's see what we can use from here.

1166
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,440
Okay?

1167
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,200
Yes, it is always going to be the same
for all the links.

1168
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,280
It will have an a tag. Okay.

1169
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:32,360
And it will it should have a text.

1170
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,000
Okay.

1171
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,280
So if a link has a text in here,
what are the locators

1172
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,880
that we can use in this case?

1173
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,800
Guys, there we go.

1174
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:45,600
We can use a link text or a partial link
text.

1175
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,080
Okay.

1176
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,600
So what I will do in here,

1177
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,240
so we have this text.

1178
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,120
Everyone can see this text, right, guys?

1179
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,360
So we have a tag, we have the link,
we have the class target.

1180
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:07,800
So now what I want to do,
I want to copy this text in here

1181
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,240
and I will go back to my intelligence

1182
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,040
and I will

1183
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,200
and I will locate that element.

1184
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,280
Okay.

1185
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:27,240
So simply driver, the font element,
what am I locating it by?

1186
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:34,360
Guys?

1187
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,400
Elizabeth, I will get back
to your question right now.

1188
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,560
Okay?

1189
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:46,120
I am locating it by link text and
what I will do inside the double quotes.

1190
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,520
I will paste this

1191
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,880
text that I copy.

1192
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,440
Okay, so let's get back in here.

1193
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,320
So now how do we know it's a text?

1194
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,320
Because it's

1195
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,960
in between the opening

1196
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,920
and closing of the link.

1197
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:05,880
Okay.

1198
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:11,160
So you can see that the opening is here
and the closing is here, right?

1199
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,960
So if you see any regular text

1200
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,520
in between the opening
and the closing of the

1201
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:24,840
links, that will be your link text.

1202
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:37,080
Is that clear?

1203
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:37,840
Okay.

1204
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,200
So let me go back to the intelligence
and now what

1205
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:47,360
we simply want to do,
we can simply click on that link.

1206
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,120
Right.

1207
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,920
But I think it's going to be really fast
right now.

1208
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,960
So what I want to do before,
I click on forgot password,

1209
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,800
what I want to do,
I want to wait for about 2 seconds.

1210
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,440
Okay, So let's do threat sleep

1211
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,200
and give it 2 seconds in here.

1212
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,120
Right.

1213
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,280
And throw that exception
in the method signature.

1214
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,120
So now let's go back.

1215
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,800
Let's run this code.

1216
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:28,920
Okay.

1217
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,680
There we go.

1218
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,480
Facebook.

1219
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,360
So there we go.

1220
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:41,240
So we clicked on forgot password
and it navigated us

1221
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,000
to enter our mobile number

1222
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,000
right.

1223
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,680
You get the link within navigate.

1224
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,600
Yeah. You can do that.

1225
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,040
Yes, you can do that.

1226
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:56,480
Okay.

1227
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:57,600
All right.

1228
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:04,120
Any questions on this, guys?

1229
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:15,520
Did everyone get the same output?

1230
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,040
Yeah, it should be waiting, guys.

1231
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:39,120
It will wait for two 2 seconds.

1232
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,680
Oksana, yours is right
because you don't find elements again.

1233
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,000
Okay? So please pay attention.

1234
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,600
This part of your code.

1235
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,440
All right?

1236
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,000
Okay, guys, there's one more thing.

1237
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,120
Let me show you,
and then we'll take a break, okay.

1238
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,640
So we said
we can use the link text in here,

1239
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,600
but we can also use the partial link text.

1240
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,560
Okay.

1241
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,720
So if you want to use the partial link
text, what does it mean, guys,

1242
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:24,840
logically, you can use the part, right?

1243
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:28,400
One part of that text that you're using.

1244
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,720
Okay.

1245
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,520
So what we can do in here, Driver

1246
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,480
dot find element.

1247
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,840
So now this time what we're doing

1248
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,560
with using partial link text

1249
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,320
and what we can
do, let's just put in here forgot.

1250
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,280
Okay?

1251
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,720
And what we need to do
we need to click on that.

1252
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:54,480
Okay, So let's go ahead and run this

1253
01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:09,000
and see if this is going to work.

1254
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Okay?

1255

01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,960
So we navigate it to this page is still
asking us to enter the mobile number.

1258
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:23,440
So that means this one worked

and we know how to use partial link text.

1263
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,720
And now we know how to use
for different locators

1264
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,720
and to interact

1265
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,160

Okay.

1320
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,280

01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:33,640
what you need to do is

01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:37,000
you need to get the title and verify

1329
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,280
Okay?

1330
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:43,680
And after that, what you need to do
is, you need to log out.

1331
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:48,800
You need to click on this, log out in here
and quit the browser.

1332
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,840
Okay. Is the task cleared?

1333
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:56,480

01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,400
Yes, I'm sending the link right now.

1335
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,840
All right.

1336
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,280
Okay.

1337
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:03,840
I'm going to send it in life questions.

1338
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,040
So copy that. And

1339
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,240
we start the task.

1340
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:13,560
So seven, 8 minutes for this.

1341
01:38:13,560 --> 01:42:11,200
It should be done right.

1342
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,960
The credentials are on the Web site
this way when you just navigate

1343
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:23,400
there,
there is username and password here.

1344
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,280
If you can't see the log out, just

1345
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,680
pause,
then pause the execution before the logo.

1346
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:35,760
Okay?

1347
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:36,720
Yes, that that

1348
01:42:37,680 --> 01:42:38,520
will do that.

1349
01:42:38,520 --> 01:43:00,880
That is correct.

1350
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:15,560
Very good.

1351
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,280
I see there are some people done already.

1352
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:35,080
That's good.

1353
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:36,320
Okay, that's fine. Yeah.

1354
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:39,120
If you added a couple of pauses, then

1355
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:42,280
that's good.

1356
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:43,960
Did everyone verify the title?

1357
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:53,120
Guys?

1358
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,240
Okay, good.

1359
01:43:55,320 --> 01:44:02,760
Nice.

1360
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:05,960
Two more minutes
and then we'll do this together, guys.

1361
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:14,240
Okay.

1362
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:16,960
Now, the title is incorrect.

1363
01:44:16,960 --> 01:45:16,120
They probably misspelled it.

1364
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:19,200
Make sure you don't misspell
the the title guys

1365
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:08,760
after you log in.

1366
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:10,200
The title may change.

1367
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:14,000
Okay, so on the login page,
it's a web orders log in.

1368
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:36,240
But when you when you log in,
that's going to be a little different.

1369
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,080
All right, guys.

1370
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,520
So let's do it together.

1371
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,920
So now

1372
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:43,680
what we're going to do,
you guys are going to guide me

1373
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:46,800
so that I can finish the task.

1374
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:47,640
Okay.

1375
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:53,680
So first of all,
what do we need to do in here, guys?

1376
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:55,160
So I have a main method.

1377
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,040
We have a task in here.

1378
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:00,120
So first and foremost, all we need to do

1379
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:03,160
is we need to set the property right.

1380
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:05,640
So system,

1381
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:08,880
the set property first

1382
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:12,120
driver, chrome

1383
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:14,760
driver,

1384
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:19,320
and then what we have and here we have our

1385
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:23,400
right.

1386
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:25,160
Okay?

1387
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:29,480
And then we need the objects

1388
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,000
of the web driver

1389
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:36,280
in here.

1390
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:37,000
Okay?

1391
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,840
So now we have with life the browser.

1392
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:40,920
We set the properties.

1393
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,960
What is my next step?

1394
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,160
Guys in here

1395
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:49,520
we need to navigate, right?

1396
01:47:49,520 --> 01:47:52,880
So driver, get in here

1397
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:56,200
and let me copy

1398
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:03,240
this guy.

1399
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:05,280
Let me copy in here.

1400
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,440
Okay,
So we're navigating to this left side.

1401
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:17,880
So what is my next step, guys.

1402
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:19,920
Okay, so maximize. Yep.

1403
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:21,840
So I won't be maximizing, right?

1404
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:22,720
So we

1405
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:26,480
will just let me just put it in here
and then I'll just comment it out for you.

1406
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,480
Okay?

1407
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:33,200
So driver dot, manage my window

1408
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:37,960
and maximize right
that I want to be doing this because it's

1409
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:42,320
it will maximize it on other screen
so you won't see the other actions.

1410
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:45,200
Okay so now

1411
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:48,040
do I have to check the title right now

1412
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:53,800
guys.

1413
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,480
One do I have to check the title?

1414
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:58,560
Guys, go step by step. Right?

1415
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:02,400
So you navigate, you log in, right?

1416
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:06,200
So after you log in,
you get the title and verify.

1417
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:11,240
So now it's time for us to go ahead
and log in to that application.

1418
01:49:11,240 --> 01:49:11,760
Right.

1419
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:14,960
So before I do anything,
what do I have to do

1420
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:19,000
in here, guys?

1421
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,280
Go to the website and inspect.

1422
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,040
Right.
So I'm inspecting this guy right now.

1423
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:30,320
So I'm going to I'm
going to click on the Magic Arrow in here,

1424
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:35,240
go to my user name, write user
name, TextBox in here.

1425
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:38,880
So in here, how many of

1426
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:42,480
what's called

1427
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,600
how many locators do I have for

1428
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:49,720
username guys?

1429
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:50,120
Three.

1430
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:53,440
Okay, name ID and class.

1431
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:54,200
Right.

1432
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:58,160
So now guys, in the previous example,
when we were talking about the class name

1433
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:00,080
being Unique, right?

1434
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,600
So right now in this example,
I can show you that

1435
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:07,080
the class name will not be unique
because they are.

1436
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:13,600
There are two classes which are
which have the same exact values.

1437
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:18,120
Okay, so I have one class in here
which has t, z,

1438
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:22,280
and I have the other class
which has to Z in here.

1439
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:25,640
Okay. So if I identify,

1440
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:29,480
why can use type or style?

1441
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:31,680
Because they are not part of locators.

1442
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:36,080
Okay, so locators,
they are built in features.

1443
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:37,160
Okay.

1444
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:39,840
So that's why we won't be able
to use other

1445
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,600
other attributes right away?

1446
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,560
We will be able to use them.

1447
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,040
But it's a little bit later.

1448
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,840
Okay.

1449
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,960
Next,
next class, I'll show you how to do that.

1450
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,760
But right now, let's stick
to the locators.

1451
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:55,520
Okay.

1452
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:58,440
So as you can see in here,
I have two classes.

1453
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:02,600
They have both same exact values.

1454
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:06,120
Okay, so that means this username.

1455
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:09,920
If we use the class name,
it will not be unique.

1456
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,360
Okay, so
but I have a question for you guys.

1457
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:17,360
If I use the class name, which,

1458
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,040
which element
will my selenium interact with?

1459
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:25,080
So if I use a class name.

1460
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:27,600
So that means I have two elements on hand
right now.

1461
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:30,560
So if I, if I perform any action

1462
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:35,280
right.

1463
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:41,640
So is it going to be username
or is it going to be password?

1464
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:45,840
It's going to be the first one
our selenium means.

1465
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,520
Right? Exactly.

1466
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,880
So if we have two different
that different elements,

1467
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:54,840
but we have the same class names

1468
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:57,560
or same names or whatever it is.

1469
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,080
So that means if we use
that our selenium will pick

1470
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:04,640
the first one it needs
and it will interact with that.

1471
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:10,200
Is that clear, guys?

1472
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:14,040
Okay, so that's
why we're trying to locate the element

1473
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:17,800
as uniquely as possible so that it is only

1474
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:21,760
okay so that our selenium doesn't
get confused

1475
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:26,880
and mistakenly interact
with different elements.

1476
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:28,800
Okay. All right.

1477
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,680
So here we can go ahead and start
using ID in here.

1478
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,080
Okay.

1479
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:37,640
So the idea is a little bit long in here,
but that's fine.

1480
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:39,480
Just going to copy that.

1481
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,360
Okay, let's go back in here.

1482
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,320
So now what am I doing next?

1483
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:49,680
I copied the ID value.

1484
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,720
We need to find the element. Right.

1485
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:56,680
So driver, the find element.

1486
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:59,160
I'm finding it by ID

1487
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:02,480
and I'm just going to paste
that value in here.

1488
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:03,880
What am I doing with this?

1489
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:15,200
Look, with this element,
I am sending keys, right?

1490
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:17,720
So send keys in here.

1491
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:21,280
So We know that the username
should be tester,

1492
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:22,680
right?

1493
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:24,840
So we identify our username in here.

1494
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,240
So now let's go back in here. Right.

1495
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:30,440
So identify the password now.

1496
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:34,960
So here we have the same type

1497
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:39,360
of attributes in here,
but in this case let's use the name.

1498
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,080
Okay, So what I'm going to do,

1499
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:46,920
I will copy the name value in here

1500
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:52,200
and then I'll do driver find element by

1501
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:57,320
name face ID here and

1502
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,720
I will send my password.

1503
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:05,160
Okay.

1504
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:09,440
All right, guys,
I hope you guys use different locaters

1505
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:15,200
that we've done so far, like ID
name linked tax and partial link text.

1506
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:18,960
So that's going to be
if you did that, that's good

1507
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:21,000
because you're practicing
different locators.

1508
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,920
So that's very good. That's

1509
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:24,640
all right.

1510
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:26,880
So I entered my

1511
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:30,280
username and password,

1512
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:34,080
so now it's time for me
to click on the log in.

1513
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:35,280
Okay.

1514
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:39,600
So again, going to go ahead
and click on the Magic Arrow in here.

1515
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,720
Go to the log in
and let's see what we have in here.

1516
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:46,480
So we have an ID, we have a name

1517
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:50,160
and, we have the class name.

1518
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:54,600
Okay, So let's try to use the class
name and see if this is going to work.

1519
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:58,280
Okay, So let me copy

1520
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:01,520
this value.

1521
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:02,040
Okay? Sure.

1522
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:04,240
If you use classy work, that's good.

1523
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:05,440
All right.

1524
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:08,440
So let me go ahead and do driver

1525
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:13,000
sign element by class name.

1526
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:13,720
Right.

1527
01:55:13,720 --> 01:55:16,960
And what I'm going to do, I'm
just going to place the class name in here

1528
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,920
and what action
I would performing on the login button

1529
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,720
was simply collecting.

1530
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:28,440
Right?

1531
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,800
So there we go.

1532
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,960
Okay, so we clicked here.

1533
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:39,520
So let me.

1534
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:44,160
Yeah, this.

1535
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,080
Okay, so we're logged in, right?

1536
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:50,800
So what is my next step, guys,

1537
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:53,760
we need to get the title right.

1538
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,440
So let's go back to our code.

1539
01:55:56,720 --> 01:55:59,480
So if I get the title,
what am I getting in return?

1540
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:03,160
Guys?

1541
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:06,240
I'm getting a string value, right?

1542
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:10,480
So string title is equal to driver

1543
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,880
get title right.

1544
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:19,760
So now if we want to verify this,
I will simply have an F condition.

1545
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,080
And right.

1546
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:23,840
So if my title that I just got

1547
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:27,520
equals,

1548
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:30,520
let's see what it is, what orders right

1549
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:39,480
then what I want to see in my console is

1550
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,520
title is correct.

1551
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:49,080
If it's not correct, then

1552
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:57,400
my title is

1553
01:56:58,640 --> 01:56:59,520
wrong.

1554
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,320
Right?

1555
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,160
Okay, so we got the title.

1556
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:04,480
We're trying to verify this right.

1557
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,880
And what is my next step?

1558
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:24,520
Guys want to.

1559
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:25,000
That's fine.

1560
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,320
Yeah. So.

1561
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:29,880
Okay, so now we need to log out, right?

1562
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:32,440
So go back to our website.

1563
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:35,960
So what we need to deal with,
we need to click on the log out.

1564
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:41,920
So again, this magic arrow,
locate this log out.

1565
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,480
So what is this, guys?

1566
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:44,440
Is this a button?

1567
01:57:44,440 --> 01:57:52,320
What is this?

1568
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,800
It is a hyperlink, right?

1569
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:00,520
How do we know it's a link goes?

1570
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:03,520
It has a tag. Exactly.

1571
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:04,680
There we go.

1572
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:09,120
So what we can do in here
we can use what locator

1573
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:17,880
we can use in here.

1574
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:20,120
Test link, link text. Right.

1575
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:24,600
So we can use the link text
or the partial link text.

1576
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:27,280
So let's go with the link text because

1577
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,720
the our link text is not that

1578
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:34,240
what's called long, right.

1579
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,200
So is just one word in here.

1580
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:38,840
So what I'm going to do driver

1581
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:41,520
find element by

1582
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:47,240
link text and I will paste that

1583
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:51,320
and what I need to do
I need to click right.

1584
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:56,600
But before we log out, guys, what
I want to do, I want to wait a little bit

1585
01:58:56,600 --> 01:59:00,560
so that we can see
actually that we're logged in right?

1586
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,960
So it's going to pause our execution

1587
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:08,400
for two more seconds.

1588
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:12,400
So 2 seconds and add that exception here.

1589
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:15,960
And then at the very end, what I can do is

1590
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:20,880
to just quit my browser.

1591
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:24,400
We use idea to log out.

1592
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:25,200
Yeah, yeah.

1593
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:28,920
If you have the log out,
I'd you can use this.

1594
01:59:29,160 --> 01:59:31,560
But guys,

1595
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:33,960
let me tell you this before I forget.

1596
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,280
So the idea

1597
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:39,120
is as I set the most reliable locator

1598
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:42,400
from any other locators. Right.

1599
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:47,280
But sometimes,
sometimes the ID cannot be reliable

1600
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:49,760
when it has some numbers.

1601
01:59:51,320 --> 01:59:54,360
Sometimes it can be dynamic.

1602
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:58,160
If it has numbers, it might be dynamic.

1603
01:59:58,160 --> 02:00:03,240
And it might not be
it might not be considered as reliable.

1604
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,560
Okay.

1605
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:08,400
So in this case, we have to in here.

1606
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:14,120
So I wouldn't really use this,
but for now, it's not a big website.

1607
02:00:14,120 --> 02:00:15,120
Okay, guys.

1608
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:17,200
So it's pretty light website.

1609
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:19,440
Nothing really changes in this.

1610
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:22,080
But whenever you start working,

1611
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:25,680
you need to pay attention
to these kind of small things.

1612
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:28,200
Okay, So keep this in mind, guys.

1613
02:00:28,440 --> 02:00:32,720
IDs, if they have a numeric value in them,

1614
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:37,000
they might be dynamic
and they might change time.

1615
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:37,360
Time.

1616
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:42,400
Okay, Is that clear?

1617
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,400
How do we know if it's dynamic?

1618
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:46,440
You won't know it right away.

1619
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:49,080
Okay. That's why I'm saying it's it.

1620
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,640
It might be finding that element

1621
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:56,440
that day that you're working on,
but the next day,

1622
02:00:56,640 --> 02:01:00,440
if something gets updated on the website,
it might not work

1623
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:04,520
because the ID gets updated
and it is dynamic.

1624
02:01:05,160 --> 02:01:11,400
Okay, guys,
why do developers write them as dynamic?

1625
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:18,480
I'm not really sure, to be honest.

1626
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:20,760
Yes, I've seen that in Facebook, actually.

1627
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:21,680
Exactly.

1628
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:23,800
So I've seen that in Facebook to

1629
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:26,880
that ID numbers are changing

1630
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:34,320
By the time.

1631
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,720
Yes, you use the ID with two numbers here.

1632
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:40,440
As I said, this
website is not getting changed anything.

1633
02:01:40,720 --> 02:01:44,600
But in real time, guys like Facebook,
as I said, other different

1634
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:48,880
big companies, the IDs on some elements,

1635
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:51,880
they might change okay

1636
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:56,400
it might be that Yeah, the prevention
for hacking.

1637
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:58,760
That's one good point actually.

1638
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:02,640
Yeah.

1639
02:02:02,640 --> 02:02:03,480
All right.

1640
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:05,600
So I quit this. Right.

1641
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:07,360
So let me run this now.

1642
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:22,240
Let's run
this and see what's going to happen.

1643
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:24,240
Running this log.

1644
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:26,480
Then we're here.

1645
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:30,120
Log out and we quit the browser.

1646
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:31,480
The title is correct.

1647
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:34,000
Everything looks good, right?

1648
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,160
I hope everyone got the same output
and it wasn't

1649
02:02:38,160 --> 02:02:44,680
that difficult to complete.

1650
02:02:44,680 --> 02:02:45,120
Okay.

1651
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:48,040
Any questions before we move forward,

1652
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:55,720
guys?

1653
02:02:55,720 --> 02:02:56,760
Okay, good.

1654
02:02:57,720 --> 02:02:58,000
All right.

1655
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,320
So now let's get back to our notes, guys.

1656
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:01,720
Okay.

1657
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:06,320
So as we learn about locators,
we've used a couple of them, right?

1658
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,760
So now I have a question for you guys.

1659
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:11,520
Why do we need so many locators?

1660
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:16,560
Guys, it

1661
02:03:18,720 --> 02:03:22,720
wouldn't be better for us to just use ID
or to have it.

1662
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:28,800
You guys,

1663
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:31,880
to minimize
the possibility of wrong entering.

1664
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:35,040
Yes That's one of the cases.

1665
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,920
Okay,

1666
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:38,080
Flexibility is good.

1667
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:40,200
Okay, What else, guys?

1668
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:44,200
Because some of locators

1669
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,520
can have duplicates, right?

1670
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:50,840
As we see as we've seen right now in the

1671
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,920
in what's called

1672
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:55,800
the class name tag. Right.

1673
02:03:55,800 --> 02:04:01,240
I mean, the class name attribute in here,
we saw that it had a duplicate value.

1674
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:01,720
Right.

1675
02:04:01,720 --> 02:04:05,000
So you can see
see you can see see in here.

1676
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:06,040
Right.

1677
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:08,640
So some locators might have

1678
02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:13,320
duplicate values in the other notes.

1679
02:04:13,680 --> 02:04:15,720
Okay. So let's put it in in here.

1680
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:20,240
Some locators

1681
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:25,240
have duplicate values.

1682
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:30,120
In other notes.

1683
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:37,400
Okay, Screen with the codes right here.

1684
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,280
Okay.

1685
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:44,360
Anything else?

1686
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:47,400
Always have them all listed. Okay.

1687
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:50,040
Who provide us those attributes?

1688
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:53,160
Guys who provide us those

1689
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:57,760
locators?

1690
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,640
Developers. Right.

1691
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:05,400
So whenever you look at the HTML,
this is written by developers, right?

1692
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:08,240
So developers may not provide us

1693
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:12,000
all the locators
for all the elements, right?

1694
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:14,880
They might provide some of those, right.

1695
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,920
And we can we have eight.

1696
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:22,840
So we need to find any of those
eight inside that specific element.

1697
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:23,760
Okay.

1698
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:26,160
That's why it is more flexible for us.

1699
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:32,480
Is that clear, guys?

1700
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:35,200
So developers

1701
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:38,160
may not provide

1702
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:45,840
all the locators for all the elements.

1703
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:46,720
Okay.

1704
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:55,200
Anything else, guys?

1705
02:05:55,200 --> 02:06:06,520
Anything else that you can guess?

1706
02:06:06,520 --> 02:06:09,000
That is very good point.

1707
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,800
Some of the locators are not always

1708
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:16,880
applicable to the elements
we're searching, right?

1709
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:20,800
So let's think about the link
text and partial link text.

1710
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:26,800
Where can we use those?

1711
02:06:26,800 --> 02:06:30,360
What tag
can we use the link text and partial link

1712
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:34,000
text guys or what kind of
elements we can use them for

1713
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:46,080
those we have a traps.

1714
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:46,800
Exactly.

1715
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,880
So that means we using them
only for the links, right?

1716
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:54,880
So you can't use the link texts
or partial link

1717
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:59,040
text for the button or the text
right there or the text box.

1718
02:06:59,040 --> 02:06:59,720
Right.

1719
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:03,360
So what you can use link
text and partial link

1720
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:06,360
text is only for the links.

1721
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:07,160
Okay.

1722
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:09,640
That's a very good, very good point.

1723
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:12,400
Okay. So

1724
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:18,360
we can say some locators

1725
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,760
may not be

1726
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:24,240
applicable

1727
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:28,200
for the elements we are

1728
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:31,000
looking for.

1729
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,440
Right. So

1730
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:36,840
an example here,

1731
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:38,960
link tax and

1732
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:43,560
partial link

1733
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:50,560
text is only used for links.

1734
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:54,920
Okay.

1735
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:57,640
All right.

1736
02:07:57,640 --> 02:07:59,400
Any questions, guys?

1737
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:02,440
Any questions on
why we need so many locators

1738
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:09,120
in selenium?

1739
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:14,040
To be clear
and pretty straightforward, right?

1740
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:15,080
Okay.

1741
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:16,720
Okay.

1742
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:19,560
So what about the attack?

1743
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:24,160
So the attack we said it is for

1744
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:27,000
it is for links, right?

1745
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:31,440
So in other words, guys,
what it's called is

1746
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:35,120
an anchor tag

1747
02:08:35,120 --> 02:08:38,000
is also called an

1748
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,160
and protect.

1749
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:42,120
Okay guys.

1750
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:47,080
So a is also called an anchor tag.

1751
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:53,280
Any questions guys?

1752
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,560
Let me see

1753
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:59,880
any questions
on how to locate the elements

1754
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:04,600
how to interact words,
how to click, how to send some text

1755
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:08,960
guys, how to use the locators
that we've used so far.

1756
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:20,760
Any questions on those?

1757
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:22,240
Okay, good.

1758
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:25,800
So let me see

1759
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:39,240
one second.

1760
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:39,680
Okay.

1761
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:42,120
So let me show you one more thing.

1762
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:44,120
Okay.

1763
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:49,200
So let me create a new class in here.

1764
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:53,360
It's going to name it as Web orders.

1765
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:56,200
Okay.

1766
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:00,280
So what I am going to do in here,
I'm just going to copy and paste

1767
02:10:00,680 --> 02:10:03,920
the some of these in here.

1768
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:11,320
All copy this and pasted in here.

1769
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:12,360
Okay.

1770
02:10:12,360 --> 02:10:17,160
So let's assume that we are navigating
to the to that Web orders

1771
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:20,240
website and we're trying to send

1772
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:22,680
keys, we're trying to locate the elements,

1773
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:28,680
input the email,
I mean the username and password

1774
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:32,520
and then click on the log in button.

1775
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:33,720
Right.

1776
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:35,080
Okay.

1777
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:37,560
So now

1778
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:41,240
before, before we used to see

1779
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:45,400
whenever we get the current URL
or we get the title, what are we getting

1780
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:50,880
in return guys,
we said before that we're getting

1781
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:54,840
a string value, right?

1782
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:56,640
Okay, that's good.

1783
02:10:56,640 --> 02:11:00,440
So now if I find if I locate any web

1784
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:03,680
element on the web page,
what am I getting in return that?

1785
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:08,160
Is there anything that I can get in? Does

1786
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:16,880
not really.

1787
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:20,040
Not the code, but I am getting a web

1788
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:23,640
element object in return. Right?

1789
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:27,200
So whenever you locate the element,
what I do

1790
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:32,280
is I'm getting a web
element object in return.

1791
02:11:32,680 --> 02:11:33,240
Okay.

1792
02:11:33,240 --> 02:11:36,720
So I have that web
element on hand right now.

1793
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:39,280
So what we can do in here, as we did

1794
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,400
with a string
assigning to the title, right?

1795
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:47,360
Whenever we got the title,
What I Can Do Online 14 is

1796
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:53,480
I can do a web element.

1797
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:55,920
Username

1798
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:58,440
is equal to this, and

1799
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:02,280
I will need to import the web
element class in here.

1800
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:06,720
Okay, so I import this,
but I am having an error.

1801
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:08,000
Okay.

1802
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,160
Why Do I have an error?

1803
02:12:09,160 --> 02:12:27,360
Any any guesses on this?

1804
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:27,840
No, really.

1805
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:30,200
We don't need to add any new so.

1806
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:30,480
Okay.

1807
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:32,640
I initialize it. Right.

1808
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:36,360
Blake, what do you mean by send keys?

1809
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:46,040
That that's a
that's a right path in there.

1810
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:48,800
I'm performing an action right away,

1811
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:52,000
but I need to be performing an action

1812
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:56,240
by using this reference
that I just created.

1813
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:59,440
Okay, so this

1814
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:05,440
whenever you want to get a web
element in return, what are we doing?

1815
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:09,120
We're just locating that element, right?

1816
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:11,160
So what I need to do.

1817
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:13,440
I need to remove this part.

1818
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:15,880
Okay.

1819
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:17,200
And that's going to be it.

1820
02:13:17,200 --> 02:13:21,240
So in order for me to get the web

1821
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:25,560
element object, I need to just located.

1822
02:13:25,560 --> 02:13:26,320
Okay.

1823
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:30,160
And then whenever I located it,
I signed it right to this

1824
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:32,600
variable in here.

1825
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:36,080
And what whenever
I want to perform an action,

1826
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:39,920
I need to use this reference from here.

1827
02:13:40,240 --> 02:13:40,880
Okay.

1828
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:43,520
So what I will do, I'll do a username

1829
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:48,080
and then I will
have the send keys in here.

1830
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:51,200
Okay.

1831
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:51,960
Is that clear?

1832
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:55,440
Guys, this is this is pretty cool, right?

1833
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:56,680
This is

1834
02:13:57,440 --> 02:14:01,240
as you guys did
and in Java that is signing

1835
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:04,040
some variable strings, integers
and everything.

1836
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:08,440
So this will give you more readability.

1837
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,640
Okay Now it is stored in a variable.

1838
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:14,200
Exactly.

1839
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:15,160
Exactly.

1840
02:14:15,160 --> 02:14:19,280
It is stored in a username
for the rest of the Java class.

1841
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:21,440
But why do we need to do this, guys?

1842
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:26,800
Why do we need to do this?

1843
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:30,000
Instead of two lines of code,
I can have one.

1844
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:32,480
Exactly.

1845
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:34,520
We can reuse it right?

1846
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:38,640
Can we can call it again
later on if we need to.

1847
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:39,600
Right.

1848
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:43,880
So now,
since we started in the in a variable,

1849
02:14:44,040 --> 02:14:48,560
we can use this variable
in anywhere in this class afterwards.

1850
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:51,200
Right. There we go. Nice.

1851
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:55,000
Okay, so here what we can do again.

1852
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:58,440
I have a

1853
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,360
web element.

1854
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:02,840
Password is equal to this.

1855
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:05,640
So since we performing action,
we don't need this.

1856
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:08,320
So I'm just going to remove this. Okay.

1857
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:13,080
And what I will do the password and

1858
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:16,720
I will place this back in here

1859
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:20,200
and same way in clicking as well.

1860
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:25,880
So I have a web element of log in button

1861
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:28,880
is equal to this.

1862
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:32,440
And since we're performing in action,
we're getting some errors

1863
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:37,560
in here.

1864
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:40,840
And then this is how our code

1865
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:45,480
is going to be looking after this class.

1866
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:46,040
Okay.

1867
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:50,120
So now we'll learn how to actually assign,

1868
02:15:51,120 --> 02:15:53,920
how to create web element variables
and assign them

1869
02:15:54,120 --> 02:16:02,720
whenever we locate any elements,

1870
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:12,000
Any questions, guys?

1871
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,080
Yes, of course.

1872
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:13,320
Yeah.

1873
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:17,000
Without knowing,
it might look a little confusing, but

1874
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:22,080
it is very simple, right?

1875
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:24,600
We're doing in here
a storing in a variable

1876
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:26,160
and then doing an action, correct?

1877
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:29,160
Yes, we storing it in a variable
and afterwards

1878
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:32,480
we are performing
an action on that particular

1879
02:16:33,600 --> 02:16:35,160
on what's called

1880
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:39,200
particular element.

1881
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,960
Yep. Once you know
all the key words is pretty simple.

1882
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:46,000
But we will be,
we will be simplifying these again

1883
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,280
and it will be more readable
in the future classes

1884
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:52,240
when you start
going through the frameworks.

1885
02:16:52,760 --> 02:16:59,400
Okay,
So when you start building the framework,

1886
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:03,920
you will see how
how the code is very readable,

1887
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:07,920
how you organize everything
differently in different packages.

1888
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:11,520
So that's going to be very cool as well

1889
02:17:20,360 --> 02:17:20,920
in class.

1890
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:21,920
Absolutely right.

1891
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:23,960
Yes, we will be creating parent classes.

1892
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:28,040
We will use a lot of inheritance guides
whenever we go through framework.

1893
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:33,120
Okay.

1894
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:36,320
We won't be actually running them
in the main method.

1895
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:36,640
Okay.

1896
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:40,640
So there will be some different
execution points when we start creating

1897
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:43,600
when we start creating frameworks.

1898
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:44,320
Okay.

1899
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:46,760
I'm really surprised
you guys are enjoying this.

1900
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:49,920
I've seen in couple different batches
that they're asking

1901
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:52,880
why we need this
and they didn't like it at all. So.

1902
02:17:53,240 --> 02:17:54,640
So that's that's very good.

1903
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:58,320
The format we will be using.

1904
02:17:58,320 --> 02:18:02,920
Yes not really, not,
not in the real lives, but in selenium.

1905
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:05,560
Yes. In real life
you will have a framework.

1906
02:18:05,760 --> 02:18:06,360
Okay.

1907
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:08,840
Which is a combination of different tools.

1908
02:18:08,840 --> 02:18:09,400
Okay.

1909
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:11,640
So there will be
a little different approach in there.

1910
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:14,920
But in order to build that approach,

1911
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:32,120
you need to know this first.

1912
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:36,080
Oh yeah, there's there's going to be a lot
of polymorphism, guys, so don't worry,

1913
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,960
there will be a lot of inheritance
polymorphism.

1914
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:44,640
There will be a lot of abstraction
probably, I'm not sure,

1915
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,680
but we'll see

1916
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:50,040
the easy part.

1917
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:58,040
Yeah, guys,
all of the concepts are easy now.

1918
02:18:58,040 --> 02:19:02,400
Oh P concepts are really fun and easy.

1919
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:05,840
Okay, so

1920
02:19:06,680 --> 02:19:14,400
let me see. So

1921
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:35,640
all there should be one diagram.

1922
02:19:35,960 --> 02:19:38,000
Okay, There we go. Okay,

1923
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:40,000
sure.

1924
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,200
I'll. I'll explain it. Okay.
One second, guys.

1925
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:43,560
So let me explain this

1926
02:19:43,560 --> 02:19:47,320
architecture for you, because yesterday
I didn't have access to these files.

1927
02:19:47,320 --> 02:19:48,040
Okay?

1928
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:52,440
So yesterday I wanted to explain to you
this architecture.

1929
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:58,080
So as you can see, guys in here,

1930
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:01,400
we have a web driver interface
that we mentioned before.

1931
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:05,400
There's a protected class in between,
which is a remote web driver.

1932
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:10,440
And then these are this interface

1933
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:15,440
and these classes are inheriting
from this web driver.

1934
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:16,280
Okay.

1935
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:18,840
So we have a Firefox driver,
we have a Chrome driver

1936
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,600
and we have an Internet Explorer driver,
or there should be

1937
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:28,120
if you're using a mac, you can do safari
and all those classes as well.

1938
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:28,920
Okay.

1939
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:34,000
So this is the simple architecture
of what is going on behind this guy.

1940
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:35,560
Okay.

1941
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:37,680
Can just do web driver.

1942
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:40,320
Driver is equal to new web driver. Nice

1943
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:44,680
So that to keep it generic.

1944
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:49,520
Not to mention either
we using Chrome driver or Firefox driver.

1945
02:20:50,280 --> 02:20:54,160
Can we do that?

1946
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:56,400
Some people say yes. Some people say no.

1947
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:58,520
Why no, guys?

1948
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:00,520
Because it's an interface.

1949
02:21:00,520 --> 02:21:02,160
Absolutely right?

1950
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:05,120
If you have an interface,
if you have an interface,

1951
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:09,880
you can't create an object
of the interface directly, right?

1952
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:12,720
So you have to created in directly

1953
02:21:13,200 --> 02:21:15,640
to the with the

1954
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:18,680
inheriting and implementing classes.

1955
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:22,280
Okay, It's good.

1956
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:22,920
All right.

1957
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:28,280
So let me see.

1958
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:30,840
I wanted to show you one more thing.

1959
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:39,680
I forgot what it was.

1960
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:41,400
Okay, let me double check, guys.

1961
02:21:41,400 --> 02:22:05,880
One second.

1962
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:10,000
And let me also put in here about

1963
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:13,920
if two or more

1964
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:20,760
elements. Same

1965
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:25,480
attributes and

1966
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:30,440
actually values.

1967
02:22:30,440 --> 02:22:34,680
Then selenium

1968
02:22:38,760 --> 02:22:41,560
will only interact

1969
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:44,360
with the

1970
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:50,000
or element

1971
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:51,600
locates.

1972
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:54,480
Okay.

1973
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:54,760
All right.

1974
02:22:54,760 --> 02:22:56,680
This should be clear, right?

1975
02:22:56,680 --> 02:22:58,320
Does anyone know, guys?

1976
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:01,920
Does anyone look into the history
of selenium?

1977
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:04,000
Why it is named as selenium.

1978
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,600
Guys?

1979
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:10,200
Why this tool is named as Selenium.

1980
02:23:10,360 --> 02:23:12,000
Does anybody know

1981
02:23:22,840 --> 02:23:24,240
it's a joke?

1982
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:32,560
Well, it is kind of a joke, right?

1983
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:34,160
It's a chemical element, right?

1984
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:38,560
So before before selenium guys,
there was a tool

1985
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:41,840
which is called mercury.

1986
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:45,600
Okay,
So there was one guy who invented mercury.

1987
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:47,680
This is a testing tool and all that stuff.

1988
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:51,880
Okay, So
but I don't think it exists anymore

1989
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:54,240
or I don't even know
what happened to that.

1990
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:58,120
So the

1991
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:02,040
the founder of Selenium

1992
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:06,840
he wanted to destroy that other company.

1993
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:10,840
So the only chemical element

1994
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:14,000
that can destroy mercury is selenium.

1995
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:16,440
So that's

1996
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:19,520
why that's
why the guy who invented selenium,

1997
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:22,440
he named it as selenium
so that it can destroy mercury.

1998
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:26,280
Okay. So

1999
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:28,720
that that's a fun fact actually.

2000
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:34,040
So and I think Mercury was
was not for free.

2001
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:37,200
So that's why he,
the guy who invented selenium,

2002
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:41,320
he made it free so that he can
completely destroy that mercury thing.

2003
02:24:41,800 --> 02:24:45,600
Okay.

2004
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:46,960
Oh, you didn't like chemistry.

2005
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:50,200
Okay.

2006
02:24:50,200 --> 02:24:53,960
Yeah.

2007
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:56,080
Yeah, that's pretty funny.

2008
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:58,680
All right, So,

2009
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:08,680
okay, guys, from today, any questions?

2010
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:23,560
Let me see.

2011
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:26,680
Naming the organization later
before the competitor.

2012
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:28,560
Yeah, that.

2013
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:29,640
That that works.

2014
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:32,520
Yeah.

2015
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:35,160
What a node is when it's PAC.

2016
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:36,200
Oh, okay. Yeah.

2017
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:36,840
And Node.

2018
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:40,040
Okay, let me go here.

2019
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:46,400
Okay,
so A node is going to be, as we said,

2020
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:51,320
an object
is any line on the on the h html.

2021
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:54,680
The node is
is the same as the object. Okay.

2022
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:58,920
So as you can see in here, so head

2023
02:25:59,360 --> 02:26:02,160
and body are in the same node.

2024
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:06,960
Okay, so h html is the very top node.

2025
02:26:07,880 --> 02:26:10,480
Okay.

2026
02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:17,840
Do you guys have issues with with audio?

2027
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:18,960
Okay. Okay, good.

2028
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:21,040
All right.

2029
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:22,920
Okay, guys.

2030
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:25,440
So as you can in here,

2031
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:28,400
HTML is a very top node, Okay?

2032
02:26:28,520 --> 02:26:34,680
And you can see head
and body are at the same level vertically.

2033
02:26:34,680 --> 02:26:35,320
Okay.

2034
02:26:35,320 --> 02:26:38,280
So that means they are on the same node.

2035
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:39,480
Okay.

2036
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:41,960
So this is one no, this is another node.

2037
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:45,560
And if I expand the head in here,
you can see

2038
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:48,240
different different nodes in here.

2039
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:51,520
As we said, it's an object right before.

2040
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:54,160
Node is the same thing as an object.

2041
02:26:54,160 --> 02:26:55,000
Okay.

2042
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:01,360
Is that clear, guys?

2043
02:27:01,360 --> 02:27:04,480
Or any confusion is in there

2044
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:09,480
each line?

2045
02:27:09,480 --> 02:27:10,400
Yeah, we can say that.

2046
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:18,120
We can say that each line
can be considered as a node, as yes,

2047
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:22,040
the top one is h html.

2048
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:29,520
Top node is the edge HTML.

2049
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:32,560
Okay.

2050
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:34,200
And oh, the guys

2051
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:42,960
and oh, okay.

2052
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:43,480
All right.

2053
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:46,200
So now

2054
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:48,640
the fun part is the homework.

2055
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:52,800
Okay.

2056
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:53,720
All right.

2057
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:55,920
Let me

2058
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:58,840
copy this.

2059
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:01,160
So I have a pretty big homework for you

2060
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:09,240
Okay, So let me copy this.

2061
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:10,600
All right.

2062
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:12,960
So here's the thing.

2063
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:16,760
So the first homework that you need

2066
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:29,400
Okay?

2067

Okay.

2068

All right.

2069
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:34,080
So this is the website that you need to
you're going to be working on

2070
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:36,000
for your homework. Okay.

2071
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,520
So when you navigate here
you can see there is a there's a forum.

2072
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:42,200
There are a couple of what's called

So fill out the whole form in here. It

2076
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:54,640
it doesn't really matter if you fill it up

2077
02:28:54,640 --> 02:28:59,640
with real information or fake information,
because this is a fake website.

2078
02:28:59,640 --> 02:29:01,960
It's not going to get captured anything.

2079
02:29:01,960 --> 02:29:02,880
Okay.

2080
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:05,200
So fill out this form.

Is that clear, guys?

2083
02:29:13,880 --> 02:29:15,280
Okay, sounds good.

2084
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:19,320
So the second homework

02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:22,680
or is this guy okay,

2086
02:29:23,720 --> 02:29:27,160
let's do it again.

2087
02:29:27,160 --> 02:29:29,280
Okay, so we're here.

2088
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:32,400
What you need to do

02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:36,240
click on the Create new account.

2090
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:37,080
Okay?

2091
02:29:37,080 --> 02:29:38,360
They don't create new account.

2092
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:40,320
You will see this guy in here.

2093
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:43,280
Okay, Fill out the first name, last name,

Okay.

2096
02:29:47,880 --> 02:29:52,520
Do not go into details
with birthday or gender because we didn't

2097
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:56,280
what's called we didn't cover these yet.

2098
02:29:56,280 --> 02:29:59,040
Okay, Just fill out the text boxes.

So it's going to tell you what's missing
and what you need to do.

2103
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:11,000
Close this.

Okay, Close this pop up
and then close the browser.

2105
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:20,000
Why did I write Facebook at work?

2106
02:30:20,040 --> 02:30:26,040
This is the shortcut for Facebook, right?

2107
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:28,480
With the pop up we're switching from.
No, guys.

2108

Not yet.

2109
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:31,240
Not yet.

2110
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:39,960
No switching frames, Nothing. Yes.

2111
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:42,000

02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:25,120
closing the pop up.

2121
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:25,760
Okay.

2122
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:30,760
All right, guys. So

02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:38,320
an intense okay.

2126
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:40,960
Because we will be going through

2127
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:44,960
through the Express and SAS

2128
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:48,920
and we will be going through the advanced
X path as well.

2129
02:31:49,320 --> 02:31:51,880
Okay. The homework.

2130
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:58,440
Do you want me to post it in the course
announcements.

2131
02:31:58,440 --> 02:31:59,440
Sure. Yeah.

2132
02:31:59,440 --> 02:32:01,000
I'll post this

2133
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:03,800

2134
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:04,440
I'm not sure.

2135
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:06,320
I mean, next class guys.

2136
02:32:06,320 --> 02:32:08,600
Sorry. Not tomorrow. Okay. Next class.

2137
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:11,400
Next class is going to be next.

2138
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:12,960
Next week, right?

2139
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:17,920
So next class,
we will have a little bit intense class

2140
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:21,400
because we will have x CSF selectors

2141
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:24,360
and we will have an advanced X plus

2142
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:28,200
class. Yep.

2143
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:31,400
I said, Guys, I said before
that you will have some challenges.

2144
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:33,160
So this is one of them tomorrow,

2145
02:32:34,200 --> 02:32:34,760
not tomorrow.

2146
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:38,920
Next class.

2147
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:41,120
Just watch how to build the X path

2148
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:45,960
for videos.

2149
02:32:45,960 --> 02:32:48,600
Next classes slide.

2150
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,280
Sure I will.

2151
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:53,720
I will share the next class of slides
in canvas.

2152
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:57,800
Okay.

2153
02:32:57,800 --> 02:33:01,920
So in Selenium review,
I'm not sure if it's tomorrow, guys.

2154
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:05,000
I'm not sure what kind of review
you're having tomorrow,

2155
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,720
but we will have our next class next week,

2156
02:33:08,280 --> 02:33:19,640
not tomorrow.

2157
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:23,040
All right.

2158
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:24,360
I will also.

2159
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:24,920
Yeah, sure.

2160
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:27,560
I will also post

2161
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:31,040
next class of subject and course
announcements as well.

2162
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:37,120
Yeah, that's fine.

2163
02:33:37,120 --> 02:33:42,360
Actually, you don't really need
the YouTube videos, but you just need to

2164
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:45,600
to look at the slides
because I will post them before the class.

2165
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,000
So take a look at the slides in canvas.

2166
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:48,960
Okay guys.

2167
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:51,040
So they have a lot of explanation in their

2168
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:00,280
I'm not

2169
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:03,440
sure if you guys having classes on Monday
or any other days

2170
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:06,480
because I don't really know the others
schedule.

2171
02:34:07,480 --> 02:34:10,560
Okay.

2172
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:21,720
All right, guys, any any questions?

2173
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:24,760
If there's no questions,
I'm giving you back 20 minutes.

2174
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:30,520
But we'll probably have an intense

2175
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:36,800
class next next week.

2176
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:39,840
All right, guys, If there's no questions,
we can wrap it up.

2177
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:42,120
Okay. I'll see you next month.

2178
02:34:42,120 --> 02:34:42,840
Next week?

2179
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:45,000
Next Tuesday. Okay.

2180
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,400
So I'll upload everything.

2181
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:48,280
I'll push the code.

2182
02:34:48,280 --> 02:34:54,240
So take a look at it and we're going
to have more fun, I hope, Next as well.

2183
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:58,440
Okay.

2184
02:34:58,440 --> 02:34:59,320
Thanks, everybody.

2185
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:02,520
