1
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,200
And then we won.

2
00:00:44,320 --> 00:01:04,480
How are you guys doing?

3
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,840
Elina So you were not okay with this?

4
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm good.

5
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:31,320
I'm good.

6
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,200
All of us know that today

7
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,840
we have a class
because only 15 students are there yet.

8
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Or maybe, like they were planning on

9
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,320
attending the sessions after the class

10
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,840
association.

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,000
What kind of facility?

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,440
al-Asiri.

13
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,680
Okay, so you also have

14
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,960
these kind of associations abroad.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,520
Okay.

16
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,480
Might be like having

17
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,560
another kind of family, you know,

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,800
from the same country.

19
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,360
And so today's session

20
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,560
is not going to be long.

21
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
We'll be covering some more concepts
regarding this.

22
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,240
And then most probably

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,320
we will be done in about,

24
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,760
I believe, 1.5 to 2 hours.

25
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,320
After that, on Tuesday, we are going to be
having different classes.

26
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,840
Usually what we did
in the previous batches, we combined

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,760
doctor with eight of us.

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,920
But from this batch

29
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,960
you have decided to make doctor individual
and spend some more time on it.

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,360
So this is going to be a session for like

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,240
maximum 2 hours.

32
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,960
And on Tuesday
we will be again teaching doctors.

33
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,440
So I believe that the concepts

34
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,720
that we discussed in
the last US are clear to all of you.

35
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,280
And today we can easily proceed
with the next things that we have.

36
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,480
So let's open up our

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,760
interviews

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,320
and let's do one thing less
than we connected to the instance of EC2

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,680
that we created
using natively as consoles.

40
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,560
So today let's learn how we can do it
using the terminal

41
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,360
or the putty for

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,320
Windows user.

43
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,600
Let's dive in our search bar.

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:16,040
Easy to.

45
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,600
Okay, let's go to launch instances

46
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,120
and over here

47
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,880
let's launch

48
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,520
this first instance Amazon Linux 2 a.m..

49
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,120
And no,
instead of that let's launch an instance

50
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,440
which has already
some softwares installed.

51
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,640
So one of the instance
that I think we can use in that terms

52
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,600
is the one that already
has Docker installed on it.

53
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,200
Okay.

54
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,320
So in
order to search for such an instance,

55
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,920
what we are going to do
is go to the search bar

56
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,880
and we will write down or there
Docker, compose

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,600
and hit enter.

58
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,840
Hi Mario.

59
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,840
Okay, so

60
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:35,520
are you guys following?

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,240
Okay, that's great.

62
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,040
So Docker compose, we search for it.

63
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,880
Okay, that that's fine.

64
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,080
So now we see that
we do not have any of the instance

65
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
which has Docker installed,

66
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,040
but it's only in the my arm

67
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,920
if we go to the market place

68
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,040
or the community and I

69
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,800
will be able to see a lot of instances.

70
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,840
So you can also use them
from the community.

71
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,240
Okay, so what is an Amazon machine image?

72
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,760
I believe that we discussed this last time
right?

73
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:31,040
You guys remember it.

74
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
And what is the

75
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,720
what is an Amazon machine image

76
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,120
with the Amazon machine image

77
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,440
file that contains

78
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,080
all the necessary information and software

79
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,480
that you need to have install
on the instance

80
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,760
or the machine
that you are trying to deploy.

81
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,040
So as we are trying to deploy
a new computer on Amazon Cloud,

82
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,880
so what we have is different
machine images available to us

83
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,400
in which we have different
kind of software pre-installed.

84
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,480
So right now
I'm looking for a machine image

85
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,360
which has Docker compose,
so I search for it.

86
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Now I can look upon
any image that has Doppler.

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,720
So this one,
if I look upon this, it has Docker,

88
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,920
Docker compose configured to deploy.

89
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,640
Okay.

90
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
So I can also use this one.

91
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,280
I believe Amazon Linux agent, Docker

92
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,040
compose, it's also there.

93
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,240
So let's go ahead with the

94
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,760
with the first one.

95
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,320
Let's go ahead and choose the first one.

96
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,360
So at this point, we select
the kind of deal that will be using

97
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,120
so to migrate it
because this one is a free one.

98
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,960
Next number of instances is one network.

99
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,080
By default, you select the VPC

100
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,680
and we will select
any of the default subnet.

101
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,480
Any other thing
we do not want to set that.

102
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:43,640
Should I move to the next page?

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,560
Okay.

104
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,200
So next step is to add storage by default.

105
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,280
It's eight. I'm good with that.

106
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,000
So next this version we skip.

107
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,240
Okay, Security group
is there now for this,

108
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,360
we will have a discussion in today's
lecture that what's a security group

109
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,400
but for now let it be by default,
whatever it is.

110
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,200
So GCP to do custom and all plots

111
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:26,280
review and launch.

112
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,480
Okay now again, the time where we need to

113
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,920
have a key.

114
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,200
So I'll say

115
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,120
this time create a new keeper,
not limit eight of us.

116
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,120
One, two, three.

117
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,200
After creating a new keeper,
I need to download it

118
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,440
so that I have it on my system.

119
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,320
And then I can simply say launch instance.

120
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,000
So my instance is in.

121
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,000
Instead of launching right now it's

122
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,560
loading up.

123
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:19,040
Have you guys launched it?

124
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Okay, great.

125
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:34,320
Now what I want you to do,
how many of you are on windows?

126
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,040
Okay, The people who are on Windows,

127
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,600
what you need to do is go to Google.

128
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,800
And this is only for people
who are on Windows.

129
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,440
Okay?

130
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,560
Typing would be and

131
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,880
download this software from this link.

132
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,040
Let me send you the link to

133
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,680
you. Just

134
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
need to download this software
and install it quickly.

135
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,160
For the MAC users.

136
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,720
You do not need to for.

137
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay Mac already has one installed

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in it.

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,600
Install the software and let me know
so that I'll be able

140
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:39,400
proceed together.

141
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:39,920
Okay.

142
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,760
So how awesome or what
system are you want?

143
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:58,920
Is it MSA that you have?

144
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,960
Well, because I've been a Windows user so

145
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
I just love Windows more than Mac,

146
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,920
especially with you
as I just don't like Matt.

147
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,920
It really gets complicated
when I need to support

148
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,040
someone with having a mac configuration
issue.

149
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,520
Other issues are fine, but
when it comes to configuration, it's hard.

150
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,120
Okay, so MSA Windows installer

151
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,320
go ahead with

152
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,240
I believe 64 bit.

153
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,240
First one, it should work for you. Just

154
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
go ahead and install

155
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:53,760
the first one.

156
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,160
Okay.

157
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,080
So people who are on Mac,
let me guide you now.

158
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,320
What do you guys need to do
is click on your instance that you launch

159
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:13,520
and do you see this
connect button appearing?

160
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,360
Any version

161
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,600
that doesn't matter.

162
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,480
Okay, so Mac users,
I'm talking to you guys.

163
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,040
You need to connect on this.

164
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,920
Click on this button.

165
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,000
And then what you'll see is some window

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,680
like this.

167
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,520
Okay, after that,

168
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,760
you need to click on the search client
Mac users, click on the search line.

169
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,960
Let me know once
you have once you see this particular

170
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,400
set of instructions in front of you,

171
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,320
do you see this?

172
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Okay.

173
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,600
Now, again, it's for only Mac users.

174
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,760
No one else.

175
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,360
Now what you need to
do is follow these commands,

176
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,880
open an SS.

177
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,520
Excellent.

178
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,040
It means that opening up your terminal.

179
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,520
Okay, open.

180
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,160
And such client means open up
the terminal.

181
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,640
Locate your private key, file.

182
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,680
Okay, So now

183
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,520
I believe that you can navigate
to the location

184
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,480
where you downloaded
the file that key file.

185
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,840
And you can, like, look at it, right?

186
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:42,160
Just like we learned and get CD
and navigate to the directories we do.

187
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,760
You have the keys.

188
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,040
And after that, once you are in
to that location, run this command C.

189
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,440
S mode 400 and your key name.

190
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,480
After that, connect to your instance
using public DNS.

191
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,760
Like you can use this particular command,

192
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,920
whatever is appearing on your screen.

193
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,960
Okay, so

194
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,240
the example is

195
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,640
over here mentioned

196
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,280
run these commands,

197
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,800
see how it works for you.

198
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,080
It should be able to connect you to your

199
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,880
instance on the NWS.

200
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,120
Okay.

201
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:35,000
Our instructions here for Mac users,
you just need to follow them.

202
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,240
You follow them.

203
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,360
Let me know if you are able to connect
or not.

204
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,440
If not, then

205
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,200
I'll just share a video with you because
unfortunately I do not have a terminal,

206
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,840
so I cannot run this with you guys
and Windows users.

207
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,120
Do you have your buddy installed?

208
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,760
Okay, perfect.

209
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,560
So now first, let's understand that

210
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,760
why are we doing this
and what are we doing, actually?

211
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,760
So sometimes the scenario may be
that instead of using an address

212
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,800
console,
you need to connect to the instance

213
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,880
directly to our computer.

214
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,640
And we do not have a log in.

215
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,440
Or maybe we are not comfortable with using

216
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,800
that console, just one.

217
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,400
So for that purpose, what we can do

218
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,480
when we launch the instance,

219
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:44,040
it's inside a building right?

220
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,640
Okay.

221
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,360
So let me draw that instance like this

222
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,800
and this building is our data center.

223
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,320
So my instance has some

224
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,880
IP address, right?

225
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:08,000
It has some IP address assigned to it.

226
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Okay. After that,

227
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,240
when we were launching the instance,
do you guys remember that

228
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,040
there was something like security
that we configured?

229
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,200
In fact, we said that we will learn them
later on, but we had

230
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,520
we saw something
like security group over there.

231
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,560
We saw that the protocol was

232
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,760
what was the protocol mentioned

233
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,160
in that security group?

234
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,640
It was SSX.

235
00:17:45,640 --> 00:18:03,560
Let me show you.

236
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,160
Okay.

237
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,800
Okay.

238
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,480
So protocol is SSL,

239
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:20,640
right?

240
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,920
And the port is 22

241
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,920
and the IP

242
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,320
address is 0.0.0.2.

243
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,400
Okay, So what are we actually
configuring over here?

244
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,640
We are considering that

245
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,360
if you want to access
this particular instance

246
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,520
on the network,

247
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,280
you can access it using the protocol set

248
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,920
and this SS protocol is basically based

249
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,040
upon DHCP.

250
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,720
So what other communication protocols
have you learned in the course?

251
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm not learned right.

252
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,800
I'll just say that
you have an introduction

253
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,200
to that.

254
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,480
Exactly. Very good.

255
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,800
You did a
you have learned a HTP and itbs so essence

256
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,640
which is also one of these communication
protocol that allows you

257
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,200
to communicate over the Internet.

258
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
There are other protocols.

259
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,840
Also there are SMP and

260
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,360
what we call that

261
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,680
script.

262
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,240
My brain was very popular.

263
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,840
Well, I'll just skip it for now.

264
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,400
I forgot the name.

265
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,600
It says it's GC or TB or HTTPS or TB.

266
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,200
The port is 22
and we are saying that it can be accessed

267
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,840
using any computer, any IP address.

268
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,320
Okay. Now the only problem is that

269
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,360
in Windows we do not have an SS line,

270
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,680
so what is and such a line

271
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
and such a such is basically putty

272
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,560
which allows you to connect

273
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,600
to this particular instance over

274
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,040
the define SS protocol
to install the putty.

275
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,440
And this putty has the capability
of establishing such connection.

276
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,360
So what are we going to do right now?

277
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,720
We are going to mention the IP address

278
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,680
of the instance,

279
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,160
we are going to mention
the port of the instance,

280
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,160
and then we are going

281
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,880
to define the protocol to be set

282
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,960
and we are going to see connect
to this particular instance.

283
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,720
Is it clear

284
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,320
any questions that you may have?

285
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,120
Okay, great.

286
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,480
So what I want you to do

287
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,840
is open up what the general in your

288
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,880
search bar right down to the region
and press.

289
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:43,760
Enter.

290
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,440
This is only for Windows users. Mac users.

291
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,080
I gave you the commands. Try them out.

292
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:59,680
Are you able to connect?

293
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,120
Okay.

294
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,440
Do you have all
do you have this particular item

295
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,600
opened up in front of you?

296
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,080
Okay, now click on load

297
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
and find the key

298
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,200
in your downloads
or wherever you downloaded it.

299
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,720
Find that key.

300
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:36,840
Let me see your I downloaded it.

301
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,120
Okay.

302
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,440
So make sure that you select all files.

303
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,360
They share the video.

304
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,360
Okay,
I'll share that with you with you guys.

305
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,880
Connect to E to instance,

306
00:22:51,720 --> 00:23:19,760
using Mac.

307
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:28,680
I know how much you guys
need to find your own key.

308
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,600
I named it. It s one, two, three.

309
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,680
So if you have named this one, two, three,
that would work.

310
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,800
If you have named it differently,
you will have to find your criticality.

311
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,880
So my key. Let's see.

312
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,360
Where is my key? It's

313
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,600
8.122. VM.

314
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,520
Where did that go?

315
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,560
Here it is.

316
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,120
So I'll just open up this file

317
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,880
and once it's there

318
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,520
after that I'll click Save

319
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:18,920
Public Key.

320
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,960
Eight of us want to B

321
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:41,440
and C, Okay,

322
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,320
So are you guys with me up to this step?

323
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,960
Anyone who is left behind

324
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,280
know your guitar.

325
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,360
Do not overwrite it.

326
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Save it in a different location
or with a different name.

327
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,560
Okay, so what else Now

328
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,040
click on Save Private Key

329
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
and again

330
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,440
I'm going to save the private key on deps
desktop of the name eight of us.

331
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,920
456 and save it.

332
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,720
Okay.

333
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,240
This time I'll see this
particular computer with the hat

334
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,880
and this particular key
is going to be there.

335
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,000
Let you know if you guys have successfully
generated this computer key

336
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
using footage. Jack

337
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,560
Okay, what are we doing?

338
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,520
Actually?

339
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,760
So when we created this instance,
we got a key.

340
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,760
A key basically allows you to connect
to your instead.

341
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,360
It's like one added layer of security
for your instance.

342
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,720
So we downloaded that key
and what was the extension

343
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,800
for that particular key?

344
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,600
It was dot

345
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,400
pam file, right?

346
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,040
Whenever we want to use putty
to connect to the instance,

347
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,920
we cannot use DOT then file rather

348
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,000
we have to use dot PPK file.

349
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,040
That's just one requirement of the party.

350
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,720
So what we will do,
we will convert our documents file to dot

351
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,520
PPK file using putty.

352
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:59,040
Jack.

353
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,360
And we just did that.

354
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,760
We simply loaded the file, the key, and
we saved the private E and the public key.

355
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,720
So more freely
you'll be using the private key.

356
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,920
Okay. Are we done to this step

357
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,160
today?

358
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,880
You guys are very, very sleepy.

359
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,680
I believe you are tired.

360
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,440
Maybe

361
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,720
just a small session.

362
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Guys. This like

363
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,080
only 1.5 hours left.

364
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,320
So be interactive, be active.

365
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,600
Okay. Okay.

366
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,560
Now we have that video in front of us
and we have an option of

367
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,680
giving the hostname our IP address.

368
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,480
So again, someone telling me that
what will go in here, the private

369
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,840
IP address are the public one.

370
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,720
Yes, exactly.

371
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:08,280
So we'll go and copy our public address.

372
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,240
Where is that.

373
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:26,040
Let me see instance running
and I'll go to my instance.

374
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,120
Is this the correct one?

375
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:35,920
Let me make sure.

376
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,360
No, this is the first one, so I'll copy

377
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,120
my public key IP address.

378
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,040
I'll pass it in here.

379
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,920
Okay. The port is 22.

380
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Connection type is SSL.

381
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,960
After this, we only need to have

382
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,840
our key added into this body.

383
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,320
So how are we going to add
the double click on the search?

384
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,320
And then what?

385
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,440
So after clicking on assets and ports,

386
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,680
we see that there's a private E file
for authentication.

387
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,080
We'll add the file simply over here.

388
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,800
So I'll go to my desktop.

389
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,760
I have this file, double click on it
and the file will be added.

390
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,000
Now get go again to my session.

391
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,960
So at this point, are you guys with me

392
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,160
or do you want me to repeat any step

393
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,240
with step with step guys?

394
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,840
If you are able to follow,
you can always ask me to repeat.

395
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,560
Okay,

396
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,080
so which step do you want me
to do you want me to repeat

397
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:00,040
all of it?

398
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,800
Okay.

399
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Even the
convergence of the key that we did,

400
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,800
we want to repeat that to

401
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,280
let me know

402
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,600
so that I can quickly start on that point.

403
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:43,680
Do you want me to repeat this
generation also?

404
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,240
Okay, so

405
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,880
since we are up our putty
and we are going to place

406
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,920
in the configuration
the hostname or IP address, so

407
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,680
the IP address, we can get it
from the instance that it launched

408
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,440
and we can simply copy
the public IP address that we have.

409
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,400
So I'm copying it
and I'm pasting it over here.

410
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,600
Let me know.

411
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,920
And once you guys have done this

412
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:23,920
before,

413
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,480
okay, now go to set

414
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:38,240
and click on authentication.

415
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:45,320
Now you need to add your key,
which you converted the private one

416
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,920
over here.

417
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,400
So simply click on Browse

418
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,440
and go to the location where you have

419
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,560
this converted key
with this computer assigned,

420
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:05,800
double click on it
and go back to sessions.

421
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Okay, Till this point,
are you guys with me?

422
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,600
Okay, great.

423
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:29,720
So now let's just click on open.

424
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,640
Okay, I'll click.

425
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,520
I'm going to accept this.

426
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,600
Now it's saying log in as

427
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,360
I need to see my username.

428
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,280
So where can I get it?

429
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,960
I'll simply click on Connect

430
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,720
and I'll click on

431
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,480
Do instance Connect.

432
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,080
So for me, my username is root.

433
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,120
You may you may have different it,
maybe root it, maybe if you do user.

434
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,840
So whatever your username is,

435
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:18,520
you need to type that into your property.

436
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:18,800
Okay.

437
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Not saying please log in as to user
and then okay.

438
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,640
So you see to that user

439
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:35,960
what happened.

440
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,680
Okay, my equity got closed
and you went off, you was able to connect

441
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,480
it. Let's

442
00:33:51,480 --> 00:34:07,520
try it again.

443
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,280
Okay, so try this again and this time

444
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,520
log in as a user.

445
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:27,080
So same steps.

446
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,440
So I'll open up the putty

447
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,560
outpaced in the IP address.

448
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,040
The public one.

449
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,720
I'll go to asset and authentication.

450
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,880
Oh, here.

451
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:43,600
I'll add the key.

452
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,120
Once I have added the key, I'll click on

453
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,040
session again and I'll click on open

454
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,200
and then I'll see you to that user.

455
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Same steps that we did before.
We need to do again.

456
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,280
The only difference is that
it will take on log in as easy to user

457
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,760
instead of this time.

458
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,880
Okay, now hassle mohamud Mariam,
you'll get that.

459
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,480
Are you able to connect to it?

460
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:18,960
You'll get that.

461
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,600
Is yours connected?

462
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,040
Okay Maryam

463
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,040
Okay.

464
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:36,280
William You are not falling right?

465
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,120
And mammoth and soon.

466
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:44,040
What about you guys?

467
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,920
Yeah, I can get that from the way you type

468
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,520
because everything is good
when you are just

469
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,920
looking at the stuff, the actual problem.

470
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,880
The problem is when you are actually
trying to implement it.

471
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,600
So that's fine.

472
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,120
Okay, So now you see that
we see the same page

473
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,840
that we saw when we logged in using

474
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,280
Amazon console.

475
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,640
But this time you have connected to that
remote machine that we

476
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,280
created using our exercise plan,
which is pretty.

477
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,400
And what about the Mac users?

478
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,960
Do you have a

479
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,120
you have this kind of connection
established using the video.

480
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:58,600
That video that I showed.

481
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:58,920
Okay.

482
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,960
So if you run the common
Java Dash version, it's going to show you

483
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,680
that this particular system has Joe
version 1.7.0 underscore

484
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,960
six one installed in the machine.

485
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,120
And if you want to look at the Docker
version so you can do Docker dash version,

486
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,600
sorry, Docker

487
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,840
dash dashboards,

488
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,560
it will show you
that you have a version of it or two

489
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:38,640
or 3.1 installed on this machine.

490
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,720
Okay.

491
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,840
Unfortunately,
I don't think I can zoom in for you guys,

492
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,600
but what I can do is
I can pace the command for,

493
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,320
okay.

494
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,760
And Docker, these are the two commands
that you are supposed to run.

495
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,880
They will just give you the versions
of the softwares

496
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,840
that are installed.

497
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:36,480
Eleanor,
were you able to connect to the instance?

498
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,120
Oh, okay.

499
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,960
Go to go to that video.

500
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,840
It's going to walk you to. It's

501
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:52,640
not far.

502
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,360
You can actually do the same instance.

503
00:38:54,360 --> 00:39:08,600
It should be found.

504
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,800
Okay, try it again.

505
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,280
Some maybe

506
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,200
try it again. The same command.

507
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,240
If the error resist, then

508
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,080
most probably do not have our
tried dockers.

509
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,880
If you have

510
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,640
launched the same exact

511
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,280
am I then it should be there.

512
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,840
Yeah. You'll be taught that.

513
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:42,840
That's correct. Okay

514
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:50,440
So the next thing that I want to guide
you guys is about

515
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,480
security group.

516
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,360
So we have already discussed about it.

517
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,240
So I'll just briefly go over to it
once again.

518
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,480
Let me see if I have some slides for you.

519
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,680
We can discuss them on slides.

520
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:18,280
It would be better.

521
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,520
Okay.

522
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:24,280
Can you see the slide?

523
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,880
Okay. Now

524
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,600
in security,

525
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:35,800
we have two kinds of firewalls.

526
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,640
Okay, awesome.

527
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,160
So maybe the possibility is that
you have not connected to the connect.

528
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,240
Am I okay?

529
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:50,240
You did not connect to the correct AM on.

530
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,200
That's the only possibility.

531
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,240
But don't worry about it.

532
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,480
Even if this command is not running,
you know how to connect the

533
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,200
to the instance.

534
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,440
So you just have connected the wrong one.

535
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,160
So it's not a problem.

536
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,560
It was just there
so that you can check the versions.

537
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,120
Okay. Talking about security,
we have two kinds of firewall.

538
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,480
One is security group
and the other is network ACL.

539
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,240
Okay? Now

540
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,320
in the end of whenever we create
an instance, we configure

541
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,400
our security groups in which
we have two kinds rules that we mentioned.

542
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,920
Number one, inbound rules.

543
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,840
Number two, outbound.

544
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,880
So what are inbound use?

545
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,680
It's very simple,
just as the name suggests, inbound routes.

546
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,760
So whatever traffic,
whatever data is going to be

547
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,840
coming to that particular instance,

548
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,360
whatever routes it should follow
are going to be under the inbound rules.

549
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,320
So for example,
in this particular instance that we have,

550
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,960
if I go to the security
and show you the inbound rules

551
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,400
I have that

552
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,200
the protocol should be TCP IP and such,

553
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,240
let me just make it a little bit big

554
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,920
with this, not this instance.

555
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,840
I want to go with this.

556
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,560
Okay.

557
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,320
So in the end I have that the

558
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,640
type is SSL protocol, TCP

559
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,600
for number trade
two and the source can be any source.

560
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,640
So these are the inbound rules.

561
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,560
It means that any traffic
that needs to be coming to this

562
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,720
particular instance
should be following the SSX protocol.

563
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,040
TCB on the poor trade to
and from this IP address,

564
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,320
If I tried to connect using Port 21,
I would not be able to connect.

565
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,880
If I tried to connect
using any of the protocols

566
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,760
rather than said
I will not be able to connect

567
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,960
if I tried to connect from level
any source, I can't.

568
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,920
Okay, let's try to edit them.

569
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,680
Let's say I want to give access
to someone else or another protocol.

570
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,800
So what I can simply do is select the kind
of port of all that I want to allow.

571
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,000
So let's say I want to allow HTP
just for for example.

572
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,320
So HTP protocol is also a TCP transport.

573
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,000
HTP is going to be Eddie

574
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,640
and which

575
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
IP address do I want to allow?

576
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,080
Let's say 192.168.1.1 So this means that

577
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,480
only this 192.168.1.1 can connect

578
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,680
to this particular instance or HTP.

579
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:00,840
Now that this makes sense,
the inbound route is is it

580
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:08,560
clear to everyone that what are inbound
routes?

581
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,360
Okay.

582
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,600
Similar to inbound routes,
we have outbound

583
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,120
routes.

584
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,520
Outbound rules refer to the traffic
that is going out of the network.

585
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,040
So any traffic
that will be going out of the networks,

586
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,120
we are going to see that
they come under the outbound rules.

587
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,920
So for this particular instance,

588
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,120
all kind of traffic can go

589
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,480
out of the network.

590
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,600
They can be on any protocol,

591
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,880
they can be on any port,

592
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,680
and they can be to any kind of computer
or IP address.

593
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,320
So we have basically no security
for outbound traffic

594
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,000
in this particular instance.

595
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,640
No, we will not be adding them.

596
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,040
Actually, I'm just giving you the concept
that what is a security group.

597
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,720
So security groups have inbound rules
and outbound rules.

598
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,840
Inbound rules are on the traffic
that is coming into the system

599
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,160
and outbound routes are on the traffic
that is going out of the system.

600
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,000
It totally depends on you.

601
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,240
If you want to restrict someone
or if you do not want to restrict anyone,

602
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,440
you want to allow everyone
to connect to your system.

603
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,800
Okay, Is that clear now?

604
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:37,200
Can you move forward
or do you guys have any question?

605
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,760
You'll get our customer.

606
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,600
Are we good, Marieme?

607
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,800
Are we good? Yes.

608
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,680
Okay.

609
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,120
Now let me open up the diagram again
and let me make this kind of

610
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,920
so let's say this is our security

611
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,640
group. A

612
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,360
so in our security group,
what rules do we have?

613
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,120
Quickly Answer Yes.

614
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,080
What rules do we
have in our security group?

615
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,040
Inbound and outbound.

616
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,600
Right? Perfect.

617
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,280
Now let's see.

618
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:28,560
We have two instances.

619
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,640
These are the two different instances.

620
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,760
What what do what do you guys understand
when, say,

621
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:45,080
the term instance?

622
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,400
Okay,

623
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,840
When I say instance, it means,

624
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,000
you know, it's not Java, right?

625
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,280
We are dealing with cloud.

626
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,640
And let me tell you
that why I was using this term,

627
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,080
because if you have read this, etc.,

628
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:09,800
what does it say?

629
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,360
It say instance, running right?

630
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,400
So what is it referring to?

631
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,040
This instance term.

632
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,080
It's referring to the computer
Oracle machine.

633
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,080
Oh my God.

634
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,240
All this time were you like

635
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,520
thinking about the instance
regarding Java?

636
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,320
Why would I mention that?

637
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,280
Okay, Mariam, you are smart.

638
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,720
Thank you for

639
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,000
thank you for understanding.

640
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,160
Okay, so if I have a security group
A can I do this

641
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,760
that I add the instance one and instance

642
00:47:50,760 --> 00:48:02,040
to board in it? Yes.

643
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,400
Now same security rules apply on board the

644
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,280
instance.

645
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,960
Okay?

646
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,560
Now, if they are in the same group,

647
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,840
they will be abiding the same rules

648
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:26,040
for inbound and outbound traffic.

649
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,200
Now, let me open up the slides again.

650
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:48,360
Okay.

651
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,800
I share these documents with you guys
so you don't need to worry about this.

652
00:48:52,800 --> 00:49:20,240
Okay.

653
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,320
Apart from security group,
we have one other thing

654
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,960
in our firewall, which is network escort.

655
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,000
So I'll briefly go to it.

656
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:33,800
Network ACL is

657
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,880
monitoring the traffic

658
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,080
that is going out of that subnet.

659
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,160
It's basically you can say that

660
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,320
it's on the router side from where

661
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,920
the traffic is entering
that particular building, our subnet.

662
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,520
It also has some rules and it monitors
that whether it's following those rules

663
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,520
or not in depth of them
because we do not actually need

664
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,920
to configure network ACL,
we can simply have them by default.

665
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,680
The only thing that we are interested in
is configuring the security.

666
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,120
GROSS

667
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,240
okay.

668
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:21,600
So after that, what else do we have?

669
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,840
I think we have discussed about

670
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,000
everything else.

671
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,240
And now the last thing
that I want to discuss with you guys

672
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,280
is going to be

673
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,680
regarding issue two.

674
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,520
Some more details.

675
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,120
So how about we do this?

676
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,880
We go for a break for

677
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,320
10 minutes
and then we come back and continue

678
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:57,000
with issue two instance.

679
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,160
Okay, So 1130 I'll see you guys on 1123.

680
00:51:03,680 --> 01:01:01,880
Okay.

681
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:06,160
Okay.

682
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,000
He is good.

683
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,240
Just taking on a

684
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,760
okay, so

685
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,920
let's quickly

686
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,720
go to the next

687
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,440
discussion in the instance

688
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,640
and then we will be ending our today
session.

689
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,240
Okay.

690
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,840
So just some more time again.

691
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:42,320
And the purpose
of having this launch, in this instance,

692
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:46,080
I hope that it's clear to all of
you that if you want to have

693
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,400
some infrastructure

694
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,680
already installed,
some applications are already installed,

695
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,800
we can easily, you know, in no time

696
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,120
use these particular instances to

697
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,080
deploy our application over there.

698
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:06,280
So, for example, if a certain application
needs some kind of resources,

699
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,920
we just select BMI and we just simply

700
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,920
go over there and deploy our application.

701
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,560
One of the example is that

702
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,480
when you guys will be learning Docker,

703
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,880
you'll see that
when I tell you to install Docker

704
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,000
on the computers, it's
going to be a very hectic desk.

705
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,360
Configuration of dockers on a computer
takes around

706
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,640
one hour to 1.5 hour

707
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,840
because there are a lot of settings
that you need to make.

708
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,280
There are a lot of configuration issues
that you need to resolve.

709
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,760
So let's say a person
who wants to quickly test

710
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,760
something on Docker
deploying application or Docker

711
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:49,400
instead of using his own computer,

712
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,760
if he simply use us and use

713
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,280
the image that we just launched

714
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,000
which had Docker pre-installed,
he will be able to

715
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,440
he will

716
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,840
be able to launch his application
within no time.

717
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,240
So that's one of the main feature.

718
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,640
The other features that we discussed were

719
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,840
more resources
that we do not have right now.

720
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,800
So we saw that
we have different kinds of options

721
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,280
for the RAM, for the hard disk
or the CPU's

722
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,400
available to us.

723
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,800
One of the most amazing feature of easy
two instance is

724
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:40,520
auto scaling.

725
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,960
Okay, so what happens in auto skinning?

726
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,760
Let's say that you launched an instance
and by now

727
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,600
I believe that you guys understand
that an instance

728
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,880
is an easy to machine.

729
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,960
Okay? This particular instance

730
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,840
now has some

731
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,680
softwares

732
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:11,880
or application running.

733
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:17,840
Let's say you are maybe running
some test scripts on it.

734
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,280
Now tell me, is it possible that you

735
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,400
chose a computer which had

736
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,360
let's see

737
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,400
those CPU's

738
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,320
RAM was

739
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,120
500 GB

740
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,400
So 5500 is way too much.

741
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:49,920
Let's go with AGP.

742
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,760
So is it possible that
when you are running this application,

743
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,800
your CPU and RAM are totally consumed
because of the traffic that you have?

744
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,360
Or maybe because of the test cases
that you are running?

745
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,600
The computer is under load.

746
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,440
Okay.

747
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,760
And your performance can be slow right?

748
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,760
It might happen
that your performance becomes a little

749
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,080
this can be a critical scenario.

750
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,520
Let's say, for example,
in the case that you have in a web

751
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,160
application

752
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,440
that is launched on this instance

753
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,880
and what happens in web application,
it is assessed to APIs, right?

754
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,000
So the customers are going to be

755
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,240
accessing that website using EC2 instance.

756
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,000
Right? It's deployed over here.

757
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So they will be using some kind of API
to connect to it.

758
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,040
So if a lot of customers
are using the website at the same time,

759
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:01,440
is the website going to be slow?

760
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,760
Yes, it is going to be slow.

761
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,400
So EWR provides
us with an option of auto scaling.

762
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,840
So what happens in order scaling?

763
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,080
We do

764
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,600
mention some criteria, let's say

765
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,880
alarms

766
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:25,560
or criteria.

767
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,920
So for example, we set an alarm on CPU

768
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,240
that if the CPU percentage

769
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:39,080
is greater than 70%, then do what?

770
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:53,160
Launch another instance.

771
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:53,560
Okay.

772
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:57,480
So we cannot increase the CPU
at runtime, actually.

773
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:58,920
Okay, awesome.

774
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:03,440
It is not possible
for us to just add a CPU.

775
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,960
It will not happen at runtime

776
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,560
when the application is running.

777
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,120
We can do this that we stop the server
and we know

778
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,880
build the computer again, this time
a larger one.

779
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,840
But that is not an efficient way
because the traffic is not consistent.

780
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,960
There might be time when in a day
the fluid is not that much.

781
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,560
Right?

782
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,040
So we we put an alarm that

783
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:32,760
if our CPU percentage go above 70%,
just launch another instance.

784
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:40,080
So what will happen?

785
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,520
It will create

786
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,840
Amazon machine image.

787
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:50,040
For the instance
that we have already created.

788
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,200
This image is going to contain

789
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,960
all the information, all the softwares
application that are running

790
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:08,520
along with the web application
that we were running.

791
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:14,640
As soon as the CPU percentage
hit 70% and the alarm goes on, it's

792
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:20,240
going to simply launch
the exact same instance in parallel

793
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,520
and all the softwares

794
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,000
and web application
will also be running on this

795
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:36,000
particular instance.

796
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:36,240
Okay.

797
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,880
So now we have two same computers

798
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,960
running the same application.

799
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,560
So this is what are the scaling?

800
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,280
Does. So

801
01:08:51,240 --> 01:09:01,840
any questions?

802
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:05,880
Okay.

803
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,800
Alarms only order scanning.

804
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,600
No alarms are everywhere.

805
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,120
In DFW
you'll see different kind of alarms.

806
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,440
You can see set down depending upon needs.

807
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,240
So they are also in order scanning.

808
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,320
They are also available in other options.

809
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:23,360
Also.

810
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,760
No, they are not.

811
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,960
I would not call them exceptions.

812
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,640
It's just like,

813
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,000
yeah, it's just like an alarm that okay,
this particular criteria has been met.

814
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,240
Now the question is that

815
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:45,440
how is the traffic going to be balanced?

816
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,240
Because this was under stress, right?

817
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,800
This computer was under stress.

818
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:55,840
So how is it going to share its load
with this one?

819
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,560
The second one

820
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,440
for that purpose,

821
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,040
we have a beautiful feature

822
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,880
in issue
two instance called load balancing.

823
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,600
Very good, very good.

824
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,040
You are

825
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,400
we have a load balancing.

826
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,360
Okay.

827
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:30,200
Now this load balancer is connected
to issue

828
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:33,120
two to and easy to want.

829
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,560
Yes, you guys must have learned about it

830
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,600
in the API as

831
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,040
now let's say

832
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,480
hundreds of people
are accessing the website

833
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,880
so it will first go to the load balancer
and the load balancer

834
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,320
is then going to decide
where to rooted out.

835
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:01,280
And in that way air
traffic is going to be routed accordingly

836
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:07,240
while setting no response time
lag on your web application.

837
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:10,480
So you also observe this that nowadays

838
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:13,600
we have

839
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,520
websites like Facebook, like Instagram,

840
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,440
you know, these are the websites on which

841
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,640
there is the most traffic all the time,

842
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,240
although they have their own
separate servers available,

843
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:31,040
but they are also using load balancing
and are just getting techniques

844
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,880
so that no person is facing any less.

845
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:37,200
Okay.

846
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,520
One of the most important thing
that I would like to mention here is that

847
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,480
when in a company
you are using auto scaling,

848
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,320
it helps you save a lot of money

849
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:52,480
because as soon as the traffic goes down

850
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:57,200
and your CPU percentage is less than 70,

851
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,880
it will shut down the other resource.

852
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,200
The other instance that you launched,
saving you a lot of money

853
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:10,880
and as soon as it goes above 70 again,
it's going to launch another instance

854
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:15,000
and you all get you can also control
the number of instances

855
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,200
that should be launched.

856
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,680
You cannot three, four, five,
six, ten or whatever.

857
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:27,080
It's your choice.

858
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,080
Okay, So the configurations
are not that complicated,

859
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:36,880
but obviously you will not be doing them
because it may charges for that.

860
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,840
As we are going
to put some stress on the CPUs,

861
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,320
it may start charging us for that.

862
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,000
So we will not be doing this.

863
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I'll just simply show you the options
where they are available.

864
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,800
So if I go to auto scaling group,

865
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:58,360
I have launch configurations.

866
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:58,840
Okay.

867
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:03,000
So in launch configurations, what we said,
we said the configuration when

868
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,240
the instance needs to be launched

869
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,720
so I can name it

870
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,920
test launch.

871
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,360
You guys should not follow this.

872
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,440
Just look upon what I'm doing.

873
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:18,920
I'll just walk to quickly
the concept source and I gave you

874
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:22,000
earlier in the discussion.

875
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,040
I'll just show you that how we need to
configure when we are using the console.

876
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:26,600
Don't it?

877
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,640
Because I will not be doing it completely.

878
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,880
Yes, just like you.

879
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,600
So it says that.

880
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,080
Which image do you want to launch when you

881
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,400
when you are actually

882
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:40,960
in need?

883
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,920
So I'll click on choosing images.

884
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,360
But the thing is that
I want to launch the exact

885
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,360
same one that is already launched, right?

886
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,920
The one that we launched earlier.

887
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,880
I want to launch the exact
exact same image

888
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:04,960
is in the scenario.

889
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,400
I want that kind of am I right?

890
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,920
So for that I will have to create first.

891
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,960
And am I?

892
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,320
So how can we create an image?

893
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:18,320
Go to your instance and simply

894
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,840
right click on it

895
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:29,960
and you'll see an icon or create image.

896
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,000
So when I click on Create Image,

897
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,480
I'll name it

898
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:46,320
my test image.

899
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,680
Okay,
Now the image for this particular machine,

900
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,360
whatever is running on
this, has been created.

901
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,480
I can have a look at that image
by clicking on images.

902
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,840
And there you go.

903
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,520
My test images here

904
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,840
is this clear

905
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,880
that first of all,
they created the image for that machine

906
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:13,920
which we want to launch
when the resources are out of bounds.

907
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,240
So now let's go to launch configurations
here.

908
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:20,400
We will configure when to launch.

909
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,920
So create launch configurations.

910
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:27,880
The name is going to be test launch.

911
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,720
Okay. Now from the images,

912
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:34,080
which image should I be choosing

913
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,840
my test?

914
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:42,240
What exactly?

915
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,960
Choose the instance type.

916
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,160
Okay, now this says that.

917
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:50,560
Okay, which instance
do you want to go along with

918
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,160
if you are now launching another one?

919
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,440
So to micro, I hope that's available.

920
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,160
No. One t to my cross.

921
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:09,240
I think it's not here.

922
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:12,800
And then to our s

923
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:17,880
t to nano micro is not to it.

924
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,120
Okay.

925
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:37,720
Okay.

926
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,080
Okay. So no other options
we need to configure.

927
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:44,440
There are some regarding the security ones
and the keep here.

928
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,480
We are using the existing PPA,
so let it be.

929
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:55,080
Eight of us wanted to see created
launch configuration.

930
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,120
So launch contributions are there. Now.

931
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:01,960
We will go to our two scaling groups

932
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,520
and in our order scaling grows,
we are going to

933
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:12,480
create one or two scaling group.

934
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:14,760
Okay. So group name is testing

935
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:21,960
the launch.

936
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,680
Now it wants to

937
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,400
choose a launch template
that contains the instance level settings

938
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:35,160
such in the Amazon Machine
image type and security group.

939
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,680
Let's see if we have one already.

940
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:46,160
We will have to create a launch template.

941
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,760
So let's not name a test template

942
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,960
and let other options be by default.

943
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,680
No. An image template that will be used.

944
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,840
Okay, Miami's

945
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:14,160
my test images there.

946
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,560
I can select this one

947
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,280
instance.

948
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,840
Type p one microgaming

949
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,640
network settings.

950
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,000
We do not need consideration this right.

951
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:26,280
Okay.

952
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:28,320
Now let's create

953
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:42,600
now let's go to launch groups.

954
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,880
Sorry are just going to go.

955
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,320
Let's try to make one

956
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,480
that's auto

957
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,800
test template.

958
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,160
Okay this one is good versions
that should be by default.

959
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:05,600
Next VPC is going to be default
availability zone.

960
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:11,440
Okay, so now over here,
I want to mention one more thing.

961
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:16,160
Let's say you want to run your
application in such a way

962
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,840
that you also have

963
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,680
redundancy for that.

964
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:27,120
For example,
what happened at the last case

965
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:31,400
that we discussed
was regarding the load one right?

966
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,920
But what if due to some

967
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,680
technical fault or natural disaster,

968
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,080
your data center stops working,

969
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:50,960
The whole data center is out of operation.

970
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,200
So in such a scenario, do you want
your application to go on or downtime?

971
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,440
It's not available to people

972
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,200
that you know,

973
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,760
but the problem is
that the whole data center is out.

974
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,680
So in your order scaling

975
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:13,920
group, what you'll do is

976
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:17,160
you will choose this subnet

977
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,600
different from the previous one.

978
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:26,920
So your one machine is going to lie
in one building,

979
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,240
whereas the other machine
is going to be like

980
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:36,200
in another building.

981
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:40,880
So that in a scenario
where even one data center is not working,

982
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,000
the other one is

983
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,120
still there to support your application.

984
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:51,080
So over here,
if I selected the first one to be one

985
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:58,800
B, now I can select one eight.

986
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,640
Okay, So now if you want to attach a load
balancer, you can.

987
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,080
If not, then you cannot.

988
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,840
For now, you will not be launching that.

989
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,240
These are somehow check metrics.

990
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:13,440
It means that checking your instance

991
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,880
after every 300 seconds,
if it's there, is good enough.

992
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,480
If not, it's going to automatically launch
another instance

993
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,560
in a separate building.

994
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,720
Okay, So now

995
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,760
what is the desired capacity?

996
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:34,440
One minimum capacity.

997
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:39,360
One desired capacity, let's say three,
and the maximum capacity, let's say five.

998
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,920
So we are saying that minimum
there should be one instance,

999
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,520
like I desired them to be three
and maximum can mean a five node.

1000
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,720
Not no greater than that.

1001
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,800
Now we have an optional

1002
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,920
scaling the policy scaling policies.

1003
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,320
Okay, now target scaling policy.

1004
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:04,000
You can select on average CPU
utilization, average network in average

1005
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,160
network out our application
load balancer request convert target.

1006
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,400
It means that the number of request
to load counter is load

1007
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:17,880
balancer is encountering so we can go
with the utilization target value.

1008
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:20,680
We can set to 70

1009
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:27,280
next.

1010
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:35,760
No notifications
needed, no tags needed, and simply create

1011
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:45,000
autofill and grow.

1012
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Okay, so auto scaling has been launched

1013
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,520
and now it will be in action.

1014
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:58,440
Let's see in our easy to instance
dashboard.

1015
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:02,520
Okay, so do you remember
I said the desired capacity

1016
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:08,320
to three?

1017
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,480
I set the desired capacity to three.

1018
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:14,880
So that's why it just like three
more instance of the same

1019
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,400
exact image.

1020
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,160
Because desired capacity means that

1021
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,840
this is what you prefer
in normal conditions.

1022
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:28,800
So now the sad part is

1023
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,200
I will not be able to terminate it
even if I terminate

1024
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,600
all of them.

1025
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,960
They will be launched automatically again,

1026
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:45,800
because the art of scaling up is going to
see that, okay, instance is not working.

1027
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:50,680
It's going to check itself and it's
going to be launching it once again.

1028
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,280
So I'll just go and delete

1029
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:59,640
the group.

1030
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:25,120
Any questions regarding order
scaling and load balancing?

1031
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,000
Yeah, I'm
just going to delete these things

1032
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
because they are going to charge me if

1033
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:30,840
if they are there.

1034
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:38,680
Okay, So That's why I need to delete them.

1035
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,760
I don't know why, but due to some reason,

1036
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:46,360
every month I get charged $1
by eight of us.

1037
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,360
I don't know.
I have not been using any services,

1038
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,200
but it's just $1.

1039
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:54,880
So I'm like, okay, just do it.

1040
01:24:54,880 --> 01:25:03,960
I don't care.

1041
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:07,160
Actions delete No

1042
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,280
option to delete

1043
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:15,200
instances.

1044
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:18,600
Yeah, well, you are right about this.

1045
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,800
A lot of money from the don't care

1046
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:27,840
customers.

1047
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,200
I checked my account.

1048
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:36,320
I was I saw nothing
but nothing was launched.

1049
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,960
So I don't know what's the fee for.

1050
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,000
Obviously they will have some reasons.

1051
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,320
It's a big company.

1052
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,480
Amazon They cannot just charge me
for doing nothing.

1053
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:49,640
Maybe I have some.

1054
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:52,080
Maybe I misread some policy
I don't know about.

1055
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,400
Maybe there is an update, but that's
the reason they will not be charging.

1056
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,360
Without any policy.

1057
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:01,360
You cannot do that actually,
because one legal case

1058
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,720
around them can actually destroy them.

1059
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:06,720
Okay.

1060
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,840
So regarding the
issue, to instance, I think

1061
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,280
this much information is sufficient enough

1062
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,080
and trust me with that, that we have only

1063
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,800
like only 20% of SC doing stats.

1064
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,920
There are a lot of other options
available over here

1065
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,240
that we can incorporate
and start working with them.

1066
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:34,800
They are now as

1067
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,480
but it's

1068
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,520
impossible
to actually cover, to be very honest.

1069
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,520
I am also not familiar
with all these options that are out there.

1070
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,680
So regarding the cloud, I hope that

1071
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,480
now you get an idea of how vast it is

1072
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:57,000
and how much complicated it can be.

1073
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,480
So the good thing is that

1074
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,080
no one is right

1075
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,360
now expert of the whole cloud

1076
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,600
and people do not expect from

1077
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,600
especially the testers or the developers
to be an expert in cloud.

1078
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,720
If you have the basic information,

1079
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,800
you are good to go.

1080
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:23,320
If you understand the terminologies,
what's a security group person?

1081
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,200
I am role.

1082
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:26,240
What's an easy to understand?

1083
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,240
How many services are there?

1084
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,040
How can you make use of a service?

1085
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,040
You are good enough.

1086
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,840
So for example,
if you have to use any of other

1087
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,960
services, let's say

1088
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,040
there is one service kindness.

1089
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:43,800
Let me show you.

1090
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:44,160
Yeah.

1091
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,680
This one kind of says

1092
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,840
so if you want to

1093
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,160
use let's say
you do not have any idea about kindness,

1094
01:27:57,160 --> 01:28:01,560
is that how and what is the application
of this particular service?

1095
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,400
Just go to guidances.

1096
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:08,440
There you'll see a detailed information
of how how it works.

1097
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:12,480
Collect and store data streams, collect
gigabytes of data per second,

1098
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,960
and make it available
for processing and analyzing in real time.

1099
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:16,800
It means that

1100
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,160
it's a prebuilt application

1101
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,560
that collects the data from a source

1102
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,640
and makes it available for processing.

1103
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,480
So if you have your computer

1104
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:34,080
in your computer, you are generating
or you are getting some data

1105
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:37,240
and you want to have some real time
analysis on it,

1106
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,840
you can simply connect that computer
with the stream

1107
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:47,040
and send the data directly to that stream
and apply some pre-built analysis

1108
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:50,760
technique or algorithms on that data
that is available.

1109
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,160
Currencies, data
firehose The bear and load

1110
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:58,760
real time data streams into data tools
and analytics tools.

1111
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,600
Kindness is data
analytics get actionable insights

1112
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,880
from streaming data in real time.

1113
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:08,280
So if you want to create this application,
you can create live

1114
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,120
stream, create a data stream.

1115
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:14,280
You'll get a lot of material
on the database documentation over here

1116
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,440
that will guide you how to do this.

1117
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,960
This explain
the stuff in detail, in depth.

1118
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,160
So any service that you want to use,
any service

1119
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:26,120
that you want to learn about,
you can simply go to that service, read

1120
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:30,480
the documentation about it,
and give it a free tier.

1121
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,600
Go just play around. It will help you out.

1122
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:34,880
Okay.

1123
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,800
Regarding the Dockers, yes,
I'll be teaching the Docker classes

1124
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,800
and they are
just going to be more of a conceptual,

1125
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,160
not much practical
implementation of Dockers is going to be.

1126
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:51,920
The reason being that Dockers
is really something

1127
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:57,080
that DevOps use testers,
even me as a developer, I have

1128
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,440
I think only use Dockers twice or twice

1129
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,680
and that was when I was working
in the last company in machine learning

1130
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:09,480
because our team was the one
who were expected

1131
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,880
to not go to any of their team

1132
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,360
and be capable
of doing the work of testers,

1133
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,120
doing the work of DevOps,
doing the work of where like everything

1134
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,640
we were supposed to and we were expected
to be able to do everything.

1135
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:28,520
So that's the reason
I had to use Dockers over there

1136
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:32,760
rather than that developers and testers,
they don't usually do to Dockers.

1137
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,880
It's a configuration do
and that is the responsibility

1138
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:39,400
of the DevOps team
in your company to handle that.

1139
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:43,680
So do one thing,

1140
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,240
just make sure that before our next class

1141
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:51,480
you guys have
the docker installed on your computers.

1142
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,840
How to do that?

1143
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:55,200
There are plenty of videos on YouTube.

1144
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:57,800
I'll share or two link.

1145
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:01,360
Try those out,
Make sure that you have Docker installed

1146
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:06,600
so that we can give it a go together
and do one thing more.

1147
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:11,240
Before you sign off on this account,
just make sure you go too easy to

1148
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,800
and terminate all your instance
so that you do not get charged for them.

1149
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:20,080
So I'm going to check it again.

1150
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:23,640
It's still here.

1151
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,640
Select and select actions.

1152
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:34,360
Now maybe I have terminated them

1153
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,680
one by one

1154
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,160
state

1155
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,040
and so

1156
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:50,040
yeah, and instant state.

1157
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:59,760
Terminate instance, terminate.

1158
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:05,320
Okay, so auto stealing group, just check
that not have our testing policy

1159
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:09,080
so the incidents are
not launched automatically

1160
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,240
load balance.

1161
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:18,000
I hope
that we do not have any of the perfect

1162
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,520
rate so apart from that, these are some

1163
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,200
notes and slides of whatever we have
discussed.

1164
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,400
I have placed all the information
in these notes and slides.

1165
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,040
There you have

1166
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,520
also the steps of our data policy,

1167
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:40,960
how to create an instance
and stuff like that is there.

1168
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:51,120
So you guys can have access to that.

1169
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:55,560
And there are some slides also.

1170
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,840
Do we have them read the help you out?

1171
01:32:58,680 --> 01:33:01,920
Okay,
so officially we are done with the cloud.

1172
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,200
I hope that you guys are now much clearer

1173
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,400
about the idea that what is a cloud

1174
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:14,080
and you are able to launch an instance,
connect to it, and if you are able to do

1175
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,400
and understand this,
the goal of the class is complete it.

1176
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,160
You have three security groups.

1177
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:25,560
You can share the screenshot.

1178
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:28,800
Should I add them to the canvas
or can I just share them

1179
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:35,280
in the course announcements?

1180
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:39,600
Thank you, Mariam.

1181
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,360
Okay. Canvas.

1182
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,320
Sure, I'll add them to canvas under us.

1183
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,520
Under the eight of us what we call

1184
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,440
it Less folder Other demo.

1185
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,040
What do.

1186
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:56,400
Okay, so

1187
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:58,680
that's it for today.

1188
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,520
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.

1189
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:03,040
Make sure that you have your dollars
installed.

1190
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,720
I'm not sure about the practical stuff.

1191
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:10,320
I believe that we will not be

1192
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,200
working on some real

1193
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,400
Docker application.

1194
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,520
Rather, we will be discussing the concepts
in detail of

1195
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:20,880
what is a Docker,
why do we need them and how to

1196
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,720
launch it, how it help us in real life.

1197
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,240
We'll be discussing stuff.

1198
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:31,720
So but just in case,
have Dockers installed on your computer

1199
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:34,880
so that you are familiar
with the interface and

1200
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,280
how does it look and how you can actually

1201
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,600
launch Docker containers on that?

1202
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,680
This is what we will be doing.

1203
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:47,400
You will be launching Docker containers,
so have them start out

1204
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:53,840
and lead those groups
keepers, volumes, instances.

1205
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:56,480
No, you'll get I don't think there is

1206
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:06,560
binary.

1207
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,280
You have some.

1208
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,280
Sure that you'll be to see
if you can turn off like this.

1209
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,560
If not

1210
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,680
security group is just a configuration.

1211
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,480
Do not need to worry about it.
There is a lot we charge you.

1212
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:22,240
Anything for that?

1213
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:28,680
Okay.

1214
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:31,040
Okay guys, take care.

1215
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,000
See you again.
