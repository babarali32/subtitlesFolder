1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,120
Oh, All right.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,440
Good morning, everyone.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,960
Good morning, friends.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,400
Folks, guys. Right.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,440
I see you guys already active.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,320
It is good to get good.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,640
All right.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,200
That short term, short term break, guys,
right from the classes.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,840
Back to back classes. We have.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,320
All right.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,720
So how is he?

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,600
Actually, guys,
I don't think I ever ask students.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:31,840
Right.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,960
So how is it do you guys have enough time
between Saturday

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,640
and Sunday to adjust to the material?

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,240
No, Michael is being honest.

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,160
Not really.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,560
I really need more practice.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,160
Not that much time.

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,640
Okay, I see.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,680
And because probably the classes

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,880
are long also.

23
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,160
So there's a lot of information.

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,080
Sometimes, yes. Sometimes no.

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,560
All right.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,880
I see. Well, just one thing, guys.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,720
All right.

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,240
We have I think we have today. Tomorrow.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,160
Oh, sorry. Today.

30
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,160
Tomorrow we have Today
we have about three or four classes

31
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,760
that left to cover our Java basics. Right.

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,040
And then you guys will be moving

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,160
to the completely brain new concepts
and oops concept.

34
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,240
Very beautiful concept. Right.

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,440
But what I always suggest, guys,
I know that

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,360
because the classes and
especially probably Tuesday and Wednesday

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,120
right now,
you guys been spared in manual classes

38
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,760
but because they in the evening
time back to back

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,720
and because you guys have some work,
I'm sure.

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,760
So that's probably gives
you even less time, Right.

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,320
So but that's one thing does please,
please, please make sure you try to find

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,880
that time because we do hear from students
that they fall behind,

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,800
not usually, not at the Java part,
but only later when the concept starts.

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,440
Right.

45
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,160
I know it could be tough,
but try to put that time and effort

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,080
because what I always say,
if you look at your calendar, right,

47
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,880
if you're going to
look at the calendar days and

48
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,120
I have all of them, one moment,

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,960
you know, they go this way.

50
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,000
So this is your schedule, right?

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
This is your schedule.

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,040
So now when we're looking right,
we have a Java class.

53
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,120
So next week, on Tuesday and Wednesday,
what you guys will be starting

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,400
you guys will be starting with
get right to now

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,160
this class has become
also a technical right now.

56
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,560
So from next week
guys from the upcoming week

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,520
all your weekdays
and weekends will be very technical.

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,360
Okay.

59
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,760
And then after we learn this,
maybe we will.

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,200
So basically after that, guys,
Java starts for one month.

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,080
But good thing tomorrow, guys,
that it's still Java, right?

62
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,160
You are still learning only one topic.

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,680
But then what will start happening
guys later in December.

64
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,560
Don't look at the time time
we want to fix it.

65
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,080
Sure. 630. Don't worry about it.
We'll fix all of this.

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,200
But what will start happening is
you will start learning different topics

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,720
besides Java, right?

68
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,560
Besides Java, there will be more topics
and then these different things

69
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,360
that you guys will start learning.

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,600
So what will start happening besides Java?

71
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,760
You guys will be learning new things,
but you will have to remember Java

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,720
after Java, you guys, your testing tool
after test until there's more things

73
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
and there is more things, right?

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,080
So then the knowledge becomes a lot
and the speed will be the same.

75
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,320
That's one thing this year.

76
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,120
That's why the course is very intense.

77
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,200
That's what you guys, I heard from
your friends that it was a tense ride,

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
but it was all worth it.

79
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
So that's I guess please, please
make sure you guys put a time

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,160
and effort right This maybe between
Saturday, Sunday classes.

81
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,800
There's not that much time.

82
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,320
So try to put your practice on Mondays
right there.

83
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,320
Try to put your practice on Mondays
and please make sure you guys do

84
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,720
study additionally.

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,000
Right.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,400
Don't just don't
just depend on the class coming.

87
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,360
All right, then try to watch those YouTube
channels and everything.

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,680
Just very quick.
Ten, 15 minutes video. Right.

89
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,400
And I promise you guys,
that will be very, very helpful to you

90
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,360
as well.

91
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,520
Hopefully, hopefully
guys for a little time with you guys.

92
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,480
So we'll have to put that effort
and sacrifice.

93
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,120
Right.

94
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,880
And usually then of the six months,
what we tell you guys before you go

95
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,560
in the market, Right, Because usually
students will have a full time job.

96
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,600
So it's hard for them to look for.

97
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,920
So we do tell you. Right. Be confident.

98
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,440
That's why you have to study.
You have to have the knowledge.

99
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,040
And usually students towards the end,
they do quit their jobs.

100
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,000
By then they put the effort right
within one or two months.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,880
I have to find it.

102
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,160
So but that will all depend
on your knowledge.

103
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,040
Okay, so try and make sure you guys please
study practice

104
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,560
as much as you can right now.

105
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,800
I know there probably a lot of repetition
for you, but still, you know, repetition

106
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,080
that what makes it better yet
this very cool thing guys also

107
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,040
for give that

108
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,480
will give you installation
videos today or tomorrow.

109
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,600
So to make sure that you guys have it
before the class.

110
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,160
Right. Okay.

111
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,120
But that's all in the future, guys.

112
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,800
Well, in the future, right.

113
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,600
So today we are having our Java class
practice makes a perfect day go, right?

114
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,120
Yep. That's what happens.

115
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,280
And because it's a coding, Right.

116
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,240
It's a coding, guys.

117
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,760
It's something that you were most of you

118
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,800
never done before, right?

119
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,120
And now you have to do it.

120
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,920
So if you don't do it for a couple of
days, you'll be forgetting stuff, right?

121
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,040
But once you start doing every day,
right, then

122
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,360
it will become more
and more and more better.

123
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,200
Okay. All right.

124
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
That's good. Okay.

125
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
So today
we will continue looking into our loops.

126
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,200
And I hope you guys did your homework.

127
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
I hope you guys did a practice.

128
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,360
And as usual,
what are we going to do, guys?

129
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,040
We just going to have a quick question.

130
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,680
Why do you have to pass the plus seven?

131
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,200
Write a seven to be

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,680
have a question.

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,440
All right.

134
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,320
So let's go over what did you guys learn

135
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,800
yesterday?

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,040
Switch case.

137
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,600
And we started with the threads.

138
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,320
We did introduction on them.

139
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,960
So I can you tell me, guys,
what did you learn about this?

140
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,400
Which case,

141
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,360
I assure you, is always there

142
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,520
in which situation.

143
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,120
This verse.

144
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,960
Let's understand

145
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,480
why do we have switch keys
and when I'm going to use it right then.

146
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,920
Then we'll go for it.

147
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,840
Limitations in there.

148
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,280
Right?

149
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,440
Which case is faster than if else.

150
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,400
If else if.

151
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,840
Right.

152
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,400
Switch is clean and more clear. Right.

153
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,960
So whenever we want to check for equality
so we talk about the switch key switch

154
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,200
cases, another statement that be a part
of the conditional statements.

155
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,880
Right.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,680
It it's it's a great substitute for
if else if

157
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,920
what do we use if else if one
we want to test multiple conditions right

158
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,480
so in here
what we want to check for multiple values.

159
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,000
Right.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,400
So we're saying the switch case is a value
based statement.

161
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,720
Right.

162
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,680
So whenever we want to check the value

163
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:45,960
for the

164
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,800
value of providing multiple values
for the variable, right,

165
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,760
then it's a good choice to go for switch
case, Right?

166
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,720
When do we go for a switch case?

167
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,760
When we are checking for the equal ready.

168
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,720
Right. And it's a valid base.

169
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,840
So switch case with it.

170
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,520
It's a cleaner, it's
a faster version of the if.

171
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:03,840
Right.

172
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,720
What do we talk about
if we send if as a condition based,

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,400
when we talk about switches,
which is a value based.

174
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Right.

175
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,920
And of course, there's no great things
that works for everything, right?

176
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,240
So each case
will have its own limitations, right?

177
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,000
It will have its own limitation, right?

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It can work only right.

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,360
It can work
only with some of the data types.

180
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:26,760
Right?

181
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,600
We can work
only this by short integer, right.

182
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,120
Any can work with the charge and strings.

183
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,120
Right. Char and strips. Right.

184
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,720
And they are.

185
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,040
We cannot use operators such as logical
and such as what?

186
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,680
What kind of operators? We cannot use

187
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,080
relational.

188
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,680
Right.

189
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,200
So then when we look at the switch syntax,
right switch syntax.

190
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,400
Right. So we have a switch keyword, right.

191
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,920
So every single key words
have a meaning for Java, right?

192
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,440
Have a meaning for Java.

193
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,320
So what happens?

194
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,240
Basically guess what happens, right?

195
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,640
So whenever we write some code, right,
Whenever we write some code,

196
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,760
so Right,
so our code when we are clicking on safe.

197
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,320
Okay.

198
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,520
So when we clicking on safe, right,
our code is being compiled, right?

199
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,640
So that's why in case
if there's any issue, right,

200
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,520
in case of any issue,
if I'm trying to click on safe right

201
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,480
here, even before clicking on Safe,
it shows me the error, right?

202
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,880
It shows me the error
and the machine who shows us the error.

203
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,440
It's a compiler, right?

204
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,160
So, for example,
if I have an issue right now, enough,

205
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,120
if I'm going to try to run my code, right.

206
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,600
So what we will get we will get some error

207
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,720
that will be saying
unresolved completion problem.

208
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,240
So it means there was some

209
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,960
syntax issues, right?

210
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,200
There were some syntax mistakes and that's
why our call was not able to compile.

211
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,360
Right. The uncle was not able to come.

212
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,120
So only normally
after a code being compiled.

213
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,840
It means there is no errors, there's
no mistakes.

214
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,480
Only then this code is given to Java,
right?

215
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
Only then this code is given to Java.

216
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,600
So whenever you try to click on Run,
then what happens?

217
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,840
Java actually takes your code and the
start execute in line by line your code.

218
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,600
So by during
while we type in who checks all our issue,

219
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,200
it's our compiler checks
that issues things.

220
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,440
All right.

221
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,000
So whenever Java exec use the code
right it's

222
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,520
it comes to the switch right switch
is a keyword so Java knows okay switch.

223
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,560
So now I have to do what I have to do.

224
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,200
I have to check for this

225
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,520
here.

226
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,640
What do we specify inside?

227
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,960
This switch gets

228
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
or what is we just doing?

229
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
The review.

230
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,080
So what do we specify
inside the switch base?

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,880
We specify variable, right?

232
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,040
We specify a variable. Right.

233
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,040
So then our switch block starts, right?

234
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,720
Our sweet book starts

235
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,400
and inside is switch.

236
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
What do we have?

237
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,240
What do we have? This

238
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
we have keys is right.

239
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,680
This is the key says
What do we provide next to the cases

240
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,240
values.

241
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,360
We provide that value one
and then whatever the code we want.

242
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,920
Right?

243
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,600
Anything else is needed.

244
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,200
Right?

245
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,000
And then if there's more values,

246
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
more value we want to provide

247
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,080
for this particular cases,
we list them out with the please.

248
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,480
The reason is the keys right now we two
and then the same thing.

249
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,680
We will provide a code, right
what we want and the break.

250
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,840
And then when we are
done, what do we provide this

251
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,360
equal rights and equal?

252
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,680
Do I do I have to put it, though?

253
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,720
I don't have to put it.

254
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,960
It's an optional right.

255
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,040
It's an optional that we provide

256
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,920
the default by default.

257
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,640
So optional keyword
that we want to provide.

258
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,480
And usually it's provided
at the end of our switch.

259
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,320
Right?

260
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,560
So this is a block of quote
is which block of.

261
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,920
Okay,
so that's why you're saying switch cases.

262
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,880
What is a value based? Value based, Right.

263
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,640
It's not like our
if statement we're in parenthesis

264
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,960
with specify a condition, right.

265
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,520
To specify the condition.

266
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,920
Very beautiful statement.

267
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,360
Right Very beautiful statement.

268
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,440
In is as similar
as another conditional statesman

269
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,600
and right out of the entire block,
right out of the entire switch block.

270
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,880
What will happen?

271
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,560
Only one case write only one case

272
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,640
or if there's none of the cases match,
only one statement will be executed.

273
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:03,840
Right?

274
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,720
There is no way that all of them
will be educated.

275
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,160
Right.

276
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,560
So similarly, what do we do?

277
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,240
We do it as selective execution, right?

278
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,600
The execution

279
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,400
right now was for a switch, right?

280
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,320
That was for a switch.

281
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,240
And then what? Last class?

282
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,040
Oh, actually, that's.

283
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:29,120
How was the homework for a calculator?

284
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,640
You guys do it.

285
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,600
Let's see, because that's
where you guys used your sample.

286
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,640
Oh, there's supposed to be
two weeks, right?

287
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,760
So let me create a package

288
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,320
from that

289
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,320
new class

290
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,120
and because everybody wants a.

291
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:13,160
Okay,
can you guys send me your calculator?

292
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,080
So two different ways
we could have done it, right?

293
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,160
So two different ways
we could have done it.

294
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,560
Let's say, Oh

295
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,440
yeah.

296
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,800
So in here,
what we bring in, we bring in our scanner

297
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,120
right in the given instruction,
please enter first number here.

298
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,720
Capturing the first number.

299
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,320
Right
this line, please enter the second number.

300
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,480
Capturing the second number right in here.

301
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,240
What are we doing?

302
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,760
We are trying to capture the operator.

303
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,120
Right.

304
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,200
What it will be
Plus minus multiplication division.

305
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
So how do we calculate?

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,240
Capture that, Operator.

307
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,480
We captured this using that chart, right?

308
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,600
We store inside that chart
and then I see what are we doing?

309
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,120
We are initializing one variable in here.

310
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,160
Okay, cool. We'll see.

311
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,240
What is that for? Right.

312
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,720
And then what do we have? Right?

313
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,640
And then what do we have?

314
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,720
So we bring in our switch statement right?

315
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,120
We bring in our switch statement in here.

316
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,760
So in the switch to which variable,
what does this variable refers to guys do?

317
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:26,160
Which variable
we try to provide matching cases.

318
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,400
Operator Right to the operator. Right.

319
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,280
So now I said, Hey,

320
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,200
if the operator that you entered
will be multiplication right then.

321
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,920
Oh I see.

322
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,320
What is solve or
okay, so what is so so then

323
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,200
a solution

324
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,760
will be you do it multiply by B, right?

325
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,520
In case if it's division,
you do A divided by B in case of the

326
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,160
plus you do
plus in case the minus, the minus.

327
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,200
And in case of none of the if

328
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,680
none of the cases will be mentioned,
then you want to say entry is invalid.

329
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Write entries in them. Okay, good.

330
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,200
And what you knew best

331
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,600
after that, you just try to run your code
and see these different variations.

332
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,200
Right?

333
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,440
Please enter number eight nine
and what you want to do.

334
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,640
We want to do a loss of

335
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,320
function loss right now.

336
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,000
So give me a result of the addition.

337
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,280
Right.
And that's all you do. You run after that.

338
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,280
You have things one number 90,
the other one, number 80.

339
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,680
Right. What I want to do,
I want to multiply.

340
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,600
Okay, go it.

341
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,320
It works, right?

342
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,560
So you guys are able
to test your own code.

343
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,760
How are we able to test it?

344
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,920
By providing different,

345
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,280
different values to see that all
my cases are matches

346
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,400
and at the same time let's see
that our default is working as well.

347
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,720
Right?

348
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,400
We did the number 112
and the number is 13.

349
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,080
And the operator,
I'm going to use a percentage sign ago.

350
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:01,640
Go says entry is invalid entries invalid.

351
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,920
So that was with the.

352
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,600
But if we give one positive one negative,

353
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,120
we can do it -19.

354
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,320
What kind of operation?

355
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,560
What kind of operation you want to do?

356
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:27,320
Please enter
second number for operator minus.

357
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,560
So it gives -23.

358
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,520
Let's see you guys.
Let's see what happens.

359
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,560
Then within the first number ten,
please enter for a second.

360
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,800
Number minus five.

361
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,200
Please enter your operator.

362
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,080
You get -36 minus, which shows me 15.

363
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,800
Okay, let's see what happens.

364
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,240
Good. So let's see what happens.

365
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,440
Let's see where our code posts right.

366
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,760
I don't think actually try to use
the negative numbers, but let's see this.

367
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,480
Let me put the breakpoint in here.

368
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,240
Right. Let's do debugging.

369
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,120
Please enter first number.

370
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,840
So we have ten second number minus five.

371
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,000
Right. And your operator minus.

372
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,080
So now let's see where it goes.

373
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,040
I'm going to select a switch. Right.

374
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,320
So what is my operator?

375
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:23,280
My operator is minus.

376
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,680
Oh, okay. It is correct.

377
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,280
Okay, good.

378
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,040
So right.

379
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,320
Does it finds the minus?

380
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,800
Yes, it finds the minus. Right.

381
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,040
That's it finds the minus
and then it takes ten

382
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,240
and then minus and then the gain again
minus five.

383
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Minus at minus. It gives me five. Right.

384
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,400
Let me see you guys,
because I did the first one as well.

385
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,720
Let me try.

386
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,240
Okay. Yep. Minus, minus.

387
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,200
Excuse me.

388
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
You use me a plus, right?
That's why it gives me that.

389
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,200
But let me try
the first. Negative goes first

390
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,480
within the first number minus ten

391
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,440
and then second number five

392
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,640
within the you operator minus.

393
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,200
Right.

394
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,880
So my operator is minus.

395
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,040
Let's see where it goes.
It still finds it.

396
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,840
So what is the value of a value of a
is minus ten.

397
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,040
What is the value of B, Right.

398
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,560
Minus ten. Minus five. Right.

399
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,840
And then it gives me using T -15.

400
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,520
Now I think I think no, I think it does
work.

401
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,600
Correct. Right.
Yep. Minus ten. Minus five.

402
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,160
So you will give me 50 as purpose.

403
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,560
Okay.

404
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,760
So only guys only if,

405
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,360
if you here would want to go deep.

406
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,720
Right.

407
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,000
Only if here you would want to go deep.

408
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,240
There's one issue.

409
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,680
We're going to have this
there's one issue we're going to have

410
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,040
in which we can solve it. Right.

411
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,760
Let me show you guys
what could be the potential issue.

412
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,120
Right? Please enter number one.

413
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,480
For example, I'm going to enter ten

414
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,200
and I'm going to enter number two zero.

415
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,120
And I want to do the division right.

416
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,840
And I want to do the division.

417
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,320
So now, based on the math, we know, right,

418
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,760
that, hey, we cannot divide by zero.

419
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,560
Right. Will my switch case
go to the margin?

420
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,440
Yes, it will give to the match.

421
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,000
Maybe I'll go to the division
right by now.

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,840
What will happen?

423
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,640
You will try to divide ten by zero, right.

424
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,440
So now what will happen?

425
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,720
Java will run into some error. Right.

426
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,080
So it will give you some some error,
some exception.

427
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,320
Right.

428
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,360
Which we will be learning
is what you will be learning.

429
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,960
So it will tell us
that we cannot divided by zero.

430
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,840
Right.

431
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,680
So in here, this in here, what are we can
do You guys can throw additional

432
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,640
if condition if some of you dig that

433
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,080
a little bit more deeper
so you guys maybe can fix that.

434
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,720
Right.

435
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,600
So maybe inside here we can say hey,
whenever you want to divide, right.

436
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,040
We will.

437
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Whenever you want to divide,
let's first check.

438
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,880
Right. Can we throw any condition is here?

439
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
Of course, can be thrown.

440
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,040
How do we I want to say, hey, all we know
only if the number is not equal to zero.

441
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,800
Then I'm going to do division.

442
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,760
Other than that, let's throw
some let's throw some message saying,

443
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,240
Hey, can you divide by zero?

444
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,120
So. Right.

445
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
So what do we can say?

446
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,560
Hey, if we trying to do the division

447
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,920
keys, we try to do the division,
let's throw this condition in here.

448
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,160
We can say even now we're going to say
all the only

449
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,000
my be right, my second number,
not equal to zero.

450
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,480
Right only and only my second number
is not equal to zero.

451
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,960
Only then I am going to perform

452
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,240
this operation right in the other.

453
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,920
Yes, we can either do a hand up which.

454
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,800
Oh so thing
you guys still talking about that?

455
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,120
Are you

456
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,600
guys still talking
about the minus minus in there. So a

457
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,640
so in here. Right.

458
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,080
We saying hey
if the operation will be a division now

459
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,160
as soon as I find the matching cases,
what is the code I'm put in I'm putting my

460
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,600
if statement is B is not equal to zero,
then I'm going to perform division, right?

461
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Only then I'm going to perform a division.

462
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,680
Right?
If you want, you throw another value.

463
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,480
Yeah, sure, we can throw another else.

464
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,600
BLOCK And we throw the block.

465
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,320
We can throw the workers

466
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,440
in. We can see it's

467
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,640
all innocent.

468
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,000
You cannot divide us correctly.

469
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,640
You cannot divide by just put it this way

470
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,000
then.

471
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,960
Now let's see what's going to happen.

472
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,320
Now let's see what's going to happen.
Right?

473
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,960
We've done the number one
9%, the number two zero.

474
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
And then please enter your operator
division.

475
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,880
Right. So now what happens to which

476
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,400
to which

477
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,400
variable we are providing
and matching cases

478
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,400
we providing for the operator
at the current moment.

479
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,640
Operator is a division, right?

480
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,240
So what will happen when we do step into
Java finds the matching case right away.

481
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,920
Right?

482
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,800
And then once it finds the matching case
right away,

483
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,280
we know what is going to do
is going to execute this code

484
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,200
that we specified inside
from this case to this case.

485
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,800
Right.

486
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,040
So now while it enter,
it sees the if condition.

487
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,960
When we see in this condition,
Java knows, hey,

488
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,160
what I have to do, I have to check on
the condition is true or false.

489
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,000
Right. Then it checks.

490
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,040
Hey, if be not equal to zero,
no condition will be false.

491
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,360
Right?

492
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,800
Because zero is equal to zero.

493
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,360
So it will come to the else part.

494
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,560
So there's no calculation will be done.

495
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,480
It will give us the message, cannot divide
by zero, and then it will see the break.

496
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,000
It will get out from our switch. Right.

497
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,680
But this is only

498
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,000
there's

499
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
a little if you want to add that,
how do we close this?

500
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,320
We close this by having the variable
that refers to our scanner, right?

501
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
When the variable that result

502
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,440
goes to our scanner.

503
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,320
And then what
we'll do will just use the cost,

504
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,040
because that's what this is,
how we can close

505
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,720
our once you guys are learning,
once we start learning objects,

506
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,880
right, and classes,
then you guys will understand

507
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,800
what does all those things means
because eventually what we can do

508
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,480
is we can go inside all of this things,
but we cannot go right now

509
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,120
because we won't be able to understand
what's going on in here.

510
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,320
But once we start learning,
there's there's every single explanation

511
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,120
you guys can find out about
what is a print does, about what is the

512
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,360
what is this part does everything will be
because we will be able

513
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,520
to go ahead and read it.

514
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,880
Okay. Okay.

515
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,280
So that was for a switch.

516
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,440
You are
that was for the calculator using switch.

517
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
Right. Okay.

518
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,880
So can you guys show me a calculator
with the eve statement

519
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,480
this year thing you list?

520
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,720
I see mostly cases, pieces

521
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:34,000
of it right there.

522
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,920
Right.

523
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,320
Copy this.

524
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,080
Right.

525
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:51,000
So all need

526
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,120
copy or while you guys use the
this in your bill in here.

527
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,320
Let me see

528
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,320
string

529
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,120
operator on the top

530
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,400
you very quickly

531
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,000
made me right

532
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,880
so another way doing that
and using the eve statement right

533
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,120
so the same thing
bring in scanner right here we asking hey

534
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,320
can you enter two numbers in the operate
two numbers and the operator.

535
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,960
Oops.

536
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,920
Right.

537
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,760
So in here I see right
you guys capturing double

538
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,240
which probably is a good choice
to go for a double because you guys

539
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,640
want to perform a division, right?

540
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,160
You guys want to perform a division game.

541
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,040
So in here, right, Capturing two numbers
in here, capturing the operator.

542
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,760
Right.

543
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,760
The only thing in difference in here,
I see a person captures it using a string.

544
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,200
Right.

545
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Using the string, which is fun, right.

546
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,960
Which is fine.

547
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,360
And here the result, I'm assuming.

548
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:21,720
Right.

549
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,560
And initializing to the default values.

550
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,200
Right to the default values.

551
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,920
So I'm here.

552
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm saying, hey, if operators equals
two plus, then you do addition.

553
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
If it equals two minus B, doing this right

554
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,760
for all valid operators plus minus

555
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,280
multiplication division, you you listen,
you list them out, use it else

556
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,800
if if none of the condition match,
we see a wrong operator, right?

557
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,080
We say no wrong.

558
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,240
And this is so think

559
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm assuming that the

560
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,360
thing copied from someone who is it
in Turk is right So now let's see

561
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,520
let's test them right
Let's as them isn't the number one nine.

562
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,760
I'm present the number two eight in what
I want to do I want to use plus Right.

563
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,560
Oh let's see what happening here.

564
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,680
Oh, I think I only see this.

565
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,920
What happened in there?

566
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,320
Where did we get stuck?

567
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,840
Okay, guys.

568
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,000
So whenever
this type of issue comes right,

569
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,800
whenever this type of things come,
what do we have to look in here, guys?

570
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,000
Eventually we will have to learn
how to read our errors.

571
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:34,800
Right?

572
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,560
So we have to look into where
we got the issue right now.

573
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,800
This is the name of my class
that I created, Right?

574
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Homework.

575
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,720
This is the name of my class, right.

576
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,280
And my java.

577
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Right on which line? On the line.

578
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,600
Right on the line.

579
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,560
Let me click on it.

580
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,880
Let me see what happened.

581
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,960
Okay. So it got stuck in here.

582
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,840
We got stuck in here.

583
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,240
Thanks.

584
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,560
Double it says, See

585
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,720
this and I can follow nothing.

586
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,000
And then

587
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,760
boom, Because this is a fact.

588
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,520
Okay, let me do the debugging this thing
and because some of the switch statement

589
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,640
in there, we see

590
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,840
the puts next.

591
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,560
Oh, because next. But it shouldn't be.

592
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,120
Yes, there is a scanner,
I think because in here

593
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,720
it just grabs this single character.

594
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,160
That's what happens.

595
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,320
And then but this Yeah,
this can let me see.

596
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,240
Guess what happens.

597
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,080
If not, I'll just take it to different
class

598
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,840
debugging. This

599
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,200
wasn't the number one.

600
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,560
Nine wasn't the number two
eight and three operator minus.

601
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,600
Right, focus.

602
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,920
So now where we going?

603
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,400
We are going, okay, So it does shows us

604
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,760
in there, shows us a D it does solve,

605
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,120
right?

606
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,200
They chose one A queens now
creating the calculator in here.

607
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,280
Right.

608
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,800
Please enter two operators.

609
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,960
Okay now.

610
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,000
Okay. It's

611
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,000
okay. Yes.

612
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,160
Let me just take it to the other class.

613
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,720
It's it comes with the issue

614
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,920
because in here we had a scanner
and we use it next chart.

615
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,560
Right?

616
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,680
Like this.

617
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,480
We just take it to another class

618
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,680
first.

619
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,120
More confusion

620
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:09,480
is X.

621
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,720
All right, let me try to beat.

622
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,240
No, no, no.

623
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,680
This in here right?

624
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,360
We're close in a scanner.

625
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,800
We have closing the scanner.

626
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,840
The one that we opened in here. Right.

627
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
And for the
if we are having another scanner.

628
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Right.

629
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,720
It's a completely brand new scanner
is the issue.

630
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,800
Because in here, when we are going
I think I've got explaining to you guys

631
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,240
what's the difference
between Nixon? Next line

632
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
and what happens in there?

633
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,200
You know,
let me just go debugging in here.

634
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,960
It's okay.

635
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,000
Let me do running here.

636
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,280
Please enter to number and the operator

637
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,160
right to number nine eight
and the upgrade minus.

638
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,800
Right.

639
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,840
So it gives me one. Right.

640
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,520
It gives me one.

641
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,600
So now why in here probably

642
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,640
go for a
double was a better choice, right.

643
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,560
Where for a double go is a better choice.

644
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,560
If I want to go for, I don't know, 89
and then second number

645
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,200
67 and I want to do the division right.

646
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,600
So what will happen
because we're using double right.

647
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,080
That's why
we are getting all those decimals, right.

648
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,200
If I'm going in here

649
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
for the case.

650
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,720
Right, If I'm going to for kids,
what will happen in the number one

651
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,720
8967 division?

652
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,280
Right.

653
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,560
So what I'm going to give, I'm
going to get only one right

654
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,680
then you guys are ready.

655
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,280
And that's why we get in only one
because we are working

656
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,960
with a integer type of values
and integer type of values.

657
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,120
You can load
all those decimal points, right?

658
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,680
So that's why in here you will get one.

659
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,240
In here you get one point,
whatever, whatever, whatever.

660
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,760
Right.

661
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,920
So that's why probably probably
for calculator if, if you guys want to go

662
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,040
more into details probably using a
double will be will be a good choice.

663
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,240
Right. Will be a good choice.

664
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,160
All right in here guys.

665
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,440
In here. Actually, there's

666
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,480
that you see

667
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,560
right. Oh,

668
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,320
when it comes to integers, guys, integers,

669
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,680
there's just don't hold any any,
any values.

670
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,640
So I there is no,
even the question happens

671
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,840
because integers cannot hold, cannot hold

672
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,280
those decimals in know hold those this

673
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,760
well you can think of.

674
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,440
Yeah that's it. Just corral that change
you can think of.

675
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,120
All right.

676
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,880
So here
maybe I would capture this value number

677
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,440
eight in number number
B, I probably would capture it inside

678
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,240
and can

679
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,480
what what you see right now guys Right.

680
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,040
What we we talking about the switch right.

681
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,200
So we said okay whenever exercise you do
is this switch

682
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,680
exactly the same you can do with that
if right.

683
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,600
The only difference
what happening here. Right.

684
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,520
The only difference
what happened in here on the switch

685
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,200
you guys work in with the char inside.

686
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,840
If you guys I see you guys
working with the string right?

687
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,760
But good of you.

688
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,360
They try in here.
Of course we can use the char, right?

689
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,000
Of course we can use the char
if you want to compare chars.

690
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,680
Right.

691
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,000
So what do you guys would use?

692
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,200
You would just use those
relational operation like you could have.

693
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,720
Say if operator equals right
equals equals to the last.

694
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,320
Right.

695
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,880
So but both solutions are good solution.

696
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,920
So you get c whatever done with the switch
got to be done with that else.

697
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,400
Right. Would it be damaged because

698
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,480
in this situation probably

699
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,440
if you really look I probably would go
for a switch case as well.

700
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,040
I would probably go for a switch.

701
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
It's like it's going there.

702
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,560
It's it's easy to read also, right?

703
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,240
You guys have to think of
where readability becomes easier.

704
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,000
Remember when I told you this,
you will be working with other automation

705
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,760
engineers, right?

706
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,720
So you guys want to make sure
that whatever code you are writing right,

707
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,960
whatever you do,
your writing, it's understandable

708
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,120
by you and others, right?

709
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,440
Can we do a double use?

710
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,880
We can do that double because
remember this in this situation, right?

711
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,480
You're variable your variable that you are

712
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,280
providing matching cases is of which type.

713
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:48,240
This variables, those of which type,
the variable of the tri type.

714
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,760
Right. You're not looking a case.

715
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,400
A case B you looking at what you looking
at the operator in here right.

716
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,920
Only inside you performing the operation.

717
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,720
But that's just regular math operations.

718
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:05,000
So we said inside switch
we can work with integer chars

719
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,080
strings.

720
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,480
Right.

721
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,600
And then by and then

722
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,880
short. Right.

723
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,160
So all of variable is of that char
type, right.

724
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,840
Yeah.

725
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,360
But we are not,
I'm not, I'm not putting the switch,

726
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm not putting A or B right this way
if it will be a double it doesn't work.

727
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,720
What is my switch is about.

728
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,880
My switch is about providing the match
values for a char type of variable.

729
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,120
So even if I'm going

730
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,080
to change to a double in here, right,
let me change it to double,

731
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,880
which was changed to the next double

732
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,880
or change to level

733
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,080
and I'm going to explain it so

734
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,080
you are going to change anything?

735
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,720
That's right.

736
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:59,120
It's not going to change anything.

737
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,120
So we're at the
you have to multiplied by B,

738
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,320
maybe that and we will happen.

739
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,160
Oh, okay.

740
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,480
So now let's see, guys,
What happened? Yep, that's it.

741
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,880
That's a good point. Right?

742
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,440
So you were not
do not catch it right away.

743
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,000
Right.

744
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,920
So any time you guys have the issue right,
when we have an idea.

745
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,200
Right.

746
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,560
It's always always
compiler is a great, great friend of ours.

747
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,280
So what now compiler tells you here right.

748
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,000
It tells you that you should say
cannot convert from double to the integer.

749
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,040
Right. So why?

750
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Because when you're doing

751
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,960
some operation
on the double type of values, your result

752
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,120
or it also should be a double right

753
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,400
here.

754
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,160
That's all right.

755
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,960
So why did not affect that?

756
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,120
Because this is just a regular.

757
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,920
Could we please inside
my switch is still looking at which

758
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,880
variable my switches to looking
at the variable of the chart type on which

759
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,800
and then present the number one, two

760
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,520
and three.

761
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,320
Number two three division right here.

762
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,200
So we getting three, three, three, four.

763
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,640
Because of that, probably having a double
will be a better choice.

764
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,680
Better choice
because you doing it at my operation.

765
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,280
Okay.

766
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,640
When the double wouldn't work,
which scenario.

767
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,400
The double would not work if right now
inside the switch you try to provide

768
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,280
a values for this variable
for the variable E Right.

769
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,280
For the variable, that's when you switch
is going to complete, right?

770
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,720
That's where you your will complete
because hey, what are you switch

771
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,280
and you trying to switch a value
that has a variable that holds a double

772
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,720
check, a valid that's
when here you going to say

773
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,960
that cannot switch
on the value of type of double.

774
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,320
Right.

775
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,800
So but as long as it's

776
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,040
char type of variable and the good

777
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,840
where it does not work
only if you're switching

778
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,920
long double fluid

779
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,920
where inside inside your switch of and you

780
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,120
locaters that was

781
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,240
or you could switch it A or B
even if you go and to put this right

782
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,240
because they are double
type of values it's not going to work

783
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,240
even if you would actually never Trevor's
counter but listening to work.

784
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,080
Okay right.

785
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,520
That was was our homework right.

786
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,120
That was a that was a for a homework.

787
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,960
Right.

788
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,880
So if you get confused, try
to debug your code, try to debug your code

789
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,760
and see how your code executes.

790
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,520
And that's all actually does Also
will help you clear a lot of things to

791
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,760
write this.

792
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,720
And thus in that last class
what we started,

793
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:09,920
we started with the loops,
okay loops in Java.

794
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:14,080
But I mean because if you are entering
minus two and then if is doing

795
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,280
the negative upgrade, it becomes minus
minus two, it will become plus, right.

796
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,240
And then it will be minus eight plus two.

797
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,360
That's why it shows minus six.

798
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,480
Okay.

799
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,280
You see if you if you are entering Right,
if you want to enter

800
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,120
first number you said you enter minus

801
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,320
minus. So

802
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,520
you can

803
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,440
minus eight.

804
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,280
Right.

805
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,640
A second number minus two and you
operate is minus then what it becomes.

806
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,960
And because minus eight minus minus
two equals

807
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,360
two plus,
that's why it gives you minus six

808
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,000
gives you minus.

809
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,840
All right.

810
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,000
The minor. We just cannot use double.

811
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,160
We cannot use double where inside
your here inside a switch If your variable

812
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:22,280
will be of the double type of the float
type you cannot put next to the switch,

813
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,920
you cannot sit next to the switch.

814
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,720
Okay, let's let's let's talk about
let's talk about loops.

815
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,560
Right. Let's talk about loops.

816
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,520
Okay.

817
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,240
Let's talk about loops.

818
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:48,880
So why do we need loops in Java, in

819
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,680
okay, so we use in loops.

820
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,600
So whenever there will be a situation,
right, Whenever there will be a situation

821
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,480
when we want to repeat
this same block of code.

822
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,120
Right.

823
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,960
What do we want
to repeat the same block of code Java sees

824
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,480
as, Hey,
don't write the same code over and over

825
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,560
to eliminate the code redundancy, right
to eliminate the code code redundancy

826
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,120
and you repeat this pain block of windows
says, Hey, go ahead and use loops.

827
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,960
Right? Go ahead and use loops.

828
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,240
So what the loops will do
loops will repeat

829
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,920
with this same block of code,
whatever you put inside the body.

830
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,160
Right.

831
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,080
What do we put inside the body and
number of times based on that condition.

832
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,920
Right. Based on the condition.

833
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,760
And then yesterday,
look how many loops we have in

834
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:59,480
Java, guys.

835
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,560
There's a
for loops. What are those loops? Gates

836
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,760
We have four.

837
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,080
We have while we have do while

838
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,320
infinite, Infinite can be infinite,

839
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,000
they can be either for a loop or why loop.

840
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,200
So infinity
just means non stop in loop right?

841
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,240
Or we have advanced
for those for loops that we have.

842
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:27,960
Right?

843
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,920
Unless we start looking with a simple
a loop.

844
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,480
Right. So let's

845
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,240
while little things x right
so will be the syntax for our why

846
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,480
look this
what is the syntax for a while loop

847
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,320
so we have a key word Well and in here.

848
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,920
Right in here.

849
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,080
What do we have inside the parentheses

850
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,520
commission.

851
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,640
Right. We also have a bowling condition.

852
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,480
Bowling condition. Right.

853
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,080
And it's it works almost similar
as if statement.

854
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,280
Right is a similar statement.

855
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,960
And then in here
or to repeat, right click to

856
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,200
put repeat.

857
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,520
Right. So

858
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,080
the way that our well works, our well

859
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,480
repeats block of code

860
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,320
as long as what
as long as the condition is true Right.

861
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,800
So your Java while executing
your code is is while so it knows okay

862
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,280
I have to repeat, repeat, repeat repeat
how long I'll be repeated

863
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,280
as long as my condition is right,
as long as my condition is true

864
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,240
and yesterday one of the example
that we started right here.

865
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,240
What if I want to say right, I want to say
good morning three times, right?

866
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,440
We said I want to say good morning
three times.

867
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:19,240
How are we going to say
good morning three times?

868
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,480
We will be adding increment decrement.
But what?

869
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,960
Which things do I need right now?

870
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,320
Just say good morning
three times and four.

871
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,040
Now I know only look,
I know only while loop, right?

872
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,280
I don't know any other loops
I know only while loop.

873
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,600
Once we look into all of them
then we will decide

874
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,240
in which situation we'll go for four
and each station will go for a while.

875
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,320
But for now you
guys only know one, right? So

876
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,680
I have to have a variable, right?

877
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,840
I have to have a variable, right?

878
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,000
I have to have a variable.

879
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,400
And let's say I'm going to put one right

880
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,240
and then off there
I have a variable, right?

881
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,280
I have that variable.

882
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,760
Then I'm going to bring my while he
what right while

883
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,800
and have the condition.

884
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,760
If the condition will be matching, then
I'm going to open up the block of code.

885
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,480
Right. I'm going to open up.

886
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,400
This is the body of your while.

887
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,360
Now what will be the condition?

888
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,840
I want to say three times. Good morning.

889
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,000
It means I have to make my condition
to be true three times.

890
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:22,800
Right?

891
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,560
So I can say times is what

892
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,080
was it less or equal than three?

893
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:34,600
Right.

894
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,560
Let's where equal Then we will then be.

895
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,480
Then we will be saying right, I'm
going to write system

896
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,760
that are that print line of them
going to write a shorter is in line

897
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,160
and I'm going to say
good morning in good morning.

898
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,040
Anything else I have to add this?

899
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,440
Anything else

900
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,800
Now what I have to do,
I have to add the incremental issue.

901
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,320
Right.

902
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,600
What's going to happen
if I'm not going to have

903
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:18,160
the implementation,
my loop will become infinite, right?

904
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,840
My loop will become infinite. Why?

905
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,000
Because variable got initialized here,

906
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,960
but my code will be stuck
between this cycle, right?

907
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,080
That's where my code will be stuck.

908
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,360
That will be stuck between this cycle.

909
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,600
You will be running,
running, running. Right.

910
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,880
So that's why inside the loop body
what we need, we need the variable, right?

911
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:43,760
We need this variable
that will be incrementing my

912
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,240
my that will be incrementing my variable.

913
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:52,320
And by incrementing my variable
I will be able to change my condition.

914
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:52,760
Right?

915
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:57,120
I will be changing the condition
that's now all while works.

916
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,160
And I hope you guys look at this slides.

917
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,880
Right.

918
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,440
So we already seen hey,
whenever we want to repeat black ops code,

919
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,120
we'll go for loops because you repeating
the same lines over and over 20 times.

920
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,440
That's not a very right approach. Right?

921
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:13,800
Right.

922
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,280
And as we said, loops are exist in
everybody

923
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,840
in everybody in every programing language.

924
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,520
Right?

925
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,160
So what then? Loops.

926
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,400
They run a certain

927
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,560
block of code. Right.

928
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,640
Piece of code multiple times. Right.

929
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,160
When do we use it to perform
the repetitive execution?

930
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,200
Why do you use it
To eliminate the redundancy.

931
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,600
Right. And also, it's time
consuming, right?

932
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,200
Instead of here,
what if I want to do right here?

933
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,200
What if I want you repeat this
block of code 300 times, right?

934
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,920
So what I do right now,
I can just change the condition now.

935
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,320
My code will run 300 times. Right.

936
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,440
Very quick and very easy.

937
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,480
Instead of repeating one morning
300 times.

938
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:01,200
Right.

939
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,960
So right in here, different type of loops.

940
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,240
And this is the order that you guys will
be learning loops, right?

941
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,840
So what is the loop statement?

942
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,160
Do it allow us to execute
group of statements multiple times.

943
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,240
So this is our way a loop right.

944
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,840
So of while loop always remember this
while loop first checks the condition.

945
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,400
Why? Because after well, what do we have?

946
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,440
We do specify a condition,
right before we are able

947
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,520
to enter the block of code, the loop body.

948
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,000
We always, always check in the condition.

949
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,280
We always check in the condition.

950
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,760
And if the condition is true,

951
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,760
we allowed to go inside the block of code
inside the loop body.

952
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,920
If the current condition is false,
we are not able to interpret.

953
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,080
If the condition is true,
I'm going to enter my loop by

954
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,200
write my block of code with the condition
is false.

955
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,760
I cannot write

956
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,840
this.

957
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,000
So you had some tasks, right?

958
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,960
You had a you had some just

959
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,320
preparing numbers from 1 to 100.

960
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:04,960
Okay.

961
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:14,240
So did you guys use increment
or decrement in here?

962
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,880
Increment?

963
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,760
What about in here

964
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,640
in your decrement.

965
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:20,800
Right.

966
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,680
Because you're starting from the highest
value going to the smallest value.

967
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,280
Right.

968
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,600
I think even numbers
we are locked in here, right.

969
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,600
I think we looked in the class,
but we can look one more time.

970
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,760
Right. Even an odd will be very similar.

971
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,880
But there's just one little thing
I want to show you this scale to show you.

972
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,240
Look, meet up with this
and you guys, you'll send me

973
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,440
your code right?

974
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:55,320
Your code homework.

975
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,760
So as we look less
class goes right as we look last class,

976
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,560
this assignment code could be done
two different ways, right?

977
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,760
Two different ways. Okay. So

978
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,200
the easiest way, right?

979
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,000
The easiest way. Probably. Right?

980
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,960
Probably would be using an increment,

981
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:25,200
right?

982
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:25,760
Right.

983
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,160
This is probably our easiest way. Right.

984
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,320
So what we have, we it

985
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,400
we started from 20 right.

986
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,720
Then specify our condition. Right.

987
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,000
So starting from 20
will be printing all the way to 100

988
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,120
and then we'll be printing the print
in the value of variable

989
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,440
and then doing increment nation by two.

990
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,000
Right.

991
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,640
So what I'm going to run here,
that's what I get.

992
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,920
That's what I get.

993
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,760
So all the values,
all the even numbers from 20 to 100,

994
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,880
Right. Dude, I completed a task.

995
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,440
I completed the task.

996
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,600
And there is another way.

997
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,640
There is another way.

998
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,840
How is it that we can do it right

999
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,360
not to

1000
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,400
send on

1001
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,800
a wave so we can do it another way,
but using our

1002
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
if statement. Right.

1003
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,880
But using our if statement

1004
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,600
right.

1005
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,880
So another way what we say hey,

1006
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,240
I can have my variable right
I can have my variable.

1007
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,520
Then this will be my condition.

1008
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:44,920
Right?

1009
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,840
The same condition all the way to 100.

1010
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,120
The only thing right now
what do we throw in here?

1011
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,600
We throw our statement, right?

1012
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,120
We throw our statement and we say, Hey,

1013
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,960
I'm going
to print the value of my variable.

1014
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,880
See all you.

1015
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,120
Only if this condition
will be matched right.

1016
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,120
And in which situation
this condition will be matched

1017
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,440
only when my numbers is equally divisible
by zero.

1018
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,040
Right.

1019
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,200
And now let's try to run it.

1020
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,280
Let's try to run it

1021
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,640
normal.

1022
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,000
And so now what are we getting?

1023
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,320
We get an exact exact the same answer.

1024
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,280
Right.

1025
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,360
Well, either use an implementation by two

1026
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,680
or throw into each condition
what it give me give me 100.

1027
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,200
Right.

1028
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,320
Give me 100. Right.

1029
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,520
So now this it's a very, very important.

1030
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,240
Right.

1031
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,360
It's very important that

1032
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,960
you guys put the increment right. Why?

1033
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,800
Because only by putting the increment

1034
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,600
we can make this condition become false
at some point.

1035
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,200
Right.

1036
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,880
So now, guys,
I want you to look at this screen.

1037
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,080
I want you to pay attention.

1038
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,840
So what I'm going to do right now, this
what I'm going to do,

1039
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,320
I'm going to pull it.

1040
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,560
I'm going to take this instrumentation

1041
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,760
and I'm going to place it inside here.

1042
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:18,080
So now, guys, by looking into this code,
by looking in this quote, can you guess?

1043
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,000
Tell me what will be my output?

1044
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,480
Will my output change?

1045
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,800
Will my output
still going to be this same or

1046
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,440
I'm going to get some errors
or I'm not going to get any errors?

1047
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,760
Tell me, guys,
what will be the output by looking at

1048
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,320
this code, then change

1049
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,240
20. Okay.

1050
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,560
One output

1051
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,960
20. Let

1052
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:57,880
me put another statement in here.

1053
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:05,600
All of this

1054
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,520
me wanted same

1055
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,680
only one time just 20

1056
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:33,200
saying okay, okay people
now they're saying 20.

1057
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,320
Okay so with this same
okay I see some people say same for people

1058
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,440
that say 20 time
you guys are going to print one time

1059
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,120
and Don or one time an infinite

1060
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,000
and then a done done nothing else.

1061
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,920
Okay, let's see, guys.

1062
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,120
Let's see now.

1063
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:04,400
Done.

1064
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,320
Okay, now, guys,
I don't want you to run it right.

1065
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,400
I don't want you to run it.
Then look at the output.

1066
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,880
I want you to analyze.

1067
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,000
I want you to analyze it. Right.

1068
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,600
So you guys will be telling me, right?

1069
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,920
So we are

1070
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,120
so we are not looking at the previous one.

1071
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:26,240
This is the only this is the only where
we're looking right now, Right?

1072
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,920
It's only now here.

1073
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,240
We know we declared in the variable.

1074
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,480
It's right in the variable here.

1075
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,600
Java goes up to the bottom, right.

1076
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,720
It runs the code
until it C is the statement or now

1077
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,240
until is going to see the loop.

1078
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,480
Right now Java sees you while it knows.

1079
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,200
Okay, while it's a keyword.

1080
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,680
So what does a keyword means?

1081
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,160
In my language
it means I have to repeat block of.

1082
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,600
Okay, cool.

1083
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,560
So now what is the value of C guys?

1084
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,600
What is the value of C

1085
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,280
one at the current moment?

1086
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,520
At the current moment it is 20.

1087
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,640
Okay, 20 is a 20 less than 100 condition

1088
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,440
truffles.

1089
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,840
Condition is true. Right
Condition is true.

1090
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,280
Condition is passed.

1091
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,720
I can go inside my little body.

1092
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,240
I'm going inside.

1093
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,880
Tell me guys,
from where my little body ends,

1094
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,480
on which line my loop ends,

1095
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,000
biting my closes the block of good

1096
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,160
meaning. Yes.

1097
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,800
This will be able

1098
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:43,920
so that's

1099
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:51,600
it ends up w it ends at 33.

1100
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,240
It's 33. Right.

1101
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,600
So this is where my little buddy starts

1102
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,520
this is where my little buddy ends

1103
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,600
right at ends of the line. 33.

1104
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,360
No. Who said condition was true?

1105
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,960
Okay, cool condition is true.

1106
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,800
Now, when condition is true,
I'm able to enter the loop body.

1107
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,440
Right. So now, as soon as Java enters,

1108
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,720
it is ease, right?

1109
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,240
It's just. It knows. Okay,
What does it even use?

1110
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,800
I have to check the condition.

1111
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,560
Okay, no problem.

1112
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,800
C right.

1113
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,760
Which holds the value of 20.

1114
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,120
What two? Right is the condition Truffles.

1115
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:35,560
This action

1116
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,360
is true.

1117
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:37,920
Okay.

1118
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,720
One condition is true.

1119
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:43,240
I am able to enter my if statement. Right.

1120
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,320
I'm able to enter my if statements enter.

1121
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:51,400
And as soon as I enter if statement
I have this statement C's out right.

1122
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,240
I have. This is out.
So what is the value of C guys?

1123
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,360
What is the value of C

1124
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,120
20? Right?

1125
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,680
At this point it's below 24
when you print it.

1126
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,760
No problem. Right.

1127
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,800
I am printing it one time.

1128
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,840
I'm printing it right one time.

1129
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,360
Okay, then what happens this?

1130
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:16,960
Then what happens?

1131
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,480
Implementation happens.

1132
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,840
My C becomes 21.

1133
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,600
Okay, but what happens after that is

1134
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,240
So then when my code goes bad guys,
where am I?

1135
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,320
What goes back?

1136
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,440
You will go back to the line 23.

1137
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,160
But look, guys,
this is where my F body started.

1138
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,760
This is where my F ended, right?

1139
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,360
So then once that condition was executed,

1140
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,320
your code will exhibit the if statement.

1141
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,280
Right?

1142
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,680
And there's no more lines for the wire.

1143
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,200
Then it will go back to the while.

1144
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,280
Right? Because it cannot stop by itself.

1145
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:12,400
Now, what is the value of C guys?

1146
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,680
A value of C right now?

1147
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,800
21 Right.

1148
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,240
The value of C right now is 21.

1149
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:27,200
21 is the condition truffles.

1150
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,640
Condition is still true.

1151
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,920
Can I go inside my wild body? Yes,
I can go.

1152
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,920
This is where my well body starts.

1153
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,560
This is where my wild body ends.

1154
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,600
As soon as it enter my wild body,

1155
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,560
I'm seeing the e statement right
Jarvis's eve.

1156
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:50,800
Okay, now I will check
what is the value of gets.

1157
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:56,120
The value of c is 2121 mod two

1158
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:01,000
is there any reminder?

1159
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,560
So now condition is false, right?

1160
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,920
So now my condition will become false.

1161
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:14,480
When my condition is false,
can I enter the body?

1162
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,880
No, I cannot enter the body.

1163
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:21,400
And where my f body starts,
my body starts from here.

1164
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,160
It ends in here.

1165
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,640
So if I cannot enter my body
where my plot will go.

1166
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:32,640
Guys, now

1167
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,720
my how it even is the eve.

1168
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,960
It can spend the eve, no problem. Right?

1169
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,960
Because It cannot do right.

1170
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,080
So now what? What happened in here?

1171
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,280
Because my C right,
Because my C is equal to 21.

1172
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:46,720
Right.

1173
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,280
I need you to pay attention
this to where the body starts.

1174
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:50,920
Right?

1175
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,240
Condition for a while was true
because it's 21.

1176
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,680
21 is less than 100 now.

1177
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,480
As soon as we emptied Jarvis's
eve value of C

1178
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,560
is 2121 more to go.

1179
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,320
There is a reminder, right?

1180
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,320
There is a reminder here.

1181
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,240
So this condition will be false.

1182
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:13,040
When condition is false,
I cannot enter my body.

1183
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,880
This entire blog that's ignored

1184
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,160
now when your java cannot enter
is no problem.

1185
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,920
Now you're could it's still where you
could you could was not able to enter E

1186
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,640
but your code is in here
you code is still inside the world body.

1187
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,000
This your code is still inside
a world body and then what happens?

1188
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,760
You code will go back
guys you will go back.

1189
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,800
Java cannot spell by itself.

1190
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,480
So now what happens?
It shows the condition.

1191
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,840
What is the value of C?

1192
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,120
A value of C still 21.

1193
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,240
It did not give increment
that why it did not get incremented

1194
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,280
because we were not able to enter
the eve body.

1195
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,000
Right.

1196
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,880
So now 21 is the condition is true?

1197
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,440
Yes, condition is true.

1198
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,320
I'm still going inside my wild body.

1199
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,040
When I go inside my wild body,
I'm chicken.

1200
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,960
Hey C what is the value of C?

1201
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,520
The value of season
21, 21 month to condition is still false.

1202
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,000
Condition is still false.

1203
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,760
I'm still not able to go inside.

1204
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,360
It means I'm not able to print

1205
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,360
and then I cannot increment.

1206
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:29,440
And then your code goes back again
to the while it's still 21.

1207
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,560
So now what will happen?

1208
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,880
We are printing 20 only one time,

1209
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,840
but then my code does not stop my code
continuously, continuously running.

1210
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,680
Right. So let's put into debugging, right?

1211
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,720
Let's put into debugging mode.

1212
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,880
I see.

1213
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,920
What is the value of C?

1214
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,080
The value of C is 20. Right?

1215
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:52,440
Okay.

1216
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,160
Cool condition is true for a while now.

1217
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,800
Condition it will be true for
if if condition is true for

1218
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,560
if I can go inside
and print in C and then what I'm doing

1219
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,840
I'm incrementing right I'm incrementing.

1220
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,320
Okay, fine.

1221
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,200
Now I finish with the eve,

1222
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,320
I'm going back to my
Well now what is the value of C analysis?

1223
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,520
2121 is still less than 100.

1224
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,320
Okay, now I'll go inside my if statement

1225
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:22,480
21 more two condition is false.

1226
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,760
I cannot go inside the body.

1227
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,600
He is my where my f body.

1228
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:32,880
So it means now I will never ever be able
to enter my eve block.

1229
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,320
And now because I put the increment
inside guys.

1230
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:41,640
So now what I'm going to get, I'm
going to get my infinite loop.

1231
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,640
I'm not going to see any output, but

1232
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:48,080
my loop is continuously running this.

1233
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,720
You don't see it, but it's running, right?

1234
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,400
So now what we got because we placed

1235
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,160
a we placed our increment

1236
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,440
inside the wrong block,
inside the wrong block, right.

1237
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:05,160
So that's why now what we have,
we still have our code running

1238
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,800
because when there was still
did not reach this line. Why?

1239
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,440
Because our code gets stuck
somewhere in here, but it keeps looping,

1240
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,320
looking, looping
because the value of C is still 21.

1241
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,760
It's never get changed.

1242
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,880
So we got an infinite loop, right?

1243
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,520
So that's why it's important

1244
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,720
as always, always pay attention
where you put in your increment.

1245
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,920
If you are using the while, right?

1246
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,280
So that's why you increment
your increment.

1247
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:34,080
Always, always
should be at the end of your well body.

1248
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:34,960
Right.

1249
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,200
This is where your well
body starts, this is where your world body

1250
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,120
ends, right.

1251
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:44,480
So you have to make sure
you always have this increment only, only

1252
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,960
because if you're not going
to have the increment at the end,

1253
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:53,280
then your implementation
will depend on the if statement.

1254
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:53,880
Okay.

1255
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,480
Yes. Implementation
still have to be inside them.

1256
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,800
Of course.

1257
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,280
Thank.

1258
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:04,680
Think.

1259
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:07,960
Okay.

1260
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,040
I hope that that's a little thing
that I wanted to show you that

1261
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:15,120
it is difference if you place it here,
if you place it here and of course

1262
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:18,520
if you place it outside the loop
of course this the difference

1263
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:34,440
in why

1264
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:39,600
we need a 25 and 21.

1265
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:40,800
You want

1266
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,280
this curly braces 25
and 27 We're identifying that.

1267
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,280
What do you mean?

1268
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,240
This is blocker.

1269
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,120
This is block of code that belongs to the
if part.

1270
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:51,600
Right?

1271
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:56,080
This block of code that belongs to the
if right this is fairly braces right.

1272
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,120
Always highlighting this this curly braces
identifies the opening of my

1273
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,840
while loop right
and this is closing right this is closing

1274
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:09,400
so this is our curly

1275
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,120
braces that identifies
that this is body for our okay

1276
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,200
so all eat

1277
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,040
this if you don't want it put it.

1278
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:19,680
Yes, that's fine.

1279
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,400
Remember, guys, we already look into this

1280
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,280
that if you have only one statement,
you don't have to put it.

1281
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:28,080
But I always, always suggest you to put it
because you just

1282
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,560
visually guys, easy for you
to read the code.

1283
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,440
Right?

1284
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,560
By looking at your code, you can read it.

1285
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,920
You can understand, right?

1286
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,040
What do you have to have it?

1287
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,640
No, you don't really have to have it,
but it's preferable to have it

1288
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:42,400
most of the time.

1289
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,800
You guys will see that people,
even if it's a one line tool

1290
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,200
as people are still
people are still putting those,

1291
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:53,080
okay.

1292
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:56,400
Okay, guys, I hope I hope you guys ready
when we are going to get to the

1293
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:57,760
nested loops.

1294
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,400
Okay.

1295
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,040
So for now, it should be easier, right?

1296
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,880
This should be easier. Okay.

1297
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:06,680
All right.

1298
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,720
So let's do one thing.

1299
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,240
Is today, of course,
we're going to look into more loops.

1300
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,160
What? For example? Right?

1301
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,800
For example,
what if I'm going to have this task?

1302
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:24,680
I ask,
what if I'm going to have this task?

1303
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,840
I want to have it, for example. Right.

1304
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:32,040
What I would like to do, right,
what I would like to do, right.

1305
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,920
I want to ask. Right.

1306
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,040
And it goes simple, right?

1307
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,120
I want to ask a user

1308
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,400
to name

1309
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,200
his or her name, whatever

1310
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,800
their name, write their name

1311
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,000
and for example, age.

1312
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,600
I don't know. This might five times.

1313
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,320
I like.

1314
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:00,000
So five times now you have to think, okay,

1315
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,600
would you ask the name
right To ask the name?

1316
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,280
What do we need?

1317
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:15,720
What do we need to ask in the.

1318
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:17,880
We will need this scanner, right?

1319
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,880
We will need this scanner
and then to make it

1320
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:25,080
five times to repeat the block of code
five times.

1321
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:25,640
What do we need?

1322
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:31,360
This. We.

1323
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,680
We'll need our loop, right?

1324
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:35,800
We will need our loop.

1325
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,400
So I have you probably a little bit ahead.

1326
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,120
So for now, we don't know any other look.

1327
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,400
We just know, Right?

1328
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,160
Okay, so now you have to think, okay,
I need to have two things.

1329
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:47,360
I need to have scanner
and then some piece of code

1330
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,760
I have to put inside the loop.

1331
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:52,880
Right now, you will just have
to understand which piece of code.

1332
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,280
Right. And remember guessing.

1333
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:57,160
The task is a little bit is a little bit
too long.

1334
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,520
Right. You just do it one time first.

1335
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,960
Okay? Find it right.

1336
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,640
I will need a scanner.

1337
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,320
Scanner.

1338
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:07,480
Scanner equals new scanner.

1339
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,040
Right system.

1340
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,720
Then the very

1341
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,200
import our scanner
and then I'm going to states is all

1342
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,840
we can say.

1343
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,320
Please

1344
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,160
enter your name and age right.

1345
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,600
For example, little captured all together.

1346
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:28,280
Right.

1347
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:31,160
So now to capture the name,

1348
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:36,040
to capture the name or we will opt system
that out to capture the name

1349
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,560
or will you scan that next right

1350
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,720
we will store it inside the name

1351
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,240
and then we will capture the

1352
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:49,120
H right integer H will equal.

1353
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,640
And then next thing to enter

1354
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,320
integer.

1355
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:59,120
And then we will build out right.

1356
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,680
Your name is and let's under name plus.

1357
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,120
And you are and let's

1358
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,640
h and plus

1359
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,960
years old right?

1360
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,280
Most of

1361
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,680
with a simple code that we already know.

1362
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,080
Right So we have in this scanner

1363
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,000
we the instruction right
then we want to capture the name.

1364
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,680
We captured the H and then we
and then we just print, right?

1365
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:34,920
So we test our code.
Please enter your name.

1366
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,680
My name is John.

1367
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,680
I am 45 years ago.

1368
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,200
Your name is John.
And you are 45 years old, right?

1369
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,920
That's my code work.

1370
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,760
Yes, my code word. Right.

1371
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,680
I was able to capture a username
and the age, right?

1372
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,240
And I printed up the only thing.

1373
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,400
What happens? Right.

1374
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,080
My quote was executed only one time.

1375
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,200
Only one time. Right.

1376
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,520
So now we're saying,
hey, whenever you want to

1377
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,200
a same

1378
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,200
block of code, we can use loop, right?

1379
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,960
We can use language. So now tell me this.

1380
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,880
We do this thing,
we should start our loop.

1381
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,240
I want you to just analyze. Right.

1382
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,360
We need to capture I want to ask the user
five times and I want to print it.

1383
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,360
So from which line should start

1384
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,880
from the line 19.

1385
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,760
From the line 17

1386
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:43,000
1317,

1387
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,720
19, 13,

1388
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,360
13 after scanner

1389
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:56,760
15, 13, 20.

1390
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,240
But how are we going to
how we going to before

1391
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:06,120
this is up 13.

1392
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,280
So now let's do this right.

1393
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,600
I want to repeat block of good Gary
I need a loop.

1394
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,800
So now would you block of code
I want to repeat

1395
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,640
do you guys just want to print

1396
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,240
user name and age five times
or you actually guys want to ask

1397
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:37,520
and you guys actually want captured
five times?

1398
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,640
We want to capture it five times, right?

1399
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,960
I don't want
just print out five times, right?

1400
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:47,160
What I want to do, I want to ask the user
their name and age five times, right?

1401
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,240
Yes. We are asking,
I don't want just Ukraine unit.

1402
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,520
Your name is John and you 45 years old.

1403
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,160
I want to capture five different names.

1404
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,520
I want you capture five different ages.

1405
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,200
Right.

1406
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,000
So now that's
where you have to think, okay, which

1407
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,840
block of good I want to repeat, right?

1408
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,120
Do we need to have five scanners, guys?

1409
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:16,240
Do we need to have five scanners
to capture the name?

1410
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,240
No, we don't need to.

1411
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,680
We know that one
scanner can do a job. Right?

1412
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,200
So then this line does not need
to be repeated.

1413
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,040
Cool.

1414
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,200
This line does not need to be repeated.

1415
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:33,040
Do we need to repeat this line?

1416
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,880
I think we should write it
because we have to give an instruction.

1417
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,800
So it means right? This line.

1418
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,160
I want you repeat this line

1419
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,520
because capturing the name and the age
I have to repeat,

1420
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,600
and this one I have to repeat,
then what part of code I have to repeat.

1421
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,560
I want you repeat this piece of code.

1422
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,480
Right?

1423
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,840
So then whenever whatever the quote you
want, you repeat what, we will have to do.

1424
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,280
We will have to place it inside the body.

1425
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,160
Inside the body. Right.

1426
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,120
So for now, we just know while.

1427
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,120
So what do we all do?

1428
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:26,520
What do I guys, first, what do I need it?

1429
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,920
Okay, sure. I can have my while.

1430
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,000
Okay, well,
this is where my body will start.

1431
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,800
This is where my well, body
will end, right?

1432
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,400
So you identify the wild body.

1433
01:15:38,520 --> 01:16:03,880
Now, what is the my condition?

1434
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,800
H No, if you look my condition, I'm
going to define in my H Right.

1435
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,320
So what is my condition?

1436
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,720
I Just wanted to say five times.
So now what?

1437
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:15,960
I have to make sure
that I have my condition.

1438
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,680
That is,
I have to make this condition to be true.

1439
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:19,360
Five points.

1440
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:19,840
Right.

1441
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,560
Well, now that way we learned
we need a variable, right?

1442
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,920
We need a variable.

1443
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,960
So let's initialize it right.

1444
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,720
Let me put it five ways.
Let me put it five.

1445
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:32,040
So now how can I make this condition
right?

1446
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:34,640
How can I make the condition
to be true five times

1447
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,280
based on the value of

1448
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:41,640
my I, I should be What

1449
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,000
I want my condition
with the current value.

1450
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,920
Let's say I did not put one.
I put five this.

1451
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,840
Can I put five? Yes, I can put five.

1452
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,880
Can I put 50? Yes. Can put 50.

1453
01:16:53,880 --> 01:17:03,600
How do I make my condition to be true
five times.

1454
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,840
Okay, we can go back to five.

1455
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:09,360
This can go back.

1456
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:14,720
Well I is what my value
if I is five, this level of

1457
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,160
I is five

1458
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,840
I less or equal

1459
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:37,440
than five. It's

1460
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,200
more than one more than equals.

1461
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,160
The one.

1462
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,160
Okay,

1463
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:52,360
well, I more equal than one.

1464
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,040
Okay.

1465
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,800
And then what do I need to use
if I'm going to use.

1466
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,120
So you see all I'm sure all your or all
your condition is true, then I guess

1467
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:03,920
you guys need to tell me, am I going to
use an increment or decrement

1468
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,880
if I have five and condition is one

1469
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,640
increment decrement.

1470
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:21,720
Okay.

1471
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,800
I guess first let's look at Michael.

1472
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,520
You probably maybe
your value is different.

1473
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,560
Maybe you operate as different, right?

1474
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,840
That's fine. Okay.

1475
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,840
So integer equals to five, right
integer equals to five.

1476
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:39,960
If you put in the condition
I is more or the one, then in order

1477
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:44,840
for this condition true to be true
five times, what do we need to do this

1478
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:55,880
I What are we going to do with the
I going to do it decrement.

1479
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:56,520
Right.

1480
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,920
So we're going to do it

1481
01:18:59,080 --> 01:18:59,960
right.

1482
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:04,200
So now first let's go back to our body
and then we can change the operator.

1483
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,360
Based on the operator.

1484
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,200
We will have to change the condition
as well. Right?

1485
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:09,640
We will have to change that.

1486
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,840
So now let's see
what's going to happen. Right?

1487
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:16,160
So we know that we need only one scanner,
Right?

1488
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,640
Variable declaration
also happens only once.

1489
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,360
Right now we have the condition
while I more than equals in one

1490
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,080
case, five more or equal than one. Yes.

1491
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,840
Condition Is to someone inside the world
body.

1492
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,960
This where a world body starts.

1493
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,120
This is where a while body is, right?

1494
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,720
So now, right inside the body

1495
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,880
I have to repeat a block of code
while the condition is true.

1496
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,600
Right?

1497
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,040
So condition.
What's true? I'm going to ask.

1498
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:48,520
Please
enter your name. Right. And then. Here.

1499
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,920
Capturing the name,
capturing the age, printing.

1500
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:56,680
Then what I'm doing is my
I am decrement in now five minus one.

1501
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,800
My I will be equal to four right then.

1502
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,680
My driver does not stop cannot stop

1503
01:20:01,680 --> 01:20:05,080
Don't have a permission to stop
until it finds the false condition.

1504
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,000
Right. It goes back

1505
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:09,720
now it's saying here is the four right.

1506
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:13,480
Because the values I was decrement
that is for more than one.

1507
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,880
Yes. Four is still more than one. Okay.

1508
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,920
If the four is more than one

1509
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,840
right, or is more than one,
then or more equal than one. Yes.

1510
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,600
Condition strong.

1511
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,400
Going back
then I'll execute the second time.

1512
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,680
Second time. Second time.

1513
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,160
Right then four minus
one will give me three Java.

1514
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,840
There's no stop.
It goes back to exact condition.

1515
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:37,960
Now I would say here
is that three more than one.

1516
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,080
Yes. Condition is true. Right.

1517
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,440
And then printing this third time.

1518
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,520
Right.

1519
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,680
And then you will get incremented to two

1520
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,680
and then they will get incremented to one.

1521
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,560
Right. All this time
it will be printing it, right?

1522
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,480
All this time it will be printing it.

1523
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,720
And then whenever you condition
would be one, right.

1524
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,800
Whenever your condition will be one.

1525
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:04,440
Hey, one is more or equal than one
condition is true.

1526
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,400
That will become your number.

1527
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,480
Number five time.

1528
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,600
What are you going to print it then?

1529
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,320
You I will still get decrement it,
it will become zero.

1530
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,720
Then where it goes, it goes back, right?

1531
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,680
It goes back.

1532
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:22,280
Now it says he is zero more or equal,
this one.

1533
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,600
No condition is false.

1534
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,720
All in only one condition is false.

1535
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:30,680
Then Java not going inside the
well body right?

1536
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:31,560
Only then.

1537
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,400
So now let's try to run a quiz.

1538
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,800
Enter your name. My Name is John.

1539
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,360
My age is 45.

1540
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,440
Your name is John and you?

1541
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:42,320
45 years old.

1542
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,960
Twins. Enter your name.

1543
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,160
My name is Jane.

1544
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:48,360
The age is 34, right?

1545
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:51,320
Your name is John.
And so then what happens?

1546
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:56,400
Our block, of course, is getting repeated.

1547
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,920
How many times?

1548
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,720
So what? Right.

1549
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,880
So now I am inside the right scan.

1550
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,800
I get created.

1551
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,840
You guys can see in here, right?

1552
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,320
My I got initialized.

1553
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,760
You see it in here.

1554
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,120
Now what we are repeating,
we are just repeating the block

1555
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:18,680
that we put inside a well,
please enter your name H Right name

1556
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,760
Jane. Right.

1557
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,160
And then age 34

1558
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,520
right now you will print it right?

1559
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:32,920
You will it and then go back and then
this thing process will be happening.

1560
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,720
Enter your name.

1561
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:35,120
My name is John.

1562
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,960
Please enter your age.

1563
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,680
I don't know. Ages. Don't know 67. Right.

1564
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:45,680
And then it will this block of what will
be keep repeating and repeating Repeating

1565
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,960
it in

1566
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,920
Give me give me increment.

1567
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:57,760
Okay guess.

1568
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,680
Now let me ask you.

1569
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,960
Let's
think of different variations. Right.

1570
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,880
So what if

1571
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,560
I want to increment this,
what should I change them to?

1572
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,360
If I want to increment,

1573
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,880
let's think of different variations
I want to increment.

1574
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:38,520
How should I fix my condition?

1575
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,520
Okay. So right.

1576
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:46,120
If you are want your increment,
then you have to fix this, right?

1577
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:49,560
You have to fix this.

1578
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,560
Well I less lesson
equals than five. Right.

1579
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:57,520
We can then this way we can change it
to one input less or equal then fine.

1580
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,600
Okay. Without Work.

1581
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,080
Yes, that would work. Right.

1582
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,920
We will be starting with one.

1583
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,320
Then you will get increment
the two and then three.

1584
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,280
And then four. And then five. Right.

1585
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:12,320
So what if I'm going
to give my equal to ten?

1586
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,600
I want to keep my incrimination.

1587
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,800
I want to keep the value.

1588
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,840
What what can I change, guys? Them.

1589
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:28,440
I want my I to be equal to ten.

1590
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,120
No, I'm still want to increment.

1591
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,640
I still want to increment.
I still want to have ten.

1592
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,680
Then what should
I change my condition This

1593
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,040
I should
you just change it to the 15, right?

1594
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:45,480
I should change it to the 15. Right.

1595
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:50,120
So you guess you it can be different
incrimination, discrimination

1596
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,400
as long as you know
how to make your condition right.

1597
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,440
As long as you know
how to make your condition.

1598
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,800
But usual,
of course we will be starting from small

1599
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,840
go into larger right
or from the large going down to one.

1600
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:06,480
So but cannot be done with the using ten.

1601
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:07,760
Yes, it can be done right.

1602
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,080
But the main thing in here, guys,
what are we doing?

1603
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,720
We are repeating right now,
you don't have just one single line.

1604
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:18,680
What you have, you have a block of code
right inside this block of code.

1605
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:19,760
What are we doing?

1606
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,280
We are giving instructions
and then we are capturing

1607
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,760
values using string
and then again printing the statement.

1608
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,040
Right.

1609
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,720
So what we are repeating,
we repeat in block of code how many times?

1610
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:34,000
Five times Based on what?

1611
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,520
Based on my point, we should write

1612
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,600
this block,

1613
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,240
the block of code that we want to repeat
where we please.

1614
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:45,000
We just play skip inside my well body,
right inside my box.

1615
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,360
Look this right.

1616
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,080
So this is how our

1617
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,640
points already 1133
okay this is how well loop right.

1618
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,720
Just always remember

1619
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:59,720
so the way we have for a while,
we have a condition first, right?

1620
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:01,320
We have a condition first.

1621
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,720
Our well, first checks.

1622
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:06,400
The condition
and only know if the condition is true.

1623
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:10,480
Then we can go inside the little body
where my little body starts.

1624
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:15,080
It starts from this curly braces
all the way to this right on the edge.

1625
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:16,680
Or I guess. Yes.

1626
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,000
We are going to take a break.

1627
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,440
1130 elastic or break until 1150, right?

1628
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,480
Yeah. Time goes to find this.

1629
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,360
And then after the break,
we want to start looking into our another

1630
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,640
right column and break below.

1631
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:36,600
1150, keeping this in here.

1632
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,640
So it's going to have a look right

1633
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:45,240
of right.

1634
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,160
So is
that there there's other loops in our

1635
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,960
which we are going to look right
so once we look into all the loops right.

1636
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:56,520
Not all but three, then I'll tell you
this wide Java gives so many variations

1637
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:01,000
and in which situation
we will go for one or another loop.

1638
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:01,640
Right.

1639
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,640
So bye for now.

1640
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:08,320
What we will do is we look into
our other look, which is do loop, right?

1641
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,480
So this is our

1642
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,080
this is was how

1643
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:20,040
well while work right.

1644
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:24,520
This is how our while loop looks
so now and that the loop that we have

1645
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,320
we have something that call dual right

1646
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:31,960
so do look will be a very very similar
to our one right

1647
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:37,520
do well will be very similar
the only thing they will have

1648
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,400
its own keywords right.

1649
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,880
Of course we will have its own keywords.

1650
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:46,320
So the way our do will work
it has a do keyword right

1651
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,240
then without any condition.

1652
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,680
Our due body will be open in its own
block of code, right?

1653
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:57,040
It opens its own block of code.

1654
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:05,600
And here, whatever code we want to repeat,

1655
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,640
we will Voice is breaking thing.

1656
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,000
It should be fine.

1657
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,920
No, it should be fine.

1658
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:13,000
This should be fine

1659
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:14,840
by check.

1660
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,360
I have a good connection. Right?

1661
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:20,000
So we will be starting with the do
and then whatever block of code

1662
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,720
we want to repeat,
we will be placing inside a do body.

1663
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,160
Right?

1664
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:29,640
And then outside of the do body
we will be having our while.

1665
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,800
And then we will be having the condition.

1666
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,480
Right. Condition will be it

1667
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,160
while.

1668
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,960
So this is a syntax.

1669
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,360
What are our do? Well, right.

1670
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:39,560
So now let's see how

1671
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:43,040
it will look into the coding
and what will be the difference between

1672
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:47,280
while in whatever there will be difference
between it do. Wow.

1673
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,920
Right. So

1674
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,880
what I'm going to do

1675
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,320
because

1676
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,200
you will

1677
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:03,960
know them

1678
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,040
so when they met that

1679
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,600
so right so let's go let's first

1680
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,960
so in order for us to see the difference,
I'm going to bring my way to look.

1681
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:16,200
Right.

1682
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:20,960
So, for example, I'm going to see it right
or individual A equals two one

1683
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,720
in the regular code that we already done
this up with this addition.

1684
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:30,400
And then the way we said while works,
well, first what we do, we are checking

1685
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:35,520
the condition while we use less
or equal than three, for example.

1686
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,520
Then I'm going to see see, All right.

1687
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:43,040
And I'm going to see what.

1688
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:43,440
Right.

1689
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,920
And then our increment or decrement.

1690
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:47,520
Okay.

1691
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,920
Right.

1692
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,040
So we know or I'm running something.

1693
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,600
So we know in here what happens, right?

1694
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,720
My code will be executed three times.

1695
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,080
Three times. Right.

1696
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,760
Because the condition was true
three times.

1697
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:02,520
Right.

1698
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,360
So now exact the same code.

1699
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,480
This I can write using my

1700
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,920
using my dual right.

1701
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,920
So the same thing.
I'm going to have a variable.

1702
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,080
I'm going to say
integer B equals to one exact

1703
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,520
the same code, exact the same condition,
but in the dual format.

1704
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,600
So what I'm going to do

1705
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,880
when specified do right
is you guys see it's a keyword, right?

1706
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,120
It's a keyword do.

1707
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:28,720
And then I have a block of code
which is body of my dual loop.

1708
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,400
This is the body of my why loop.

1709
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,520
This is the body of my dual. Right.

1710
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:37,280
So inside the new I'm placing the code
that I want you repeat, right.

1711
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,360
I'm going to say for example in here.

1712
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,120
Hello.

1713
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:45,920
And then outside of the do body
what I'm going to provide, I'm

1714
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:49,440
going to provide the well and my condition

1715
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,520
will be less or equal.

1716
01:30:53,520 --> 01:31:01,640
Dempsey will be electronic Olympic.

1717
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:04,600
So using

1718
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,760
my body

1719
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:15,600
while doing my body right.

1720
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:15,920
Okay.

1721
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,120
Now let me try to execute.

1722
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,440
Let me try to. Exactly right.

1723
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:22,120
Oh, wait, what did it.

1724
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:24,040
Oh, I forgot what happened, you guys.

1725
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,920
What? Why? My little pillow? Right way.

1726
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:26,600
Give sprinting.

1727
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:26,960
Hello?

1728
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:34,040
Non stop this.

1729
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,120
I forgot the increment or decrement.

1730
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:36,600
Right. Sorry.

1731
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,600
Okay, so be plus

1732
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,000
the plus plus.

1733
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,480
Right.

1734
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,440
So now if I'm going to execute it right,

1735
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,480
if I'm going to execute
it, output is exact the same right.

1736
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,160
Output is exact the same.

1737
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:53,880
So my y loop gives me a high three times.

1738
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:58,920
Why do I loop
gives me a hello three times right.

1739
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:02,040
So now then what is the difference? Right.

1740
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,440
How it does not germinate here.

1741
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:07,320
It stops based on the condition, right?

1742
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:11,520
It's based on the condition
when my it becomes four

1743
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,840
and then when we check condition
for less than three condition,

1744
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:18,840
because that's how we are not able
to enter the inside the world body.

1745
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:21,600
That's how we are stopping the right

1746
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:23,600
that we notice.

1747
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:28,560
So now here, while the condition is two,
we don't see the difference, right?

1748
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:33,720
My while runs three times
my dual runs three times.

1749
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,040
Right.

1750
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:38,240
My my my do runs three times. Yes.

1751
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:40,880
Instrumentation
always happens inside the body.

1752
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,800
Guys, this is the wild body.

1753
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,360
This is the Dubai always always happens.

1754
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,600
And site implementation. Right.

1755
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,680
So now let's see
then what is the difference.

1756
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,360
Let me change this condition to be false

1757
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:01,240
now. And let's just look at the code.

1758
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:03,400
This let's look at the court.

1759
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,480
When Java starts looking right

1760
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,080
when Java starts,
look in top to the bottom, right.

1761
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,120
So now Java sees a while.

1762
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,200
It knows it has to repeat block of code.

1763
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,600
But before before repeating

1764
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,400
block of code, what your Java see is
your Java sees a condition.

1765
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,080
Right?
So now we have to check the condition.

1766
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,200
He is one
is more than equal then three condition.

1767
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:26,800
True or false

1768
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,840
condition is false.

1769
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,160
So one condition is false.

1770
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:37,680
Your java can load and the block of code
which belongs to the wild body.

1771
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,120
Right? It cannot enter.

1772
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,560
So your code will be ignored.

1773
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:43,760
Now we going to see this outcome.

1774
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,440
So now when it comes to a do body
dual loop,

1775
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:52,200
so depolarize version of variable,
now your java sees a do keyword, right?

1776
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:52,920
It sees Dukie.

1777
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,720
What do you guys see?

1778
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:58,280
Any condition to enter a new body?

1779
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,200
To see any condition
before entering this block of code?

1780
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:03,240
There's no condition, right?

1781
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,680
There's no condition.

1782
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,600
So because there's no condition.

1783
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,800
What? Your joke.

1784
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:10,080
They did not want any condition.
So I just do.

1785
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,320
So do your java sees also do.

1786
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:16,080
It means I have to repeat
the block of code to it knows it.

1787
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:16,600
Right.

1788
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,480
So there was no to enter this block of put

1789
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:23,120
so your java easily enters
it will execute.

1790
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,240
Hello.

1791
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,600
Then what it will do?

1792
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,160
It will increment.
So what they did will become this?

1793
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,200
What they be will become

1794
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,040
your B will become two

1795
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:42,080
Then after in the body the loop.

1796
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:45,400
Now what it does, it gives the condition.

1797
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:48,560
It says while B is more than three.

1798
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,800
Hey, I want you repeat this block of code.

1799
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,080
Why B is more than equals.

1800
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:58,080
The three Now at this point
condition will be false.

1801
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:00,000
One condition is the false.

1802
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,160
Your loop cannot continue.

1803
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,040
It cannot continue. Right.

1804
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:09,560
So now what do you see the difference
between wow and do while right?

1805
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,040
While all in
do while they're very very similar loops

1806
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:19,760
what they do
they run while condition is true

1807
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:23,600
that only difference between why loop

1808
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,240
and do y loop when the condition is false.

1809
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:32,880
When the condition is false,
do while will still execute

1810
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,480
the block of code
that you put inside the body.

1811
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,840
Why it still executes
because do allows you

1812
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,960
to do the action once right
and only then it checks the condition.

1813
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:44,720
Right.

1814
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:48,720
So the way do does do think of it
it trust you.

1815
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,680
But then checks right.

1816
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:52,400
I trust you one time.

1817
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,600
Then I check the condition. Why?

1818
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:57,840
When we talk about the why,
why Loop doesn't trust you.

1819
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,920
It says, Hey,
you know what? I'll verify first.

1820
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:02,360
If the condition is true,
then I'll trust you. Right.

1821
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:06,360
So what happens once
first checks the condition?

1822
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:08,040
Only.

1823
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:09,840
Only the condition is true.

1824
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,760
Then it allows you to go inside the world
by when it comes

1825
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:18,360
Do, do, do says, Hey,
go ahead and execute this block of code.

1826
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,440
I care about the condition.

1827
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,800
I have no condition to check. It
suffers. Right?

1828
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,640
I'm going
allow you to execute the code first

1829
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,280
and only and only have to execute the code
at least once.

1830
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,360
I'll check the condition.

1831
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,400
And if that time is the condition of us.

1832
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:38,120
Of course I cannot go back right.

1833
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:40,080
Let's first do has no condition.

1834
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,360
You guys at first do has no condition.

1835
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:47,120
But after executing one time only,
then it checks condition only.

1836
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:49,160
Then you check the condition. Right?

1837
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:53,000
So let me check
does me when back check to the true right.

1838
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,200
Let me check again. That's right.

1839
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:59,120
So the way do it works exact same thing
this it's a cycle it's

1840
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:03,960
repetition of the code right so the way do
works right up to the bottom of this.

1841
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:07,200
Always top to the bottom B equals one.
Okay.

1842
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,320
B, initialize to one. Now what happens?

1843
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,400
Do no condition to check.

1844
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:13,640
This will be executed one time.

1845
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:18,840
B will incremented
one one by one equals two to right.

1846
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:24,200
Then it exists the body and then after
that it chose the condition.

1847
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:27,240
I will repeat block of code what I want y

1848
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,840
condition is true
hey is due less than or equal then three.

1849
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:32,440
Yes, condition is true.

1850
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:34,960
One condition is true. Your code goes back

1851
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:37,760
Now again he

1852
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,480
says do right now
we going to print second time,

1853
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:47,080
then do implementation by one
it will be equal to three right then

1854
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:51,880
after executing this code it will check
is three less or equal than three?

1855
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:54,960
Yes, condition is true.
It goes back again.

1856
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,800
It goes back to do again
is going to print.

1857
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:03,200
Then three plus one will be equal to four.

1858
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,400
Right.

1859
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,760
And outside of the
well now it will check the condition.

1860
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,840
Hey is for less than three.

1861
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,360
No. Now condition becomes false.

1862
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,080
So you cannot go back
and repeat that cycle.

1863
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:16,800
Right.

1864
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,920
So that's the only difference between
while and do well this

1865
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,560
and let's take a look
Oh, let's take a debugging

1866
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:29,240
debugging in here.

1867
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:34,600
We like

1868
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:40,000
so declaring of the will be
what is the value of is one right

1869
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,720
so we will go over when do we go for
well one of you will go for the key

1870
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:47,360
so be right the value of these one.

1871
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,280
So there was no condition
to enter the body.

1872
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:55,040
So now I'm execute and hello
then I am incrementing might be

1873
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,920
you can see became two
and only after I executed

1874
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:02,560
first code then I'm checking the condition
Hey is due.

1875
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,280
I will continue using the while

1876
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,520
the run block of got
well condition is true.

1877
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,640
He is due less or equal than three years
condition is true.

1878
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:13,080
Okay.

1879
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:15,600
If condition is true ongoing back. Right.

1880
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,200
I'm going back printing.

1881
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:20,520
Hello incrementing B right while I after

1882
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:23,160
I increment the B now check the condition.

1883
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,680
Hey, is three less or equal
than three years?

1884
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:27,680
Condition is true and you shouldn't.

1885
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:28,080
It's true.

1886
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:31,360
I'm going back like I'm going back
repeating the same.

1887
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:34,560
Hello now incrementing now B

1888
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,520
became equals to four
or is not less than three.

1889
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,040
Now condition becomes false.

1890
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,080
I'm stepping right?

1891
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:44,400
I'm stepping it.

1892
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:48,160
Why? It's not all the same. If B

1893
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:58,640
is equal to two.

1894
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,480
Genius.
I don't think I understood your question.

1895
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:00,720
Right.

1896
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:03,040
And let's change my condition to be false.

1897
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:04,920
Right.

1898
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,240
So now,
when the condition is false. Right.

1899
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:10,600
What happens with our dual right.

1900
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:13,040
What happens is our due, right.

1901
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:17,720
A B is equal to one first.

1902
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,160
I don't check anything.
I trust you, right?

1903
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,200
I trust you.

1904
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:24,000
I'm going to execute
this block of code Right.

1905
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,440
Then I will do implementation.

1906
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,280
Now after I did, I do at least one

1907
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,280
institution after execution.

1908
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,080
Now I check the condition.

1909
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,360
Condition becomes false.

1910
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,520
I cannot go back and there my Dubai.

1911
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,200
Right.

1912
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:40,800
So now we're one of us.

1913
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,520
Now we will look.

1914
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,360
So now those loops you go see very,
very similar right so you're while and do

1915
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,440
very similar loops they do work

1916
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:52,880
while condition is being true right.

1917
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:54,960
While condition is being true.

1918
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,240
The only difference first
look at the difference.

1919
01:40:57,240 --> 01:40:57,840
Right.

1920
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,800
And well first check the condition
only then execute

1921
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:07,760
block of your do executes block of code
in only checks the condition.

1922
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:11,040
So this way whenever a condition is false,

1923
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:15,240
your while will never execute
block of code right

1924
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:18,800
will never body will never get executed
compared to a do.

1925
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:24,960
Even if the condition is false,
your do will execute at least one time.

1926
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,400
Okay, so now out of this two loops,

1927
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,160
right out of the tools
because they are very similar, right?

1928
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:34,000
Because they're very similar.

1929
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,680
So now out of this loops,
which loop will be more popular?

1930
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:41,240
Why loop is way more popular
compared to do

1931
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,640
right while loop compared to more to do.

1932
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,160
It's more popular.

1933
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:48,840
But then why java users do they will be.

1934
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,920
There could be some possible scenarios

1935
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:56,000
in the way we might use a do right.

1936
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,640
For example, let's look at this scenario

1937
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:00,480
right

1938
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:09,960
for example.

1939
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:12,440
Right. What we will try to do this.

1940
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:20,960
We will try to bring this our scanner
and everything, okay?

1941
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:24,880
In which cases we will go for for example,
that's for example, Right.

1942
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,600
So let's think of this scenario.

1943
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,000
Let's think of this scenario.

1944
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,280
So what we will do,

1945
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:33,000
let's

1946
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:37,800
create a secret number.

1947
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:40,760
So I'm going to have my secret number,
for example.

1948
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:41,280
Right?

1949
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:44,640
It can be a number from 1 to 20,
for example.

1950
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:45,160
Right?

1951
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:48,640
1 to 20, 50, 100, whatever.

1952
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:48,960
Right.

1953
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,440
Whatever the image or example,
we will create a secret number.

1954
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,360
Then what we will do, let us.

1955
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,960
Let's ask user

1956
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:05,520
to guess my secret number.

1957
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,000
Right?

1958
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,480
So now I will have one number right?

1959
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:12,680
Then I will ask user to guess
my secret number.

1960
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:13,280
Right.

1961
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:15,760
So now guys, do it.

1962
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,080
What do you guys think? Right.

1963
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:21,440
Let's say from one to, I don't know, 1000
from to 100 don't matter.

1964
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:21,960
Right?

1965
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,800
Let's say in my mind
I have a number 77 right now.

1966
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:29,040
I will ask my user, Hey, do you

1967
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,600
hey, guess my number.

1968
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:36,400
Do this know how many times
it will take a user to guess my number?

1969
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:36,960
Do you know

1970
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:38,720
your guess?

1971
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:42,240
My number 77.

1972
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:43,760
We don't really know, right?

1973
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,520
We don't really know.

1974
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,720
But what I want to do,
I want to keep asking.

1975
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:52,040
Right. I don't know
if it's going to take ten times.

1976
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,320
I don't know.

1977
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,760
It's going to take 20 times
or maybe one time or 100 times.

1978
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:56,280
Right.

1979
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:59,920
So now I don't really know
how many times I have to ask,

1980
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:07,280
but what I'm going to do,
I'm going to ask, continuously asking.

1981
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:11,440
I'm still until a user guesses

1982
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:17,400
the number, as soon as user enter 77,
then I will check is

1983
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:21,920
the 77 is the number that I'm looking for
as long as the number.

1984
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:26,160
As soon as the number becomes match,
then I will stop asking.

1985
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:26,840
Right.

1986
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,400
So now you have to think, okay, first,

1987
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:33,600
first I have to ask a user.

1988
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,640
It means I need a scanner.

1989
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,800
Then I have to ask.

1990
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,800
I have to I have to ask a user. Right.

1991
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,560
Then I have to repeat a block of quote.

1992
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,320
I have to keep asking.
Keep asking, Keep asking. Right.

1993
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,600
It means I need to look right for now.

1994
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:50,400
We to lose. Right.

1995
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,600
So now let me ask you this first.

1996
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:59,480
First, are we would you ask for a number
or we already can check

1997
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:04,560
if the number is equal to my equal
to my secret number or not equal.

1998
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:08,960
Can I come, Pierre, before I can
I check my condition

1999
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:15,560
before I ask for a number?

2000
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:16,720
So first right.

2001
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,320
So first what I have to get.

2002
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,280
I have to get the number right.

2003
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:24,680
I have to ask the number from a user
and only then I compare.

2004
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:25,200
Right?

2005
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,080
So first
I will have to perform the action, right?

2006
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:32,520
So let's try to do this right and then
I'm going to and then hit keep asking

2007
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,240
for more number

2008
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,840
due to user.

2009
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,920
So user gets the secret.

2010
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:47,360
So user guess

2011
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,920
that's because number

2012
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,400
two, we will have two things.

2013
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:52,720
Okay.

2014
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:55,240
So first, right, so first

2015
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:58,640
what I'm going to do,
I'm going to have a secret number.

2016
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:00,480
So what is the secret number?

2017
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:02,320
This secret

2018
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,120
winning number, Right.

2019
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:09,480
I mean, that's fine. Let's go for 17 now.

2020
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,400
I guess it's like a lottery, guys, right?

2021
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:13,560
So the lottery has once won.

2022
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,960
Lucky number, right?

2023
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:15,840
So now what?

2024
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,560
I said, I have my secret number.

2025
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:19,400
Now I want to ask a user.

2026
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,720
It means I need a skin scanner

2027
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,480
and equals new

2028
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,960
scanner.

2029
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:35,480
The right.

2030
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:39,360
So now what I have to do, I have to ask

2031
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:42,000
a user to gift my secret number,

2032
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:45,840
but I have to keep until he guesses.

2033
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:51,840
So it means I will have to repeat
this same block of code.

2034
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,400
Write this same block of code so

2035
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:58,360
repeating the same block of foot,
I have to place it inside that.

2036
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,880
Why do I have to put inside the loop

2037
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:05,280
now in order for me to use a well,
I need to have a condition.

2038
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,520
Right at this moment,
I don't have any condition.

2039
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:10,240
I don't have any condition.

2040
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:13,360
So what? I can go
I can go for a dual right.

2041
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:17,320
Hey, what I'm trying to do, right,
what I'm trying to do.

2042
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,960
Let me ask a user to guess the number.

2043
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:22,280
Right.

2044
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:26,720
I'm going to say this is all in here.

2045
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:27,160
Please.

2046
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:31,680
It's my

2047
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:35,520
secret number.

2048
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,600
For example.

2049
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,920
It is a number, for example, from 1 to 1.

2050
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:44,080
Right?

2051
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,680
So now you have to capture it.

2052
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:48,320
You will have to capture. Right.

2053
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,040
So now let's capture it.

2054
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,680
So we are going to say, yeah,

2055
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:58,080
that's next.

2056
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,400
We're going to capture inside integer

2057
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,120
user number

2058
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:09,120
using number.

2059
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:11,560
So what did I do wrong?

2060
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:13,680
Oh, now I have my condition, right?

2061
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:15,440
So now

2062
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:19,640
or next in future, what is the future?

2063
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,080
Right?

2064
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:24,120
So now first what I'm doing,
I'm having my action.

2065
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:24,440
Right?

2066
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:27,040
Okay.

2067
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:28,320
Give me the number.

2068
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:31,600
Now, when you as a gives me the number

2069
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:36,000
now what I have to do,
I have to check, right?

2070
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,440
I have to check.

2071
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,640
And I want to continuously ask

2072
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:46,200
until a user gives me
until user gives me a valid number,

2073
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:49,320
your user gives me a exact
the same number.

2074
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:51,360
So what will be my condition?

2075
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,160
Guess what will be my condition?

2076
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,920
How long should I look?

2077
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:05,400
Give me the condition.

2078
01:49:05,400 --> 01:49:10,480
Or maybe it's going to take me three
times.

2079
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,560
I'm not going to go.
One, two, three, four, five. Maybe.

2080
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:17,000
So now I want to continuously looping.

2081
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:21,520
I want to continuously loop
while my number.

2082
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:23,920
Now you guys will tell me what it's equal
with.

2083
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,800
It's not equal. Wow.

2084
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:29,040
So what will be my condition?

2085
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,760
My condition will be I'm going to loop

2086
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:35,640
until the number that you enter it.

2087
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,760
So now you guys tell me it.

2088
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,160
Should it be equal
or should it be not equal?

2089
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,680
Which operator should I use?

2090
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:48,280
Equal or not equal?

2091
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:50,880
Equal.

2092
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,360
Okay, let's do this before running that.

2093
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:55,200
I want you to run this. I want you.

2094
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,880
I want you to understand.

2095
01:49:57,880 --> 01:49:59,520
Okay? We have to okay.

2096
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,760
We have to take it outside
and I'll explain.

2097
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,000
You guys,
we have to take it outside. Okay?

2098
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,120
So let's declare this variable.

2099
01:50:06,120 --> 01:50:09,600
This let's declared
this variable outside of the due body.

2100
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,120
Let's declare this variable.

2101
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:13,800
And inside we just going to.

2102
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,600
Inside we just going to initialize it.

2103
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:18,480
But let's do it outside
and I'll explain you one.

2104
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:20,360
So on the line

2105
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:23,480
20, let's declare
a user number inside the line.

2106
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:25,840
24 Let's do it initialization

2107
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:28,280
because

2108
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,760
now we will go line by line
and don't be confused yet.

2109
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,280
We're going into finalizing

2110
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,720
the now let's go line by line

2111
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:40,560
right after bottom.

2112
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,280
Do we know what happens in here, guys?

2113
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:47,680
Do we know what happens in here?

2114
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:48,200
Okay, guys.

2115
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,040
And please
make sure you guys are all active

2116
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,320
right now
because I see the same people Keep typing.

2117
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,800
I want to make sure guys understand
loops is very, very important.

2118
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:56,280
Okay.

2119
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:01,120
I want all of you guys to tell me
whether after explanation,

2120
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,240
if somebody is confused,
I will repeat again. Right.

2121
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:07,160
But as of now, I hope you guys know what
first three lines means, right?

2122
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:08,240
Just first three lines.

2123
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:12,600
That's where we look right?

2124
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:12,840
Okay.

2125
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:16,320
I hope
you guys all put your weights right.

2126
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,920
So now what do we have

2127
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,800
yet? Is above the scanner, right?

2128
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,840
First, it's
kind of like in my mind. Right?

2129
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:26,200
So now we will see.

2130
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:28,040
We will see guys,
we will analyze it. Right.

2131
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:31,960
Remember, even at the first time
we did it with the mistake, that's fine.

2132
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:36,680
How we can we saw with we can solve it by
analyzing our could see what's happening.

2133
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:39,400
Right. So first okay first lines.

2134
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:42,640
We know what happens now we see do right

2135
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:48,560
do do while repeats block of code
repeats by the code.

2136
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,360
Welcome. This is true.

2137
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:52,080
But first what it allows me.

2138
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:55,880
It allows me to enter the body
without checking the condition.

2139
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:58,320
Right.
And first I don't even have the condition.

2140
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:58,920
So I'm saying.

2141
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:01,280
Hey, enter your secret number.

2142
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:03,600
This code will be executed.

2143
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,560
No, I'm saying.

2144
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,480
Hey, enter it.

2145
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:09,360
For example, guys,
my secret number is 7 to 8.

2146
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,880
I'm going to enter, for example.

2147
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,080
I'm going to enter 13.

2148
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,960
Let's think I'm entering 13.

2149
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,640
I want to store 13 inside here.

2150
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:21,200
Right So now after I perform

2151
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:24,600
this action, what I'm doing now,
I'll check the condition.

2152
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:25,800
What is my condition?

2153
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:28,080
Well, user number.

2154
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:30,320
User number is 13.

2155
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:33,120
Now I'm saying equals.

2156
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:35,040
What is the value of my secret number goes

2157
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:40,520
78. Now tell me this is my condition.

2158
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:43,360
True or false?

2159
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,040
It's a false right.

2160
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:49,560
But did I guess a number
I did not gives the number yet, Right.

2161
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:53,040
I want to continuously get

2162
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,560
until I actually get the valid number.

2163
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:01,920
So now how can I make this condition true
that how can I make this condition true?

2164
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,960
It's false right now
can then make it true this

2165
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,560
now let's change it to the not equal.

2166
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,360
Let's change it to the not equal.

2167
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,720
And let's see, guys, this right

2168
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,480
now the same thing.

2169
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:18,760
New pape. Give a number. Take a guess.

2170
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:21,240
I'm going to enter 13

2171
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:24,800
entering 13 store in here

2172
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:28,680
now after I exited my do body Now

2173
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:31,960
I'm chicken Hey well 13

2174
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:36,120
is not equal to 78.

2175
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:37,680
Is the condition true or false? This

2176
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:42,600
condition is true now.

2177
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:45,560
When the condition is true,
my code goes back.

2178
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:48,600
My code goes back is going to ask me

2179
01:53:48,640 --> 01:53:52,560
second time now again,
I'm going to capture the number.

2180
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,960
I'm going to enter 55 right now, 55

2181
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,760
will be stored inside user number.

2182
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:02,440
Now I'm chicken. Hey,
what is the condition?

2183
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:08,240
While 55 not equal to 78 now
condition again.

2184
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:08,880
True.

2185
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,560
Now my code will keep be repeating,
repeating, repeating.

2186
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:16,080
I'm due until what days?

2187
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:16,960
Until when?

2188
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:20,320
My call will get repeated.

2189
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:24,280
Now, when you going to enter 78.

2190
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:26,920
When we're going to enter 78.

2191
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:28,800
Inside

2192
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:32,280
now we're going to see, hey, is 78

2193
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:35,080
not equal to 78?

2194
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:40,560
Now? What is the condition?

2195
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,880
Now? Condition becomes false.

2196
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:48,120
And can I continue running the look, one
condition is false, guys.

2197
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,480
No, that's it.

2198
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:52,480
Now my loop cannot go back.

2199
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:56,080
It exists. My new well body.

2200
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:56,400
Right.

2201
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:59,880
So first of understand
that there should be a right condition.

2202
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:00,480
Right.

2203
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:01,920
Okay. Please.

2204
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,240
That's my number. 11.

2205
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:05,320
No quiz.

2206
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:08,760
That's my number 1266.

2207
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:10,960
No, 67. No.

2208
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:13,240
Now 78. Boom.

2209
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,320
It stopped right now outside.

2210
01:55:15,320 --> 01:55:20,040
Maybe we can add some sequences
or you got it, for example.

2211
01:55:20,040 --> 01:55:21,600
Right? Something like that.

2212
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:24,600
You got it right. Now let's run

2213
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:27,720
11. No. 12.

2214
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:29,320
No, 67.

2215
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:32,280
No, 78 right now.

2216
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:35,640
78. Is it not equal to seven?

2217
01:55:35,640 --> 01:55:37,640
The condition becomes false.

2218
01:55:37,640 --> 01:55:40,600
Now, I cannot go back inside my body.

2219
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:44,520
I will exit right
and outside of the message.

2220
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,320
You got it right.

2221
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:52,120
So First of all, this first of all,
this is a perfect example of where

2222
01:55:52,520 --> 01:55:57,160
we should go for a while
or do a while, Right?

2223
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:03,080
So usually we go for a while and do
well when we don't know how many times

2224
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:06,480
you want to repeat the code,
but we know we

2225
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,920
to repeat the quote
while condition is true, right?

2226
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:12,600
We were repeating the code all the way.

2227
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:14,200
Well, condition was true.

2228
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:18,120
Now why do was the best choice to go?

2229
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:21,480
Because first we had no condition to run.

2230
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:25,480
First,
we wanted to ask for a number in only.

2231
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:28,080
Only after capturing the number

2232
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:33,360
we were able
we were able to use it as our condition.

2233
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:35,960
Right? At first there were no condition.

2234
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:41,160
Only then, hey, what if the user will be
entering seven need from the very first?

2235
01:56:41,160 --> 01:56:43,440
Right? Could that be possibility? Yes.

2236
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:44,800
But what will happen?

2237
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,800
You will still run in here.

2238
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:48,960
Please enter your guess number.

2239
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:53,920
It will enter 78
and here 70 is not equal to seven.

2240
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:58,320
Need no condition will become false
and you will exist right away.

2241
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:01,480
Right. But until you enter 70,

2242
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:04,600
you quote continuously repeating,
repeating, repeating.

2243
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,240
Right.

2244
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:08,360
Could be this same scenario.

2245
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:10,560
Okay.

2246
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,840
Could it be the same scenario as done

2247
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:15,720
using the y loop?

2248
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:16,920
Yes, it could be done.

2249
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:19,360
The only thing why loop?

2250
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:19,720
Remember?

2251
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,680
Because there we are similar now
based on our logic.

2252
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:23,760
Can we make the C?

2253
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:24,600
Can we make look?

2254
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:28,400
What if you Of course we can make
the only thing using the Y look

2255
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:31,480
there will be repetition of code.

2256
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:32,520
Let's think of this.

2257
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:36,720
How can we do our well?

2258
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:39,960
So us

2259
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,120
guess

2260
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,720
number one

2261
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:50,960
while you

2262
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:04,680
so in here right
this is was exact the same thing

2263
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:09,080
So we've done the same thing
now the way we said

2264
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:12,720
for the well condition will be
the same condition will be the same.

2265
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:18,960
Now the only thing for a while
I have to have already a used in number

2266
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:22,320
in order for me use it as a condition.

2267
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:26,640
Then which one should I have first
before I bring while this

2268
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:37,960
which which lines should I have first.

2269
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:40,240
So I will have this line. Right?

2270
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:42,520
Because of course
I need to give instruction

2271
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:46,560
and then do I need to grasp,
do I need to grasp the user? This

2272
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:50,200
a question

2273
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:53,760
is I'm trying to do exactly
the same scenarios in the well, right.

2274
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,200
And trying to see
what could be the difference.

2275
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,240
No. If this is will be my condition, guys,
I have to have

2276
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:02,320
I have to have some value, right?

2277
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,960
I have to have some value.

2278
01:59:03,960 --> 01:59:06,320
So I still need to get this number.

2279
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:10,080
I still need to get this.

2280
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,360
So first, this is what I will do, right?

2281
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:18,080
So now what I'm doing, I'm checking,
but I'm putting it outside of the block.

2282
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:22,920
Now say, Hey, I'm capturing a user number
now only

2283
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:27,040
and only after I capture a using number,
I can use it as a condition.

2284
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:32,040
Now I can see user number,
not equals to the

2285
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:37,400
number, right?

2286
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:39,680
So now it's

2287
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:44,280
only my only if this condition is true,
then what you guys want to do?

2288
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:47,520
What do you guys want to do?

2289
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:50,560
So in here think it gets right?

2290
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:55,480
So in here at first you ask
and then I'm going to enter 55.

2291
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,280
Now you check 55,

2292
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:03,440
not equals to 78.

2293
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:05,520
So now condition will be true. Why?

2294
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,800
It's true
because my number is not matching.

2295
02:00:08,160 --> 02:00:10,200
I want to keep asking.

2296
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:13,320
I want to keep asking until the number
not matching.

2297
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:23,400
So what call will go inside my while guys.

2298
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:25,000
So do I have to ask again?

2299
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,200
Yes, I have to ask again.

2300
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:32,000
Do you guys think
I need to capture a given or no?

2301
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,640
Or are just I just going to print

2302
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:48,080
and I need to capture it?

2303
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:48,680
Right.

2304
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:52,440
Because if I'm not going to capture inside

2305
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:57,160
my wild body,
then my loop will become infinite, right?

2306
02:00:57,160 --> 02:01:01,960
So then again, inside,
I will have to repeat this block of

2307
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:08,880
like I will have to do it again.

2308
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:12,080
So now let's try to run my while code.

2309
02:01:12,240 --> 02:01:14,080
Let's try to run my wild.

2310
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:15,840
I'll put my breakpoint in here

2311
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,080
or maybe just in here.

2312
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:20,880
I'll do debug

2313
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:23,920
what it is.

2314
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,760
Guess my secret number. Right.

2315
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,720
I'm going to enter 90.

2316
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:30,120
Let me close this for now.

2317
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,240
I'm going to enter 90.

2318
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:34,240
Right. So now what happens?

2319
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,080
Secret number is 78.

2320
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:39,640
User number is 90.

2321
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:46,040
Now I'm checking
he is 90, not equal to 78.

2322
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:48,160
Condition is true. Okay.

2323
02:01:48,160 --> 02:01:51,360
You still did not guess
because you did No guess.

2324
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:54,240
I'm going to continue asking again
right now.

2325
02:01:54,240 --> 02:01:55,200
My skin again.

2326
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,520
Okay. Condition was true.

2327
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:59,200
Please guess my secret number
I have to repeat. Right?

2328
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:02,160
I'm going to say 88

2329
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:04,440
right now. 88.

2330
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:06,120
I have to capture it. Right.

2331
02:02:06,120 --> 02:02:07,920
So now what will happen?

2332
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:10,560
90 will get replaced.

2333
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,640
The 80 they go right.

2334
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:17,160
And now when I capture a new number,
now again,

2335
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:19,480
what I'm comparing right
now, again, I did.

2336
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:22,720
Yes, I did. It is not the same as 78. Now.

2337
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:26,800
I have to keep asking again
and I have to capture it again.

2338
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:30,360
Now, I'm going to enter 78 right now

2339
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:33,800
after I entered 78 does not step.

2340
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,960
It still has to go back.

2341
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:40,120
Now it says, hey, is 78 not equals 78.

2342
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:41,880
Now condition becomes false.

2343
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:46,480
When condition is false,
I am keeping the body right

2344
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:49,480
and then outside we will just
we will just add.

2345
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:53,440
Got it right. So

2346
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:02,440
you think

2347
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:07,760
we through a number, right?

2348
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:11,440
Is this line 13 is getting executed 89.

2349
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:12,680
Right.

2350
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:19,000
So now after capturing 89
now I'm checking my condition.

2351
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:19,200
Right.

2352
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:20,480
Because for the while,

2353
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:24,440
in order for a while to work,
first I have to check the condition.

2354
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:28,520
Check in
The condition 89 is not equal to 78.

2355
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:31,520
Right? It's not. Then I'm going to enter.

2356
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:34,600
I'm going to repeat
and I have to get tricky.

2357
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,600
Like 99.

2358
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:39,480
99 is not the same as 78.

2359
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:41,320
Condition will be true.

2360
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:45,920
I'm repeating the same block code
I am capturing 78

2361
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:49,080
now once my user number

2362
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:53,520
78 is equal to the second number right?

2363
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,360
So now condition becomes false.

2364
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:58,520
When condition is false,
I skip an entire wild body

2365
02:03:59,160 --> 02:04:01,360
existing
while body outside the world body.

2366
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:02,480
I have that without

2367
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,400
that right.

2368
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:07,880
So good to see

2369
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,880
both of the things could of be done

2370
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,160
right could be done using

2371
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:18,520
either while or do well with my

2372
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:29,240
right

2373
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:32,360
finger. Right.

2374
02:04:32,360 --> 02:04:36,320
Both could do the same thing right

2375
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:40,200
with this.

2376
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:42,520
Right was going to work.

2377
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:46,400
But now when you go
like logically for the right

2378
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:49,480
but now when you look right
when you really look

2379
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:55,000
so this is the code using do while this is
the code used in the wild.

2380
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:59,400
So What do we seeing
we seen repeated lines.

2381
02:04:59,560 --> 02:04:59,960
Right.

2382
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:03,080
And what are we saying
when it comes to our coding?

2383
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:07,440
What are we trying to eliminate the
we try to redundancy.

2384
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,080
Right.

2385
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:12,080
So in this case
a dual was a better choice.

2386
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:15,560
Why new was a better choice
because first we wanted

2387
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:19,920
do something in only
then we wanted to compare.

2388
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:22,560
Right? We only then you wanted to compare

2389
02:05:24,080 --> 02:05:24,880
the main difference

2390
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:28,320
between wild and do what right do first

2391
02:05:28,680 --> 02:05:31,640
does the action
and only then checks condition

2392
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:34,840
Well first checks the condition

2393
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:37,440
only then repeats the action.

2394
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:40,480
Is there any questions?

2395
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:49,520
This any questions?

2396
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:54,080
And I'll give you or if you want to,
if you want a lot

2397
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:55,600
or if you're going to win, I'm afraid

2398
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:57,720
I'm not going to see you in the class
after that.

2399
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:00,080
Yes, I'm going to leave a guess.

2400
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:11,840
I'm going to leave it.

2401
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,200
You still will be here. Okay.

2402
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:19,160
That that's good to hear.

2403
02:06:19,160 --> 02:06:20,760
Next, we are going to the next one.

2404
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:24,520
But I wanted to give you
just a couple exercises exact

2405
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:26,160
the scene that we did with the while.

2406
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:29,160
So this way you guys will see right then.

2407
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:31,440
I just want you to practice with the duel.

2408
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:34,680
This way you guys will see that exact
the same thing

2409
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:38,320
you can do with the do.

2410
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:40,480
A little bit confusing,
but understandable. Okay.

2411
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:43,320
I hope it's like 10% confused.

2412
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:48,520
Right.

2413
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:49,000
Okay.

2414
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:51,520
Well,
some of you type in what I'm going to ask.

2415
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:53,160
This is just for practice, guys.

2416
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:54,320
This is just for practice.

2417
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:57,120
I want you to do a quick tasks case.

2418
02:06:57,120 --> 02:07:00,360
They will be repetition,
but this way you will practice the

2419
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:02,200
dual.

2420
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:04,720
Right?
I just want you to do the same thing.

2421
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:12,280
Praying numbers from
I don't know, a little bit

2422
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:15,720
prime numbers

2423
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,160
from,

2424
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,800
I don't know, 30 to 70 use and do what

2425
02:07:22,840 --> 02:07:27,080
I just want you to practice that
and maybe let's do the same thing.

2426
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:30,240
Odd numbers bring numbers

2427
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:36,920
from 99 to 1

2428
02:07:37,680 --> 02:07:41,040
using dual right then example.

2429
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,640
But you guys will see that exactly
the same thing can be done as a duo.

2430
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:49,160
Okay, so try to do this quick and
then we going to move to the next look.

2431
02:07:49,400 --> 02:13:44,960
Okay?

2432
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:45,840
All right.

2433
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:47,800
All right. I hope you did it right.

2434
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:51,760
And now you guys, no more slopes.

2435
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:56,920
Just make sure you know when to go
for which one right?

2436
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:00,360
You is in both,
you can accomplish the same task.

2437
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:01,520
But we say, Hey,

2438
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:03,520
when do we go

2439
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:06,720
for it, When do we go for a dual?

2440
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:07,360
Right?

2441
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:08,400
What do we know?

2442
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:12,480
At least we want the code to be executed
one time, right?

2443
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:14,480
Well, even the conditional before.

2444
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:18,240
So you want to execute code
at least at least once, Right?

2445
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:21,720
So when do you use dual ready word?

2446
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:24,840
When you want to repeat the block of code
at least one time? Why?

2447
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:26,440
Because do right?

2448
02:14:26,440 --> 02:14:28,960
Even by looking at that,

2449
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:30,960
we went by looking at that code, right?

2450
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:33,240
Just by looking at the code,
you see the do

2451
02:14:33,720 --> 02:14:37,240
don't have any condition
before the block of code.

2452
02:14:37,240 --> 02:14:39,840
Right.
What are we going to look for? E Right.

2453
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:45,280
The way our if works, he has Eve
and then the same our Eve has a condition

2454
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:50,080
like Eve has a condition
and only then allow us to go inside

2455
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:54,840
while has a condition
only then allows to go inside.

2456
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:59,120
When you look at the do do it
don't have any condition at first, right?

2457
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:03,160
First it allows you
to execute the block of code.

2458
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:06,120
Only then we need to check the condition.

2459
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:06,680
Right.

2460
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:08,960
So that's the main difference between

2461
02:15:08,960 --> 02:15:12,840
while in duo
and once again guys out of this two loops

2462
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,320
out of this two loops

2463
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:19,720
while will be more popular
while will be more popular.

2464
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:25,160
And this example this
and this example of while

2465
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:29,680
or whether do
well it's actually the best example.

2466
02:15:29,680 --> 02:15:32,800
When should we use while and do well.

2467
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:33,480
Right?

2468
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:35,280
Because what are we saying in here?

2469
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:39,680
Hey, we want to keep asking a user

2470
02:15:39,680 --> 02:15:42,640
for a number until you guess it, right?

2471
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:47,800
You want to play a lottery
until you win it, right?

2472
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:52,080
Do you know how many times
you have to play the lottery? No.

2473
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:53,640
But what are you going to do?

2474
02:15:53,640 --> 02:15:57,800
You're going to buy the tickets
until you win, right? So.

2475
02:15:57,800 --> 02:15:59,040
But you don't know how many times.

2476
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:02,360
But you will be repeating this
same action.

2477
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:05,400
Keep buying and buying and win
until you win.

2478
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:06,120
Right?

2479
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:12,880
So when you don't know how many times
you want to repeat a block of could you

2480
02:16:12,880 --> 02:16:15,920
while or do while always always

2481
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:20,400
the best looks to use the best
which to use now

2482
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:25,440
you're giving us another loop
and this loop is actually

2483
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:30,040
very very beautiful
look and you guys going to allow it?

2484
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,400
Probably than before.
That's what that one.

2485
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:33,680
Then the while that's why we show you.

2486
02:16:33,680 --> 02:16:36,600
Well, first, but for a loop, it's
a very beautiful loop.

2487
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:40,520
It's a very well nice structured loop

2488
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:46,520
and the for loop compared to the
why loop is actually more popular.

2489
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:52,080
Okay maybe probably more more times
we will using it for loop.

2490
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:52,760
Right.

2491
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:57,080
So now in which cases do we go for a for.

2492
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:57,600
Right.

2493
02:16:57,600 --> 02:16:59,760
So now you guys are learning
that third loop,

2494
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:02,440
the third loop
that you are learning, right?

2495
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:08,080
So now Java says, hey,
I am giving you a loop.

2496
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:13,600
Very beautiful, very well structured loop,
which is for loop.

2497
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:16,400
Where do we go for a for loop?

2498
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:22,440
All loop we go when we know in advance,

2499
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:28,000
when we know in advance how we need times
we want.

2500
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,200
You repeat this same block of code.

2501
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:33,640
For example,
when we look at this scenario, right?

2502
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:36,440
I want to say good morning three times.

2503
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:38,760
Am I doing repetitive action?

2504
02:17:38,760 --> 02:17:41,640
Yes, I'm doing repetitive action, but

2505
02:17:42,560 --> 02:17:44,600
I know in advance

2506
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:48,280
how many I want to repeat this action.

2507
02:17:48,360 --> 02:17:49,120
Right.

2508
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:53,160
So again, this be done means that
while yes, it can be done with the well,

2509
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:56,360
but now we are moving the four.

2510
02:17:56,360 --> 02:17:59,480
So what the for loop says hey, when

2511
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:03,480
you know in advance
how many times you want to repeat

2512
02:18:03,480 --> 02:18:07,680
the block of code, go for the for loop,
go for four.

2513
02:18:07,680 --> 02:18:10,200
Look for loop
always will be the best choice.

2514
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:14,040
Why the for loop is the best choice
because the four

2515
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:16,920
look this very nicely structured.

2516
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:22,080
Okay so the why the for a loop works it
has you probably guys already saw it right

2517
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:23,760
or loop.

2518
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:25,440
It's very nice.

2519
02:18:25,440 --> 02:18:28,320
So we have a four
which is a keyword right.

2520
02:18:28,360 --> 02:18:30,560
So right away is four.

2521
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:33,240
I have to repeat the block
of good number of times.

2522
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:33,480
Right.

2523
02:18:33,480 --> 02:18:37,200
So the way the for works,

2524
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:39,080
what do we look at in here guys?

2525
02:18:39,080 --> 02:18:40,920
What do we do?

2526
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:43,320
We have a variable that we initialize.

2527
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:49,040
We a condition that we check
and then we have instrumentation by the

2528
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:53,200
you guys see they're all somewhere
in different places, right?

2529
02:18:53,240 --> 02:18:55,000
They also way different places.

2530
02:18:55,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Initialization happens
outside, implementation happens inside.

2531
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:00,360
Right?

2532
02:19:00,360 --> 02:19:04,680
And this happens in the condition
right now.

2533
02:19:04,680 --> 02:19:07,320
Think about
when you could become as large.

2534
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:12,680
Now when you code becomes large and here
you have multiple, multiple lines.

2535
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,600
Then It's complex.

2536
02:19:14,600 --> 02:19:18,360
Sometimes it's hard for you
to see where you are incrementing right.

2537
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:20,920
For example,
there will be 20 or 30 more lines.

2538
02:19:20,920 --> 02:19:21,480
Right.

2539
02:19:21,480 --> 02:19:25,760
It's kind of hard for for you
where you increment and it's kind of hard

2540
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:28,600
to see how many times
you will be repeat and block of clock.

2541
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:29,120
Right.

2542
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:31,760
So now when it comes to the full loop,

2543
02:19:32,400 --> 02:19:35,000
everything you find is one line.

2544
02:19:35,520 --> 02:19:39,280
So right away, by looking
only in one line, you don't have to scroll

2545
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:43,160
it left right to look at all the things
by looking at one line

2546
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:47,240
that's, you know how many times
this loop will perform the action.

2547
02:19:47,600 --> 02:19:50,040
So what happens in here?

2548
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:54,520
Inside a follow we're doing initialize
right integer.

2549
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:59,880
I for example, equals to one
we the condition at this same line.

2550
02:19:59,880 --> 02:20:00,200
Right.

2551
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:02,840
I'm looking at the scenario
where I want to say

2552
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:06,760
high five times, right?

2553
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,360
So am I doing repetitive action?

2554
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:11,480
Yes, I'm doing repetitive action.

2555
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:14,160
Do I know how many times I want to repeat?

2556
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:15,680
Yes, I know. Okay.

2557
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:19,200
We can do it using the for loop
and follow will be the best choice.

2558
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:19,920
Right.

2559
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:23,240
So integer I equals to one initialization

2560
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:27,520
now condition I less or equal then fight

2561
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:32,960
right I less or equal than five
and then increment or decrement

2562
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:36,800
also happens on the same line
I plus plus right

2563
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:42,000
and then inside
and then inside the block of code.

2564
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:45,920
That's where we're going to repeat
an action like for example, system

2565
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:48,720
that out that gray line right this way.

2566
02:20:49,080 --> 02:20:54,680
So let me just say the shorter way for
system there are the print element, right?

2567
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:56,440
And I'm going to say hi in here,

2568
02:20:57,640 --> 02:20:58,200
right?

2569
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:00,120
So what is the beauty in here?

2570
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:03,920
This initialization condition

2571
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:07,400
increment or decrement happens
all at once, right?

2572
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:10,560
It's always will be in that order this.

2573
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:16,320
So now you as a programmer,
by looking at this code, you know,

2574
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:22,280
right away, you know right away
how many times you could real be repeated.

2575
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:23,960
Right. And it looks cleaner.

2576
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:24,920
It looks cleaner.

2577
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:27,000
It looks more organized. Right.

2578
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:30,280
And they know right away whether you need
to increment or decrement.

2579
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:30,600
Right.

2580
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:35,480
And then a block of code
that you want to repeat you place inside.

2581
02:21:35,480 --> 02:21:36,440
Right.

2582
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:40,560
So for a loop,
where do we go for the full look or look?

2583
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:44,640
This same thing this repeats block of code
and number of time

2584
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:49,080
based on the condition
all loops work exactly the same way.

2585
02:21:49,080 --> 02:21:53,280
All loops run your code
while the condition is true.

2586
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:53,840
Right?

2587
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:57,360
So now the only thing okay
now are no three loops.

2588
02:21:57,360 --> 02:21:58,560
Which will do I go?

2589
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:00,720
So we say go for a loop.

2590
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,600
We use for loop

2591
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:05,920
when we know

2592
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:08,040
when we know

2593
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:10,200
in advance

2594
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:12,960
how many times

2595
02:22:13,840 --> 02:22:17,360
anchors we want to repeat

2596
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:22,640
block of point.

2597
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:25,120
What do I know? Yes, you told me.

2598
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:27,120
I want to say high five times, right?

2599
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:29,160
I want to say high five times.

2600
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:31,800
When do we go for a well, we use while

2601
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,160
when we don't know

2602
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:40,080
in advance,

2603
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:44,880
when we don't know how many times,
how many times

2604
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:47,160
we have to

2605
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:50,640
keep block of code.

2606
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:53,840
Right.

2607
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:55,920
All right.

2608
02:22:56,240 --> 02:22:59,280
So the example
you guys can can think of the scenario

2609
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:02,400
that when we did a guess number right.

2610
02:23:02,600 --> 02:23:06,920
I will continue asking the user
until he guesses the numbers.

2611
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:12,640
I will continue by the lottery
until I'm going to win.

2612
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:14,960
Right. I'm two. I'm going to win. Right.

2613
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:19,040
So in this particular scenario,
you'll go for a we for a while,

2614
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:23,080
but when you know in advance
will go for four.

2615
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:23,600
Right.

2616
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:28,560
So endless unless I want to repeat,
I want to say high five times.

2617
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:28,880
Right.

2618
02:23:29,960 --> 02:23:32,920
Let me go for

2619
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:53,520
it was three for gain.

2620
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:55,880
Four is what Four is a keyword right.

2621
02:23:55,880 --> 02:24:00,680
As soon as you click on Run, Java enters
you inside your main block.

2622
02:24:00,680 --> 02:24:00,920
Right.

2623
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:02,800
The event is inside your main block

2624
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:05,840
and then it's used
for as soon as it's important. No.

2625
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:08,160
What is the ID for this keyword?

2626
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:09,720
It's a loop.

2627
02:24:09,720 --> 02:24:11,120
What is a loop loop?

2628
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:15,720
I have to repeat block a fourth
as long as the condition is right.

2629
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:20,240
So the way the for loop we have to
initialize the variable integer.

2630
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:25,520
I set equal to one, then semicolon
right after the semicolon.

2631
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:27,080
We have a condition.

2632
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:31,120
I have to meet this condition to be true
five times next week.

2633
02:24:31,240 --> 02:24:34,160
Then and then I. Plus. Plus. Right.

2634
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:42,840
And then when we say we're saying hello.

2635
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:47,280
So any works exactly the same way guys
if you want to try to double right

2636
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:52,640
you're to try to block
so what happens right initialization

2637
02:24:53,800 --> 02:24:54,600
condition and

2638
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:57,560
right so
first our variable will be our initialize

2639
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:01,520
then we're going to check the condition.

2640
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:06,760
And as long as the condition is true
based, can you enter the block of code?

2641
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:08,760
Yes, we can enter the block of right.

2642
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:10,680
We enter in the block of code. Right.

2643
02:25:10,680 --> 02:25:14,040
Integer equals to one condition was true.

2644
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:16,200
That's why we printed Hello.

2645
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:20,160
Then after that, we're happens
and after that implementation happens

2646
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:22,120
after implementation again we check.

2647
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:23,320
And the condition.

2648
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:26,120
Condition
is to print in that. Hello. Right.

2649
02:25:26,400 --> 02:25:29,520
So it gives you very nice and very clean
loop.

2650
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:32,400
Right. Everything is set in the one line.

2651
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:36,560
You don't have to scroll up and down
to look for variables,

2652
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:38,240
to look for the increment. Right.

2653
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:39,360
It's a very beautiful.

2654
02:25:39,360 --> 02:25:41,840
That's very beautiful.
Very popular. Right.

2655
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:45,880
So now I want to show you guys
how the logic,

2656
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:48,920
how it could actually in CI.

2657
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:51,400
So this way you guys understand. Okay

2658
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:55,160
so how the code ups

2659
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:59,400
that people just extra squeezed in in here
so I can okay

2660
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:06,240
so so which action first happens first

2661
02:26:07,360 --> 02:26:11,560
first we initialize in the variable right
We are initializing the variable.

2662
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:16,320
Guess how many times overall
when we when we just started

2663
02:26:16,320 --> 02:26:19,440
learning course, how many times do
we have to initialize the variable

2664
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:26,040
initialization hope once, only once.

2665
02:26:26,040 --> 02:26:29,800
Remembering this right then
assigning the value,

2666
02:26:29,800 --> 02:26:33,560
reassigning that happen many times,
but initialization only once.

2667
02:26:33,560 --> 02:26:36,560
Right declaration integer
I What are we doing via

2668
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:39,920
declaring the variable
and then the initial initialize.

2669
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:42,120
And yet this process this happens
only once.

2670
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:45,320
Right?
Then what happens after that? Right.

2671
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:46,880
What happens after that.

2672
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:49,640
After that as a second step.

2673
02:26:49,640 --> 02:26:51,160
This as a second.

2674
02:26:51,160 --> 02:26:54,320
We are checking the condition
as a second step.

2675
02:26:54,320 --> 02:26:56,760
And please make sure you guys remember
this. Pass this.

2676
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:00,160
Then we check in the condition
this process happened.

2677
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:03,600
Second Now, after after

2678
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:07,920
the condition is true,
we are going inside the loop.

2679
02:27:08,280 --> 02:27:10,680
We are going inside the right.

2680
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:14,720
So then the code that we have, the abort
the code

2681
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:17,920
inside the loop body,
right inside the loop by

2682
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:21,120
will be executed.

2683
02:27:21,120 --> 02:27:27,120
So entire code, entire code
that starts from opening blueberry and

2684
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:29,760
closing the little body right.

2685
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:34,440
So after we execute your code,
this after we execute the code,

2686
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:37,080
when the Java goes back

2687
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:41,800
all in, only after it goes bad,
then they do incremental.

2688
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:45,400
So after number three,
this process happens,

2689
02:27:45,880 --> 02:27:48,040
implementation happens first

2690
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:52,080
and then after incrementally
shouldn't happen.

2691
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:56,400
Then again, what we are doing,
we are going to check

2692
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:58,480
for a condition, right?

2693
02:27:58,480 --> 02:28:01,440
And then because instrumentation happen
next time,

2694
02:28:01,440 --> 02:28:04,920
it will be will check
if tool is been sliced by two or three.

2695
02:28:05,520 --> 02:28:09,360
Now one condition is true again,
we are going back,

2696
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:14,080
executing the block of code
and then again we are going back.

2697
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:16,960
Remember, guys,
the loop cannot stop by itself.

2698
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:20,200
Right
loop done Java do anything by itself.

2699
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:22,480
We as a programmers instructed it right?

2700
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:24,480
Then it goes back again.

2701
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:27,480
It shows the condition of the checks,
the condition.

2702
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:31,560
So after implementation again
the checks condition

2703
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:35,080
after check the condition
if executes block of right.

2704
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:38,880
So this cycle continuously,
continuously repeating.

2705
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:43,240
Okay, implementation

2706
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:45,960
happens
only after the existing block of code.

2707
02:28:46,360 --> 02:28:48,160
So this way when we go back.

2708
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:52,400
When we go back only then implementation
happens and then condition it.

2709
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:53,000
Right.

2710
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:56,640
And this we can see,
we can see it while we debugging.

2711
02:28:56,760 --> 02:28:57,360
Right.

2712
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:00,000
So I guess see when we at the first line

2713
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:04,400
incremental tation checking,
the condition happens right away.

2714
02:29:04,440 --> 02:29:04,880
Right.

2715
02:29:04,880 --> 02:29:08,240
So this way because conditional was true

2716
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:11,680
now you I
you could see still equals to one right.

2717
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:14,880
It did not get incremental
because implementation did not happen

2718
02:29:15,640 --> 02:29:19,360
first
it's going to execute the block of code

2719
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:24,000
after is execute block of good
only then it come back, then it goes back.

2720
02:29:24,360 --> 02:29:27,960
And when it goes back
it will get incremented.

2721
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:30,560
And right away. It checks the condition.

2722
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:33,560
And if the condition is true,
then it goes inside.

2723
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:37,200
That's where you get to to right
then goes back.

2724
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:45,720
Implementation happens, implementation
happens, taking the condition,

2725
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:49,840
running the code,
going back in fermentation, the condition

2726
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:53,480
running code, implementation
chicken condition, running the code.

2727
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:57,200
You guys see now the value is five, right?

2728
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:59,560
The value is five.

2729
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:01,320
Now, Java does not stop.

2730
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:02,640
Java cannot stop.

2731
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:06,000
It knows its inside
before it's repeating the cycle.

2732
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:07,520
So now it goes back.

2733
02:30:07,520 --> 02:30:11,960
Now It will do increment
and it will check the condition.

2734
02:30:12,360 --> 02:30:14,160
Now condition will be false.

2735
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:17,720
When condition is false,
I cannot enter the loop body and.

2736
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:19,520
I'm going to miss

2737
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:27,960
weeks
because because we still increment red.

2738
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:32,160
Because we still increment.

2739
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:34,920
Yeah. First
you think that this all happens at once.

2740
02:30:34,920 --> 02:30:37,400
But no, this happened one time right away.

2741
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:41,880
Check the condition going inside
and after that only these two lines.

2742
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:43,560
Repeat increment check.

2743
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:45,440
Condition increment check.

2744
02:30:45,440 --> 02:30:48,600
Condition.

2745
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:49,440
You only modify it.

2746
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:52,800
Now, of course, guys,
remember what we're doing in the loop

2747
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:57,680
to repeat black of code,
to repeat block of code that we have right

2748
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:01,520
to repeat block of code that we have in
the Let's look at more things

2749
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:04,800
like we're going to repeat
what we've done before.

2750
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:07,680
So let me see.

2751
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:09,960
I want to print

2752
02:31:10,400 --> 02:31:13,560
numbers from 1 to 20.

2753
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:15,360
So how are we going to do it?

2754
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:16,800
Are you going to do this right?

2755
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:19,240
So now, right away,
when you think right, right.

2756
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:22,240
Well, when you think I want
you pray for 1 to 20,

2757
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:26,400
do I know in advance
how many times I want you print?

2758
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:29,360
Yes, because it's from 1 to 20. Right.

2759
02:31:29,360 --> 02:31:30,960
I have a starting point.

2760
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:33,000
I have the end point. Right.

2761
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:36,000
So most easiest loop to go
is a for a loop.

2762
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,040
Right? Right. Along is 34

2763
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,760
your I

2764
02:31:41,120 --> 02:31:41,680
equals two.

2765
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:42,720
What this

2766
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:51,440
one right.

2767
02:31:51,440 --> 02:31:54,720
High less or equal then 20.

2768
02:31:54,800 --> 02:31:55,160
Right.

2769
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:57,400
Because I'm looping all the way to 20

2770
02:31:58,400 --> 02:31:59,720
and then I

2771
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:03,440
and then
which variable they are printing is

2772
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:09,160
we are printed by that we are printing.

2773
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:09,720
Right.

2774
02:32:09,880 --> 02:32:13,800
And let's print maybe all in one line
so this way we can see it.

2775
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:18,160
Nice, like

2776
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:21,920
from 1 to 20.

2777
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:22,520
Right.

2778
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:26,920
So somewhere this right
somewhere what we can see.

2779
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:29,680
Right.
So the way I did your description. Right.

2780
02:32:29,680 --> 02:32:32,120
So first initialization

2781
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:38,800
we knew

2782
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:42,320
was then

2783
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:44,560
right, first initialization happened,

2784
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:48,280
then condition was specified.

2785
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:52,680
Specify look not what happens
this condition and then we have increment

2786
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:56,280
decrement like increment

2787
02:32:56,400 --> 02:32:58,560
increment slash decrement

2788
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:03,360
like chrome.

2789
02:33:04,840 --> 02:33:05,240
Right.

2790
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:06,600
Okay.

2791
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:10,800
Now where that is,
so where maybe you can hear about our

2792
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:15,480
for loop for someone,
it makes it easier because what we know

2793
02:33:15,720 --> 02:33:18,720
need to know how many times we are right
somewhere.

2794
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:21,640
What you might hear
is a first we put in our starting point

2795
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,560
start point

2796
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:26,880
right start point.

2797
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:29,160
Then we should have our end point

2798
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:32,160
and point

2799
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:37,680
and then third increment decrement
the same thing.

2800
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:41,240
So some of you can think of this, right?

2801
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,160
So what is my starting point?

2802
02:33:43,160 --> 02:33:46,200
My starting point is one,

2803
02:33:46,200 --> 02:33:47,560
What is my Indian point?

2804
02:33:47,560 --> 02:33:49,800
My Indian point is 20, right?

2805
02:33:49,800 --> 02:33:55,360
And then from 1 to 20, what I'm doing,
I am going increment in.

2806
02:33:55,360 --> 02:33:58,720
Right, I'm going,
I'm going to increase in the numbers.

2807
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:01,120
That's
why we're using that increment. Right.

2808
02:34:01,400 --> 02:34:05,040
So this way, let's say
I want to bring the numbers right.

2809
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:08,160
If I want to print the numbers from,

2810
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:10,360
I don't know, 100 to 20.

2811
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:10,920
Right.

2812
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:18,440
So now what is my starting this?

2813
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:21,120
I want to print from 100 to 20

2814
02:34:22,360 --> 02:34:24,720
integer I equals to 100.

2815
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:25,440
Right.

2816
02:34:25,960 --> 02:34:28,240
So what is my Indian point? Right.

2817
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:29,600
What is my Indian point?

2818
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:32,800
My ending point is 25 and 20.

2819
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:35,040
Now you just have to figure out, oops.

2820
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:37,280
Now you just have to figure out
the condition, Right?

2821
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:45,600
How do I make this condition to be true?

2822
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:47,880
What's more equal, less or equal? Right.

2823
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:50,760
And now when you really think now

2824
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:55,200
going from the largest number
going to the smallest, right.

2825
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:56,040
So what are you doing?

2826
02:34:56,040 --> 02:34:58,800
You are decreasing the values, right?

2827
02:34:58,800 --> 02:35:01,320
So now what you do, do I French minus

2828
02:35:02,560 --> 02:35:06,240
one. Now

2829
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:25,280
we can print our.

2830
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:27,720
Oh, what happened, guys? Why?
Why then why am I.

2831
02:35:27,720 --> 02:35:29,160
Look, did no work.

2832
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:36,680
Why am I no what?

2833
02:35:36,680 --> 02:35:38,240
My condition. Right.

2834
02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:42,480
My condition So and you guys see
works in the back this thing we're right

2835
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:47,720
variable got initialized
now we check and hey is 100 less than 20.

2836
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:50,680
No condition is false.
One condition is false.

2837
02:35:50,680 --> 02:35:53,040
I cannot the block of quote right.

2838
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:54,600
I cannot enter one.

2839
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:57,960
So now we have to change for a greater or

2840
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:01,280
it changed for the greater or equal Nagel.

2841
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:03,440
Now we got all the numbers right.

2842
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:08,600
We got all the numbers.

2843
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:09,600
Not all at once.

2844
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:10,320
Okay.

2845
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:14,560
Now, I think, Alex, you asked
what if I going to ask you right

2846
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:18,640
now, guys, I want you print

2847
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:21,720
numbers

2848
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:26,400
for one 250,

2849
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:28,440
but I want you print only

2850
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:34,400
human numbers.

2851
02:36:34,400 --> 02:36:36,960
So how are you guys going to do it
with the My

2852
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:21,400
we control is condition.

2853
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:22,600
Okay,

2854
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:34,720
that's good.

2855
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:40,640
Okay.

2856
02:37:40,640 --> 02:37:42,560
Right. So first, right.

2857
02:37:42,560 --> 02:37:46,320
If we're going to go
the way we were going to solve for right.

2858
02:37:46,320 --> 02:37:47,720
What is my starting point?

2859
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:51,360
My starting
point is one right here are equals to one.

2860
02:37:52,800 --> 02:37:57,040
Then how far in my loop in I'm open
all way to 50.

2861
02:37:57,320 --> 02:38:00,000
Right? All the way to 54, 1 to 50.

2862
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,440
I am incrementing right.

2863
02:38:01,440 --> 02:38:04,320
I was like,

2864
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:11,520
wow, if just going to print my equal,
if I'm just going to print my I.

2865
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:11,920
Right.

2866
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:13,400
So we know what happens

2867
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:18,160
if I'm just going to print
I without any condition what will happen.

2868
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:21,720
I will just one, two, three, four,
five fold the weight of that eight

2869
02:38:22,120 --> 02:38:24,960
I want you print only and only

2870
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:29,080
when my is an odd number right.

2871
02:38:29,080 --> 02:38:30,960
I have the condition right?

2872
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:35,200
If I want you print only only if the
I is even number

2873
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:39,080
then listen through the conditions
for the condition. If I

2874
02:38:40,360 --> 02:38:44,560
want two equals equals zero, I am only.

2875
02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:48,800
That will be the case
when I'm going to do my output.

2876
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:52,320
Only then I'm going to do my system.

2877
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:52,720
Right.

2878
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:54,840
So this is one way.

2879
02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:55,920
This is one way. Right.

2880
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:59,160
And let's let's look at

2881
02:38:59,480 --> 02:39:01,120
let's look at the logic, right?

2882
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:03,600
Let's look how this works, right?

2883
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:05,880
This code that we are looking

2884
02:39:05,880 --> 02:39:09,720
integer equals to one one is less than 50.

2885
02:39:09,720 --> 02:39:10,800
Condition is true.

2886
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:14,880
I am going inside as soon as I enter
my full body.

2887
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:17,760
Right this where my full body
and you go see everything is aligned.

2888
02:39:18,120 --> 02:39:19,640
This is where my full body start.

2889
02:39:19,640 --> 02:39:20,800
This is where my full body.

2890
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:25,640
It's right As soon as I enter
the body of my for loop,

2891
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:28,800
you will see if notice here

2892
02:39:28,840 --> 02:39:33,120
if one more to add, the first iteration
condition will be false.

2893
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:33,960
Right.

2894
02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:36,720
And you guys see
you don't worry right now.

2895
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:41,040
You don't worry right now
about where's your instrumentation,

2896
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:43,920
what course
your instrumentation is all in one line.

2897
02:39:44,280 --> 02:39:46,600
So now implementation will happen.

2898
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:51,120
So Now one, one plus one will give me.

2899
02:39:51,320 --> 02:39:53,400
Q Right, will give me two.

2900
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:54,760
Now check in the condition.

2901
02:39:54,760 --> 02:39:58,320
Hey, is two less than 50
Condition is true, right?

2902
02:39:58,320 --> 02:40:00,000
I'm going inside now.

2903
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,360
I'm saying here is two mod two.

2904
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:04,400
Yep it is a condition is true.

2905
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:08,680
Now I'm going to print, I'm going
to print two things and that same thing.

2906
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:11,040
It goes back repeats two plus one.

2907
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:14,320
Right? Two plus one will be three.

2908
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:16,080
Three is still less than 50.

2909
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,040
Condition is true.

2910
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,120
I'm going to inside now

2911
02:40:19,120 --> 02:40:23,200
inside I have if statement three
my two condition will be false.

2912
02:40:23,200 --> 02:40:25,840
I'm not printed right I'm look pretty.

2913
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:28,360
So now let's see.
I guess what would be the other way?

2914
02:40:28,360 --> 02:40:28,680
Right?

2915
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:32,400
We know that we can also know
implementation, right?

2916
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:35,240
That we know that
we can do incrimination by

2917
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,160
exact the same
thing, but we can do incrimination by two.

2918
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:41,000
Right.

2919
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:42,520
So now let's think is

2920
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:46,280
what should be my initialization
and condition in in everything.

2921
02:40:46,400 --> 02:40:48,800
Right.

2922
02:40:48,800 --> 02:40:51,720
So at first right

2923
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:53,640
we're saying, hey,
you know what I want to do?

2924
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:55,440
I want to increment by two.

2925
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:58,200
Can you increment by two? Yes,
you can increment by.

2926
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:02,600
But first you have to
initialize it into your I equals two.

2927
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:06,520
Now the only thing you have to think
I want only even numbers.

2928
02:41:06,920 --> 02:41:11,640
And if I'm going to increment
by two, right.

2929
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:14,760
If I'm going to increment by two

2930
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:18,520
now what should be my starting point is

2931
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:19,840
we can start with that.

2932
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:20,640
You no problem.

2933
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:24,120
We can start with the two
or we can start from the zero, right?

2934
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:26,080
Or we zero.

2935
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:26,920
We don't need zero free.

2936
02:41:26,920 --> 02:41:29,000
I'm going to start from two and in here.

2937
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:30,200
What's my condition? This

2938
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:43,320
by less or equals, right?

2939
02:41:43,640 --> 02:41:46,480
And then it is going to frame my

2940
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:58,520
what or why did we need

2941
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:04,120
space

2942
02:42:09,800 --> 02:42:10,320
figure.

2943
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:12,400
Right. Exactly the same footprint.

2944
02:42:12,400 --> 02:42:16,680
Even numbers from 1 to 50 exact
the same output here.

2945
02:42:17,240 --> 02:42:19,440
Exactly the same output in here.

2946
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:20,240
Right.

2947
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:24,840
So this is how our or

2948
02:42:26,360 --> 02:42:28,800
for loop works, right.

2949
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:31,720
Oh, let me ask you one more
and then I guess

2950
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:35,280
I'll give you I'll give you the task

2951
02:42:36,440 --> 02:42:41,760
and what will be the output of that

2952
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:56,160
or I can do

2953
02:42:58,240 --> 02:42:59,160
this one

2954
02:42:59,760 --> 02:43:03,000
I lost or equals 40

2955
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:16,160
I will come in What will be my output?

2956
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:38,520
This.

2957
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:39,760
Okay, Let me make it less.

2958
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:46,320
Let me make it less.

2959
02:43:46,320 --> 02:43:48,200
You guys already execute, right?

2960
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:50,280
The best way to execute it.

2961
02:43:50,280 --> 02:43:54,840
If you know the logic, how it works
inside, then all this makes it right.

2962
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:58,320
They initialize into one
take in that condition.

2963
02:43:58,600 --> 02:44:02,960
First I'm printing one going back Now.

2964
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:03,960
What are we doing to this?

2965
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:08,160
I would say one plus five right now.

2966
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:12,720
One plus five will give you six
because incrimination by five,

2967
02:44:13,080 --> 02:44:15,960
hey is still six less than 20 years.

2968
02:44:15,960 --> 02:44:19,960
Okay, then I'm printing I going back six

2969
02:44:19,960 --> 02:44:24,680
plus five will give 1111
still less than 20.

2970
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:28,080
We want to print 11 going back again
plus five.

2971
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:31,080
This will give us 16 and so. Right.

2972
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:35,520
And so the only difference what happened
in here, just my increment, right?

2973
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:39,240
I'm incrementing by five,
I'm incrementing by two.

2974
02:44:39,240 --> 02:44:43,960
And before I was just increment right.

2975
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:47,160
It's always,
always this p attention to the condition

2976
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:51,200
because condition must be true
before you enter the body.

2977
02:44:51,360 --> 02:44:51,720
Right.

2978
02:44:51,720 --> 02:44:55,560
And just look at your implementation
in documentation.

2979
02:44:55,880 --> 02:45:00,560
Right.

2980
02:45:00,560 --> 02:45:03,360
Right. So let me try to run it.

2981
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:04,320
What is the output?

2982
02:45:04,320 --> 02:45:07,240
This is the output
that we got right. Once it's

2983
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:29,200
I will be myself. I

2984
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,840
yes. So

2985
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:34,880
let's look at our slides
and I'll give you the task.

2986
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:36,600
I'll give it the time

2987
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:39,960
for loop.

2988
02:45:39,960 --> 02:45:40,560
Right.

2989
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:44,880
So they don't go for loop
exactly the same way

2990
02:45:44,920 --> 02:45:50,200
it uses to execute this same block output
several times.

2991
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:50,800
Right.

2992
02:45:50,880 --> 02:45:56,040
The only thing when we go, when we know
the number of repetition or we call them

2993
02:45:56,040 --> 02:46:00,200
the number of the iterations is fixed,
right?

2994
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:02,520
It's fixed means we know in advance.

2995
02:46:02,520 --> 02:46:04,200
That's how we'll probably see. Right.

2996
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:06,840
And when you look at this index,
we put it to different ways.

2997
02:46:06,840 --> 02:46:11,920
Initialization, condition, increment,
decrement or somewhere maybe we'll be

2998
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:17,120
you guys will see starting value in in
value and the same increment or decrement

2999
02:46:17,400 --> 02:46:22,360
and of course what we have, we have block
of code that we want to repeat, right.

3000
02:46:22,360 --> 02:46:24,480
That you want to repeat.

3001
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:25,000
Right.

3002
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,840
So initialization happens first,
then condition

3003
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:31,720
after the condition, right,
a body will be executed, right?

3004
02:46:31,720 --> 02:46:35,160
The bodies, the loop is executed
and only then increment

3005
02:46:35,160 --> 02:46:38,680
and decrement.

3006
02:46:38,680 --> 02:46:41,360
Here, two different examples
you guys will see.

3007
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:42,080
All right.

3008
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:43,960
And I'm going to give you the tests.

3009
02:46:43,960 --> 02:46:46,320
This the task is similar.

3010
02:46:46,360 --> 02:46:51,440
What we've done like now
it will make more sense.

3011
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:53,520
Use them the for loop. Right.

3012
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:54,600
For example. Right.

3013
02:46:55,680 --> 02:46:57,320
I'm going to give a next time

3014
02:46:57,320 --> 02:47:00,880
task a pre numbers from whatever right

3015
02:47:01,320 --> 02:47:04,800
you know the range
so now because you guys know three loops

3016
02:47:05,080 --> 02:47:08,200
you should be if you know in advance
how many times you should look

3017
02:47:08,200 --> 02:47:12,160
you should go for a or look like
you should go for the performance.

3018
02:47:12,680 --> 02:47:14,520
Okay let me give you the task.

3019
02:47:14,520 --> 02:47:18,400
And after that, guys,
I will be showing you more stuff.

3020
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:18,680
Right.

3021
02:47:18,680 --> 02:47:36,760
So let's send it in that,
of course, announcements.

3022
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:40,040
And one thing is,
even though it's a repetition, try

3023
02:47:40,040 --> 02:47:41,880
not to copy and paste this.

3024
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:44,040
Try not to copy paste. Okay.

3025
02:47:44,040 --> 02:47:45,840
Try not to copy and paste.

3026
02:47:45,840 --> 02:47:47,680
And you guys can do them right now.

3027
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:49,080
Yes, we'll do them right now.

3028
02:47:49,080 --> 02:47:51,040
Enough
that guys will be a break time. Right.

3029
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:53,440
I'll give you 10 minutes for the task.

3030
02:47:53,440 --> 02:47:55,520
I'll give you 15 for break. Right.

3031
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:57,080
So let's be back.

3032
02:47:57,080 --> 02:47:59,320
But please
make sure you complete the task. Right.

3033
02:47:59,360 --> 02:48:01,680
Because after that,
we will be looking at more things

3034
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:04,200
completely.

3035
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:08,120
Third and revised by right.

3036
02:48:08,120 --> 02:48:09,680
It will be 1525.

3037
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:12,880
By 148.

3038
02:48:12,880 --> 02:48:15,360
I you to do all of this and just come back

3039
02:48:15,360 --> 02:48:20,880
by 140.

3040
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:21,840
So copy and paste.

3041
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:26,320
Guys, I want you to do it because for look
we actually will be using a lot of the

3042
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:30,320
for loops, right So I want to make sure
you guys understand it.

3043
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:33,480
But I think after a while
it looks pretty pretty easy

3044
02:48:33,480 --> 02:48:38,120
and pretty, pretty clean for you now.

3045
02:48:38,120 --> 02:48:41,120
Well, I guess I'll be back at 140.

3046
02:48:42,360 --> 02:48:44,280
Are the tests that they are in.

3047
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:45,840
It's in the course and that's them.

3048
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:50,560
Okay.

3049
02:48:50,560 --> 02:49:04,440
All right.

3050
02:49:04,440 --> 02:49:05,480
They were you. You, you.

3051
02:49:05,480 --> 02:49:08,560
You did not get a chance to get a break,
will you?

3052
02:49:08,560 --> 02:49:12,480
Will you want to have a break there
very soon?

3053
02:49:12,480 --> 02:49:13,560
Too many tasks.

3054
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:21,040
Oh, that's a put a little extra hour.

3055
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:26,320
So and then the you
then you can take your break right.

3056
02:49:26,320 --> 02:49:27,520
You neither

3057
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:30,360
are I guess
you guys going to have a break soon right

3058
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:33,280
then then you guys going to have a one day
break from us.

3059
02:49:33,720 --> 02:49:38,200
Okay.

3060
02:49:38,200 --> 02:49:38,960
All right. Is right.

3061
02:49:38,960 --> 02:49:42,720
So let's look again.

3062
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:44,640
So what are we covering today?

3063
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:48,120
We looking into our loop concepts, right?

3064
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:52,440
So we say loop concepts in Java exists
to repeat a block of code.

3065
02:49:52,440 --> 02:49:53,080
Right?

3066
02:49:53,160 --> 02:49:55,880
So now Java. Now we just run three, right?

3067
02:49:55,880 --> 02:50:01,080
Java use a different variations
of the loops using different variations

3068
02:50:01,080 --> 02:50:05,120
because there's a difference scenarios

3069
02:50:05,400 --> 02:50:08,760
where we have to use each particular loop,
right?

3070
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:12,480
Regardless of kind of loops,
they will repeat block of code

3071
02:50:12,680 --> 02:50:15,000
as long as the condition true, right.

3072
02:50:15,400 --> 02:50:18,000
But Java gives a different variation

3073
02:50:18,240 --> 02:50:21,480
because we should use them
in different scenarios.

3074
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:22,120
Right?

3075
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:26,400
So Java sees, hey whenever you guys know,

3076
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:30,120
when you know in advance how many times

3077
02:50:30,480 --> 02:50:34,400
you want to execute a block of code right.

3078
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:37,280
You want to repeat block of good.

3079
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:41,040
Then please
make sure you go for a for loop right

3080
02:50:41,800 --> 02:50:45,240
when you know, hey,
I want you to do something five times.

3081
02:50:45,240 --> 02:50:47,360
Hey, I want to I don't know.

3082
02:50:47,360 --> 02:50:49,920
I want you the calculator
that we execute it right?

3083
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:53,480
I want to make that program run,
I don't know, five times.

3084
02:50:53,480 --> 02:50:54,480
Why five times?

3085
02:50:54,480 --> 02:50:57,200
Because I want to test different
conditions. Right.

3086
02:50:57,240 --> 02:50:59,280
For example, for this, Which statement

3087
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:02,400
was our homework?

3088
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:04,680
Right. For this switch statement.

3089
02:51:04,680 --> 02:51:07,680
I want to run this task

3090
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:11,680
five times y five times
because I want to provide value

3091
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:17,360
for multiplication value
from value for addition, subtraction.

3092
02:51:17,360 --> 02:51:19,200
And if there will be invalid write.

3093
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:21,840
I want this particular script
to be executed at 510

3094
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:26,680
so I'm able to test my OC,
then go for a four, go for a four.

3095
02:51:26,680 --> 02:51:27,840
Look right here.

3096
02:51:27,840 --> 02:51:30,000
What I would like that I would like to do.

3097
02:51:30,520 --> 02:51:32,400
I want to guess a number, right?

3098
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:34,440
I want to give the number.

3099
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:36,240
I want you to guess a number. Right.

3100
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:38,760
I want you to play a lottery
until you win.

3101
02:51:38,760 --> 02:51:40,920
Do you know how many times
you have to play?

3102
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:45,360
No. You don't know when in the scenarios
when you don't know how you how long

3103
02:51:45,360 --> 02:51:46,720
you want to repeat a block of.

3104
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:49,760
Could we go for a while?

3105
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:50,680
Loop. Right.

3106
02:51:50,680 --> 02:51:52,280
So now what do we go for?

3107
02:51:52,280 --> 02:51:53,040
Why loop?

3108
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:54,640
We have two variations, right?

3109
02:51:54,640 --> 02:51:56,280
We have a two origins.

3110
02:51:56,280 --> 02:51:59,440
We have a while
and we have do what we have.

3111
02:51:59,440 --> 02:52:01,320
Well, and we have a new well.

3112
02:52:01,320 --> 02:52:05,840
So now when you know that you don't know

3113
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:09,200
how many times you want to repeat,
but you want to repeat,

3114
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:12,520
as long as the condition is true right
now, just I do well.

3115
02:52:12,520 --> 02:52:13,240
Oh, well.

3116
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:14,320
So what is the difference?

3117
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:16,360
Well, we'll check the code first.

3118
02:52:16,360 --> 02:52:19,920
You will execute the code
first only, then checks the condition.

3119
02:52:19,920 --> 02:52:20,400
Right.

3120
02:52:20,520 --> 02:52:24,880
So now, based the particular scenario,
you guys will be able to see

3121
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:28,080
which you want to complete.

3122
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:30,720
Right. Which task you want to go right.

3123
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:31,720
And anything.

3124
02:52:31,720 --> 02:52:34,640
All those stars, guys, they were very

3125
02:52:34,640 --> 02:52:37,080
they were very similar
to what we have done before.

3126
02:52:37,440 --> 02:52:42,000
Now, the only thing where we seem that the
for loop is a more structure train loop.

3127
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:42,600
Right.

3128
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:46,120
Although this is a cleaner code.
All right.

3129
02:52:46,120 --> 02:52:50,680
So just by looking at one line,
you as a programmer can define

3130
02:52:50,680 --> 02:52:54,840
how many times you quote will execute,
right by looking at one line y

3131
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:57,600
because initialization, condition

3132
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:02,280
and implementation or documentation
specified all in one line.

3133
02:53:02,400 --> 02:53:02,760
Right?

3134
02:53:02,760 --> 02:53:04,440
So quite easily, easily.

3135
02:53:04,440 --> 02:53:06,720
I can read my work.

3136
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:12,320
So I bring an example of this
where we can actually very easy

3137
02:53:12,320 --> 02:53:16,760
right where we can see a benefit of the
what the benefit, what a little.

3138
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:21,720
But I can bring it exercise where
we can see how powerful loops are right.

3139
02:53:21,720 --> 02:53:22,920
For example this right

3140
02:53:24,880 --> 02:53:25,640
how we want to

3141
02:53:25,640 --> 02:53:28,680
create a multiplication table.

3142
02:53:28,680 --> 02:53:32,520
I want to create a multiplication tables
multiplication table.

3143
02:53:32,520 --> 02:53:33,600
We know those table, right?

3144
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:36,480
For example,
I want to create a multiplication

3145
02:53:36,480 --> 02:53:40,560
table of ones or twos or threes or force.

3146
02:53:40,560 --> 02:53:41,240
Right.

3147
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:44,160
So what I want you
to see in multiplication

3148
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:47,600
I want to see one flow one by one equals
two one, right.

3149
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:52,800
One by two is equals to two
and one by two is equal to three.

3150
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:53,360
Right.

3151
02:53:53,360 --> 02:53:57,840
So all way for example
I get one by ten equals to ten.

3152
02:53:58,080 --> 02:53:58,640
Right.

3153
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:03,000
And then if I want to change my table
we still then the same thing

3154
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:08,360
two by one equals two,
one two by two equals two two.

3155
02:54:08,360 --> 02:54:08,760
Right.

3156
02:54:08,760 --> 02:54:12,760
Two by three equal absurd to for us.

3157
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:13,600
Two by three

3158
02:54:14,720 --> 02:54:15,280
equals to

3159
02:54:15,280 --> 02:54:18,120
six all the way to by ten equals to 20.

3160
02:54:18,320 --> 02:54:18,920
Right.

3161
02:54:19,320 --> 02:54:22,040
So now this multiplication

3162
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:28,320
there's we can easily do with our
for loop.

3163
02:54:28,320 --> 02:54:29,120
Right.

3164
02:54:29,480 --> 02:54:34,200
So now do I know how many times
I want to print.

3165
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:39,720
Yes I know I want to print,
I want to multiply from 1 to 10.

3166
02:54:39,960 --> 02:54:41,280
Right. From 1 to 10.

3167
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:43,680
I want to multiply right.

3168
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:47,200
And then I want to multiply one by one
by one,

3169
02:54:47,200 --> 02:54:50,480
by two, by three, by four by five.

3170
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:51,320
Right.

3171
02:54:51,320 --> 02:54:54,920
So which variable do you guys think
be holding this values?

3172
02:54:54,920 --> 02:55:01,600
Which variable.

3173
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:03,000
Our I. Right.

3174
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:07,800
Our variable
that is keep getting income centered.

3175
02:55:07,800 --> 02:55:08,040
Right.

3176
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:11,560
That variable
that keeps getting incremented right now

3177
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:13,960
let's see how we can do it in our code.

3178
02:55:13,960 --> 02:55:15,520
Right. How we can do it now

3179
02:55:27,600 --> 02:55:30,720
for now, just simple one right
where we just

3180
02:55:31,760 --> 02:55:33,720
can multiply only one number, right?

3181
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:37,560
So let's say I want to do
multiplication of once, right?

3182
02:55:37,560 --> 02:55:43,080
And then if you want to do this right,
so I have my number integer num equals

3183
02:55:43,080 --> 02:55:46,680
to one right y
because I want to do multiplication

3184
02:55:46,680 --> 02:55:51,880
or once I want to do multiplication of one
from one all the way to ten.

3185
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:52,720
Right.

3186
02:55:52,800 --> 02:55:58,240
So now what will be my starting point
this integer

3187
02:55:58,240 --> 02:56:01,760
I equals to it.

3188
02:56:01,760 --> 02:56:05,640
We starting from one
because we want to do one by one, right?

3189
02:56:06,120 --> 02:56:08,200
One by one equals to one.

3190
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:16,680
And then how far are we going
this time last week was then turn

3191
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:19,320
and then incrementing or decrement in days

3192
02:56:24,440 --> 02:56:26,960
right.

3193
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:27,440
Right.

3194
02:56:29,040 --> 02:56:31,240
And then we are going to say here

3195
02:56:31,240 --> 02:56:35,640
we can just do print,
but now we can print out what is it?

3196
02:56:35,640 --> 02:56:38,160
What are we trying to do? We trying to do?

3197
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:41,880
I multiply by nothing.

3198
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:43,160
So in now let's go.

3199
02:56:43,160 --> 02:56:46,320
Now multiply by point nine.

3200
02:56:46,400 --> 02:56:47,160
Right.

3201
02:56:47,160 --> 02:56:48,360
So this way.

3202
02:56:48,360 --> 02:56:50,680
And now look. Now it's a constant
daily, right?

3203
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:51,800
It's not changing.

3204
02:56:51,800 --> 02:56:54,240
What will be changing in Malawi?

3205
02:56:54,320 --> 02:56:56,040
I will be right

3206
02:56:56,040 --> 02:57:00,400
First time, which will be one by one,
then one by two, then one by three.

3207
02:57:00,440 --> 02:57:00,800
Right.

3208
02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:05,000
And if I'm going to run here,
it gives me all the weight of ten, right?

3209
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:09,120
If I want to have a nice output,
let me add some things right.

3210
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:14,760
I'm going to say now, plus multiply right.

3211
02:57:14,760 --> 02:57:17,880
Multiply by I

3212
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:23,800
words. So

3213
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:26,920
those

3214
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:31,200
okay num one

3215
02:57:31,320 --> 02:57:36,160
multiplied by one right equals

3216
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:45,440
so num

3217
02:57:45,560 --> 02:57:48,360
multiply by i

3218
02:57:48,400 --> 02:57:53,480
which is one equals
none multiplied by right.

3219
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:58,400
So now let's see
what's going to happen next.

3220
02:57:58,400 --> 02:58:00,040
Right now we got our table.

3221
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:02,320
So now ac1

3222
02:58:02,320 --> 02:58:04,520
multiplied by

3223
02:58:05,080 --> 02:58:10,280
O are missing by multiply by nine.

3224
02:58:10,280 --> 02:58:13,080
And now what do we get? Right.

3225
02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:17,440
So one, it's a constant value
that comes from our now.

3226
02:58:17,880 --> 02:58:22,320
But what is changing
because our I inside to get an incremental

3227
02:58:22,320 --> 02:58:25,280
and this y value of I is changing from one

3228
02:58:25,960 --> 02:58:28,400
all the way to ten, right.

3229
02:58:28,400 --> 02:58:29,840
Yeah.
There are two different variables, right.

3230
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:34,160
Because you have to multiply,
you have to multiply one by all of this.

3231
02:58:34,160 --> 02:58:37,320
Then if you want to change to two,
we will have to multiply to

3232
02:58:37,320 --> 02:58:39,760
for all these values
and then three, right.

3233
02:58:39,840 --> 02:58:43,800
So now what we can do, we can change
nonselective right now what are we getting

3234
02:58:43,800 --> 02:58:47,160
get we get all the twos right,
we get all the tools.

3235
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:50,240
One day multiply by all the little ten.

3236
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:53,800
Right now you want to do
the multiplication table of nines

3237
02:58:53,840 --> 02:58:55,320
with you, click on it.

3238
02:58:55,320 --> 02:58:57,800
Now we get a multiplication of nine.

3239
02:58:57,880 --> 02:59:01,240
Same. So now it is the help of you guys.

3240
02:59:01,240 --> 02:59:05,520
We can easily, easily create
those multiplication tables right

3241
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:09,880
then how we are able to do it because
our marbles keeps getting incremented.

3242
02:59:09,880 --> 02:59:14,000
And here we just using
our theory, just using our

3243
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:16,880
arithmetic operation.

3244
02:59:16,880 --> 02:59:17,280
Right.

3245
02:59:17,320 --> 02:59:18,600
Or to make

3246
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:26,280
any questions those any questions

3247
02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:30,800
and I'm going

3248
02:59:30,800 --> 02:59:34,040
to show you so subjunctive for you.

3249
02:59:34,040 --> 02:59:35,280
You are very active.

3250
02:59:35,280 --> 02:59:38,040
Okay. What about? Okay, guys, let me ask
who has a question.

3251
02:59:38,040 --> 02:59:56,720
This tell me who at this
point has some questions.

3252
02:59:56,720 --> 02:59:56,960
Okay.

3253
02:59:56,960 --> 03:00:00,480
I want I want you best to before we go,
going to throw more stuff, right?

3254
03:00:01,240 --> 03:00:01,520
Okay.

3255
03:00:01,520 --> 03:00:03,560
Alexander, you have

3256
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:07,600
you just mentioned the concatenation
operator, right?

3257
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:10,280
Alexander
Because look here, you have a variable.

3258
03:00:10,600 --> 03:00:11,640
You try and content.

3259
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:14,200
You made the variable
with the string, right?

3260
03:00:14,200 --> 03:00:20,400
You concatenate your variable
with the string, you need a plus sign.

3261
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:25,800
Yes. Now, when I have different variables,
that's two different variables, right?

3262
03:00:25,800 --> 03:00:27,160
The problem when is a test?

3263
03:00:27,160 --> 03:00:28,320
Yes, but again,

3264
03:00:28,320 --> 03:00:33,120
so one thing when I give you all the task
and for example, when the time was up.

3265
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:33,840
Right.

3266
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:37,000
If you're not able to complete
all of them, it's okay.

3267
03:00:37,240 --> 03:00:41,200
So just make sure you don't leave them,
but complete them after the class.

3268
03:00:41,200 --> 03:00:42,840
Right. Because I know for some of you,

3269
03:00:43,880 --> 03:00:45,080
for some of you guys,

3270
03:00:45,080 --> 03:00:47,840
it might
you might need some time to think, Right.

3271
03:00:47,840 --> 03:00:51,320
Because some of you are very quick,
some of you for you, it takes a lot of

3272
03:00:51,680 --> 03:00:53,840
some time. It's okay. It's okay. Right.

3273
03:00:54,080 --> 03:00:55,200
So it just do it right there.

3274
03:00:55,200 --> 03:00:56,000
Go Get it right.

3275
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:59,520
So it does not matter
how long is going to take you from point

3276
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:02,600
A to point B, as long as you go in there.

3277
03:01:02,600 --> 03:01:03,640
Right. As long as you go.

3278
03:01:03,640 --> 03:01:06,000
And that's what's more important
because my my guess.

3279
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:07,800
And then you'll be looking for Jeb.

3280
03:01:07,800 --> 03:01:09,280
Maybe somebody will get a job

3281
03:01:09,280 --> 03:01:11,840
in two weeks,
maybe somebody will get it in two months.

3282
03:01:12,280 --> 03:01:16,760
Don't really matter what's matter
that you're ending point, is that right?

3283
03:01:16,760 --> 03:01:19,080
That's well, we all have our own piece

3284
03:01:24,240 --> 03:01:25,560
of the programing background.

3285
03:01:25,560 --> 03:01:27,040
Yes. That that probably will help.

3286
03:01:27,040 --> 03:01:30,600
But majority of you guys are not right
in know it will be helpful guys

3287
03:01:30,840 --> 03:01:32,560
make sure you can practice in practice

3288
03:01:32,560 --> 03:01:34,840
and because I'm sure
some of you guys did not have a

3289
03:01:36,240 --> 03:01:38,800
programing background and I'm
sure you guys are doing them great.

3290
03:01:39,360 --> 03:01:42,760
Okay, so let me just write one more quote.

3291
03:01:42,800 --> 03:01:47,120
Very simple, very simple. Put.

3292
03:01:47,120 --> 03:01:48,000
So let me do that.

3293
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:51,240
For example,
I want to print numbers, right integer

3294
03:01:51,240 --> 03:01:57,200
I equals to one I let's equal then 20.

3295
03:01:57,480 --> 03:01:59,680
And for example,
I just want to print a numbers

3296
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:03,120
and then I'll do I plus equals two.

3297
03:02:03,360 --> 03:02:04,000
Right?

3298
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:06,720
And then I'm just going to print it all

3299
03:02:09,440 --> 03:02:17,000
by. So that's one of your exercises.

3300
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:17,520
That's right.

3301
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:25,440
How to print the numbers right.

3302
03:02:25,440 --> 03:02:29,240
It's no different.

3303
03:02:29,240 --> 03:02:32,200
Right. I'm going to run.
You guys know what happens, right?

3304
03:02:32,200 --> 03:02:37,080
So we are printing all the other numbers,
all the ones I know.

3305
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:39,600
I have a question. How think is.

3306
03:02:40,720 --> 03:02:42,880
Remember when we said,

3307
03:02:42,880 --> 03:02:46,080
hey, why not have a variable, right?

3308
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:50,880
When we have a variable here
we have integer num equals to nine.

3309
03:02:51,400 --> 03:02:55,080
If I'm going to create
another variable integer num,

3310
03:02:55,080 --> 03:02:58,720
I'm going to say equal to my compiler
completes.

3311
03:02:58,720 --> 03:02:59,040
Right?

3312
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:00,800
So you guys know who is complaining
right now.

3313
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:02,400
Your compiler

3314
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:05,120
shows you that there's an issue, right?

3315
03:03:05,560 --> 03:03:10,400
So what it tells you, it tells you
that there's a duplicate variable, right?

3316
03:03:10,640 --> 03:03:12,160
So we already know in this case, right.

3317
03:03:12,160 --> 03:03:14,400
So that we cannot have two variables

3318
03:03:15,400 --> 03:03:18,440
with the same name within one,

3319
03:03:19,720 --> 03:03:22,880
I would say right now
method within one main method.

3320
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:23,520
Okay.

3321
03:03:23,880 --> 03:03:26,920
So this will give us an arrow
as a duplicate right.

3322
03:03:26,920 --> 03:03:28,920
But now

3323
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:31,800
when we go into all of this,

3324
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:36,640
then how is it
I am able to I have to declare a variable

3325
03:03:36,640 --> 03:03:41,280
I in here and to declare the variable
I in here.

3326
03:03:41,320 --> 03:03:41,680
Right.

3327
03:03:41,680 --> 03:03:45,600
So why my compiler is not complaining
right now?

3328
03:03:45,880 --> 03:03:48,680
Why am Java is not getting confused?

3329
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:52,640
Okay, so now let's
when it comes to variables, right?

3330
03:03:52,960 --> 03:03:56,200
So now it's important where you

3331
03:03:56,320 --> 03:03:59,360
right where you declared this variable.

3332
03:03:59,600 --> 03:04:00,120
Okay.

3333
03:04:00,280 --> 03:04:03,840
So now when it comes to declaration
of variable num,

3334
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:07,240
you guys see I declared my name.

3335
03:04:07,440 --> 03:04:07,680
Okay.

3336
03:04:07,680 --> 03:04:11,440
Inside my main block of code,
our main is the method.

3337
03:04:11,440 --> 03:04:17,200
So it means this variable right now
this is visible to the entire block.

3338
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:18,200
This block

3339
03:04:19,200 --> 03:04:23,040
Now, when we are declaring the variable I,

3340
03:04:23,520 --> 03:04:27,400
we are declaring it inside our for loop.

3341
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:31,480
So it means this variable, this
this variable

3342
03:04:31,480 --> 03:04:35,840
right now is visible
only to this block of code.

3343
03:04:35,840 --> 03:04:39,960
That's where it being created
and that's where it release.

3344
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:40,640
Okay.

3345
03:04:40,800 --> 03:04:45,040
So the same thing, this variable,
I only belongs to this block.

3346
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:47,440
What is the what is this?

3347
03:04:48,480 --> 03:04:51,920
Let's say I don't know where is that
where it starts leaving the word in

3348
03:04:51,920 --> 03:04:55,960
and it starts
where are you using your for loop

3349
03:04:56,360 --> 03:04:59,400
and the variable ends

3350
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:02,400
at the time
when you are exiting your form.

3351
03:05:02,560 --> 03:05:03,120
Okay.

3352
03:05:03,160 --> 03:05:07,600
So that's why guys,
we are able to create the variable in here

3353
03:05:07,960 --> 03:05:10,720
and be able to create a variable
I in here.

3354
03:05:10,720 --> 03:05:13,560
Our java is not complaining. Why?

3355
03:05:13,880 --> 03:05:17,840
Because this variable I
it lives inside this block

3356
03:05:18,360 --> 03:05:23,480
and it's not visible to this variable
I that lives inside this block.

3357
03:05:23,640 --> 03:05:24,000
Okay.

3358
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,640
So this variable belongs to this for loop.

3359
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:27,760
This variable.

3360
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:29,960
I belongs to this form.

3361
03:05:30,120 --> 03:05:31,560
Okay. Why?

3362
03:05:31,560 --> 03:05:34,720
Because it has been declared
inside this for loop

3363
03:05:34,720 --> 03:05:37,040
and this has been declared
inside this form.

3364
03:05:37,520 --> 03:05:42,400
So that's why I guess now when it comes
to creating these variables, we can loops

3365
03:05:42,400 --> 03:05:47,880
we can easy easily declared this variable
here and e declare this variable here.

3366
03:05:47,960 --> 03:05:49,280
Right. So no,

3367
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:51,240
we will

3368
03:05:51,240 --> 03:05:53,800
look at this example right
first time when I

3369
03:05:56,080 --> 03:05:59,280
first started, when I wrote this code,
the number of days

3370
03:05:59,640 --> 03:06:03,360
before I did not declared right,
let me remove this line.

3371
03:06:03,960 --> 03:06:06,480
So at first time I did, guys,

3372
03:06:06,480 --> 03:06:10,040
I declared my variable inside here, Inside
here.

3373
03:06:10,200 --> 03:06:12,480
Right. So what happened?

3374
03:06:12,480 --> 03:06:15,160
This is why my compiler in here

3375
03:06:15,480 --> 03:06:19,440
complaining right?

3376
03:06:19,440 --> 03:06:20,960
Yes. Yes.

3377
03:06:21,640 --> 03:06:23,280
So that's what it happens. Yep.

3378
03:06:23,280 --> 03:06:28,200
So once it exists, that block your
variable, get in remove from the memory.

3379
03:06:28,200 --> 03:06:30,480
Yep. That's exactly what happens. Right.

3380
03:06:30,480 --> 03:06:35,040
So exactly this same exact
this thing happens in here guys.

3381
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:35,600
Right.

3382
03:06:35,800 --> 03:06:38,640
So where we declare error

3383
03:06:38,640 --> 03:06:43,400
in our variable user number where we are
declaring a variable, use a number,

3384
03:06:43,680 --> 03:06:48,640
you are declaring it inside your do body,
you declare it inside your do body.

3385
03:06:48,960 --> 03:06:54,720
Now, this variable
E was not visible outside of this block.

3386
03:06:54,960 --> 03:06:57,440
It was not visible outside of this block.

3387
03:06:57,760 --> 03:07:02,880
That's your compiler tells you in here,
Hey, use a number.

3388
03:07:02,880 --> 03:07:05,160
I cannot resolve it to a variable. Right?

3389
03:07:05,160 --> 03:07:09,240
That's why here it tells you
that you have to create that right.

3390
03:07:09,240 --> 03:07:13,360
You have to created Y
because your code is not seen

3391
03:07:13,600 --> 03:07:16,560
because this variable was created
inside this block.

3392
03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:17,280
Okay.

3393
03:07:17,280 --> 03:07:20,640
So and this variable
you guys will be looking more into them.

3394
03:07:21,400 --> 03:07:24,000
This variable,
we call them local variables.

3395
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:28,720
They are local to the block
where they have been declared.

3396
03:07:28,720 --> 03:07:31,480
Okay, you guys are going to have a
complete, complete separate class on that.

3397
03:07:31,800 --> 03:07:34,920
But this is just to explain you,
why is it happening?

3398
03:07:34,920 --> 03:07:39,400
So that's why what we did,
we did a declaration in here, right?

3399
03:07:39,400 --> 03:07:43,960
We did a declaration outside of do block.

3400
03:07:43,960 --> 03:07:46,560
We did it
where we're this variables declared.

3401
03:07:46,560 --> 03:07:49,080
Is this variables declared inside my name.

3402
03:07:49,560 --> 03:07:53,400
So once I declared inside my mean
this variable is e

3403
03:07:53,640 --> 03:07:58,520
is invisible to or everywhere
invisible to all the blocks.

3404
03:07:58,520 --> 03:07:59,120
Right.

3405
03:07:59,160 --> 03:08:04,560
So now when we declared inside the line
20, that's why on the line 25

3406
03:08:04,840 --> 03:08:08,360
what we seen is seen shows
that s as a duplicate

3407
03:08:08,400 --> 03:08:12,080
Y, because now
you declare this variable inside the mean

3408
03:08:12,280 --> 03:08:17,280
and if you declare it inside the name,
it's visible to every single block.

3409
03:08:17,680 --> 03:08:20,920
Lulu that we use in, in our code.

3410
03:08:21,160 --> 03:08:23,280
Okay. So that's why I'm here now.

3411
03:08:23,680 --> 03:08:28,000
Once we declare now,
we can be neutralized.

3412
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:29,360
That's why we created this place

3413
03:08:30,560 --> 03:08:35,520
in space.

3414
03:08:36,040 --> 03:08:39,440
So now if I'll go back in here,
I'll go back in here.

3415
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:40,480
Now, look this.

3416
03:08:40,480 --> 03:08:44,000
If I'm going to print out this out.

3417
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:48,120
All right, so now where am I to start?

3418
03:08:48,120 --> 03:08:49,800
What is the difference between this?

3419
03:08:49,800 --> 03:08:52,840
It's out and what is it
difference between this isn't right

3420
03:08:53,280 --> 03:08:56,960
so this is out is seen variable I Why?

3421
03:08:56,960 --> 03:08:59,800
Because you are still inside your body.

3422
03:09:00,240 --> 03:09:02,280
You're still your full body.

3423
03:09:02,280 --> 03:09:07,200
But as soon as you take it outside,
as soon as you're taking it outside

3424
03:09:07,200 --> 03:09:12,000
of your loop right outside of you,
you're variable eight not visible.

3425
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:15,920
If that's what compiler tells,
you can not resolve to a variable.

3426
03:09:16,840 --> 03:09:17,520
Right?

3427
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:19,680
You cannot resolve there. But why?

3428
03:09:19,800 --> 03:09:25,120
Because this variable I is visible
only for you for look.

3429
03:09:25,440 --> 03:09:28,600
Okay, now here

3430
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:33,520
all my guys trying to explain it to you
why we are able to use integer R in here

3431
03:09:33,880 --> 03:09:36,960
and declared
the same integer variable in here. Why?

3432
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:40,680
Because they're declared inside
two independent loops.

3433
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:43,920
Right. This is loop works by itself.

3434
03:09:44,200 --> 03:09:46,920
This is a loop that works by itself
you're variable.

3435
03:09:46,920 --> 03:09:52,800
I lives in here and as soon as you exist
for loop, it does not leave anymore.

3436
03:09:52,800 --> 03:09:53,400
Right.

3437
03:09:53,400 --> 03:09:55,960
So let me show
you actually in the debugging to this

3438
03:09:56,400 --> 03:09:57,760
you will see if in the debugging

3439
03:09:59,080 --> 03:10:03,520
you right.

3440
03:10:03,720 --> 03:10:05,640
So you will see what happened.

3441
03:10:05,640 --> 03:10:07,800
My code, right?

3442
03:10:07,960 --> 03:10:10,000
Yes. It's local foods block Right.

3443
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:11,080
This local voice.

3444
03:10:11,080 --> 03:10:14,600
So you may see
as soon as I'm entering my name, right,

3445
03:10:14,680 --> 03:10:19,800
as soon as I'm entering my mean job, Java
executes the top to the bottom, right?

3446
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:26,160
Until it sees either if condition, until
it sees either for either loop, right?

3447
03:10:26,160 --> 03:10:29,880
Because now when it sees
and if it has to do this

3448
03:10:29,880 --> 03:10:33,480
selective execution
or when it sees the loop,

3449
03:10:33,480 --> 03:10:35,880
it has to do repeated execution.

3450
03:10:37,040 --> 03:10:39,200
And now I want you pay
attention to the variable.

3451
03:10:39,200 --> 03:10:42,680
So you see you declared a variable name

3452
03:10:43,320 --> 03:10:47,760
outside of any block, right outside of
when you block, it belongs to you.

3453
03:10:47,800 --> 03:10:50,280
Me, it belongs to me. That's
why it's in here.

3454
03:10:50,400 --> 03:10:51,520
Visible, right?

3455
03:10:51,520 --> 03:10:52,360
So variable.

3456
03:10:52,360 --> 03:10:54,880
I still did not get created. Right?

3457
03:10:54,880 --> 03:11:00,160
So now it gets created only normally
when you go into enter your right.

3458
03:11:00,600 --> 03:11:02,680
When you enter your for,
let's say, your variable.

3459
03:11:02,680 --> 03:11:04,640
I comes up in here right

3460
03:11:04,640 --> 03:11:08,440
now, I'll be executing my for loop
ten times one one windows

3461
03:11:10,080 --> 03:11:12,280
and right

3462
03:11:12,280 --> 03:11:17,840
then right So what is the value of I
the value of my is right now ten.

3463
03:11:17,840 --> 03:11:18,680
Right.

3464
03:11:18,680 --> 03:11:21,560
I am still inside my four body. Right.

3465
03:11:21,560 --> 03:11:23,520
So now what will happen?

3466
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:26,400
I will be going back. I'll be going back.

3467
03:11:26,400 --> 03:11:30,520
I am incrementing my I now my
I will become 11.

3468
03:11:31,040 --> 03:11:33,880
11 is not less than a ten.

3469
03:11:33,960 --> 03:11:35,600
Right. So now you guys practice.

3470
03:11:35,600 --> 03:11:40,080
What happens is my
I as as I'm exit in my for loop that's it

3471
03:11:40,080 --> 03:11:44,520
my variable either disappear
okay my variable either disappeared

3472
03:11:44,760 --> 03:11:48,240
so it's not there any memory anymore
a get vanished right

3473
03:11:48,240 --> 03:11:53,400
as soon as you exit in your
for loop variable I is vanished.

3474
03:11:53,480 --> 03:11:53,960
Right.

3475
03:11:54,080 --> 03:11:57,280
So this way
when you go to the next loop here,

3476
03:11:57,280 --> 03:12:01,200
it looks like a complete brand
new variable that is getting created.

3477
03:12:01,440 --> 03:12:06,600
And this variable going to leave
as long as you were executing for it.

3478
03:12:07,080 --> 03:12:10,720
That's why I this they are this variable
that we've only inside this block.

3479
03:12:10,920 --> 03:12:13,160
This item is only inside this block.

3480
03:12:13,560 --> 03:12:13,800
Right.

3481
03:12:13,800 --> 03:12:17,360
That's why are able to repeat
the exact same variable.

3482
03:12:17,360 --> 03:12:21,960
But now when it comes to variable nine,
it stays there in the memory

3483
03:12:22,440 --> 03:12:26,320
all the way until you've finished
execution.

3484
03:12:26,320 --> 03:12:27,360
Your Me Why?

3485
03:12:27,360 --> 03:12:29,960
Because it was declared
outside of any blocks

3486
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:32,360
anyone's

3487
03:12:32,680 --> 03:12:34,920
right now again, when you create it, I'm

3488
03:12:34,920 --> 03:12:38,560
the only one
and your variable is to exist.

3489
03:12:38,560 --> 03:12:44,560
Big needs, big needs exist all the way
until all the way into executing

3490
03:12:44,560 --> 03:12:49,800
you loop right now, once you go
back, 19 will get changed to 21.

3491
03:12:50,160 --> 03:12:52,360
21 is not less than 20.

3492
03:12:52,360 --> 03:12:54,920
Now you are existing for loop, right?

3493
03:12:54,960 --> 03:12:56,640
You are rainfall.

3494
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:59,160
So that's why you variable either
disappeared.

3495
03:12:59,600 --> 03:13:03,840
All you do you you do all of this
the number and once you exist you mean

3496
03:13:04,040 --> 03:13:07,920
and then of course the thing

3497
03:13:08,560 --> 03:13:10,320
there's a little thing
that I wanted to show you

3498
03:13:10,320 --> 03:13:14,320
why we're able to have integer
I integer I in

3499
03:13:14,320 --> 03:13:19,280
both of those.

3500
03:13:19,280 --> 03:13:19,840
Okay.

3501
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:22,280
It's I'm going to write

3502
03:13:23,400 --> 03:13:25,080
what is there really

3503
03:13:25,560 --> 03:13:30,000
there's not really relationship guys
this one variable and this is another able

3504
03:13:30,120 --> 03:13:34,600
to see the only thing this variable
is a variable that belongs to the main.

3505
03:13:35,160 --> 03:13:39,800
This variable is
it belongs to your for or that's okay.

3506
03:13:40,200 --> 03:13:43,680
More details you guys will learn in
in the future classes.

3507
03:13:43,680 --> 03:13:46,560
They are actually different
type of variables we have.

3508
03:13:46,600 --> 03:13:49,440
Okay.
So now we're just using this type later.

3509
03:13:49,440 --> 03:13:53,160
They will there will be some variables
where you can declare else

3510
03:13:53,520 --> 03:13:56,880
outside of your main and there will be
different name for those variables.

3511
03:13:56,880 --> 03:14:04,960
Okay.

3512
03:14:04,960 --> 03:14:05,600
All right.

3513
03:14:05,600 --> 03:14:07,560
Let me do more examples.

3514
03:14:07,560 --> 03:14:11,040
So now we will do more examples
just to practice

3515
03:14:11,040 --> 03:14:15,200
on developing our logic and,
you know, to analyze in the quote.

3516
03:14:15,720 --> 03:14:16,800
That's what we're going to do.

3517
03:14:18,160 --> 03:14:20,520
Now. I'm just going to create

3518
03:14:20,800 --> 03:14:25,280
what I for.

3519
03:14:25,280 --> 03:14:37,080
Now let me just make it more for loops.

3520
03:14:37,080 --> 03:14:43,480
So let me give you a

3521
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:46,680
I'm going to write the code

3522
03:14:47,120 --> 03:14:48,000
on the right B code.

3523
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:51,960
But my question is my question is
I want you to give the output

3524
03:14:52,240 --> 03:14:56,840
so you guys, not you guys not running it,
but I want you to look at the current,

3525
03:14:56,840 --> 03:15:05,200
analyze it what is the output?

3526
03:15:05,200 --> 03:15:06,040
Well,

3527
03:15:08,600 --> 03:15:12,440
I'm going to have a loop, right
for Going to say it.

3528
03:15:12,640 --> 03:15:16,080
I believe you are equals to one

3529
03:15:18,360 --> 03:15:18,840
integer.

3530
03:15:18,840 --> 03:15:22,560
I I for example less or equal then

3531
03:15:23,240 --> 03:15:25,400
and as both

3532
03:15:26,920 --> 03:15:30,960
we actually know when you're 20

3533
03:15:32,280 --> 03:15:36,640
let's go 51i want maybe six.

3534
03:15:37,040 --> 03:15:39,400
We'll go for six. Right.

3535
03:15:39,400 --> 03:15:42,040
And then let's

3536
03:15:42,800 --> 03:15:43,560
And now what?

3537
03:15:43,560 --> 03:15:47,800
I want you to do this Now
what I'm going to do, I am going,

3538
03:15:48,280 --> 03:15:50,960
I am going to introduce one variable.

3539
03:15:51,480 --> 03:15:54,000
Okay,
we're going to introduce one variable.

3540
03:15:54,720 --> 03:15:56,520
I want to say integers. Some

3541
03:16:02,240 --> 03:16:02,880
actually I have

3542
03:16:02,880 --> 03:16:06,000
two interesting integers,
some equals to zero.

3543
03:16:06,640 --> 03:16:10,400
Now, inside my loop,
I'm going to write a code.

3544
03:16:10,560 --> 03:16:17,880
I'm going to see them less equals.

3545
03:16:17,880 --> 03:16:21,960
And now outside of do
I want to print the value of my variable.

3546
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:25,520
So now by looking at this code,

3547
03:16:25,520 --> 03:16:30,960
guess by looking at this code
without running, I want you to tell me

3548
03:16:30,960 --> 03:16:34,080
what will be the value of some

3549
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:44,040
21. Okay.

3550
03:16:44,040 --> 03:16:47,720
One, two, three, 456 21

3551
03:16:49,880 --> 03:16:55,440
six plus seven divided by 218

3552
03:17:00,720 --> 03:17:05,680
118 one, 234, five, 611, eight, whatever.

3553
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:08,000
So in the 1118.

3554
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:13,400
Okay, one, two,

3555
03:17:13,400 --> 03:17:16,280
three, four, five, one,
two, three, four, five. Okay

3556
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:24,720
620 161 and four.

3557
03:17:25,320 --> 03:17:25,800
Okay,

3558
03:17:26,720 --> 03:17:33,360
four.

3559
03:17:33,360 --> 03:17:34,560
We are not running the core guys.

3560
03:17:34,560 --> 03:17:36,560
I just want you to analyze it. Right.

3561
03:17:36,560 --> 03:17:38,640
So I'm going to ask you why.

3562
03:17:38,640 --> 03:17:41,360
Why 21 Why seven Y6

3563
03:17:55,320 --> 03:17:56,520
You would say six.

3564
03:17:56,520 --> 03:17:59,760
Okay, now we are

3565
03:18:01,080 --> 03:18:03,040
let's look at select analyze, right?

3566
03:18:03,040 --> 03:18:06,200
It's important to understand
what happens in our code.

3567
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:07,960
Right? Okay.

3568
03:18:07,960 --> 03:18:10,360
So first of all, guys, can you tell me

3569
03:18:12,240 --> 03:18:14,800
how many print out statements
am I going to see?

3570
03:18:14,800 --> 03:18:17,040
How many print out statements
am I going to see

3571
03:18:19,800 --> 03:18:21,560
one way?

3572
03:18:21,560 --> 03:18:26,840
One because my print out statement
is not inside loop, right?

3573
03:18:26,840 --> 03:18:28,440
It means it won't be repeated.

3574
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:30,640
We just single independent speak, right?

3575
03:18:30,880 --> 03:18:33,200
So it will be printed once.

3576
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:34,640
Okay. Okay.

3577
03:18:34,640 --> 03:18:38,520
So now let's analyze it.

3578
03:18:38,520 --> 03:18:40,480
We're bringing this up.

3579
03:18:40,480 --> 03:18:43,120
Let's write something new.

3580
03:18:43,120 --> 03:18:44,320
Looking for the variable.

3581
03:18:44,320 --> 03:18:47,040
This variable has a value of zero for now.

3582
03:18:47,120 --> 03:18:47,720
Right?

3583
03:18:48,280 --> 03:18:51,040
So now we know what happens in a year.

3584
03:18:51,040 --> 03:18:52,960
Declaration check.

3585
03:18:52,960 --> 03:18:55,120
And the condition is
the condition is true. Guess

3586
03:19:00,120 --> 03:19:01,080
condition is true.

3587
03:19:01,080 --> 03:19:03,240
I am going inside.

3588
03:19:03,280 --> 03:19:05,000
Once I entered inside.

3589
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:06,240
What are we doing in here?

3590
03:19:06,240 --> 03:19:08,040
This are we doing

3591
03:19:15,800 --> 03:19:18,720
increasing some by one.

3592
03:19:18,720 --> 03:19:19,040
Right.

3593
03:19:19,040 --> 03:19:20,280
But what are we doing?

3594
03:19:20,280 --> 03:19:23,040
We are incrementing we are adding right?

3595
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:28,680
We are in the value the variable
I so basically what we're saying is saying

3596
03:19:28,680 --> 03:19:31,880
zero plus one, right.

3597
03:19:32,240 --> 03:19:33,640
Zero plus one.

3598
03:19:33,640 --> 03:19:36,120
What it will us it will give us one.

3599
03:19:36,640 --> 03:19:38,760
So now what happened?

3600
03:19:38,760 --> 03:19:41,040
A previous sum that was zero.

3601
03:19:41,040 --> 03:19:45,840
We take it out now
the sum the value of some equal to one.

3602
03:19:45,960 --> 03:19:47,440
Right. Okay.

3603
03:19:47,440 --> 03:19:50,280
Then what happens with our loop

3604
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:57,560
goes back,

3605
03:19:57,600 --> 03:20:00,240
implementation happens one plus

3606
03:20:01,440 --> 03:20:03,840
equals two to

3607
03:20:04,040 --> 03:20:05,880
check in the condition.

3608
03:20:05,880 --> 03:20:07,520
Condition is true.

3609
03:20:07,520 --> 03:20:11,840
Now, when condition is true,
I'm going inside now what are we doing?

3610
03:20:11,880 --> 03:20:18,200
Is so what happens inside?

3611
03:20:18,200 --> 03:20:22,400
So it takes a value of some
which is was one.

3612
03:20:22,640 --> 03:20:27,080
And now what it does, it adds the of I
what is the value of

3613
03:20:27,080 --> 03:20:31,840
I is two one plus two will give me three.

3614
03:20:32,120 --> 03:20:35,200
Right. And then cycle repeats. Right.

3615
03:20:35,520 --> 03:20:40,280
It goes back to plus
one will give me three.

3616
03:20:40,960 --> 03:20:43,040
Three is still less than six.

3617
03:20:43,200 --> 03:20:43,800
Right.

3618
03:20:43,800 --> 03:20:46,440
Okay. Condition Is true. I'm going inside.

3619
03:20:46,800 --> 03:20:50,160
So now what I'm doing, I'm
taking the value of some

3620
03:20:50,520 --> 03:20:53,320
and adding the value of I.

3621
03:20:53,400 --> 03:20:55,920
Right. Three plus three, right.

3622
03:20:57,520 --> 03:21:01,120
013 plus three equals to six.

3623
03:21:01,280 --> 03:21:04,000
Right. Plus equals to six.

3624
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:08,280
Now going back three plus one is

3625
03:21:08,280 --> 03:21:11,000
four is four still less than six.

3626
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:13,440
Yep. Four is still less than six.

3627
03:21:13,440 --> 03:21:15,480
Right Condition is true.

3628
03:21:15,480 --> 03:21:18,960
Now what was the last value
of some less value of sound was six

3629
03:21:19,240 --> 03:21:21,960
and now six plus I is four.

3630
03:21:22,080 --> 03:21:22,800
Right?

3631
03:21:23,200 --> 03:21:27,480
And then get ten
and then we will have ten plus five.

3632
03:21:27,560 --> 03:21:27,960
Right.

3633
03:21:27,960 --> 03:21:31,440
Because I will get incremented
by one right.

3634
03:21:31,440 --> 03:21:33,840
Condition of five is still true.

3635
03:21:33,840 --> 03:21:36,720
Ten plus five people will get 15 right.

3636
03:21:36,720 --> 03:21:41,200
Then next time going back,
I plus one will give a six

3637
03:21:42,280 --> 03:21:44,400
weeks. He still than six.

3638
03:21:44,400 --> 03:21:46,760
And then we get 15 plus six

3639
03:21:47,840 --> 03:21:50,080
plus.

3640
03:21:50,080 --> 03:21:54,280
That's
where we going to get what 21 right.

3641
03:21:55,240 --> 03:21:57,360
When get one.

3642
03:21:57,360 --> 03:21:59,520
So what is going to change.

3643
03:21:59,520 --> 03:22:00,040
Okay.

3644
03:22:00,360 --> 03:22:02,920
What is going to
change is if I'm going to have

3645
03:22:04,160 --> 03:22:06,360
some in here,

3646
03:22:07,880 --> 03:22:26,880
what will be the difference this.

3647
03:22:26,880 --> 03:22:31,720
So now,
instead of the having one print out,

3648
03:22:31,720 --> 03:22:35,920
it will print out some every time.

3649
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:37,920
21 times.

3650
03:22:37,920 --> 03:22:40,120
That is my condition to 21 times.

3651
03:22:40,120 --> 03:22:42,240
How many times my condition is true. This

3652
03:22:44,440 --> 03:22:45,640
thinks so.

3653
03:22:45,640 --> 03:22:48,760
What you will get
you will get six times condition.

3654
03:22:48,760 --> 03:22:49,640
It will be true.

3655
03:22:49,640 --> 03:22:54,280
So your print out
statement will be executed six times.

3656
03:22:54,280 --> 03:22:59,440
So now what will be printed
six times at first time?

3657
03:22:59,480 --> 03:23:01,320
Write it first time. Let's take a look.

3658
03:23:01,320 --> 03:23:02,520
And always, always guess.

3659
03:23:02,520 --> 03:23:04,840
And you think confusing just the right

3660
03:23:06,400 --> 03:23:07,200
angle, right?

3661
03:23:07,200 --> 03:23:09,720
So variable sum has a value of zero

3662
03:23:11,160 --> 03:23:12,520
for loop, right?

3663
03:23:12,520 --> 03:23:15,960
Initialize our AI. Now
what is the variable?

3664
03:23:15,960 --> 03:23:17,040
I is one.

3665
03:23:17,040 --> 03:23:20,560
What is the value of sum is zero zero
plus one.

3666
03:23:20,560 --> 03:23:22,920
Now you will see that your sound
will get changed.

3667
03:23:23,760 --> 03:23:26,040
Right now our some change.

3668
03:23:26,040 --> 03:23:28,920
What is the value of
some is one going back.

3669
03:23:29,200 --> 03:23:31,120
Hi, I got change Rhino.

3670
03:23:31,120 --> 03:23:32,520
Let's see that yellow. Right.

3671
03:23:32,520 --> 03:23:38,200
So now what we do we doing two plus one
will give us the sum will be three, right?

3672
03:23:38,200 --> 03:23:41,200
And so on. But now every time

3673
03:23:42,360 --> 03:23:44,520
we are calculating the sum because now

3674
03:23:44,520 --> 03:23:49,880
we put the six out inside the body,
now we will be printing some every time.

3675
03:23:49,920 --> 03:23:52,400
Right? So now how many times
Sum will get printed?

3676
03:23:52,800 --> 03:23:55,000
We will be printed six times three

3677
03:23:56,280 --> 03:23:59,680
times six.

3678
03:24:00,480 --> 03:24:02,800
Why is six times right? You know what?

3679
03:24:03,200 --> 03:24:06,840
Because six times you
your condition will be true, right?

3680
03:24:07,080 --> 03:24:10,600
Six times that condition will be true.

3681
03:24:10,600 --> 03:24:12,680
So now let me see this.

3682
03:24:12,680 --> 03:24:15,280
Let me another similar example.

3683
03:24:15,280 --> 03:24:18,240
So you guys will know
what will be happening now right?

3684
03:24:18,240 --> 03:24:20,760
So let's do another variable

3685
03:24:22,120 --> 03:24:24,480
integer result results to make it

3686
03:24:25,720 --> 03:24:28,320
right and

3687
03:24:28,320 --> 03:24:30,760
integer and make

3688
03:24:33,960 --> 03:24:36,200
or right

3689
03:24:36,520 --> 03:24:46,000
is I equals you.

3690
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:48,600
All right, let's record and four

3691
03:24:49,520 --> 03:24:52,320
and then I plus

3692
03:24:54,120 --> 03:24:57,520
right and now want to say result

3693
03:24:58,520 --> 03:25:00,600
multiply equals right

3694
03:25:04,600 --> 03:25:06,360
and I want to print result.

3695
03:25:06,360 --> 03:25:27,360
What will be my output based.

3696
03:25:27,360 --> 03:25:30,000
Okay, that's good. It will be zero. Right?

3697
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:34,640
Because what happens
my result is equal to zero in here.

3698
03:25:34,680 --> 03:25:35,120
Right?

3699
03:25:35,120 --> 03:25:38,760
And then anything
multiplied to a zero, right.

3700
03:25:38,760 --> 03:25:41,280
Anything are multiplied
to zero will become zero.

3701
03:25:42,080 --> 03:25:47,040
Okay, let me ask
what if all do result equals you want?

3702
03:25:47,360 --> 03:25:48,320
What would be the output?

3703
03:25:48,320 --> 03:26:17,640
This one or zero

3704
03:26:17,640 --> 03:26:18,800
or four

3705
03:26:30,280 --> 03:26:40,040
eight.

3706
03:26:40,040 --> 03:26:41,760
Let's take a look.

3707
03:26:41,760 --> 03:26:45,000
Let's take a look for

3708
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:48,720
the neuron and then you guys will see.

3709
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:51,000
So it shows me zero, right?

3710
03:26:51,160 --> 03:26:52,160
It shows me zero.

3711
03:26:52,160 --> 03:26:54,560
Now let's understand what happens.

3712
03:26:54,560 --> 03:26:57,720
So here we are
initializing the variable, right?

3713
03:26:57,720 --> 03:26:59,200
We are initializing the variable.

3714
03:26:59,200 --> 03:27:00,240
So what is the value?

3715
03:27:00,240 --> 03:27:02,280
We put We put it value of one.

3716
03:27:02,280 --> 03:27:03,440
It goes inside.

3717
03:27:03,440 --> 03:27:06,200
Right now we have our loop, right?

3718
03:27:06,680 --> 03:27:09,240
So How many times
the condition will be true this?

3719
03:27:09,440 --> 03:27:10,560
How many times condition?

3720
03:27:10,560 --> 03:27:12,440
Oh, now I have different increment.

3721
03:27:12,440 --> 03:27:18,240
How many times condition is true?

3722
03:27:18,240 --> 03:27:18,720
Four times.

3723
03:27:18,720 --> 03:27:27,360
Two times three times How many times?

3724
03:27:27,360 --> 03:27:28,440
Three times. Right.

3725
03:27:28,440 --> 03:27:33,920
So first I initializing to zero is zero
less than four years.

3726
03:27:33,920 --> 03:27:34,960
Condition is true.

3727
03:27:34,960 --> 03:27:37,160
We are going inside now.

3728
03:27:37,160 --> 03:27:40,120
What are we doing? Our result is one.

3729
03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:41,000
What are we doing?

3730
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:43,240
We're multiplying it by zero.

3731
03:27:43,240 --> 03:27:46,440
Anything will multiply by zero equals
to zero.

3732
03:27:46,720 --> 03:27:47,440
Right?

3733
03:27:47,440 --> 03:27:49,680
So now when we are going back,

3734
03:27:50,360 --> 03:27:54,800
what happens is I zero
plus two will give me two.

3735
03:27:55,240 --> 03:27:57,320
Is two less than four years?

3736
03:27:57,320 --> 03:28:00,360
Two less than four condition is true then

3737
03:28:00,360 --> 03:28:03,840
you multiply zero
by two is will give you zero.

3738
03:28:04,160 --> 03:28:06,840
Then you going back to plus two.

3739
03:28:06,960 --> 03:28:09,720
Four is four less than four? Yes.

3740
03:28:09,720 --> 03:28:13,800
But even if you go to multiply by four
still will give you zero.

3741
03:28:13,800 --> 03:28:14,480
Right.

3742
03:28:14,480 --> 03:28:19,640
So condition was true
three times zero when I was equal to zero.

3743
03:28:19,640 --> 03:28:21,160
When I was equal to two.

3744
03:28:21,160 --> 03:28:23,040
When I was equals to four.

3745
03:28:23,040 --> 03:28:25,240
However, the result. Right.

3746
03:28:25,240 --> 03:28:29,120
So now what happens at first iteration
you had one

3747
03:28:29,520 --> 03:28:33,840
as soon as you did one multiplied by zero,
you got zero guy.

3748
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:38,400
So now your one got replaced with that
zero, right?

3749
03:28:38,400 --> 03:28:40,400
Got replaced with the zero.

3750
03:28:40,400 --> 03:28:44,280
And we know the bottom, the last value

3751
03:28:44,440 --> 03:28:47,360
will be stayed
inside that variable, right?

3752
03:28:48,680 --> 03:28:50,960
So now what if I'm going to change to one

3753
03:28:50,960 --> 03:28:54,600
this model will be the result

3754
03:29:08,600 --> 03:29:10,040
or what?

3755
03:29:10,680 --> 03:29:18,840
413331.

3756
03:29:18,840 --> 03:29:39,840
This is one days 313111.

3757
03:29:40,240 --> 03:29:41,400
So the same thing first.

3758
03:29:41,400 --> 03:29:45,360
First of all, that's
how many times we print in our result.

3759
03:29:45,360 --> 03:29:48,240
And we need to be printing the result

3760
03:29:48,240 --> 03:29:49,080
only once. Right?

3761
03:29:49,080 --> 03:29:53,280
Because we did not put this statement
inside the loop.

3762
03:29:53,280 --> 03:29:53,560
Right?

3763
03:29:53,560 --> 03:29:56,840
So it executes always once
if it's outside of the loop with things,

3764
03:29:56,880 --> 03:29:58,520
if it's only once right,

3765
03:29:58,520 --> 03:30:02,880
and then you can do
the same thing, result is equal to one.

3766
03:30:03,200 --> 03:30:04,640
I is equal to one.

3767
03:30:04,640 --> 03:30:08,120
So what we have one
multiplied by one will give us one.

3768
03:30:08,240 --> 03:30:10,640
Right? We are going back.

3769
03:30:10,640 --> 03:30:14,920
How we're multiplying, how we incrementing
and we incrementing two.

3770
03:30:14,920 --> 03:30:18,640
One plus two will give me three.

3771
03:30:18,880 --> 03:30:19,240
Right.

3772
03:30:19,240 --> 03:30:21,080
Hey, is that three?

3773
03:30:21,080 --> 03:30:23,040
Less than four years.

3774
03:30:23,040 --> 03:30:24,960
Three. Less than four Is condition True?

3775
03:30:24,960 --> 03:30:26,480
Yes, condition is true.

3776
03:30:26,480 --> 03:30:28,440
What was the last value of the result?

3777
03:30:28,440 --> 03:30:32,200
The last value of the result was one
one multiplied by three.

3778
03:30:32,520 --> 03:30:32,880
Right.

3779
03:30:32,880 --> 03:30:35,960
And then stored in it
back inside the same variable.

3780
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:37,160
Three. Right.

3781
03:30:37,160 --> 03:30:39,760
And then going back now we had three.

3782
03:30:40,080 --> 03:30:42,600
Three plus two gives us five.

3783
03:30:43,200 --> 03:30:45,280
Now becomes false.

3784
03:30:45,280 --> 03:30:50,160
We cannot enter inside, not enter inside.

3785
03:30:50,160 --> 03:30:55,120
So now we're told
you will get three right?

3786
03:30:55,120 --> 03:30:58,920
So don't forget about the incremental
you know,

3787
03:30:59,040 --> 03:31:03,320
forget about the implementation part.

3788
03:31:03,320 --> 03:31:03,960
Okay. All right.

3789
03:31:03,960 --> 03:31:10,760
So you guys see there's different things
that we can do inside our loops, right?

3790
03:31:10,760 --> 03:31:17,360
This is like all loops.

3791
03:31:17,360 --> 03:31:19,680
Okay. This I'm going to give you.

3792
03:31:19,680 --> 03:31:22,440
There will be some homework based, this

3793
03:31:23,160 --> 03:31:27,760
based on this current.

3794
03:31:27,760 --> 03:31:27,960
Yeah.

3795
03:31:27,960 --> 03:31:32,880
You guys see, once you know a logic, logic
how your loop works, right?

3796
03:31:32,880 --> 03:31:36,960
Once you know the logic behind
how the works, then then it's

3797
03:31:37,320 --> 03:31:40,960
will be making more sense
how your code is actual actions

3798
03:31:41,160 --> 03:31:45,920
execute right.

3799
03:31:45,920 --> 03:31:50,520
Right.

3800
03:31:50,520 --> 03:31:56,800
Are we paradise or we are good. Hi.

3801
03:31:56,920 --> 03:31:58,640
Good. Okay, now let's see.

3802
03:31:58,640 --> 03:32:02,160
Let's see how to tag. Good, good. So good

3803
03:32:04,760 --> 03:32:07,360
brain hurts the brain.

3804
03:32:07,360 --> 03:32:10,080
We we do shake in the brain,
which is good, right?

3805
03:32:10,080 --> 03:32:13,200
Guess it's always good
when when some new information

3806
03:32:13,200 --> 03:32:15,960
comes third time you want to go home.

3807
03:32:16,400 --> 03:32:19,280
Are you not taking class from home?

3808
03:32:19,280 --> 03:32:21,640
Another cup of coffee

3809
03:32:21,640 --> 03:32:23,200
for detailed

3810
03:32:30,680 --> 03:32:31,360
loading time.

3811
03:32:31,360 --> 03:32:34,240
Hard brain. Okay, so let me see.

3812
03:32:34,240 --> 03:32:35,360
We have.

3813
03:32:35,360 --> 03:32:36,120
Right?

3814
03:32:37,520 --> 03:32:42,000
Because what are we going to have?

3815
03:32:42,000 --> 03:32:44,360
So we will have the

3816
03:32:44,360 --> 03:32:50,560
break nested loops right?

3817
03:32:50,560 --> 03:32:53,920
And then your house

3818
03:32:54,880 --> 03:32:55,520
call.

3819
03:32:58,960 --> 03:32:59,680
Okay.

3820
03:32:59,720 --> 03:33:00,240
All right.

3821
03:33:00,240 --> 03:33:02,720
Then I'm going to give you a more

3822
03:33:05,160 --> 03:33:05,680
because

3823
03:33:06,080 --> 03:33:08,720
I'm going to give you
probably more homework.

3824
03:33:08,880 --> 03:33:09,640
Okay.

3825
03:33:10,000 --> 03:33:12,920
And then what I want you to guys to look

3826
03:33:13,880 --> 03:33:17,240
what I want you to give us to look

3827
03:33:17,240 --> 03:33:18,760
for a next class.

3828
03:33:18,760 --> 03:33:19,480
Next class.

3829
03:33:19,480 --> 03:33:22,800
There's
no more things that we going to look. So

3830
03:33:24,400 --> 03:33:26,560
I'm going
to give you just the intro right now.

3831
03:33:26,560 --> 03:33:30,280
So this way you guys will look like

3832
03:33:33,720 --> 03:33:34,600
actually are easy.

3833
03:33:34,600 --> 03:33:39,920
One is going to do the introductions
for you and then you guys,

3834
03:33:40,320 --> 03:33:43,200
I'll explain your homework
and then I'll let you go.

3835
03:33:43,320 --> 03:33:46,160
Basically. Now,

3836
03:33:47,360 --> 03:33:49,640
whenever we work with the Loops desk,

3837
03:33:49,920 --> 03:33:53,400
whenever we work with the loops,

3838
03:33:53,400 --> 03:33:56,520
there are some key words
that we can use inside, right?

3839
03:33:56,520 --> 03:33:59,880
There are some keywords that we can use
inside, for example, right?

3840
03:33:59,880 --> 03:34:03,280
And it can be any type
of any type of right.

3841
03:34:03,600 --> 03:34:09,800
So for example my form, right,
my follow up integer equals two zero.

3842
03:34:09,800 --> 03:34:13,440
I like that equals
then I don't know or right

3843
03:34:13,560 --> 03:34:16,520
I plus plus.

3844
03:34:16,520 --> 03:34:21,480
So based based on the current condition,
how many times conditioner

3845
03:34:21,480 --> 03:34:22,920
will be triggered? How many times

3846
03:34:34,840 --> 03:34:36,240
four or five

3847
03:34:39,920 --> 03:34:40,320
zero.

3848
03:34:40,320 --> 03:34:42,240
One, two, three, four.

3849
03:34:42,240 --> 03:34:44,880
So it will be
it will be true five times, right?

3850
03:34:44,880 --> 03:34:47,760
Because I'm starting from the zero
and I'm including for.

3851
03:34:47,760 --> 03:34:50,120
Right.
Just always look at the operator. Right.

3852
03:34:50,120 --> 03:34:52,920
You know, if I'm going to run,
we know that my works

3853
03:34:52,920 --> 03:34:56,200
well works was given the natural condition
five times, right.

3854
03:34:56,200 --> 03:34:59,680
So we it we did expect of our loop
to execute it five times.

3855
03:34:59,760 --> 03:35:00,320
Okay.

3856
03:35:00,720 --> 03:35:04,200
So now there's some keyword
that we can add

3857
03:35:04,320 --> 03:35:07,280
in our inside loops.

3858
03:35:07,280 --> 03:35:08,400
Guess what we can use?

3859
03:35:08,400 --> 03:35:11,640
We can use some keyword that we say break.

3860
03:35:12,800 --> 03:35:14,640
So we already use this keyword.

3861
03:35:14,640 --> 03:35:16,800
Guess what is this keyword used to do?

3862
03:35:16,800 --> 03:35:18,040
What is this keyword used to do?

3863
03:35:18,040 --> 03:35:24,080
Is this key word

3864
03:35:24,080 --> 03:35:27,560
to use to observe and black of code?

3865
03:35:27,560 --> 03:35:30,480
Right.
It gives out from the block of quote.

3866
03:35:30,480 --> 03:35:30,760
Right.

3867
03:35:30,760 --> 03:35:36,360
So where we use the before
we use that inside our switch,

3868
03:35:36,360 --> 03:35:37,680
right inside our switch.

3869
03:35:37,680 --> 03:35:41,600
So what as soon as it would see break
what it was doing

3870
03:35:41,640 --> 03:35:45,120
it was breaking out from what
from the block of code.

3871
03:35:45,240 --> 03:35:48,160
Which block of code
because we declared inside the switch.

3872
03:35:48,160 --> 03:35:50,440
So it was getting out from this switch.

3873
03:35:50,800 --> 03:35:53,760
Now break works exactly the same way.

3874
03:35:53,760 --> 03:35:55,560
Guess what a break will do.

3875
03:35:55,560 --> 03:35:58,000
It will get out.

3876
03:35:58,000 --> 03:35:59,080
Where would you clear it?

3877
03:35:59,080 --> 03:36:02,360
Inside part
we declared inside our for loop.

3878
03:36:02,680 --> 03:36:07,680
So what we will do
our break will break our loop.

3879
03:36:07,680 --> 03:36:09,720
Right. So what will happen?

3880
03:36:10,960 --> 03:36:13,360
What will
happen days and what will happen?

3881
03:36:13,680 --> 03:36:13,920
Right.

3882
03:36:13,920 --> 03:36:17,640
So your Java initialization checks
the condition.

3883
03:36:17,640 --> 03:36:18,720
Condition is true.

3884
03:36:18,720 --> 03:36:21,560
Goes inside execute this court.

3885
03:36:21,840 --> 03:36:23,520
But then top to the bottom.

3886
03:36:23,520 --> 03:36:25,600
Right now it sees a break world.

3887
03:36:25,840 --> 03:36:27,080
It is a break it not.

3888
03:36:27,080 --> 03:36:29,040
Okay, I'm going to get out.

3889
03:36:29,040 --> 03:36:30,160
I'm breaking what?

3890
03:36:30,160 --> 03:36:31,080
I'm breaking.

3891
03:36:31,080 --> 03:36:32,600
I'm breaking this block.

3892
03:36:32,600 --> 03:36:33,240
All right.

3893
03:36:33,240 --> 03:36:38,040
So now Java sees break and what it will
do, you will get out from your phone

3894
03:36:38,200 --> 03:36:38,800
right?

3895
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:43,520
So this way, your Java just executed
your code one time.

3896
03:36:43,560 --> 03:36:44,160
Right?

3897
03:36:44,440 --> 03:36:47,880
And this break guys can be used inside
any loop

3898
03:36:49,080 --> 03:36:50,920
in the used inside a well look. Right.

3899
03:36:50,920 --> 03:36:55,280
So while let me just make this I'm
just going to type right

3900
03:36:57,520 --> 03:36:59,880
in so I'm going to say

3901
03:37:01,200 --> 03:37:02,720
hello. Right?

3902
03:37:02,720 --> 03:37:05,520
So by looking at this look, guys,
what kind of look we have?

3903
03:37:05,960 --> 03:37:13,440
What kind of look we are going to have?

3904
03:37:13,440 --> 03:37:16,320
It look will be infinite. Look, right.

3905
03:37:16,440 --> 03:37:17,680
It will be infinite.

3906
03:37:17,680 --> 03:37:20,160
It will be could continuously print in.

3907
03:37:20,160 --> 03:37:21,240
Hello? Why?

3908
03:37:21,240 --> 03:37:23,520
Because our condition is true, Right?

3909
03:37:23,880 --> 03:37:28,120
But now, if I'm like
you are the great keyword, right?

3910
03:37:28,120 --> 03:37:29,760
What Happens with my look.

3911
03:37:29,760 --> 03:37:32,520
Why look, we'll break. Well, we'll break.

3912
03:37:32,880 --> 03:37:36,640
So let's see if we are near the book

3913
03:37:39,480 --> 03:37:41,160
and of code

3914
03:37:51,120 --> 03:37:56,840
for right

3915
03:37:57,840 --> 03:38:03,520
so declaring our variable i0i was was
then for condition is true

3916
03:38:03,840 --> 03:38:07,640
that's why I want to happen
we're printed almost done

3917
03:38:07,640 --> 03:38:11,640
then you java so break you got out
you broke your for

3918
03:38:11,680 --> 03:38:15,680
by writing from bronchial
the thing thing you will do inside a well

3919
03:38:15,720 --> 03:38:20,520
hey while condition is true
well condition is true right?

3920
03:38:20,520 --> 03:38:22,320
I want to print Hello.

3921
03:38:22,320 --> 03:38:22,680
Hello.

3922
03:38:22,680 --> 03:38:25,880
Get pregnant
but then your java so break it got up

3923
03:38:26,240 --> 03:38:29,480
think got out
and then it printed something right there.

3924
03:38:29,640 --> 03:38:31,720
Now is it important guys?

3925
03:38:31,720 --> 03:38:33,000
They will be right.

3926
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:37,880
So to me, using the break
does not make sense just to use like that.

3927
03:38:37,880 --> 03:38:38,160
Right.

3928
03:38:38,160 --> 03:38:41,120
So we will be using break

3929
03:38:41,440 --> 03:38:45,680
only only when will be some condition met.

3930
03:38:45,840 --> 03:38:46,360
Okay.

3931
03:38:46,440 --> 03:38:51,440
So this break you would
usually we will put inside if write inside

3932
03:38:51,440 --> 03:38:55,560
our conditional statement because having
this does not make sense to me.

3933
03:38:55,560 --> 03:38:59,160
I if I need to print printed one time
I'm not going to place inside a break.

3934
03:38:59,360 --> 03:39:05,040
So usually this break keyword will be used
in some set inside some condition.

3935
03:39:05,040 --> 03:39:05,680
Right.

3936
03:39:05,760 --> 03:39:09,600
As soon as the condition is met, then what

3937
03:39:09,600 --> 03:39:13,440
I'm going to do,
I'm going to exit the right.

3938
03:39:13,440 --> 03:39:15,960
I'm going to exit the game.

3939
03:39:15,960 --> 03:39:19,800
For example, I'll give you the scenario
when it comes to our automation.

3940
03:39:19,800 --> 03:39:20,640
Right.

3941
03:39:20,640 --> 03:39:24,720
So let's go again to our word,
our application, right?

3942
03:39:25,400 --> 03:39:29,040
So as a part of the automation,
guess what is the automation

3943
03:39:29,040 --> 03:39:30,000
you guys will be doing?

3944
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:34,320
Automation is
we will be automating browsers,

3945
03:39:34,480 --> 03:39:37,560
Okay, any application
that we have on the browsers.

3946
03:39:37,640 --> 03:39:39,760
Okay. So this is the application.

3947
03:39:39,760 --> 03:39:43,640
And when it comes to testing, as of course
there will different different scenarios

3948
03:39:43,640 --> 03:39:46,960
that will be given you in the form of user
stories, right?

3949
03:39:46,960 --> 03:39:49,960
You know,
what is a user, for example, right?

3950
03:39:50,320 --> 03:39:52,400
So now what you will have do

3951
03:39:53,200 --> 03:39:56,120
once, once
you guys start learning the selenium,

3952
03:39:56,640 --> 03:40:00,440
you will be able to capture
all the links, right?

3953
03:40:00,440 --> 03:40:03,120
You will be able to all the links, right?

3954
03:40:03,760 --> 03:40:07,680
Once you capture all the links,
now you have to click

3955
03:40:07,680 --> 03:40:09,920
only on one of them, right?

3956
03:40:09,920 --> 03:40:13,320
So for example, once you capture one,
two, three, four, five,

3957
03:40:13,320 --> 03:40:15,360
six, seven, eight links. Right.

3958
03:40:15,360 --> 03:40:19,080
So out of this eight links,
you will be looping through

3959
03:40:19,080 --> 03:40:23,640
every eight link through every
and you will be checking for a text

3960
03:40:24,360 --> 03:40:28,040
as soon if the text, for example,
you want to do enroll

3961
03:40:28,400 --> 03:40:32,640
if the text is equals to enroll,
what do you want to do?

3962
03:40:32,640 --> 03:40:36,560
You want to click
and then you want to break the loop. Why?

3963
03:40:36,560 --> 03:40:37,600
Because what happened?

3964
03:40:37,600 --> 03:40:40,800
You found the link that you're looking
for, right?

3965
03:40:40,800 --> 03:40:42,840
You to talk through all of them.

3966
03:40:42,840 --> 03:40:45,680
Maybe think of Amazon and Amazon
have hundred links, right?

3967
03:40:45,920 --> 03:40:49,160
So now you have to go through all things

3968
03:40:49,440 --> 03:40:53,640
you have to look through of them
and to see eight is this link has this

3969
03:40:53,640 --> 03:40:57,840
text is the next week's link has this text
is this link has this text right.

3970
03:40:58,080 --> 03:41:03,600
You will continue looping
until what happens until you find the link

3971
03:41:03,800 --> 03:41:08,120
that shows enroll As soon as you find
the link that shows enrolled,

3972
03:41:08,320 --> 03:41:09,120
what are you going to do?

3973
03:41:09,120 --> 03:41:11,440
You went to click right because once you

3974
03:41:12,240 --> 03:41:14,760
then you want to break you'll look. Why?

3975
03:41:14,760 --> 03:41:17,760
Because the rest of the links,
something will happen with them, right?

3976
03:41:18,160 --> 03:41:22,000
So I don't know if it makes sense right
now, but that's one of the good examples

3977
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:24,120
that we're going to have
right on the application.

3978
03:41:24,120 --> 03:41:27,760
We might have links on the application,
we might have ten links.

3979
03:41:27,760 --> 03:41:28,320
Right?

3980
03:41:28,320 --> 03:41:31,680
But what we have to do,
we have to go to single link and grab

3981
03:41:31,680 --> 03:41:35,080
the text will be,
Hey Link, what's your name hailing.

3982
03:41:35,080 --> 03:41:35,880
What's your name?

3983
03:41:35,880 --> 03:41:38,880
As soon as I find that name,
let me break them.

3984
03:41:39,520 --> 03:41:40,520
Let me break them.

3985
03:41:41,600 --> 03:41:42,600
Okay, so this

3986
03:41:42,600 --> 03:41:45,680
I'm going to finish in early
because probably it is

3987
03:41:46,800 --> 03:41:47,880
a lot of things, right?

3988
03:41:47,880 --> 03:41:53,200
But what I want you to guys I want you to
look into the break and continue keyword.

3989
03:41:53,200 --> 03:41:53,840
Right.

3990
03:41:53,840 --> 03:41:56,000
So are they very popular?

3991
03:41:56,000 --> 03:41:58,040
Some cases, yes. Some cases no. Right.

3992
03:41:58,040 --> 03:42:01,080
Sometimes we'll be using this,
sometimes We want we won't be using them.

3993
03:42:01,080 --> 03:42:04,920
But it's important to know
that this keywords can be placed

3994
03:42:04,960 --> 03:42:10,320
inside the right and make sure you
you look into another important thing,

3995
03:42:10,400 --> 03:42:12,960
another important thing
for our next class.

3996
03:42:12,960 --> 03:42:18,000
What I want you guys to
I want you guys to look into nested loops.

3997
03:42:18,200 --> 03:42:18,720
Okay.

3998
03:42:19,000 --> 03:42:29,480
So what are
this thing will be in the loop.

3999
03:42:29,480 --> 03:42:32,880
It's a loop inside another way.

4000
03:42:32,880 --> 03:42:35,880
We had Eve inside another Eve, Right.

4001
03:42:36,160 --> 03:42:37,120
And of course, this.

4002
03:42:37,120 --> 03:42:40,600
In order for you to understand
those loops will be working,

4003
03:42:40,880 --> 03:42:43,120
you have to make sure you understand

4004
03:42:43,600 --> 03:42:48,960
the logic of the one single right
when it comes to nesting as we can this

4005
03:42:48,960 --> 03:42:53,680
anything we can have, we can have four
inside another four, right?

4006
03:42:53,680 --> 03:42:55,960
For example, integer equals to one

4007
03:42:56,280 --> 03:43:00,040
and then I or equals three
and then I plus plus.

4008
03:43:00,360 --> 03:43:00,960
Right.

4009
03:43:00,960 --> 03:43:05,440
And then inside we can miss another week
in this two force.

4010
03:43:05,440 --> 03:43:06,080
That's fine.

4011
03:43:06,080 --> 03:43:08,600
For example, integer J to zero

4012
03:43:08,880 --> 03:43:13,200
and then G less than three
and then J plus, for example.

4013
03:43:13,360 --> 03:43:13,680
Right.

4014
03:43:15,040 --> 03:43:16,680
And then right.

4015
03:43:16,680 --> 03:43:18,240
It could be this variation.

4016
03:43:18,240 --> 03:43:19,120
Could it be different?

4017
03:43:19,120 --> 03:43:21,600
Variation is yes,
it can be different variations.

4018
03:43:21,840 --> 03:43:23,680
We can have four, right?

4019
03:43:23,680 --> 03:43:26,400
And we can have integer I equals to one.

4020
03:43:26,720 --> 03:43:30,120
I literally equals then three
and then I plus plus.

4021
03:43:30,440 --> 03:43:33,600
And inside of this we can have while right

4022
03:43:33,960 --> 03:43:38,200
instead of this we can her once
and then another block of course.

4023
03:43:38,200 --> 03:43:42,840
Right so or we can have while inside
the tree does not matter

4024
03:43:42,840 --> 03:43:46,600
right so when we say any but nested nested
loops it's

4025
03:43:46,800 --> 03:43:50,720
loop inside
another look loop inside another.

4026
03:43:51,280 --> 03:43:54,840
So please make sure guys
mostly we will go for this variation

4027
03:43:55,160 --> 03:43:58,920
sometimes in our automation
will be using this variation, right?

4028
03:43:59,200 --> 03:44:03,000
But in order in order
for us to understand.

4029
03:44:03,000 --> 03:44:03,680
Right.

4030
03:44:03,680 --> 03:44:07,960
It's like before we went to the nested,
if we saw how the regular if works.

4031
03:44:07,960 --> 03:44:09,280
Right. So the same thing.

4032
03:44:09,280 --> 03:44:11,520
Please
make sure you guys practice on the loops.

4033
03:44:11,680 --> 03:44:13,560
Okay. Practice on the loops.

4034
03:44:13,560 --> 03:44:15,760
So this way. Next class we will touch.

4035
03:44:16,080 --> 03:44:19,840
We will touch
this part right in real guys.

4036
03:44:21,240 --> 03:44:23,280
So when you use

4037
03:44:25,440 --> 03:44:28,320
when you use

4038
03:44:33,320 --> 03:44:35,600
let's do

4039
03:44:37,120 --> 03:44:37,520
bowling.

4040
03:44:37,520 --> 03:44:41,200
I think I got confused a little bit
in the question for a loop

4041
03:44:42,720 --> 03:44:46,440
storm we use. Plus

4042
03:44:49,360 --> 03:44:51,720
no, we depend on the value, right?

4043
03:44:51,720 --> 03:44:55,520
Catalina will just depend on the value
on which value

4044
03:44:55,520 --> 03:44:58,280
multiplying and doing the things right.

4045
03:44:58,520 --> 03:45:01,040
So that will be for you guys to look

4046
03:45:02,160 --> 03:45:03,560
to look for a next class.

4047
03:45:03,560 --> 03:45:06,360
But here's the homework. Homologous.

4048
03:45:06,360 --> 03:45:07,720
Let me see if I have it.

4049
03:45:07,720 --> 03:45:10,640
Then you have to type it for you. This

4050
03:45:20,400 --> 03:45:21,840
I'll give you more simpler

4051
03:45:21,840 --> 03:45:24,240
Then you guys will do this.

4052
03:45:24,840 --> 03:45:25,680
Okay, I'll.

4053
03:45:25,680 --> 03:45:27,200
I'll send this. Okay.

4054
03:45:27,200 --> 03:45:29,280
So there's one. The task will be.

4055
03:45:30,600 --> 03:45:32,560
One of the task will be.

4056
03:45:32,560 --> 03:45:34,560
I want you to write.

4057
03:45:34,560 --> 03:45:37,760
I want you from your one.

4058
03:45:37,760 --> 03:45:39,520
The task explaining.

4059
03:45:39,520 --> 03:45:43,040
I want you to calculate, calculate

4060
03:45:43,560 --> 03:45:46,320
sum of all.

4061
03:45:46,760 --> 03:45:50,520
And in all odd numbers.

4062
03:45:51,800 --> 03:45:53,040
Numbers

4063
03:45:54,040 --> 03:45:55,840
from range

4064
03:45:56,520 --> 03:45:58,160
from range.

4065
03:45:58,160 --> 03:46:02,360
For example, one to, I don't know, 100.

4066
03:46:02,600 --> 03:46:03,840
Right. 100.

4067
03:46:03,840 --> 03:46:06,920
So what does it mean from the range?

4068
03:46:06,920 --> 03:46:08,800
From 1 to 100. Right.

4069
03:46:08,800 --> 03:46:10,960
From the range 1 to 100.

4070
03:46:10,960 --> 03:46:16,160
I want you to calculate this sum of all
even numbers two plus four plus 90.

4071
03:46:16,240 --> 03:46:18,240
Right. What will be the total sum?

4072
03:46:18,240 --> 03:46:20,960
And at the same time,
I want you to calculate

4073
03:46:20,960 --> 03:46:24,840
the sum of odd numbers,
right from 1 to 100.

4074
03:46:24,840 --> 03:46:28,560
I want you to do one
plus three plus five, seven plus 99.

4075
03:46:28,560 --> 03:46:30,760
What will be the sum, right?

4076
03:46:30,760 --> 03:46:32,760
So that is one of the homework.

4077
03:46:32,760 --> 03:46:38,200
In another little more days,
I will ask you another homework

4078
03:46:38,200 --> 03:46:40,840
we will have write in.

4079
03:46:41,120 --> 03:46:44,360
So you guys will should differentiate
what kind of fluke you guys will be using.

4080
03:46:44,400 --> 03:46:45,080
Right.

4081
03:46:45,080 --> 03:46:48,600
So another homework I'll you
you what I want you to do guys

4082
03:46:48,600 --> 03:46:52,200
I want you to ask user to pay

4083
03:46:52,200 --> 03:46:54,840
for I don't know let's say soda right

4084
03:46:55,200 --> 03:46:58,760
You buy a soda right or whatever thing
you're buying, right.

4085
03:46:59,600 --> 03:47:03,160
Ask user to pay it for soda and continue.

4086
03:47:04,240 --> 03:47:06,240
Continue asking

4087
03:47:07,000 --> 03:47:09,320
you pay until

4088
03:47:10,680 --> 03:47:12,600
the user gets

4089
03:47:12,720 --> 03:47:14,640
the right amount.

4090
03:47:15,080 --> 03:47:19,000
Right amount.

4091
03:47:19,000 --> 03:47:21,240
Right. The user gets the right amount.

4092
03:47:21,520 --> 03:47:25,440
But this time I'm going to make it
a little more complicated.

4093
03:47:25,440 --> 03:47:27,840
This a little more complicated, right?

4094
03:47:27,840 --> 03:47:30,640
So what I want you to look into, right?

4095
03:47:30,640 --> 03:47:34,360
So if user gives you right, if user gives

4096
03:47:35,040 --> 03:47:37,360
if user gives

4097
03:47:37,640 --> 03:47:41,400
extra money, X

4098
03:47:41,560 --> 03:47:44,080
one money, I want you to give change

4099
03:47:45,840 --> 03:47:47,200
your change.

4100
03:47:47,760 --> 03:47:53,520
If user gives less money, ask

4101
03:47:54,920 --> 03:48:00,520
how much more you need,
how much more unique.

4102
03:48:00,560 --> 03:48:01,200
Right.

4103
03:48:01,440 --> 03:48:05,200
And I want you to keep asking
until you get the right

4104
03:48:05,200 --> 03:48:07,800
the month, right
until you get a right amount.

4105
03:48:07,800 --> 03:48:10,880
So I will
I will put it in the more writing by.

4106
03:48:10,880 --> 03:48:13,240
For example, I want you to ask

4107
03:48:13,240 --> 03:48:16,560
I think I made it
actually will make it pay for an item.

4108
03:48:16,880 --> 03:48:18,960
Let's decide which item will be right.

4109
03:48:19,160 --> 03:48:22,200
I want you to ask a user to pay
for an item, whichever item

4110
03:48:22,200 --> 03:48:23,520
you guys will decide.

4111
03:48:23,520 --> 03:48:27,000
And then I want you to keep asking
until you get the right amount.

4112
03:48:27,000 --> 03:48:29,320
For example, item will cost $10.

4113
03:48:29,640 --> 03:48:33,120
If user gives you 20,
I need you to give them a change.

4114
03:48:33,360 --> 03:48:34,080
Right?

4115
03:48:34,200 --> 03:48:38,040
If user gives you five,
I need you to for five more

4116
03:48:38,440 --> 03:48:43,480
and I want you to keep looping and looping
until you actually

4117
03:48:43,480 --> 03:48:47,120
will get a right amount,
until you get actually ten.

4118
03:48:47,120 --> 03:48:50,080
So I will write in more detail
and I'll give it to this.

4119
03:48:50,080 --> 03:48:50,880
I'll give it to you. Right.

4120
03:48:50,880 --> 03:48:53,920
So this is will be
and the only thing you guys

4121
03:48:53,920 --> 03:48:57,840
will have to see
what kind of loop you can use.

4122
03:48:57,840 --> 03:49:00,320
Right. What kind of loop you can use.

4123
03:49:00,320 --> 03:49:03,120
And I think there's a more ripple
will be coming in.

4124
03:49:03,120 --> 03:49:05,320
Guys, please don't forget

4125
03:49:05,320 --> 03:49:08,760
don't forget about your quiz
And don't forget to look at those

4126
03:49:09,720 --> 03:49:10,720
those key words.

4127
03:49:10,720 --> 03:49:13,560
Break and continue in the book
for the next class.

4128
03:49:13,600 --> 03:49:14,000
Okay.

4129
03:49:14,320 --> 03:49:17,080
So I would send that I will
I will make it a little more detail.

4130
03:49:17,200 --> 03:49:17,440
Okay.

4131
03:49:17,440 --> 03:49:20,640
I will make it a little more detail
so you guys will know step by step.

4132
03:49:20,640 --> 03:49:21,240
Okay.

4133
03:49:22,440 --> 03:49:23,400
How many replies?

4134
03:49:23,400 --> 03:49:28,240
So I think we did not release
logical switch and there will be loops,

4135
03:49:28,240 --> 03:49:30,080
so there will be good
amount of ripples too.

4136
03:49:30,080 --> 03:49:32,160
Okay, so let me have a look.

4137
03:49:32,160 --> 03:49:34,880
So you guys will have a lot
a lot or a lot of homework.

4138
03:49:34,880 --> 03:49:37,200
