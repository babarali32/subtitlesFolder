1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,360
You're

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,040
Republican, but

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,560
let me start the record.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,920
Fine days.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,000
So now

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,080
we'll start right with we could begin

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,320
with the glass for

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,720
glass or first woman that it

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,200
then?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,480
Why do we need a donor glass

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,880
to mostly talk about this right now?

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,640
Why do we need run glass case?

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,720
What is one of us

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,680
who configure

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,680
the execution

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,880
flow of OD just gives us current

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,680
to configure
the execution of our test cases.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,240
We need to look glass

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,080
right now in this room of glass.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,360
We have a lot of options.

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Remember, these are under glass.

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,400
Witness starts with the right amount.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,720
But let me open.

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,640
So the red table with when I'm
taking this part, we are taking from it

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,880
in cucumber we are running into with

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,120
G unique.

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,000
Right? So a direct line
between the taking.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,200
It simply means the move
from TV to the channel you want to watch.

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,640
Cutting them is right.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,320
So now we are seeing that we are going
to run not to kill, but with Johnny.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,200
So run with Johnny.

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,000
And in the return with Art,
we are taking this a direct action,

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,200
but options to configure are so of glass.

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,640
So now here

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,320
here in are enough glass right

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,800
we need Adelaide run with option
and option from

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,440
from g unit
and then to do other options we need

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,920
we need to provide

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,960
we need more options to provide

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,200
configurations to provide configurations
quite

41
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,200
bindings now

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,560
indicating more options
to provide configuration options.

43
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,240
What are these options?

44
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,080
See first is features, plate

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,600
first is features
in features we provide What

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
part of my

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,560
part of my feature finds current.

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,960
Wherever I stored
all of my feature device,

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,520
I provide the part of those feature files
in my feature step

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,800
boasting steak. Anything.

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,840
Right now here we can pass either one
feature fight or we can pass the bottom

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,600
the entire folder where all of my picture
files are available.

53
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,680
Right,

54
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,160
Right.

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,680
Point after features after features.

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,080
The next thing we have is blue.

57
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,240
What we had next thing is blue, right?

58
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,440
Why do we need blue?

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,240
Always

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,280
package.

61
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,960
Now remember, it's not about package.

62
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,920
Blue means basically
whatever the feature flights

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,120
you want to execute for back each of you.

64
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,200
We had steps implemented but not so the
no glass always ask for this thing.

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,680
If we have this the steps implemented
in available, we need to provide that.

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,560
But so part of a particular location
where I have all of my steps,

67
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,760
it could be in one class,
it could be in multiple classes, right?

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,200
So if I have, for example, to simplify
the go to easily understanding,

69
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,040
to maintain the code,
we have separate steps class

70
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,560
for every single page, right?

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,040
That's why
we put all of those things in one package.

72
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,520
So instead of providing the part

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,360
of multiple classes, I'm
going to provide the part of the package

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,000
where all of my steps are available
in different classes.

75
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,600
So glue is basically what

76
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,760
of the steps

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,160
step definitions

78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,680
for each of rights

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,720
ladies, Is this going to

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,520
one of the most important options

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,560
which we studied yesterday in our donor
class was a dry and

82
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,760
lost dry

83
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,080
enemy.

84
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:27,600
Guys, why do we need dryer?

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,840
No, your fabric is pretty common.

86
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,800
All right.

87
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,000
So basically,
we saw right before using the dryer

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,400
and what we were doing,
we were actually writing the steps

89
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,800
and we were executing the feature
by unnecessarily.

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,640
It was taking time
to execute the previous code

91
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,320
and then it was giving me
the steps for implementation, right?

92
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,240
The snippet it was giving me.

93
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,000
So that time unnecessarily
I was wasting my time

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,880
or the limited execution right now
to get rid of this problem.

95
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,680
We came up with one option
or try it in our don't. Plus

96
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,520
by default
it is state to false by default.

97
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,640
To disable false false means

98
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,680
you can continue
with the indication from the class range.

99
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,120
That is not in fact
because of this particular option.

100
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,120
The moment you make it to
the moment you send a greater

101
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,360
is equals to true,
then it stops your actual execution.

102
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,280
The first thing it does,
it stops your actual execution.

103
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,960
After stopping

104
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,840
your actual execution,
what is the next thing it does?

105
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,840
It quickly checks it quickly checks

106
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,040
all the steps
that you have mentioned in your feature.

107
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,880
It checks all the steps
right after taking steps, it will see

108
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,440
which steps are implemented,
which is steps are not implemented.

109
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,480
If there are a couple of steps

110
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,440
which are not implemented,
it will give you all the snippet,

111
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,120
all the code to implement
those steps in system definitions.

112
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,960
But so it's not only scanning

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,040
all the steps, but also providing the goal
for missing the steps.

114
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,480
Both things it one day.

115
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,600
So the first thing we are saving
the time of the deliberate execution

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,240
because we are not doing it
stops your actual execution.

117
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,200
Second thing
it is checking not in one picture frame,

118
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,880
but in all the feature file.

119
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,320
It single by all the feature, by its
legacy of 100 feature by another method.

120
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,240
It will check in all the region
points right?

121
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,800
It will give you the steps
which are not implemented.

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,720
You can simply go ahead,
copy those two steps and put it into

123
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,640
the particular plan perspective
plus the steps

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,480
like right in

125
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,000
both cases and goes towards and

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
then the next is monochrome.

127
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,080
What does it mean? Monochrome?

128
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,920
Great now because we

129
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,520
are having good segregated output,
but if we don't output in the console by

130
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,320
running digital

131
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,600
but in this

132
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,560
ink is if there is any information or
unreadable character exist in the console.

133
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,800
Right.

134
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,880
Executing make it in this case,

135
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,240
then what it does when you write
monochrome is the equals to draw.

136
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,560
Then it removes all those things.

137
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,120
It removes all the irrelevant

138
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,200
information, it removes
all the unreadable character, right?

139
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,280
When it removes all the unreadable content
in the limited information, it

140
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,200
gives you prop, but it cleans the output
only with the relevant information.

141
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,120
That's what we are taking already.

142
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,000
So monochrome does equal is
it was removed is not working with this.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,360
But yes, if you are having that kind
of information, if someone is living right

144
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,880
in their console indefinitely,
you will see the effect of it.

145
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,080
Then we use x rayed
this particular part X,

146
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,760
we will go ahead and we will see
more things in this factory duty.

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,480
So that name
I will explaining in plug ins, right?

148
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,440
Yeah. Text.

149
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,120
I will explain.

150
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,520
You indeed get three more plug ins

151
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,480
right now.

152
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,320
Right now, yeah. In plug ins.
Right, right.

153
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,600
We need plug in a lot of plug
ins available.

154
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,720
It is you use always which one

155
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,200
monochrome.

156
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
Ah yes ideally
you should it's optional but we can use

157
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,800
All right so now in

158
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,840
plug ins read
it it's not only for report generation

159
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,800
plus we have so many things
which we can do via plug ins.

160
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,360
As of now,
we are creating just one report rate.

161
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,280
When we proceed further,
I will give you more scenarios

162
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,000
what other things we can do
using this plug ins.

163
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
All right.

164
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,160
So right now just one plugin we are
waiting there to be editable keyboard.

165
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
What is that keyword

166
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,040
in plug ins to be added one word, right?

167
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,520
That is the word

168
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,040
to be added

169
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,800
or read this word, we add it here.

170
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,640
And after that
we provided the instructions.

171
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,720
What kind of instruction?

172
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,320
For example, HDMI, What does it mean?

173
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,000
I need a multiple colon target.

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,280
It means inside my target folder.

175
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,880
What slash estimate?

176
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,720
What does it mean in my target folder?

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I need one report product.

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,920
Each team is are not eligible for work
report related to the converter I need in

179
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,080
my using this plug ins
which is available in middle class

180
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,880
and just put

181
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,120
and then this is deprecated.

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,520
Right.

183
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,320
But like I said,
it is simply an alternative

184
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,720
to the Triton since we already have drain
and that supports deprecated.

185
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,480
So we don't use a strict rate
as a whisper crew here.

186
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,160
At the rate what it does,
it takes all the steps and it is against

187
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,800
what they were.

188
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,840
These steps undefined
and it gives you the initial conditions

189
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,200
frame.

190
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,000
This was the render class
we have seen yesterday, correct?

191
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,600
So Triton,

192
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,920
if it is inserted to brew

193
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,000
it starts right.

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,640
So KG provides

195
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,800
the instance

196
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,880
snipped

197
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,400
in monochrome,

198
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,920
which is

199
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,720
invalid,

200
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,840
means that pretty soon

201
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,880
and the

202
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,240
simple language

203
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,080
as of now
we will shed some more light on it.

204
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,320
Plug ins.

205
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,800
Very good morning division plugins for

206
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:09,280
before generation and under purchase.

207
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,080
Fine guys.

208
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,680
So this is all about class now than me.

209
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,440
What if I copy?

210
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,920
One is the definition
in to establish classes.

211
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,440
What would happen in that case?

212
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,000
And we do this

213
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,560
domain problem.

214
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,120
Okay, fine.

215
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,800
We will get Adelaide duplicate exception.

216
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,800
No, no big boundary.

217
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm talking about one instance
in two different classes.

218
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,280
The nicer two different classes implements
big ones.

219
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,800
It is not normal with the like for example
use only we get to do it

220
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,920
John And this application,

221
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,960
if I implemented this steps in two
different classes, then what would happen?

222
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,680
Your symbol get confused.

223
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,760
Right?
I have to take this steps from there.

224
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,840
So remember we should be having unique

225
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,480
steps implementation for unique instances,
which would be clear enough feature.

226
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:08,840
Correct.

227
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,400
So it has to be a single
list, not multiple places.

228
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,840
Correct. But

229
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,560
the second thing does order maintenance
where we are implementing

230
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,960
in which we are implementing steps.

231
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,320
No, it doesn't matter.

232
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,320
What matters is linking used in our mark

233
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,480
when that I am able to link read

234
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,560
my steps, declaration
with my steps definition or not.

235
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,640
If it is the point, if it is implemented,
then we can see the linking.

236
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,320
Everything is fine and the stored

237
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,800
point.

238
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,800
After that we learn one more important
keyword.

239
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:03,200
Go make chrome.

240
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:11,360
What does it mean when I speak?

241
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
Guys, why do we need big joke

242
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,640
commonality?

243
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,720
Common steps, right?

244
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,160
For reuse the common step that,

245
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,880
for example in one feature

246
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,240
remember my words in one feature.

247
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,080
Fine.

248
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,200
If I had multiple scenarios

249
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,800
endorsed in end use,
I see the starting flow is being.

250
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,720
The starting flow is the mark.

251
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,840
My words in their name.

252
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
I see the reference in the step

253
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,120
builder name.

254
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,640
I see the difference in the step
build next.

255
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,880
And if we see all the

256
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,760
for the two step straight,
all the prior two steps are similar.

257
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:03,120
They are common, so we can use those steps
as the terms of big ground.

258
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,240
Instead of writing those steps again
and again and again.

259
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,200
In all the scenarios, we can keep
those steps only at one place, right?

260
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,040
And that one place is nothing
but my big current.

261
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,960
So common is that certain place
different systems with the person names.

262
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
Now make sure your background
is applicable,

263
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,760
but only one feature by

264
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,200
only one be generally

265
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:30,840
understood.

266
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:41,480
This could add an incident,

267
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:47,000
but it wouldn't cut.

268
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,720
Fine.

269
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,640
So this is all about my big jump.

270
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,720
Let me put this thing

271
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,640
steps

272
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,160
with the use

273
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,040
of single

274
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,120
or single

275
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,280
file.

276
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,560
The bigger

277
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,840
we use big group days.

278
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,400
No, the so far we have done this things

279
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,680
confirming it

280
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,880
can not apply to feature,
but it is a feature by leaps.

281
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,680
It doesn't apply
for all the feature piece.

282
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,200
You mean to sit there trained.

283
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,040
So using the build
we already created big ground.

284
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,800
Great big ground.
Great for a brief feature.

285
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,720
While big ground is different.

286
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,160
We did it last in the last class.

287
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,960
See this bigger.

288
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,000
This particular this class,

289
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,080
this big ground is for particular
with this particular feature.

290
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:02,600
So one big ground for one feature
or linked.

291
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,560
Alright.

292
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
Yep. Yes.

293
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,600
Sorry.

294
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,680
Find. Now

295
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,800
let's increase the scope.

296
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,120
Let's increase the scope.

297
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,240
We are not going to restrict

298
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,040
on imagination and we should build one
feature or deal one class.

299
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,720
We observed one bigger.

300
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,600
There is something common in one region,
some other thing

301
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,480
common in some of the feature by some
other thing, common in some other feature.

302
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,920
But there is one thing
that is one thing or two things

303
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,400
which are common across the entire feature
finds

304
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,520
across the entire project.

305
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,040
It means precondition in both condition

306
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,040
for all the feature files is same
given you that is,

307
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,720
get to a gentleman's application
first to super

308
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,760
user close the browser blast is

309
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,920
going to employ such feature
a given user comment

310
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,920
to step you close the browser common step

311
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,960
go at employ even use a common step.

312
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,720
You close the browser of common
description.

313
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:21,800
Can everyone see?

314
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,640
We can see it. Great.

315
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,200
So now when we have something

316
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,000
which is common across
all the features face,

317
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,000
we don't need to write
even in each of this part,

318
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,520
we don't
even need to write this in feature.

319
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,560
We have a separate place
to call precondition in most condition,

320
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,640
and that thing will work again
and again and again.

321
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,920
Put every single feature by business block

322
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,200
We go hooks into timber,

323
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,480
what we call them hooks

324
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,400
like what
we call them hooks, why we use hooks.

325
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,720
We use hooks to provide

326
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,200
precondition

327
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
pause conditions.

328
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,200
Again, I am repeating yes,
it is correct Hooks

329
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,960
We use hooks to provide preconditions
in most conditions and you can

330
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,680
now see that is a precondition
for every feature file we connect.

331
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,560
We colleague.

332
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,320
If we have a precondition in every feature
by we call it

333
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,520
background.

334
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,840
Similarly, if we have a precondition
and most conditions

335
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,520
to augment project, to automate
all the feature points, we call it

336
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,320
oops, right

337
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,920
now tell me what all are the annotations.

338
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,640
You know, the state,
what all of the annotations

339
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,720
you want to be invested

340
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,560
before, method
after method, before test after test,

341
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,680
before class
after class, before sort of this

342
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,960
right.

343
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,080
These are the annotations. You know,

344
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,480
sometimes it becomes very difficult,
sometimes it becomes very confusing,

345
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,120
right?

346
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,560
Sometimes it becomes to remember
all of them and to decide

347
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:31,280
which one to use,
which will not be correct.

348
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,200
Correct. It happens.

349
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,320
So now now what?

350
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,280
To compasses.

351
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,640
You don't have to be worried
of all this things.

352
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,600
We have just two hooks called before
and after.

353
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,800
Simply put your preconditions in before
put your post conditions

354
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,360
in after the next eight door hooks
we have in the entire computer.

355
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,400
That's it. All right.

356
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,400
So many hooks.

357
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,840
We have guys here.

358
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,760
We have just two hooks.

359
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,160
So good number of hooks are block of code

360
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
that run before or after each scenario.

361
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,000
Now, remember,
when we use our hooks before and after,

362
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,760
it works as a before method flat rate,

363
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,600
correct? Correct.

364
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,800
So before method means running
before everything, then

365
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,600
after method means running
after everything, then correct.

366
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,480
That's what we were using

367
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,920
guys remember before method
after method in this dingy.

368
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,800
Right.

369
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,240
Similarly, when we are going to implement
this a done it before and it after

370
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,880
in December in terms of who it is
considered as a matter of the method,

371
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,320
it means it months before the scenario
and after it vicinity

372
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:46,880
destroyed.

373
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,440
So far.

374
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,040
Second thing
second mark this works, modify works.

375
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,840
What I'm saying
we always have to define hooks

376
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,720
under the back page
where my steps are available.

377
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,080
If we put this point, we should provide

378
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,440
hooks under the package

379
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,160
where my

380
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,280
steps are

381
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,040
in separate class.

382
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,560
Yeah, we will.

383
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,200
We will create,
we will clear nobody, nobody.

384
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,360
Right.

385
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,800
So now what I'm saying this
we have to provide our hooks

386
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,360
under the separate package rate
where all of my steps are available

387
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,280
because hooks are related to steps load
with your actual feature.

388
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,720
Right.

389
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,880
Your feature points
are also going to be jump

390
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,080
steps are also related
to step definitions, correct?

391
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,560
Correct.

392
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,400
And then if you
you're not have any step definition,

393
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
does it make sense
to have all the feature weights?

394
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,080
Does it make sense?

395
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,680
Will it work?

396
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,640
It will not work. Great.

397
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,880
So first we have to write
hollow steps in feature weight.

398
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,080
Then we have to write all this step
definitions, right?

399
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,560
We have to make sure that these
the step definitions

400
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,720
are the step of feature points
that are integrated.

401
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,880
When these two beams are linked together,

402
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,480
we have to
wait hooks in that steps package.

403
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,320
So what would happen this time?

404
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,560
My hooks linked with my steps
which are available

405
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,200
in the different classes
and it executes before

406
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,520
of this menu in terms of precondition
in most condition.

407
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,920
So how many hooks we have?

408
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,720
We have just two hooks before
and after, before and after that

409
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,600
saying no method, no test, no class, no.

410
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,480
Is this point clear

411
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,320
point.

412
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,520
Now, remember one thing

413
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,640
when we use before
let let me let me give you one scenario.

414
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:08,720
Here is my board.

415
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,960
Let me ask you one thing. That to me,

416
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,840
this is my feature by

417
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,920
in my feature file,
I'm having a big growth

418
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,720
rate and I am having my Cincinnati

419
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,240
getting my scenario, says van user

420
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,240
clicks, or it's been

421
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,720
user interface
and I'm also having my hooks

422
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,520
hooks big time scenario feature by

423
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,920
and I'm having my camera. Plus

424
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,840
when I execute my remote last.

425
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,600
Tell me what will execute first

426
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,760
Hooks will execute first, then

427
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,520
item hooks.

428
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,680
Big will execute yes feature by correct.

429
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,880
So in feature find
what is what will execute second bingo

430
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,520
and third scenario

431
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,160
content.

432
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,240
First hooks will execute,
then background will execute.

433
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,560
Instantly you will execute
and then again hooks will execute

434
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,480
again.

435
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,680
Hooks will executed or not. Any

436
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,440
first, second, third, fourth.

437
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:48,480
Isn't it the correct order?

438
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,560
No, no.

439
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,680
You should not get you should believe

440
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,480
because I explaining right
and it's like a loop

441
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,640
not it's not like a loop,
it is just a singular single line.

442
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,600
See hooks execute before condition,
then big known, then scenario,

443
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,640
then hooks execute after condition.

444
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,840
Simple like this that I've been on call.

445
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,600
Got to fight.

446
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,480
All right, guys. So two hooks only simple.

447
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,920
We have before
and we have after that expect.

448
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,640
All right. That's it.

449
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,680
Is this a graphical representation
is clear to everyone

450
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:36,400
or not about the hooks?

451
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,720
This is clear. Super.

452
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,440
Let's proceed for that.

453
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,520
I am going to implement
this hooks part in my project.

454
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
First. I'll right

455
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,120
what I'm going to do.

456
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,600
I'm going to put all of these things
in my hooks part.

457
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,960
So like I said, that I need these hooks

458
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,440
based, that I need hooks

459
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,080
instance.

460
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,880
So let's open the steps.

461
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,760
Let's open this open here.

462
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm going to write

463
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,360
new class code

464
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,800
hooks

465
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,320
and insert hooks.

466
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,240
First ritual.

467
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,720
We have two external common methods. One

468
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,920
fine guys.

469
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,560
Now then me,

470
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,280
we were talking about do keywords
in the hooks, only two hooks we have.

471
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,920
The first one is the

472
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,280
before.

473
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,400
Can you see
it is coming from remember Java?

474
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,160
Remember
we have before with a larger unit as well.

475
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,560
And we had before with
I could convert our java so big this again

476
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,360
what I ordered do Commodore Java don't use

477
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,240
your Einstein bleed use

478
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,680
I ordered to convert our Java

479
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,880
byte big the second one from

480
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,240
right

481
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,160
now in this before hook.

482
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,360
I'm going to write my precondition.

483
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,080
Everyone knows how to write precondition
goes public

484
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,880
void lets it start.

485
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,000
This would be the name of my precondition
and this is the method

486
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,400
I called for My common methods

487
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,840
and right guys.

488
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,680
Open browser launch application
is the matter to be implemented.

489
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,600
Not a common method

490
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,040
is that anyone who has any question
related to this particular part.

491
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,640
We had been doing it multiple times.

492
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,440
Now there is no question
there should not be any question about it.

493
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,480
Great

494
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,520
preconditions then

495
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,240
precondition, then

496
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,720
let's talk about forced condition again.

497
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,920
I don't get Googlebot or Java.

498
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,080
I or not could convert
or Java public void.

499
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,800
Find the end simple

500
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,480
clause browser.

501
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,240
We are calling this method again from our

502
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,560
particular finding great common mistakes

503
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,880
before after done right then we

504
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,400
let us come to our log in feature.

505
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,440
Then let's come to a log in feature,
see what I'm going to do.

506
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,480
I'm going to commit
to this particular step.

507
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,840
I don't need

508
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,520
I don't need this a step here and here.

509
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,600
I don't need this a step also.

510
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
So let me remove this a step also from

511
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,560
now see
my scenario is getting shorter, right?

512
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,120
It's getting reduced.

513
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,720
Earlier we had five plus steps.

514
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,640
Now we have how many days? Ten.

515
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,880
Now we have how many steps to be
in the username password.

516
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,040
Click on log in button

517
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Just three.

518
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,200
Right.

519
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,320
Let's try to execute it.

520
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,880
Okay. Let's try to execute.

521
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,800
Let's see.

522
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,240
I'm going to say log dog feature.

523
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:32,960
Okay.

524
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,480
It says smoke scenarios.

525
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,680
I have to execute both the scenarios.

526
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,280
So I'm going to put smoke here and smoke
here. Fine.

527
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,720
Both scenarios of smoke I have,
is there anyone

528
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,920
who is not getting what I am doing?

529
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,880
Is that anyone who has any question

530
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,880
can be checks? Yes.

531
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,520
Why don't these are the hooks.

532
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:06,880
Please check it Is

533
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,000
is there anyone who has any question
with this part

534
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,440
log in feature

535
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,680
by Yes.

536
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,160
I need you that moment.

537
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,200
So here now can you show the log
in feature economics open?

538
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,560
So now if you'll see here,

539
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,280
instead of using double slash to command
something, this is not your Java.

540
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,840
This is a feature file.

541
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,120
So here we have
we use this hash rate hash to commit.

542
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,680
Did you overnight
when I didn't smoke next in that

543
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,560
or what rate what

544
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,960
what over eight nine.

545
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,040
Number 13. Okay

546
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,800
no I provided multiple takes.

547
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,480
Okay let me simply by today's okay
don't get confused.

548
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,280
It's simple.

549
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:12,720
Remember grouping I told you
the user takes how to use their tag.

550
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,640
Now let me keep it.

551
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,440
Just one is of no fun.

552
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,600
Let's go here in class
and I'm going to run

553
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,000
working fine without my without my step

554
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,040
from grader to sticking the code
for launching the browser and everything.

555
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,440
It's taking the code from my hooks
now, right?

556
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,600
It's taking the code
so simple, launching the browser

557
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,840
or browsing the browser

558
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,520
we need to connect Whoops using
no that we don't need to connect.

559
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,800
We don't need to connect.
That's the beauty of the.

560
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,800
But you just mentioned the hooks
and because you provide it already, glue

561
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,680
it does deps.

562
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,920
Your hooks is already
under your steps, right?

563
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,400
Your hooks are already under the steps,
so it will get automatically identified

564
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,480
by gate.

565
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,680
So now you see this is the hooks back

566
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,280
here.

567
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,880
Now see what I'm going to do.

568
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,080
Do we need this a step.

569
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,480
We don't need it.

570
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,280
Remove it from here.

571
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,360
Do we need this user.

572
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,840
Close the browser nor remove it.

573
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,320
Do we need this step?

574
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,680
No. Removed simple
going to employ feature.

575
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,960
We need it.

576
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,920
No. Then removing booted the last step
not do it now.

577
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,720
See how simple it is great
how simple it is.

578
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,680
Can you see

579
00:33:50,360 --> 00:34:00,680
very small scenarios right?

580
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:04,640
It makes an easy cutting.

581
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,320
So now let me show you another
very good point.

582
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,600
See what I'm going to do in my log
in feature?

583
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,240
You'll be blown up.

584
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,960
It lets in so they give us keyboard

585
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,480
to simplify the code.

586
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,160
Which keyboard

587
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,680
like hooks?

588
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,120
Yes, correct.

589
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Got to simplify.

590
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,200
They like the background scenario
and everything got it.

591
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,040
Now see you said I'm having a lot of
than a lot of then not a lot of pain.

592
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't want all of distance
I don't want this.

593
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,280
When then and keyboard.

594
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,480
I know what my scenario is working
how these things are working.

595
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,200
I know the both gain is always

596
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,440
my precondition
because now you see precondition is going.

597
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,160
Where is your precondition in your hooks

598
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,120
videos? Where is a most condition?

599
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,680
It is also hooks.

600
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,080
So this is just your actual actions,
right?

601
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,200
And the expected results
that you're getting in using sanity kind

602
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,840
categories.

603
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,080
Another important thing,
another important thing, before

604
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,440
I beat you in this particular topic,
you see hooks are applicable.

605
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,320
Well, Blade

606
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,200
hooks are applicable to all the violence

607
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,760
you see in Breakdown Down.

608
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,600
We have different systems in logging.

609
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,800
You should be able to remove this,
nor am I going to do it.

610
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,120
Please don't do it
even if it is available there.

611
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
We are not going to call it. Right?

612
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,000
If we are not calling it, it will be dead.

613
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,400
It's like those useless clothes
in your wardrobe

614
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,120
that you're having, but you're not going
to be at the point on time,

615
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,600
just like that.

616
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,040
Just so just keep give them, give them.

617
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,760
Because

618
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,120
it will look good when the time comes.

619
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,640
They will remember. The code

620
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,240
implies that you should see

621
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,080
is everyone.

622
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:27,480
But with this nice.

623
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,000
So now let me put this in the notes.

624
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,480
People often get confused in between hooks

625
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,360
versus.

626
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,160
Big crown.

627
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,760
So when we talk about background,

628
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,000
it is applicable

629
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,720
is applicable

630
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,560
1 to 1 feature file.

631
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,200
And when we talk about hooks,

632
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,680
it is

633
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,640
it is

634
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,440
applicable to

635
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,360
the feature.

636
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,520
It means we can have multiple becomes
one way people classes,

637
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,000
but we cannot have multiple hooks.

638
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,760
For many people in classes.

639
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,680
There will only be just one hook
for the entire project,

640
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,120
one before one of the next big

641
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,080
point

642
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,800
will be just things to consider.

643
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,960
This one is also spelling mistake.

644
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,400
You guys are very clever, you know.

645
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,680
It is my stick, my

646
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,760
Olga still made amends too.

647
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,880
We didn't start with the actual paperwork

648
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,440
once.

649
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,320
We'll be having the complete part
of print, but it'll be blown away

650
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,480
by looking at the functionality

651
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,000
on another class.

652
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,320
Shows you.

653
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:15,960
This is the class view. Yes.

654
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,840
Cutting that gold is applicable.

655
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,160
No one features like

656
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,960
you are correct, but

657
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,240
yes. Yes. Yes.

658
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,480
Correct. Correct.

659
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,520
Your scenarios will be like this
only just the one step. Yes.

660
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,360
Yes is correct actually.
And this is correct.

661
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,440
That was about will tell you this that
we started from six, nine, seven, nine.

662
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,200
Those scenarios are

663
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,320
they will end up by just one later
synthetic everything will be in just one.

664
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,640
We will learn this trick.

665
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,880
So next time, when you take a data job
and when you go into the company,

666
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,000
you'll be having an out of in the computer
and just one of

667
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,560
it will be doing this.

668
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,760
So fine.

669
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,520
Let me come to this particular page.

670
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,640
The blind, which I wanted to explain

671
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,960
is this When keyword and keyword,
then keyword

672
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:16,520
given keyword, this keywords
are for our understanding, right?

673
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,560
This is what our understanding what use
user lot of when your dog did not open.

674
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,840
I do want this point no issues
but implicit all this keyword

675
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:41,080
with simple start.

676
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,720
Yes I missed it.

677
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,320
It depends.

678
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,280
It depends on the scenarios of scenarios
there definitely we have to use multiple

679
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,280
separate of scenario is just one minor
and if we see that begin

680
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,720
to cover everything in one line,
we will read like that.

681
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,800
Now you see, guys,
it's not going to impact on

682
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,680
any of the big impairments
in areas like this right.

683
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,680
It would be confusing anonymously
since we are learning right now.

684
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,440
That's why you think it is confusing
when it comes to proportionate rate.

685
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,480
They always you start at keywords,
even if by right this start street.

686
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,080
So keywords can be replaced
with a straight yes.

687
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,520
Correct.

688
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,000
But still you'll see if I right click

689
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,280
click on go to go under declaration.

690
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,880
It still does taking me to the same speed.

691
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,440
Can you see

692
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,560
it is

693
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,480
still taking me to the same state correct.

694
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,000
It's it's not going to impact
anything on my baby killer implementation

695
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,240
implementation is not happening now
Nordstrom

696
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,000
let's see whether it is running
with this strict sign or not.

697
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,760
The log in feature
I change in log in feature only extra

698
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,520
words for beginners.

699
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,840
Correct me with

700
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:08,880
working

701
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,840
fine.

702
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,960
Yep. Yep.

703
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,440
Right

704
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,760
now you'll see here and you see a star.

705
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,960
Star star again.

706
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,960
You'll see here stars does not rate

707
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,160
in using your console.

708
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,080
Always these things change

709
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,360
based on your implementation.

710
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,880
It changes

711
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,320
indirect scenario in a star.

712
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,360
No, no, no, no, no. No limit.

713
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,840
They could go better,
but not with the respect of conversion.

714
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,600
Okay.

715
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,800
Play with the element that is the way
it will not allow you to execute. It

716
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,800
is a shortcut to add

717
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,200
short

718
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,760
is trick is just a one click me.

719
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,280
But you need more shortcut learning
how to say this.

720
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,600
I don't know what kind of shortcut
you need to add

721
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,840
this trick.

722
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,080
What?

723
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,560
This is available in your keyboard
trade in your keyboard as well.

724
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
You just click.

725
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,640
It will work.

726
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,600
We can column selected by encoding or non

727
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:31,800
normal.

728
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:38,280
It would work.

729
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,080
Are there certain things that want
if you are very much professionals?

730
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,240
Right.

731
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,520
And if you guys are working day and night
with the scenarios, you think that

732
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,160
these works are taking my much time
and I don't want

733
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,760
this thing where I do mistake.

734
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,280
So Did you add this particular part
in your books?

735
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,120
Sure.

736
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,400
Did you call this clause?

737
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,200
But I was on my 13 year after folks

738
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,200
driver not wait we have just over
not good bit

739
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,640
like we should

740
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,360
see this is we have private

741
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,080
or what can you see

742
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,920
now if it's not closing

743
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,200
can you check whether you still have I
then I close the browser.

744
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,480
If you have that step that

745
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,600
if you have those systems deleted,

746
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,720
delete those steps. How can you read?

747
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,760
How can you start to make a trade
in good improvement?

748
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,800
There's one by one if it is already closed
and that is no point to call it again.

749
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,280
So it will be difficult read.

750
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,960
So just remove those two steps
from all of us to that use.

751
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,000
So this is in case if you want to do again
in case if you want really

752
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,920
if you don't want to do

753
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,640
no issues with your keywords,

754
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,080
find don't get

755
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:03,720
right.

756
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,320
It's optional.

757
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,440
Completely optional.

758
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,720
And of course this everyone.

759
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,160
But yeah.

760
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,440
You mean we will use keywords?

761
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,680
I was just giving you what needed.

762
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,400
That's the whole intention.

763
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:30,680
That is nothing else. Yes.

764
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,880
Yes. It is clear for any user.

765
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,760
Tell me any user reads this thing
or any user reads

766
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,320
this particular thing and what can easily

767
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,560
Imodium for sure, why not? But

768
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,360
is that anyone who is falling behind

769
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,000
long silence?

770
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:21,080
What happened?

771
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:21,520
Clear.

772
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,560
Done Good Read Good Nice.

773
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,920
So so far.

774
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,400
So far.

775
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,560
Class this mode Guys,

776
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,440
I hope you are not taking
a lot of pressure of burden of the class.

777
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,080
Right? Everything is going smooth.

778
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,160
I just want to make sure

779
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,080
please employ such.

780
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,160
Okay. That you

781
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,240
am very much

782
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,280
habitual to take decision
by looking into this camera.

783
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,760
So again, I'm talking to you right
by looking to the camera.

784
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,360
But I always forget that
I have this camera be

785
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:15,760
this problem is

786
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,080
anyone would be playing something
by your yourself, correct?

787
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,920
Yes, ma'am. Yes.

788
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,880
Can you open an employee? Fine.

789
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
Yes, sure.

790
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,960
They will be

791
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,480
it. Right.

792
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,440
But definitely you will be able to see
this is the big

793
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,920
one of the analogy.

794
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,560
This is the big
one of your entire learning.

795
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,760
If you know how to explain the preview.

796
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,680
Anyway, your clicks in the preview
are totally fake.

797
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,200
The V rate, if you can explain the way
I'm going to beat you,

798
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,840
if you explain your framework in that way,

799
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,520
you can have my words
that you will be able to

800
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,760
mark my words to record this station.

801
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,160
Right and draw it on my face.

802
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:17,280
If you don't get a job, just explain
the way I'm going to teach that.

803
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,760
Excellent.

804
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:25,320
All right.

805
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,440
Shall we present for this?

806
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,400
We're going to not

807
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,320
great.

808
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,680
So now.

809
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,360
Now, I was talking yesterday
about one particular

810
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,880
topic right?

811
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,480
You remember the topic we lived in between

812
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,200
two people working on spring, one

813
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,200
in spring, then spring three,

814
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,920
then spring four, and then spring five.

815
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,960
Right.

816
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,040
In this particular spring here, five
scenarios here you have ten scenarios.

817
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,280
Here you have these scenarios again in
your twenties was

818
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,240
So by the end of the spring
you'll be having five.

819
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,760
By the end of second of spring
you would be having four be

820
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,240
end of third, 30 and a fourth.

821
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,920
You'll be having these
scenarios in your bucket

822
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,840
now. Now

823
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,640
you want to check rate how many scenarios

824
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,720
you had executed in your spring, two

825
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,600
in your spring table

826
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,400
at the same time
you want to execute or best guesses

827
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,640
for smoke suite and on the very next day

828
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,720
you want to execute your test cases
in your regulations.

829
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,760
We did some

830
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,400
cutting

831
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,080
categories,

832
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,600
three tables of execution you have.

833
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,240
Is it possible that your scenario belongs
to a string?

834
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,000
Do belongs
to spoken, belongs to regulation is but

835
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,320
in all the three categories
you'll one see that you can do a not

836
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,480
Yes it can be a bar right
It can be a part of your for example.

837
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,200
But if I talk about
a logging functionality

838
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,920
could be implemented
in your second script, Right.

839
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,240
So that particular scenario for logging,
it should be a part of your smoke

840
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,760
because it is a key
functionality of the application.

841
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,160
It should be a part of the ignition order
just to get this.

842
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,160
And because you implemented it
in the spring, do

843
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,400
it should be a part of your second
sprint release in animals or not anymore.

844
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,720
So it means you're one
scenario can be with multiple categories

845
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,560
can be it made people point made fine

846
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,000
this is my log insanity.

847
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,880
This is my log.

848
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,800
The menu you see, it belongs to smoke.

849
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,440
It belongs to the creation.

850
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,400
It belongs to my is

851
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,240
correct.

852
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,240
Correct.

853
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,920
Is this correct?

854
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,560
Now, now, EMC,

855
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,000
if I go if I go in my this particular
Patrick DB, this particular part in my

856
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,920
if I go in my remote class, I have a bag
right here, you see smoke back.

857
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,160
I want to run my multiple scenarios.

858
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,960
So I'm c either right
and under those scenarios

859
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,720
belong to small category or run

860
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,280
those scenarios belong to

861
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,440
the ignition,

862
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,600
either
smoke a degree or ignition Category four.

863
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,680
Now I'm taking just one feature
by because if I take

864
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,720
all the picture paints everything right.

865
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,280
So this to save your name,
I'm picking one particular feature. So

866
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,720
let me go here and

867
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,800
let me change this particular
one to category shape.

868
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,920
Now, tell me how many scenarios

869
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,760
I have, what ignition

870
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,360
and how in this videos

871
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,080
I have four smoke one.

872
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,960
Now let's go into that another class

873
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,080
right here exclude.
But there are no class.

874
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,600
I am using all the keyword
what I'm using this

875
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,280
I'm using or keywords or means either

876
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,560
execute those scenarios having smoke
discussed or execute scenarios.

877
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,200
Having that ignition in this case.

878
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,600
So now in this particular feature,
total three. No.

879
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,080
So not totally actually today, two
because Yes, because

880
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,920
we have two scenarios of how we're going
to execute three scenarios.

881
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,160
This one is common
for smoke integration both

882
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,360
and this one is a specific pot
ignition industrial.

883
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,080
Or let me do one thing, let me do one
thing liquid delete the significant thing.

884
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,880
Now tell me how many scenarios
it will execute from here

885
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,080
if I write smoke or ignition,
this will execute because smoke is here

886
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:00,240
and this will execute
because regulation is is great.

887
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:05,000
So when I use this or keyword,
it means it will execute

888
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,240
either those scenarios having smoke
or those scenarios having your

889
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,720
regulation understood

890
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,800
industrial base.

891
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:22,120
Let's execute this looks executed across.

892
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:39,160
Now see it to go the scenarios in as well.

893
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,600
I'm coming to that point
also I just explain.

894
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:42,880
Great.

895
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,840
I just explained the point

896
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,120
guys do to explain
what are there different disciplines

897
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:53,960
we have in their Nagra.

898
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,200
I will it's once again significantly

899
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,560
like nasal radio
check this particular diagram

900
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:10,640
when I was explaining,
did you take this data?

901
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,080
Okay,

902
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,400
so now here, you see,

903
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,360
I already expected this print to smoke
and the creation rate.

904
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,280
So now let's see.

905
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,720
We executed
based on either smoke or regression.

906
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,320
Now I need to execute only those scenarios

907
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,360
that is that was developed

908
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,360
only in a spring
do it belongs to smoke a degree.

909
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,600
What the conditions I need was 20

910
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,120
should it should belong
to spring to second condition

911
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:47,520
it should belong to smoke industrial in
that is what I have to do.

912
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:53,120
I have to open my remote last
and I have to use this keyword as end

913
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,360
as and

914
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,400
here I'm going to do it.

915
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:06,920
So that's what I'm doing. City

916
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:13,000
sending fake.

917
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,520
Maybe you ask the question only for

918
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,800
So this is your logical end
and that was your logical order.

919
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,840
But no, no, that's fine.

920
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,560
That's fine.

921
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,960
So now you'll see here
when I use and keyword, what does it mean?

922
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,840
It simply means it will execute.

923
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,040
Only those scenarios think both prototype.

924
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,480
Even if you have just one
dead, it's not going to execute

925
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,080
because we need smoke
it as well as we need sprint.

926
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,680
Do it correct.

927
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,720
Now let me go into this and you tell me

928
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,320
if I have here smoke big,

929
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,560
would it execute the second one?

930
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,800
Yes, I will it execute the second one? No.

931
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,080
How many is it will execute in this case?

932
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,320
Just one. Just one scenario.

933
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,400
Let's go here and let's execute

934
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,600
this one.

935
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,520
See, just one scenario would good.

936
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:12,840
What are the standards to

937
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,320
categorize those scenarios
for smoke or two scenarios for smoke?

938
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,800
Who decides this?

939
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,200
So you decide this.

940
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,120
See just one test exposed.

941
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,200
Now, let me tell you how many of you
remember a couple of days back

942
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:31,600
I gave you the definition
of smoke integration.

943
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,680
Everyone knows the functionality

944
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,960
by looking right.

945
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,040
Looking at these three class
is going to amaze

946
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,880
the same liquidity once again scenarios

947
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,800
which defines the key
functionality of the application.

948
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,000
If you want to test only those scenarios,
we call it smoke testing, right?

949
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,920
All the scenarios, all the scenarios
when we check after every deployment,

950
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,880
after every fixed,
after every week of delivery to retrieve

951
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,240
it, four weeks depending on the decision
of the management based.

952
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,920
When you decide
and when you run all of your test cases

953
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,960
to check the health
check of your application.

954
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,320
We call it integration. Understood. Now

955
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,600
I see.

956
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,720
Great, great.

957
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,080
Even if you say 99.9%,
I will repeat the point.

958
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,480
I look like not even 99.

959
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:28,920
I need to inform you because I'm giving my
the incredibly will execute only gives

960
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,040
this with two takes
what with at least one day yesterday.

961
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,880
Got it.

962
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,120
Got it.

963
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,720
Get it now. Here, here.

964
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:44,520
You see this and this
and or you can use it for multiple days.

965
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,520
And integration, right.

966
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,240
If you want to add another one then.

967
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,200
And onwards exist three also and so on.

968
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,440
Right.

969
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,400
Similarly you can use this for auto
also great or this

970
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,160
or this or this simply like this.

971
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,640
And so a lot of combinations
you can use understood

972
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,720
in the mix them knows that ideally it's

973
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,200
I was invisible to use the combination
right

974
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,600
anyway in the framework will see
and it will not be running on one last

975
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,840
maybe be having separate execution
point for that

976
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,080
and then will simply

977
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,640
then migrate all of this or just one click
and it will change the execution

978
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,640
of all the scenarios
that also we are going to do looking

979
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,120
now. Now you'll see

980
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,800
how many of you guys remember
we used multiple test

981
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,000
and do not exactly like

982
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,560
everyone knows it, right?

983
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,280
Everyone understood.

984
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,760
That point is to remember

985
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,400
very similarly.

986
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:07,360
Can we have multiple classes?

987
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,960
We can have. Great.
So let me do one thing.

988
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,080
Let me rename this class and

989
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:15,720
smoke

990
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,840
smoke trade

991
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,240
and let's create

992
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,400
another class called

993
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,920
duration.

994
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,760
No, no, I will coming.

995
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,760
I will commit everything.

996
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,560
So I'm going to be

997
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,840
from here.

998
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,760
I will copy this particular part

999
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,040
and put it in the integration,

1000
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,240
will put it in the regression

1001
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,480
and instead of smoke
I will put only the regression.

1002
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,320
Now see, everything is changed.

1003
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,080
All the smoke related
scenario will execute from here.

1004
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,960
All the regression
related scenario will execute from here.

1005
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,720
Right? We just need to

1006
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,520
provide the part of this part.

1007
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:07,800
Now we got two execution points right
based,

1008
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:23,480
is this correct?

1009
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,320
In another class,

1010
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,600
the British smoke or regression
did it in log in feature on facility.

1011
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,200
We don't smoke in seconds in a
in that case it will execute on

1012
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,480
it will be executed in one

1013
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,480
unit that we just did it

1014
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,440
if we have smoke or regression
and in scenario

1015
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,800
we have clustered smoke and second
regression, then both will execute

1016
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,280
because is smoke, it will be found in

1017
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,880
both point and regression
will be found in the second one.

1018
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,480
Can you open regression?

1019
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,440
Make sure everything is
same with the smoke.

1020
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,280
I just changed this take from smoke index.

1021
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,400
Everything else is same.

1022
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,480
It is just start a leak of your smoke. One

1023
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,560
to describe more trade.

1024
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,560
Instead of writing a smoke in regression
you can write the smoke Grammar

1025
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,680
integration.

1026
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,120
Okay, you can read negative

1027
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:23,560
so far.

1028
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,960
So what everyone

1029
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,680
Nice months now

1030
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,080
Now let's come to this.

1031
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,440
An employee feature

1032
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,440
here here
you'll see like we are seeing user

1033
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,920
clicks on it in button and user
in first name and last name.

1034
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,880
Can you see this user in name and nasty

1035
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,240
guys?

1036
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,440
Can you see
let me go inside this particular

1037
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,720
step.

1038
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,280
This is what we are doing.

1039
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,080
Are we doing correct

1040
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,000
and we will to

1041
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,840
remember I told you one thing that posting

1042
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:34,440
the hardcore data is not good.

1043
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,960
How many of you guys remember
data agreement testing?

1044
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,920
I am restricting my scenario
to just one particular employee

1045
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,760
data driven best seller.

1046
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,720
Remember data provider.

1047
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,760
We implemented their data provider
in testing so that our scenario can run

1048
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,920
May eight straight

1049
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,600
in the name and last name from site.

1050
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,400
All right.

1051
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:10,960
Any of those additions would.

1052
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,960
I will definitely want
any of those additions.

1053
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,560
Good for now.

1054
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,680
Thank you so

1055
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,440
so now

1056
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,680
all are providing this hardcore data.

1057
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,600
Someone asked
before that we can make this method.

1058
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,920
Yes, yes, yes we will.

1059
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,800
We Will do it without Benami transaction.

1060
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,000
That is no data driven.

1061
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,960
Without data driven,
there is no experience of the framework

1062
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,800
without
there is no standard of the playbook.

1063
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,760
There is no job.

1064
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,720
If there is no job
that is more like that thing.

1065
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,360
Certainly
we will make them better mid-priced

1066
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,120
now for better grades,
they should be already discussed

1067
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,280
right from the data
from their data provider.

1068
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:59,600
But it was very big and we have a small
amount of data then it is good, right?

1069
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,040
We already discussed this part.

1070
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,600
One more thing Data provider belongs to

1071
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,520
data, provider belongs to

1072
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,840
this engine
can be used to deploy that here.

1073
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:22,480
No, because we are working
we are dealing with younger.

1074
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,360
So do we have anything particular?

1075
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,600
So the answer is yes.

1076
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,480
We do have one thing with the governance,

1077
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,440
but we are going to implement.

1078
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,520
No, no, Sebastian,
there is a part of later

1079
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,680
discussion post will start from one part.

1080
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,960
Okay, First will start from one part.

1081
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,240
So step by step. No, that's fine, sir.

1082
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:42,720
That's fine.

1083
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,680
I'm glad that still
you have a knowledge of great Nancy Grace.

1084
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,280
We will follow the step first.

1085
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,520
What we will do initially is

1086
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,520
first thing,
we are passing hardcoded data.

1087
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,680
Correct.

1088
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,640
First thing we will do is we will pass

1089
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,280
this data from one byte

1090
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,160
second thing.

1091
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:15,600
So they will pass this data
in terms of in terms of grace

1092
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,840
and in Windows.

1093
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,440
Then we will pass this data
from data driven pass

1094
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,480
and then we will pass this data
from external source.

1095
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,720
All of this is discussed

1096
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,200
today, one by one, already

1097
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,080
passing their data
through multiple means fine.

1098
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,440
And we windows data driven testing,
external and source.

1099
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,080
Obviously excellent source
also belongs to everyone. Just

1100
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,240
talk about report.

1101
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,080
Yes, ma'am.

1102
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:49,600
Yes, ma'am.

1103
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,080
Report is also marked one by one.

1104
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,880
One by one. Hold your horses.

1105
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,960
We still have three more classes
for more classes after this one.

1106
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,520
Right?

1107
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,080
If I beat everything into this class,
what would I be?

1108
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,680
Jump. That would be classes.

1109
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,360
A lot of things are on the way.

1110
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,000
So just a week for you.

1111
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,680
So now first
we will pass this data from file.

1112
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,880
Okay, Let's take one scenario
where we can pause the data from like,

1113
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,880
let me come here.

1114
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,560
Great

1115
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,600
and let me go into my log in feature
frame.

1116
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,960
Anyway, guys, do we have any place
where we have paused this username

1117
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:42,600
and password?

1118
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,440
Let me go into my log.

1119
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,440
In the steps will be line eight zero

1120
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,960
redlining when you know I'm seeing

1121
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,240
where we have provided
all of my username and password.

1122
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,120
Do we have any place

1123
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,680
certain

1124
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:10,200
configured properties?

1125
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,120
We already have this
and we have this function as well.

1126
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,640
How many of you guys
remember this function?

1127
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,400
Read properties, configuring properties.

1128
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,520
How many of you know this function?

1129
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,920
This one gain property value configurator.

1130
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,720
Everyone knows it.

1131
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,360
Fine.

1132
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,920
So let's go in the log in two steps.

1133
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,720
Instead of passing this hardcoded data,

1134
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:41,680
instead of passing this hard,
would it do not pass from here? Go

1135
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,120
configurator, don't

1136
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,000
gain property value by username

1137
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:52,080
and we do this

1138
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:59,280
and we do do this as friends.

1139
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,520
Similarly, instead of passing
this hardcoded data, we can write

1140
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,760
configurator door get property

1141
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,600
when you and pass the password.

1142
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,040
Now. Now this data is coming from where

1143
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,360
this is coming from mine.

1144
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,480
And remember one more thing.

1145
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,680
You're doing this
for a username and password,

1146
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,640
not for the second step,
which is this username and password.

1147
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,760
Okay, so both things are different.

1148
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,480
All right.

1149
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,120
So just I'm passing this data from here.

1150
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,320
Configured property supply.

1151
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,520
First, let's check
whether this scenario is working or not.

1152
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,720
Just bring it to synergy.

1153
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,840
So let me go and change this

1154
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:47,400
back to print.

1155
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,440
Let me run this.

1156
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:55,200
So I'm going to replace my hardcoded
data with my file connect.

1157
01:07:59,040 --> 01:07:59,600
See, it's

1158
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,640
taking their data and then user ID
and username username password.

1159
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:05,720
Good for me. Trade. And it passed.

1160
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,200
So now let's come back to this

1161
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,640
particular point earlier.

1162
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,520
Earlier
we were passing the hardcoded data.

1163
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,760
Okay, Now we are passing the data
from one particular.

1164
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,000
This was the first material intention
behind.

1165
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:24,680
Right?

1166
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,920
So now we achieved this milestone
the most.

1167
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:32,920
We are passing the username and password
from one particular property space.

1168
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,640
We did same thing in our destiny portion.

1169
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,280
Well,

1170
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:41,720
is there anyone who has any question
related to this particular implementation?

1171
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:43,680
What we did so far

1172
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:49,840
one string squeak.

1173
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,480
Should you get a positive?

1174
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,760
Please answer my question.

1175
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,760
Is that any question?

1176
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,520
This is the code you see.

1177
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,360
This is the code.

1178
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:03,560
We have this great initial
log in the steps that you see

1179
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,840
the VB called browser.

1180
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:15,560
We are simply calling
username and password text.

1181
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,520
Now see, everything is everything, right?
There is no hard.

1182
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,760
Could it be a mistake?

1183
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,840
Can you see it is no hardcoded data.

1184
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,720
Everything is connected to

1185
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,040
is. I can see
a lot of people are still typing the code.

1186
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,160
That's why they're not to blame.

1187
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:41,120
Let me come with
the big guys can take the good

1188
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,280
so please check and your username
your passing just once

1189
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,800
the one side quote not this level
quotes on the other side in the username.

1190
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,040
That's why it is giving you the error

1191
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,840
you undoable.

1192
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,840
But you know what happens
sometimes if I do this straight?

1193
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:54,000
Well they will not see anything here
right.

1194
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,040
But they will not write.

1195
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,600
They will stop writing the quote
I had this experience in back

1196
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,760
when I was teaching grade and there never
was not that which obviously

1197
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,080
I was telling them that, hey,

1198
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,960
don't try to communicate the good,
but they do that.

1199
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,440
It doesn't matter for them.

1200
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,000
They do to tell them, right? Whatever.

1201
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,600
You just keep telling them.

1202
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,720
They will keep doing the things
what they want to do.

1203
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:21,040
So at the time, I stop pushing the code
before the completion of the class.

1204
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,080
But then I found some to some their age.

1205
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,160
They didn't even have the code
in between them,

1206
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:29,720
plus the duty when it does anything,
even though things were easy.

1207
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,200
But just because they were not able
to write, they were not able to type.

1208
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,400
They need to understand.

1209
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,840
So from the beginning
they started this strategy

1210
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,200
to commit to the repository
before every break rate or in between.

1211
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,040
Obviously that is the fact that I'm

1212
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,000
committing
the most number of times in the batch. 11,

1213
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,320
eight times, ten times, 11 times.

1214
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,640
I'm committing the code

1215
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,760
because what is happening
then I'm explaining something important.

1216
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,280
I'm not talking about every single one.

1217
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:02,360
Majority of the students are busy,
Blade are busy with.

1218
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,720
The writing of code they are writing.

1219
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,120
They're busy with their code writing.

1220
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,240
They're not giving any focus
on what I'm explaining.

1221
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,240
And after some time
they come up with the questions.

1222
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,800
I need to understand you. Please repeat.

1223
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,000
That's what happening.

1224
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,240
Got it. Correct and index.

1225
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,720
What I always see
this code is for your reference.

1226
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,760
You should always have the code
under the glass plate in your machine

1227
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,600
so that if you get stuck at some place,
take my code late, take your code with me,

1228
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,480
and then if you find any problem,
it would be easy for you to identify rate

1229
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,320
that again.

1230
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,000
Incorrect.

1231
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,960
So even if you copy paste it,
you're not going to know.

1232
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:50,520
Right.

1233
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,040
But doing the same thing
If you're not taking my code

1234
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:58,280
from the repository after the class, then
obviously you will make mistakes, right?

1235
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,240
And you will keep making the mistakes.

1236
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,320
You should be having one reference
point up to the class.

1237
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,520
Great. Great.

1238
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,120
Great, great, great, great.

1239
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,880
That's what you know,
I found the intermediate to be

1240
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,360
so that everyone can be on the same beach.

1241
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,240
I know a couple of
you guys found me slow in teaching,

1242
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,800
but again, I mean, it is the way it is.

1243
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,600
The need of the hour is of now.

1244
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,600
Everyone needs this kind of teachings
and that's why I'm doing this.

1245
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,160
Earlier in the study,
I was bust in second class

1246
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,600
and then I got a lot of messages.

1247
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,000
It Hey, can you please slow?
Can you please go slow?

1248
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,720
We are not taking
they're not skipping school.

1249
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:38,880
No, it's not.

1250
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:39,440
It's good.

1251
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:39,960
It's not good.

1252
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,920
And you got me confused.

1253
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:46,280
It's good. It's tangible. What was that?

1254
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:49,640
Got it.

1255
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,760
Miriam?
Yes? It's the break. Well, with you.

1256
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,160
Amazing. See,

1257
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,600
during the show.

1258
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,120
Great. We would.

1259
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,240
We were talking about those important
points, the strategy

1260
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:04,560
and everything,
and she was quite good the time.

1261
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,400
And then suddenly when in just one minute
she said, I'm going to break it.

1262
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,040
All right, guys,
let's take a break. Right?

1263
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,280
Let's take a break for 20 minutes.

1264
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:19,520
And after 20 minutes,
once again, place, great place.

1265
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:26,600
Let's take a break for 20 minutes.

1266
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,520
So now

1267
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:34,000
looking at this,
we're looking at this picture file park.

1268
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,040
We are done.

1269
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,720
Thanks for is passing
the data from candidate properties

1270
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,360
something right basic properties, but

1271
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,520
we are done with this part.

1272
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:49,200
Now let's talk about this barometer spark
how things done

1273
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:51,480
how can do the things in better meters

1274
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,160
to campuses.

1275
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:03,240
I have my own inbuilt functionality

1276
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:08,320
which you can use to perform data driven
testing in terms of barometers.

1277
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,760
When I say data driven this right,

1278
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
it simply means it
simply means that you can pass

1279
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,440
multiple sets of data

1280
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:23,400
in one scenario and that scenario
will execute a number of times

1281
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,280
depending on the number of datasets
you're passing.

1282
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:32,320
That is what we call data.

1283
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,640
Is this going to

1284
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,720
is this correct or not?

1285
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:39,840
Based on data driven testing,
the definition of a test?

1286
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,920
My first, what we will see

1287
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:47,400
in terms of parameterization testing,
what how we generally do it,

1288
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:51,480
we pass parameters in method
in terms of arguments.

1289
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:57,000
We handle those arguments straight in a
actually script and we fill the data data.

1290
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,640
That's what we do there.

1291
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,240
So what we do not always

1292
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,640
we do this

1293
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,320
fine.

1294
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,000
So instilling,
you know, sort of into gomber,

1295
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,160
we have one key word going

1296
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,920
synthetic.

1297
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,640
We use this given to render

1298
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,920
scenarios correct.

1299
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:28,280
Could there be right
just a simple scenario

1300
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,720
and we are passing the data
from some exquisite config file.

1301
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:36,240
Then we are doing this point
all in old tradition.

1302
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,880
We don't need it.

1303
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,520
Another keyword we have in the Google

1304
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,840
is scenario

1305
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,640
outline

1306
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:49,560
what we have.

1307
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,120
The next is

1308
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,520
this one is over one,

1309
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,720
this one is updated, one.

1310
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:58,560
All right.

1311
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,920
So we need this in any outline to deliver.

1312
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,040
Understood

1313
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,840
industrial base.

1314
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:12,160
Now see where we can find this
scenario later on.

1315
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,600
If I go if I go, let's see in my
an employee feature,

1316
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:22,000
if I'm going to write another scenario
here,

1317
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,000
can you see it's a scenario scenario
outlining template.

1318
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,320
If you see three scenarios,
scenario outline and templates

1319
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,960
now see the difference

1320
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:37,720
now see the difference here
generates in any you outline trade

1321
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:51,400
when I see this scenario apply here,
see what I'm going to do first,

1322
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,800
if I'm going to write scenario outline,

1323
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,720
it is giving me the add of liquidated

1324
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:02,800
scenario paid employee.

1325
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,960
Let me copy this complete portion
just for a moment.

1326
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:06,600
Copy.

1327
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,840
This complete version is still
it is giving me the enter

1328
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,240
y see when I go yet

1329
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,560
it says example is section is missing.

1330
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,560
For example section is missing.

1331
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,920
What does it mean?

1332
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,280
Example section liquidity.

1333
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:32,320
After completing that after
completing the scenario, when you are done

1334
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:37,680
with the scenario writing,
you have to write examples here.

1335
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,600
Now see scenario outline and it is gone.

1336
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:45,360
But what does it mean
when I read examples here?

1337
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,720
What does it mean when I read examples?

1338
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,600
And let me be

1339
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,600
here, I will write See,

1340
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,680
with this symbol I will read

1341
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,960
both me

1342
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,480
and again symbol and write it.

1343
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,080
See me delete

1344
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:07,920
again.

1345
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:13,080
Symbol and write last name and close
by the same thing right here.

1346
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:16,760
I'm going to write the best

1347
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,840
best 1 to 3

1348
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,680
grade middle name, Image's

1349
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:27,600
last name, maybe best 4.6.

1350
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,440
Again,

1351
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,600
this ABC

1352
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,320
middle name means last name

1353
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,120
first X, Y and z.

1354
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,600
Then again best 97.

1355
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,960
When I missed

1356
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,640
then best 3 to 1.

1357
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,520
And you see this.

1358
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,400
Can you see what I'm doing here

1359
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,080
now? Now what happens?

1360
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:06,560
My this scenario
this scenario will execute three times

1361
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,000
because my first name we didn't name
last name how many did I have to wait?

1362
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,280
3.3 things right now.

1363
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:20,640
The point is how are we going to link
our exam buds to our scenario line?

1364
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,280
How can we link

1365
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,000
are examples to our scenario
outline understood.

1366
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,200
How can we do this?

1367
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,360
So let's see how we can do this.

1368
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:35,280
Here we are going to write user interface
to me.

1369
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:36,600
Right?

1370
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,000
So now see instead of using this post,
copy this

1371
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,400
it here first.

1372
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,680
Now do this.

1373
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:50,400
The quotes.

1374
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,040
When you provide double codes

1375
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,960
like this here

1376
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:01,960
again, the way that works and here

1377
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,080
you provide again
the key that you're passing below sake

1378
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,120
and then you will put this key

1379
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,520
with the last name.

1380
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:15,440
This one.

1381
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,040
Now you see the connection just to orange.

1382
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:23,640
Nice guys.

1383
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,120
Can you see
this cannot changes to orange one.

1384
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,280
It means somehow it found this key here
correct?

1385
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:32,960
Correct.

1386
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,480
But we do not have any step definition

1387
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,040
for this particular step
because this is the new step.

1388
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,160
Remember, minus purple.

1389
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:44,280
Congratulations.

1390
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,680
Now color changes, right?

1391
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,960
Collecting this. See?

1392
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,040
First name, middle name, last name.

1393
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,760
You passed these things right?

1394
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,320
When you pass this three keys,

1395
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:00,600
make sure these keys match with the keys
you're passing.

1396
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,160
In your example statement.

1397
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,680
Right.

1398
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:08,240
They should pass in your examples
deeper understood this Borges

1399
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,920
every
time it will begin in first vibration.

1400
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,120
If we take this data in sync.

1401
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,120
In addition, it will take this data.

1402
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,200
In addition
it will make this data understood.

1403
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,000
Make me right here called new take.

1404
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:24,520
I'm waiting.

1405
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:27,240
Could be the

1406
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,000
best.

1407
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,960
Is there anyone Who has any question

1408
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,400
with this explanation
what I just explained.

1409
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,440
Let me show you examples table

1410
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:41,120
also here.

1411
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:46,360
When you provide first name,

1412
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,000
middle name

1413
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,400
and last name, these three things
when you provide here, right?

1414
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,600
And you pass via

1415
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,720
later examples, people

1416
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,160
first name, middle name, last name B b b

1417
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:07,920
an e to be to be able to be three.

1418
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,800
The m three the find

1419
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:16,880
these is their data
that you are posting from your examples.

1420
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:17,600
People

1421
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:21,960
how things work
when you execute your scenario

1422
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,840
right it fourth time
it will identify and it will get

1423
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,040
these are the keys we are passing them
with the last name from here.

1424
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:32,280
From here.

1425
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:32,920
Right.

1426
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,800
And then we are passing
these two in first orientation.

1427
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,200
If we take this data, same thing.

1428
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:42,200
Anyone will run for this data,
same scenario will run for this data.

1429
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,880
So tell me my one scenario will learn
how many times

1430
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,240
my one scenario will run.

1431
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,200
How many times three times,
depending on the state,

1432
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,560
depending on the state
or number of this dataset.

1433
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,280
I'm waiting here
getting current categories.

1434
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,680
Let's create this step.

1435
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,920
Let's create this step for this one.

1436
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,480
Now tell me if I want to create this step.

1437
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,720
What is the best approach
to create this to

1438
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,000
driver point?

1439
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,520
So they're just going to the small part.

1440
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,520
State Let me change the state to DDT.

1441
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:24,640
Correct.

1442
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,160
And let me check this
because I'm focusing on just one feature.

1443
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:31,240
Fine. So I'm voting for this aid employee.

1444
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,000
The feature

1445
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:37,160
added employee don't feature right this

1446
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:40,920
guy's right.

1447
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,120
What I'm doing

1448
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:51,920
right

1449
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,160
now, Brian, is equal to to

1450
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,000
one more thing is right
and is equal to put

1451
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:06,440
good.

1452
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:10,000
Let's proceed for that

1453
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,920
which I

1454
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,720
It gave me the step straight.

1455
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:33,000
Can you see it
says that is Dem user does 2123

1456
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:36,120
EMIs best 456

1457
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,440
guys can you see it is not picking first

1458
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:44,480
name, middle name
and last name or tier undefined exception.

1459
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,640
It means it is already started
reading the data.

1460
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,680
But here now see what is the difference?

1461
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:50,880
It is speaking.

1462
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,760
The string is string string

1463
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,040
with double chords
you passed staking three strings.

1464
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,840
Can you simply

1465
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,800
the difference in

1466
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,480
would be normal step
and the difference in between scenario.

1467
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,520
We have to take out the hard data
from steps.

1468
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:10,560
No, we have already order heart

1469
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,800
rate from the step.

1470
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,840
We are creating the new steps.

1471
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,120
We have to do it now. See,

1472
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,760
this should be the part of your employee
steps or not.

1473
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:22,360
10 minutes.

1474
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:26,120
They should be the part of good
employee steps right now.

1475
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,440
See, earlier
we were adding data like this.

1476
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,000
Right now we won't use this.

1477
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,520
We will use this particular
see I have written it over here.

1478
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,800
Now see how things work.

1479
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,080
Tell me the first key is which one?

1480
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,240
When looking into this scenario,

1481
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,040
what is the scenario

1482
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,840
when looking into the scenario?

1483
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,320
First key is first name.

1484
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,120
So let's take this key.

1485
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:55,480
Let's take this key and go here.

1486
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,920
Go here and you forced to me

1487
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,720
second key

1488
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,880
break would be your No, no.

1489
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,800
Only means they can get your middle name

1490
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:09,240
right.

1491
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:13,480
So just take the middle name key
find good people you're here

1492
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,480
put is in the third key is your

1493
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,320
last correct

1494
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:24,480
Is this correct case

1495
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,760
is built still

1496
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:30,080
these keys are agreed
by because we didn't use

1497
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,920
we didn't use this keys right
anywhere find so for false name and

1498
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,320
for forced them in last name.

1499
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,560
We already have this data.

1500
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:39,840
Guys.

1501
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,000
Can you see we already have this element
supposed to stimulate.

1502
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,080
So let me copy.

1503
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,320
Let me copy this post.

1504
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:50,960
The last thing you any question
why I'm calling this

1505
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:58,160
any question, I'm
changing the keys to force it to see it

1506
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:01,200
because it is matching with the argument
firstly.

1507
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:06,720
So first name, what is the problem?

1508
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:11,160
I am fine and I'm changing this last to me

1509
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,200
and see here also to this last name.

1510
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,640
Now tell me this.

1511
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:25,920
Do I need to pass this data hardcoded?

1512
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,160
No, no, I don't need to.

1513
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,560
Instead I can pass my first name barometer

1514
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,680
yet I can pass my

1515
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,600
3000 in parameter right now.

1516
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,680
See, both are black color changed,
but middle name is still great

1517
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:48,040
because we have to take the locator
of this middle name also, right?

1518
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,760
We have to take the locator of middle name
also.

1519
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:51,680
Fine.

1520
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,720
So let's go ahead and take this locator.

1521
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,160
My my code work without.

1522
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:57,480
Right.

1523
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:05,760
This is steps.

1524
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:11,600
How? Just two questions.

1525
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:27,880
Why and how?

1526
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:28,840
Yeah, that's fine.

1527
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:38,760
That's fine.

1528
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,920
Let me find this locator first.

1529
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,720
It will find this.

1530
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,880
Look at the first you age.

1531
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,640
But I am going to treat

1532
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,360
one missing one string.

1533
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:28,240
So did you check that your implementation
part is correct in your feature point?

1534
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,880
Is this the part that you did
correctly like this?

1535
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:37,600
If it is like this,
only a good one, please check their

1536
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,640
very similar to test engineer this.

1537
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,320
Right. Right.

1538
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,000
It was where it not yet.

1539
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,480
We are doing this

1540
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:51,800
in spec for them.

1541
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,360
Really.

1542
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,600
If I go here it is giving me would they.

1543
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:00,640
This might be how many words variable.

1544
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:04,080
No. Which but I that it was corresponding

1545
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:04,800
file.

1546
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,080
Okay.

1547
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,240
All right. Tell me what is up.

1548
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,960
This is my arguing number.

1549
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,200
You know how parameters to make works,

1550
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:20,520
right?

1551
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,080
This argument which I'm passing right.

1552
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,240
I'm passing in my method. Right.

1553
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:30,360
It will consider as the first argument
that I'm passing from my feature point.

1554
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,080
From my feature. Right. Right.

1555
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:36,680
So the first one is going to be handled
by a first argument.

1556
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,680
Second value will my second one
and third value will be handled

1557
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:45,240
by the third one will break.

1558
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,520
All right. Well,

1559
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,160
then there's a part of Java

1560
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,240
right now.

1561
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,200
Let me write this one for element

1562
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:58,560
of be.

1563
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,280
This is to appear

1564
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,480
and they should be slightly better than me

1565
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,600
and this fourth

1566
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,240
we didn't see

1567
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:18,120
this one was not that I would

1568
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,240
so what is this going to create

1569
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:22,760
so far

1570
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,080
but the second row, when you went to
the third, Benham would

1571
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,680
circle the second web element, right?

1572
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,320
The second element, I am passing the key.

1573
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:35,600
So here it is dealing with this key.

1574
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,160
See, in same because I'm passing the key.

1575
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:38,880
Right.

1576
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:44,240
So now here is key based
and from there it is argument.

1577
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:48,160
This numbers matters from feature
vital steps in methods.

1578
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:48,600
Right.

1579
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,440
But inside the steps where we are calling
it depends on the key.

1580
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,880
Key should be matched.

1581
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,360
So it doesn't matter
that if I'm going to take this middle

1582
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,560
name in the first place, it will work
because it is matching with this key.

1583
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,760
And this is coming from my feature right
so far.

1584
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:26,080
Is there anyone who has any question
with this portion?

1585
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:27,400
No question.

1586
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:32,480
Everyone good.

1587
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,480
Now let's come here for an employee.

1588
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,480
One say Sure, sure

1589
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,960
is we no one's going to want to

1590
01:34:33,960 --> 01:35:19,000
see this one.

1591
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,080
And I see smoke.

1592
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:22,920
Sure.

1593
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:25,280
There you go.

1594
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:30,040
This is the smoke.

1595
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:33,840
I was reading all those questions
that I'm getting in slack from students

1596
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,400
or just taking to those questions
where they impact accordingly.

1597
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:44,320
Am I missing another part but
must exist those resources configure them.

1598
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:47,080
Are you not using system
to propagate property

1599
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,240
multiple

1600
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:06,080
then everyone?

1601
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,280
But this fixed She will help note
something is fine.

1602
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,000
Shall we proceed further?

1603
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,920
Let's execute.

1604
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:15,480
Oops.

1605
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:23,520
It's not going to work.

1606
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:24,000
Great.

1607
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,200
But you'll see here
what I wanted to show you Quick

1608
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,360
is one, two, three, four, five, six.

1609
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,480
Best ABC, Ms..

1610
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,960
Best x, y, z,

1611
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,040
Best 9x7 and Ms.

1612
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,320
Just three, two, one.

1613
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:42,760
And employee number one.

1614
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:44,360
Number two, number three.

1615
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,520
But it employs too many.

1616
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,880
Are these details
we were looking forward to.

1617
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:52,280
Now let's actually execute them now.

1618
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,920
Let's actually execute them.

1619
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:56,880
Make it influence
going through the scenario

1620
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:00,360
and see it is clicking on
the were employed successfully.

1621
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,240
Fine let's go here and execute

1622
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,200
run run run fine so you already run it

1623
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,360
create a

1624
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,840
link to it until yours is done.

1625
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:27,000
Great. Yes.

1626
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,640
Yes sir.

1627
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:41,280
Thank you so much, sir.

1628
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:48,600
See D do it all together.

1629
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:49,840
Do it all together.

1630
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,600
Aiming to make it work all together.

1631
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,960
Everyone should have it

1632
01:37:56,720 --> 01:38:07,400
ready.

1633
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:12,880
Now does this for the sake of degradation
right.

1634
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,400
See the second iteration.

1635
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,720
But the second one, then tighter.

1636
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,800
Got it, guys.

1637
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:22,200
Correct.

1638
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,160
Did you observe one thing?

1639
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:25,560
Did you observe one thing?

1640
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,680
My browser is not closed,
even though I provided hooks.

1641
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,800
Hooks should execute the network

1642
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:36,720
opportunity,
but every time my browser launches

1643
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:42,040
everything right, my browser launches
every time it is closed.

1644
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:44,320
Sorry, my right, it's closed everything.

1645
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,280
It means what?

1646
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:48,920
Operating my employee
every time it is closed.

1647
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:52,400
Even when I am working
with just one scenario,

1648
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:56,680
even if
I'm working with just one scenario,

1649
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,480
every time it open the browser,
it close the browser, open

1650
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,520
the browser, closed the browser
time, opened it and closed. Why?

1651
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,840
Because now the moment
I provided the negative

1652
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,360
when distinguish consider asked
three scenarios are not ones.

1653
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:17,400
So now you see below to test paused
How many?

1654
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,600
How many test cases are passed?

1655
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:26,880
Let's see the report also here.

1656
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,680
Let me show you this report
from Target window

1657
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,920
open in browser

1658
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:40,320
going to Chrome. See?

1659
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,320
And you see it says employee straight

1660
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:49,160
for EST one, two, 3456 past ABC M is x,
y, z pass nine x.

1661
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:50,520
The name is just 3 to 1.

1662
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:53,160
First all these three.

1663
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:54,920
Now you can simply take it

1664
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:58,440
as the screenshot and send it to anyone
like this on the correct correct

1665
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:14,880
already understood

1666
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:22,320
in this report.

1667
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:22,960
Clear

1668
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,840
easy work

1669
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,840
is there to give or take screenshots.

1670
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:38,840
Oh no, no.

1671
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:45,200
We will give you the screenshot
also with the reports.

1672
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:48,240
Just because we didn't provide stuff.

1673
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:51,080
Right or not, we already changed the next

1674
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:56,760
so far.

1675
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:05,800
So what everyone want in
of blame portion here everyone.

1676
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,960
All right.

1677
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,080
Let's go back to personnel you

1678
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,440
right now time to learn something new.

1679
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:17,640
Something new.

1680
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:18,840
Let's say

1681
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:22,360
obviously the hardcoded name
is not appreciable appreciably.

1682
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,440
We already discussed
we cannot pass hardcoded data

1683
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:28,480
and now we do not have hardcoded.

1684
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:29,280
Fine.

1685
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,240
Then what else we can do?

1686
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:33,960
What else we can do? Simple.

1687
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:38,640
Either we can pass data like this
in terms of so that it will work.

1688
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:39,720
Getting

1689
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:45,040
correct so that it executes
across multiple sets of data.

1690
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,560
Or else we can do one thing

1691
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,360
if we have just one stick of data
in that time.

1692
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:55,120
If I don't want to pass by our hardcoded
data, then what we can do. See,

1693
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:00,560
I will take simple scenario
which is ending one

1694
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:05,120
log using good feature

1695
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:07,720
right now.

1696
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:11,960
See, again, I'm going to provide the
parameterized data but in different form.

1697
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:16,160
So this time
if you see I provided scenario

1698
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:19,560
and not scenario understood.

1699
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:23,320
That is I provided scenario
not seen any new.

1700
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,160
You see everyone

1701
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,720
it means

1702
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:31,080
it means if I'm providing scenario
and not scenario.

1703
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:31,440
Okay.

1704
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:34,560
Do any to provide exemptions do but

1705
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:38,880
no, we don't need to provide any example

1706
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:42,880
simple rate this time
I'm going to provide simple bar.

1707
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,280
Now see what I'm going to do

1708
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,160
here.

1709
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:47,640
Okay.

1710
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:50,840
Let me copy this complete scenario.

1711
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,600
Let me copy this complete scenario.

1712
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,960
I cannot find.

1713
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,160
So I am going to write user interface.

1714
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:02,480
I added data

1715
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:05,840
such as, for example, let's see

1716
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,480
Sebastian

1717
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:14,920
Vos to name just to make it unique.

1718
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:17,480
Then the name would be

1719
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,200
pristine.

1720
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,640
We didn't name

1721
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,320
and then would take

1722
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,600
you get the last name

1723
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,760
and you see what I'm doing

1724
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:34,560
directly.

1725
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:39,200
If I have the data, If I have the data
with the help of the well

1726
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:43,320
codes,
I can directly aid what I can do directly.

1727
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,720
So let me write it again here with

1728
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:49,080
simple conversion rate, I'm

1729
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:52,360
ready to convert it
just to just to make it unique.

1730
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,600
Guys, if we have just one employee to add

1731
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:00,760
or if we are dealing with this scenario
where we have to bias just one data.

1732
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:06,120
So instead of passing from a new fight
or instead of passing this data hardcoded,

1733
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:09,880
we can simply pass this data
directly from our feature

1734
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:13,760
so we don't need to be bothered
about having other points in this group.

1735
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,000
So far, the spark

1736
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,800
questions is no.

1737
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:29,160
Christin now understood
what I just expected.

1738
01:44:29,160 --> 01:44:34,120
Months now see, this time
I need to do just one thing.

1739
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:37,280
Change time to become better

1740
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,680
over and provide this right and as equals

1741
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:45,400
to why I'm making it this one.

1742
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,320
Making this one to

1743
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:53,000
the right.

1744
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:54,360
I don't want to waste time.

1745
01:44:54,360 --> 01:45:02,640
I want to generate system.

1746
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:05,320
See again, because this data

1747
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:10,440
can you see

1748
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:16,000
again

1749
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,120
we got this data right
so just take in the formula

1750
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:23,080
springs from here
is taking the form of the strings

1751
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:27,560
go in the method heart rate, go into the

1752
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,880
an employee instance and add this step

1753
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
and add this.

1754
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,200
No, see,

1755
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:38,640
I am going to pass this data as is

1756
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:41,520
first need

1757
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:44,480
this data as

1758
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,960
Melanie and this data is

1759
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,160
us now tell me

1760
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:56,200
how I'm going to fetch this data
from my feature by Simple.

1761
01:45:56,200 --> 01:45:59,480
The first data we are passing,
it will be considered

1762
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:02,560
as the first name
because the order makers from there.

1763
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:07,760
But when I'm taking this data from here,
can I simply pass it?

1764
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:12,000
Can I simply password here like this best?

1765
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,400
Can I do this?

1766
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,600
Students

1767
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,080
and simply I can change this keys.

1768
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:22,640
I can take this case from here to match.

1769
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:23,240
Right.

1770
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:26,080
So these are the arguments I'm handling

1771
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:32,400
this data with the name and possible.

1772
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:44,040
Any questions far in this part?

1773
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:45,880
What tag we use?

1774
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:46,880
Oh, yeah.

1775
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,880
Indirectly.

1776
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:50,600
Right.

1777
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:54,080
Because we are passing the data
from to Uber, so we use it directly. But

1778
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:59,680
you can rate and no issues
anything you can use personal.

1779
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:00,600
You use see

1780
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:10,520
with scenario.

1781
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,840
Let me open this in any which scenario

1782
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:19,440
I was showing it

1783
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,080
employs steps
only this is the employees break

1784
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,360
so it was opened earlier also

1785
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:44,280
this feature by looking why not me.

1786
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:47,880
What is the issue here?

1787
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,280
Is there any other one with question
like this?

1788
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:52,000
Any other one

1789
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,200
with this question?

1790
01:47:54,920 --> 01:47:56,520
Why are we using this?

1791
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:58,920
I told you was it belongs to you.

1792
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:00,640
It completely depends on you.

1793
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,960
Whatever big you want to use,
you can use that thing just to make it

1794
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:09,960
easy, just to make it, just to memorize it
using this particular data.

1795
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:15,240
So really easy to understand.

1796
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:15,640
Correct.

1797
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:17,800
To use the Michael for title. Right.

1798
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:19,200
But again, know

1799
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:22,840
all the vegetables, all the fruits,
anything you can use which are not

1800
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:30,160
simple good timber scenario.

1801
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:32,480
Another intelligent kind of

1802
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,880
additional equipment keeps all

1803
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:37,840
the goomba

1804
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:39,880
scenario.

1805
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:41,400
You already

1806
01:48:41,880 --> 01:48:44,040
let me copy this one

1807
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,200
and paste it in my small part

1808
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:51,360
and let's do it straight equals to false.

1809
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:53,840
Shall we run it now?

1810
01:48:53,840 --> 01:49:00,600
Because we already implemented the state.

1811
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,280
I will give you time based on quality.

1812
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:02,840
After this.

1813
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:12,480
I been given my complete work.

1814
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:13,680
Let's extra

1815
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:43,960
it added their data

1816
01:49:43,960 --> 01:49:50,720
and big employee correct.

1817
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,440
Is this correct?

1818
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:55,760
The students.

1819
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,920
But if we don't run with Vegas
specification, those two methods

1820
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:01,320
is to be recognized
because they are overloaded.

1821
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:04,760
Those two methods wish to winners

1822
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:07,800
of your preconditions and post condition.

1823
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:19,080
You. We.

1824
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:22,440
But then if you don't use tag
that will execute

1825
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:30,480
all the scenario, right?

1826
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:31,960
It will execute all those in the result

1827
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:34,200
to make them you
to make the attribute correct

1828
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:38,280
and this to there.

1829
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,400
See, let me show you what you are
trying to say.

1830
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:43,400
I got it. See if I click on this method.

1831
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:46,520
Likely I told you to check the link

1832
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:49,600
writing go to declaration.

1833
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:51,920
It is coming to this particular run rate.

1834
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:54,560
Can you see?

1835
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:56,480
Can you see
it is coming to this particular work?

1836
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:00,480
But if you go here and you click
here, right

1837
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:04,360
click and go to
it is taking you to this one,

1838
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:05,800
right?

1839
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:09,120
So internally
it is linked because of example, stable

1840
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,520
income leads, the example stable rate

1841
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:22,840
so far.

1842
01:51:22,840 --> 01:51:24,240
So what everyone

1843
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:47,280
in equal

1844
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,320
but is by shows that you go

1845
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,080
there in this article

1846
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:38,960
is this hard coding as well.

1847
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,160
So this is not hard coding.

1848
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,440
This is not hard coding.

1849
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:46,200
Hard coding means you master data in your
this particular part

1850
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:49,840
trade in your method in the matter
passing them.

1851
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,200
This is not hard for me.

1852
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,720
You can change this data you put there.

1853
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:54,800
That's what I saying.

1854
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:58,200
So when you parse their data
from your scenario of you continued

1855
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:00,120
at any point of time in this scenario.

1856
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:04,040
So that linking of passing the arguments
is not going to change in this case.

1857
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:04,640
Right.

1858
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:06,760
It may specifically explain

1859
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:10,160
you have to use this case,
but you have just one set of data.

1860
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:10,920
All right.

1861
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:12,680
You have when

1862
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,720
you have just one set of data,
then you have to use this approach.

1863
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,360
Otherwise you can use another approach.
What is that approach?

1864
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:23,560
I already told you examples table right?

1865
01:53:23,560 --> 01:53:26,640
Guess.

1866
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:43,160
Are these two things
clear to everyone? Nice

1867
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,600
to proceed further with the third

1868
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,600
rate.

1869
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,440
Let's proceed further with the third one.

1870
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:59,520
So here, if you see

1871
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:04,200
file part is done

1872
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,960
using example unstable scenario
outline is done

1873
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:12,720
right now
we are going to talk about employee data.

1874
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,160
Okay.

1875
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:20,160
We are going to talk about employee data
busting from some external source.

1876
01:54:20,160 --> 01:54:20,880
Right?

1877
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,400
So when I see the data,
which we are going to pass

1878
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:26,440
from some external source,
we are going to use that data.

1879
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:29,760
All right.

1880
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:32,520
All right. Now what we will do,

1881
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:36,360
we will keep our scenario in one place.

1882
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,320
It will keep us any one place.

1883
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:44,280
Can we do a negative testing of an admin
log in with example?

1884
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,760
It will. Yes, sir, we will.

1885
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,760
We will do that.
Hopefully we will implement that.

1886
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:50,960
But also,
if you want, let's do that first.

1887
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:54,080
If you want, let's do that first.

1888
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,320
It would be very easy.

1889
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:58,880
See what we are going to do

1890
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,040
when implementing this logic, right?

1891
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:10,640
See how easy it is to perform, to

1892
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:17,360
raise rate to is to pass it first initial.

1893
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:22,440
Then we will see how to pass the data
from extremely by going to log in feature,

1894
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,880
going to log in feature, create
another scenario here

1895
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:29,160
we trained Samad

1896
01:55:29,160 --> 01:55:33,320
you mercenary
you actually your vicinity apply right

1897
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:39,120
so negative

1898
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:42,880
next point

1899
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:45,600
so I'm
entering here for username password.

1900
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,880
So when a user

1901
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:52,360
enters great interest
I'm bringing different

1902
01:55:56,560 --> 01:55:58,000
username

1903
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:05,880
and password

1904
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:08,880
activity.

1905
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,560
The be verify the

1906
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:15,840
added

1907
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:19,680
user interface,
different username and password

1908
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:23,040
activated by the error for

1909
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:30,480
for all the all the combinations.

1910
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:36,160
And here I'm going to write my examples
table.

1911
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:38,880
I will boss username is the key

1912
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:43,000
to password is the key

1913
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,440
error message is the previous right.

1914
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:48,880
Now let's check.

1915
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:52,800
Let's check for this scenario
first go here on the application form

1916
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:56,360
and let me loaded first from

1917
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:57,480
look first.

1918
01:56:58,120 --> 01:57:00,480
If I write see the combinations

1919
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:02,560
all the genius.

1920
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:05,240
Let's create your menu knowledge

1921
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:06,080
first.

1922
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:09,920
If I write a valid username

1923
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:13,200
embedded when it is an invalid password,

1924
01:57:14,440 --> 01:57:17,080
something invalid password
and I click on log in that

1925
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:21,240
it is invalid credentials.

1926
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,400
Can you see

1927
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:30,640
it says invalid credentials?

1928
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:33,240
Fine.

1929
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:36,600
If I boss invalid username and

1930
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:45,000
password, it says click on log in again.

1931
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,120
It says invalid credentials.

1932
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:52,240
Two guesses for requesting
invalid username, but it password.

1933
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:55,320
Well, it is an invalid password. Correct.

1934
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:59,080
Lucas's what would be the code biggest

1935
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:00,480
medina man?

1936
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,960
What would be the 30th

1937
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,040
MP Great.

1938
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:09,680
So I will pass worst enemy and leave empty

1939
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:13,200
Both Incorrect

1940
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:18,960
it is password cannot be empty message

1941
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:24,040
in the fourth one

1942
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:26,680
keep it empty and plus something here

1943
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:31,040
and then click
it says username can not be empty.

1944
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:36,440
Got it.

1945
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:37,440
Got it.

1946
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:40,560
So it means for combinations

1947
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,920
we can think of
is of now for combinations trade

1948
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:46,680
and then error is changing.

1949
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:48,600
So how many errors we are getting those?

1950
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:51,240
The first one is invalid credentials.

1951
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,080
Secondly, those are invalid credentials.

1952
01:58:54,080 --> 01:58:58,680
Third is password can not be empty
and for this username cannot be empty.

1953
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,600
So all in one we had three error messages
invalid credentials

1954
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:06,640
in both the cases that in three
error messages we are getting

1955
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:10,800
20. So let's go ahead here.

1956
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,160
Let's talk about one by one first

1957
01:59:13,160 --> 01:59:16,080
valid user and

1958
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:19,040
invalid password x, y and z.

1959
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,440
So what would be the error message?

1960
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:23,800
Error message would be invalid

1961
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,200
credentials, correct?

1962
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:31,200
One day, please follow me.

1963
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:35,680
Is this correct?

1964
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:36,840
Nice.

1965
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:40,440
The second one is I'm seeing

1966
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,240
Cristiano

1967
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:48,720
and the password is correct. One

1968
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:57,160
again, I would it invalid

1969
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:01,800
mentions rate

1970
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,120
three days

1971
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:11,520
and then the third one I'm begging is
leave this pool empty

1972
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,920
user name empty and put the password

1973
02:00:17,880 --> 02:00:20,040
so it should see user name

1974
02:00:22,040 --> 02:00:24,320
and not B

1975
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:28,400
can not be empty
username cannot be correct.

1976
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:31,560
And then the fourth one I would see

1977
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:37,800
take their data username,
leave the password blank and right.

1978
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,560
So I should see

1979
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:43,000
four again.

1980
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:47,160
Not be empty.

1981
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:55,520
Are these correct combinations or not? I

1982
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:57,400
am saying

1983
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:01,040
log in test just for waiting one day
for long.

1984
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:03,200
Log in all empty combination.

1985
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:05,760
All right. So again,
I think it's not going to change.

1986
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:09,000
It will take you to the same place
because it will check first

1987
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:13,040
for username,
so it will give you the same error.

1988
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:15,040
That's why I'm working

1989
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:18,760
when I'm using this log in big rate.

1990
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:22,960
Or you can write log in validation
also whatever those in your

1991
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:24,200
because you can keep.

1992
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:29,520
I don't have any issue and providing
just a log point let me go into the smoke

1993
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:32,520
and here I will provide

1994
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:34,880
this particular scenario name is logging

1995
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:37,840
missing and

1996
02:01:38,200 --> 02:01:40,880
balancing and

1997
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,160
invalid

1998
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:57,760
credentials.

1999
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:59,920
Anyway, it will going to give you invalid
credentials.

2000
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:05,280
We have to provide
invalid credentials, but

2001
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:08,880
even if you provide end,

2002
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:14,880
it's not letting us log in.

2003
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:23,720
Next my standard
within a fraction of a moment.

2004
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:29,040
All right,
so now let's go here in the smoke part.

2005
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,120
And here let's make it true again.

2006
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:33,880
Let's make it to again my to make it to

2007
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,880
my to make it was prevents

2008
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:46,520
yeah good list can and do this to find

2009
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:49,320
the running

2010
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:58,280
for that one

2011
02:02:58,320 --> 02:02:59,440
common

2012
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:01,720
logging feature.

2013
02:03:01,720 --> 02:03:04,360
Yes yes yes yes sir

2014
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:09,800
It employee nature kind of

2015
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:17,560
it came with resistance
so let me take it from here.

2016
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:21,080
Let me go into my log in.

2017
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:23,600
This is my log in the steps that you

2018
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:26,400
implement.

2019
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:29,640
Now see now see what I'm doing.

2020
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:34,280
I'm passing here my next see username.

2021
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:39,000
This would be my password.

2022
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,360
This would be my error message.

2023
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:44,400
Correct.

2024
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:49,440
And the code for this log in username
and password I need to provide here.

2025
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:52,160
So let's provide this

2026
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:54,120
for username and password.

2027
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:58,080
First I'm going to take from it.

2028
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:01,680
Loading it should I must.

2029
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:05,280
I'll get it would be this username
as the username value.

2030
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:08,520
This would be my password.

2031
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:10,680
LBJ should have passed
his username like this

2032
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:15,680
when it was username like this.

2033
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:18,800
No, this time I will pass username

2034
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:21,360
value for my examples table.

2035
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:22,760
Right.

2036
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,680
And this boss word of a new

2037
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:28,280
also from my exemptions table.

2038
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:31,800
And then the third thing I need
is the error message.

2039
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:36,520
So I need to identify
the look of this particular error

2040
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:40,640
message link.

2041
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:47,520
Next right click.

2042
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:52,200
I'm taking this particular error message,
but it says spend message.

2043
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:55,240
I can you see why I'm not taking text guys

2044
02:04:57,200 --> 02:04:59,520
That is why I'm not taking the text.

2045
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:06,680
What is the reason?

2046
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:08,480
Because it is.

2047
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:12,520
Yes, because a text change
sometimes password, an empty,

2048
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:15,760
sometimes username empty,
sometimes an invalid.

2049
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:16,320
Credentials.

2050
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:19,480
Wait, so we are just taking this look.

2051
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:22,680
At the rate it might, it will change

2052
02:05:22,680 --> 02:05:25,840
and I'm going to write it when and then my

2053
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:29,760
message is equals

2054
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:33,360
to try to find it in by.

2055
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:34,840
No, I.

2056
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:37,400
And this would be the IED cutting

2057
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:46,680
kind. No.

2058
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:49,080
Now tell me one thing.

2059
02:05:49,080 --> 02:05:52,080
If I'm going to verify this message,

2060
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:56,520
to verify the added message
in the same state, in the same state.

2061
02:05:57,040 --> 02:05:59,640
So just observe closely

2062
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:03,360
where I'm going to click,
when I'm going to click on log.

2063
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:06,800
But I have to click on my log.

2064
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,240
It went down inside my business demo.

2065
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:09,800
Leo Not

2066
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:14,880
inside.

2067
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:18,640
This is here to click on log
in within this after the username

2068
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:22,920
and password.

2069
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:23,760
Correct.

2070
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:27,880
Because see, we do not have any other step

2071
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:31,120
which we are calling after this
in single step only.

2072
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:34,200
We are providing username,
we are providing password, we are

2073
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:37,560
clicking on log into button in a minute
verifying the error message also.

2074
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:42,600
Now remember that point I told you
we will learn how to write in edu in

2075
02:06:42,640 --> 02:06:43,840
just one

2076
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:47,440
in just one in password

2077
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:49,680
stored in the Visser

2078
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,600
password or gives is the correct one

2079
02:06:58,840 --> 02:06:59,360
like this.

2080
02:06:59,360 --> 02:07:12,000
You will see.

2081
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:16,440
Oh he is not in the know
we have to provide log in button for this.

2082
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,520
You click on log in button.

2083
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,200
This is the functionality, right?

2084
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:21,240
Yes. Yes. Correct.

2085
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:21,960
I got it.

2086
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:25,080
But I'm in an undersea
if I provide it to me.

2087
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:26,120
Right.

2088
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:29,400
If I provide admin, if I click anywhere,
for example, like this.

2089
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:32,680
See, I'm clicking outside of this
and I'm being built here.

2090
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:33,000
Right

2091
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:34,680
here.

2092
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:36,960
So it's taking, digging, digging, digging.

2093
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,920
Nice.

2094
02:07:38,640 --> 02:07:41,640
If I click here, for example,
if I do anything

2095
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:46,320
you will deleted
and if I click on here, then it's changed.

2096
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:51,040
But if my username
and then if I invalid password,

2097
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:54,240
let's see something else once.

2098
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:56,920
Now this time it's speaking,
you'll get by.

2099
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,160
So next time would be stating credentials.

2100
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:00,080
Fine.

2101
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:02,120
So simple digging clicking on logging
button.

2102
02:08:02,520 --> 02:08:03,240
Right.

2103
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:06,120
And then it should work.

2104
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:09,080
Now guys, see here

2105
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:11,400
another important point,

2106
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:13,480
another important point.

2107
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:16,160
We are going to find the message

2108
02:08:16,160 --> 02:08:19,240
let me completely
and coming to that point, I said

2109
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:24,880
another important point I'm explaining
is I'm building unless I finish.

2110
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:26,880
Please don't raise any question with me.

2111
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,360
Please let me complete.

2112
02:08:28,360 --> 02:08:30,360
And then if you think
I missed something, then

2113
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:33,200
another important point is

2114
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:36,000
so far we didn't verify anything.

2115
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:40,200
We didn't provide any verification
and validation check point,

2116
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,120
right?

2117
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:44,400
We didn't violate what we are writing.

2118
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:45,360
It is verified.

2119
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:48,720
It is verified. It is verified. Why?

2120
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:52,600
Because the assertions be used
in distended electrical,

2121
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:55,600
your testimony assertions.

2122
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:59,240
Remember the assertions
we used those assertions

2123
02:08:59,320 --> 02:09:02,040
relating to your best energy
that we used earlier.

2124
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:07,200
So the assertions
which we are going to use,

2125
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:11,320
these solutions are related
to your G-Unit assertions,

2126
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:15,760
which so we are going to use case

2127
02:09:18,680 --> 02:09:20,680
your following.

2128
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:22,720
So force be posting.

2129
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:26,040
See, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to read a string

2130
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:28,440
added

2131
02:09:29,480 --> 02:09:32,400
or let me read it an x,

2132
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:36,320
then I should read it expecting
it should be

2133
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:38,360
address

2134
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:40,080
message.

2135
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:45,520
Don't get text.

2136
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:49,080
Whatever the biggest
I am building on this particular locator.

2137
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:50,040
Right.

2138
02:09:50,040 --> 02:09:52,800
I will store it in this adequate.

2139
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:55,040
I will store it in
this part. Is this correct?

2140
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,120
Is this correct?

2141
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:01,440
Why? Why I'm not picking
is displayed method

2142
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:04,080
because if the locator is displayed

2143
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:07,720
it's not going to verify my error
message messages changing everything.

2144
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:13,800
So even if I used is displayed, it's not
going to add any value value to my work.

2145
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:20,320
Right, guys, that is getting my point.

2146
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,640
Really good.

2147
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,440
So now, now here
we have to use a solution.

2148
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:28,240
So see, I'm going to write here, assert

2149
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:31,480
when I write assert.

2150
02:10:31,480 --> 02:10:35,080
Can you see it does give me assert from
all are not unique

2151
02:10:36,240 --> 02:10:39,240
can you see are Jordan
G United is giving me the assert now

2152
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:42,800
you need that list of all errors
in and use correct

2153
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:49,440
so guys from this time we are going to
use the assertions which are coming from

2154
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:55,920
g unique and not from best in g grade.

2155
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:59,560
Since we are working on Google
with the unique part.

2156
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:02,160
So please provide a search dot

2157
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:06,960
all those
all those assertions that we had earlier.

2158
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:10,360
We are using assert assert

2159
02:11:10,360 --> 02:11:11,760
to string fine.

2160
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:14,520
We can take any one, anyone, any strings.

2161
02:11:15,120 --> 02:11:17,200
Now see how this assertion work this time.

2162
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:18,480
I'm telling you

2163
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:27,120
assert equals which I'm going to take

2164
02:11:27,120 --> 02:11:30,360
to assert because

2165
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:35,080
is string message playing
with string mostly in string?

2166
02:11:36,160 --> 02:11:46,200
No, no, no.

2167
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:47,400
Let's take anything.

2168
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:49,320
Let's take anything. Assert equals.

2169
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:53,120
So first, first I have to provide message

2170
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:56,080
in case. In case.

2171
02:11:56,080 --> 02:12:00,680
If strings don't match,
then it will provide values.

2172
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:04,920
It will give me the assertion error,
which with the message

2173
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:08,120
so values do not match comma.

2174
02:12:08,600 --> 02:12:12,600
Then I have to provide the expected
one which is coming from my.

2175
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:16,560
This one is coming from where

2176
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:19,840
we provided the actual one.

2177
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:23,400
This error is coming from my C

2178
02:12:25,240 --> 02:12:28,320
feature by this
and it is coming from my feature file

2179
02:12:28,680 --> 02:12:32,400
and here I'm going to provide the actual
one which is coming from my building

2180
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:34,080
base.

2181
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:37,760
Can you see in one simple assertion line

2182
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:42,000
I provided straight, the value is coming
from one particular part.

2183
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,360
It is going in one part
and it is comparing these two is together.

2184
02:12:45,640 --> 02:12:49,080
So now in case
if my assertion means it gives me

2185
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:53,360
these added values do not match,
otherwise it will compare the value.

2186
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:56,680
And if it is asked
then it will not give me any and therefore

2187
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:59,760
it will not give me
any extremely positive message that you

2188
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:02,480
understood

2189
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:05,280
this part.

2190
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:19,080
Understood or not.

2191
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:19,600
So now,

2192
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:22,880
thinking by rotational loop coming out, we

2193
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:25,640
very simple rate.

2194
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:28,320
This is very similar not

2195
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:41,400
shall we execute this one now

2196
02:13:42,160 --> 02:13:43,240
which is going to test

2197
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:46,720
against for different parts

2198
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:01,640
initial log in please.

2199
02:14:01,640 --> 02:14:44,280
Sure that this is the log in.

2200
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:47,280
But we must do this.

2201
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:52,000
We must turn it and we will need line 49.

2202
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:52,720
Sure will.

2203
02:14:52,720 --> 02:14:53,680
Pleased

2204
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:57,640
with.

2205
02:14:57,640 --> 02:15:00,480
So these are just the arguments
that we handle now.

2206
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:01,320
You'll see

2207
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:05,240
these are just your keys
that you're passing

2208
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:11,320
from your features right.

2209
02:15:11,320 --> 02:15:16,480
Uh, when I said this and that,
if I write this error, actually,

2210
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:20,040
then it will ignore all the errors
when I said this,

2211
02:15:20,040 --> 02:15:23,040
this is just an assertion
that we are providing data.

2212
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:25,520
So providing the assumptions doesn't

2213
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:28,560
mean we ignore it,
will compare all the errors,

2214
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:33,280
all the error messages,
and whenever it is going to give you

2215
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:37,440
the added rate, wherever it doesn't match,
it will give you this message and.

2216
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:39,960
Whenever it matches,
it will simply pass your assertion.

2217
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:42,120
So it is just a simple assertion.

2218
02:15:42,120 --> 02:15:44,600
We are not writing anything to ignore
something

2219
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:52,960
understood.

2220
02:15:52,960 --> 02:16:06,480
Shall
we proceed further and execute this call?

2221
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:08,760
Nice, Ahmed. Excellent.

2222
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:12,120
Excellent.

2223
02:16:12,120 --> 02:16:14,320
So that's what I was expecting.

2224
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:17,880
Nice.

2225
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:20,560
Let me make it false. And now let me, me

2226
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:29,400
see. It

2227
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:32,880
is going to execute four times
four scenarios.

2228
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:34,120
First,

2229
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:38,880
second,

2230
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:47,520
third, fourth.

2231
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:49,920
All four passed.

2232
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,200
Can you see

2233
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,200
that is going to suit

2234
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:08,400
everything is biased.

2235
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:11,320
That's why there is no message
from the associate part.

2236
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:14,000
Every single thing is just fine.

2237
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:17,600
Let's reload this project from there. Disk

2238
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:20,160
open.

2239
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:32,600
This could compare each team report
this time.

2240
02:17:32,600 --> 02:17:35,400
Can you see
these are the scenarios Be executed.

2241
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:37,280
Write

2242
02:17:38,240 --> 02:17:39,560
any names of anything.

2243
02:17:39,560 --> 02:17:41,600
Actually should Thank you. Right.

2244
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:44,760
Because this was the part
I was supposed to trade.

2245
02:17:44,840 --> 02:17:47,120
Now we are in the same flow, right?

2246
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:48,520
We are in the same flow.

2247
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:52,040
So it's called effect trade. Sorry.

2248
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:59,560
One more time to log in two steps point.

2249
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:01,760
One more time to log in is on.

2250
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:02,560
Right.

2251
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:07,360
Which is my log in the steps that you go.

2252
02:18:07,360 --> 02:18:12,640
This is the log in two steps.

2253
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:13,760
There's just a you

2254
02:18:15,240 --> 02:18:16,440
lined up this task

2255
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:20,480
earlier and I was supposed to
this as opposed to perform this later.

2256
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:24,680
But now I will complete all this in that
he was related to example, stable enough

2257
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:27,080
and then only which one to the next task.

2258
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:30,960
Thanks for raising remembering me

2259
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:46,800
when we have a break. Yes.

2260
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:51,680
After completing this particular task,
which I'm going to take next,

2261
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:54,000
you guys can take a break
for five or 10 minutes.

2262
02:18:54,680 --> 02:18:55,560
I'll take

2263
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:09,680
what is here.

2264
02:19:09,680 --> 02:19:12,080
So you are writing a third at equals.

2265
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:15,080
Please remove
this edit just write assert equals

2266
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:20,280
an employee feature.

2267
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:25,200
Next an employee feature show that you go.

2268
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:28,960
This is the employee feature.

2269
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:30,120
Why do you need an employee?

2270
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:32,560
Each of you are dealing right
now with log in feature you

2271
02:19:34,480 --> 02:19:35,240
non-negotiable.

2272
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:36,120
It is not.

2273
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:38,120
It is not my writing, right?

2274
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:41,080
These are not my my head here.

2275
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,240
No, the other one. Sorry.

2276
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:42,600
All right.

2277
02:19:42,600 --> 02:19:54,000
It's a log in feature.

2278
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,400
Every one of you guys, every one of you.

2279
02:19:57,400 --> 02:20:21,800
Do you want my brothers and sisters
in particular, logging steps, please.

2280
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:24,000
No issues, Jimmie. No issues. Vital.

2281
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:24,960
So sorry.

2282
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:26,280
You're asking.

2283
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:28,080
It's good because you are trying.

2284
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:39,480
This is the log instance instance.

2285
02:20:39,480 --> 02:20:42,000
I hope you guys are understanding
what I'm teaching grade

2286
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:45,840
and it's not too complicated for you

2287
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:52,200
going to manually correct

2288
02:20:52,480 --> 02:21:11,640
names.

2289
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:15,560
I mean, we went over that,
but what if user study done

2290
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:18,000
instead of the log in button

2291
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,760
on in line number

2292
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:23,960
53 of the people, how do you account

2293
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
for the situation

2294
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:32,240
line number four digit for default or read

2295
02:21:33,240 --> 02:21:35,640
more diffuse it hits the written

2296
02:21:35,640 --> 02:21:38,160
written means
they will not navigate dot backward

2297
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:40,000
there's what can we

2298
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:45,440
never not navigate navigated back

2299
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:57,920
just to return in general

2300
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:00,480
no written means sir

2301
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:04,120
I mean in terms of command which command
in regards to ever not bigger

2302
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:07,160
bank or keys don't in there

2303
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:11,000
or just keys back to the bar
for entering the password.

2304
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:14,160
Click on user name
which which one you mean

2305
02:22:16,200 --> 02:22:17,720
on keyword.

2306
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:20,280
On keyword return means physical need.

2307
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:21,200
Right.

2308
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,280
So it simply removes the thing, Right.

2309
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:35,400
Which you already have in the field.

2310
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:38,160
Yeah. I got the question.
I got the difference on keyboard.

2311
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:41,560
If we place in a big space
that is that again key.

2312
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:43,040
So big removes the keyword.

2313
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:45,240
Right. Whatever
he and it's simple but it's not.

2314
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:49,080
It has nothing to do with this
alphabetic negation builder

2315
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:54,600
name to their data one more time
assert equals did we use this is J unique.

2316
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:55,920
This is unique.

2317
02:22:57,320 --> 02:22:58,360
Sebastian.

2318
02:22:58,360 --> 02:23:00,600
This is the G unit all urgent or generic

2319
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:04,160
you'll see here import or do not do.

2320
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:05,600
Can you see?

2321
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:08,120
So we use this the word assert

2322
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:16,440
like Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2323
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:17,880
Give me 20 minutes.

2324
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:21,120
And then after that I will give you the
is give me something.

2325
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:22,760
I just want to show you something.

2326
02:23:22,760 --> 02:23:23,760
That's what

2327
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:33,040
is this

2328
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:41,240
line based?

2329
02:23:41,240 --> 02:23:43,120
It is assert equals.

2330
02:23:43,120 --> 02:23:44,400
It is assert equals.

2331
02:23:44,400 --> 02:23:47,440
So is why we use assert equals
when we have to

2332
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:50,280
compare groups strings together,
do values together.

2333
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:51,400
Right.

2334
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:54,760
If we are going to compare
two venues together, we call it assert

2335
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:58,280
equals equalization means
comparing two things to get at rate.

2336
02:23:58,520 --> 02:24:01,200
But when we talk about a safeguard
assert true,

2337
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:04,360
it simply means
we are taking the Boolean condition.

2338
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:08,280
That condition example is in
this particular element is displayed.

2339
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:09,160
Right?

2340
02:24:09,160 --> 02:24:13,400
So if I see this element is displayed
is displayed.

2341
02:24:13,400 --> 02:24:14,520
So what does it mean?

2342
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:20,000
It simply means if it is available, it
returns true, otherwise it returns false.

2343
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:22,760
And a student

2344
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:36,320
everyone understood this.

2345
02:24:36,320 --> 02:24:42,600
What kind of assertions we used.

2346
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:43,360
Right.

2347
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:46,160
So now tell me what you guys need a break

2348
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:57,240
or should we continue?

2349
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:59,600
We should continue.
All right. So let's continue.

2350
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:00,800
Right, for one more topic.

2351
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:02,840
And then after we give you the break.
Okay,

2352
02:25:04,480 --> 02:25:07,360
I made some type of

2353
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:13,120
noser credentials.

2354
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:17,160
So please, babe, Capital
II of invalid credentials

2355
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:19,080
at least see what I'm typing here.

2356
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:22,720
See, it is I would give an invalid
would give me the like.

2357
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:23,880
Can you see

2358
02:25:24,360 --> 02:25:28,000
I wanted this to run rerun it already.

2359
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:31,240
Maria, we're running

2360
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:34,720
it useful.

2361
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:35,160
All right.

2362
02:25:35,160 --> 02:25:37,920
I will come into the repository, ma'am,
and then you'll be happy.

2363
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:42,240
Okay.

2364
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:48,160
Yellow Valuable of the property index.

2365
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:53,880
All right.

2366
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:55,880
No, no.

2367
02:25:55,880 --> 02:25:57,240
Raise the

2368
02:25:57,640 --> 02:26:00,360
Then we use examples table here.

2369
02:26:00,360 --> 02:26:02,840
We added, we added rate.

2370
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:05,640
We added here all the keys in one state.

2371
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:08,760
We added all the keys in one nested.

2372
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:09,320
Can you see it?

2373
02:26:09,320 --> 02:26:10,040
Everyone

2374
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:18,440
break.

2375
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:20,600
When we added this scenario.

2376
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:23,680
Here you see we added all the keys

2377
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:32,960
in one state only.

2378
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:36,120
But this should not be the case
wouldn't be used

2379
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:40,360
when we are dealing with indirect
examples, they will instantly apply

2380
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:42,800
so we can add these points.

2381
02:26:42,800 --> 02:26:45,360
We can add these points in multiple lines.

2382
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:47,200
How big we should.

2383
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:50,920
It says a domain user
is successfully logged in. Correct.

2384
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:54,480
So instead of writing
admin user, this time

2385
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:58,120
I'm going to write it.

2386
02:26:58,520 --> 02:27:00,520
This time I'm going to write like this

2387
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:06,560
admin user is successfully logged in
and this line many user readers

2388
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:10,760
username and password right
when user interface username and password.

2389
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:16,280
Cool. It's

2390
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:19,440
great. Let me provide here

2391
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:21,960
like this.

2392
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:23,000
And now.

2393
02:27:23,160 --> 02:27:26,960
Now here I'm going to write for scenario
outline.

2394
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,760
I'm writing here.

2395
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:32,920
Examples Table and examples

2396
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:35,600
given I'm going to provide write the name.

2397
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:39,240
So let me copy and paste to your

2398
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:42,120
username password. Right.

2399
02:27:42,120 --> 02:27:47,320
So that we provided the connectivity
for this document each and every 1 to 3.

2400
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:50,880
And then here
I will going to provide this data.

2401
02:27:50,880 --> 02:27:54,240
Me What would be the name of the element
simply

2402
02:27:56,720 --> 02:27:59,880
understood?

2403
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:05,400
What does it mean when I'm dealing
with scenario outline and example stable?

2404
02:28:05,600 --> 02:28:09,840
I can boss whatever the keys
I'm mentioning in, the example stable.

2405
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:13,800
I can pass
all those ds in multiple steps as well.

2406
02:28:14,480 --> 02:28:17,120
So even if I have 15 or 20 years

2407
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:19,720
which I need to pass,
introducing this depth

2408
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:24,640
with one example table
we can use why I'm explaining this point

2409
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:27,840
because I got one
is Stephen Hawkins in the last batch

2410
02:28:28,560 --> 02:28:33,160
last to last batch actually
write in batch nine and he asked, Hey,

2411
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:37,840
you are passing multiple keys in one
particular step, for one example, step one

2412
02:28:38,120 --> 02:28:42,600
Do I need to write multiple examples
the boss data in multiple instances?

2413
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:44,880
And then I got

2414
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:48,520
this idea that how students can think
out of the blue, right?

2415
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:51,080
That's why I'm explaining this point here.

2416
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:53,520
This is the point I wanted to expand.

2417
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:56,200
So now see here in the lines

2418
02:28:56,560 --> 02:28:59,720
in lines I am passing different keys.

2419
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:00,440
Right?

2420
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:04,800
But the same examples table
I'm using to perform this particular part

2421
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:07,800
understood.

2422
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:10,280
Industrial days

2423
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:21,040
or red days.

2424
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:25,960
So now, now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to verify, I'm going to redefine.

2425
02:29:26,520 --> 02:29:28,680
It means a successfully logging or not.

2426
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:33,440
I will put one more solution in in
one line and passing username and password

2427
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:38,480
so it's okay to need the start
instead of when and then yes, yes,

2428
02:29:38,480 --> 02:29:41,960
it is completely fine because
as long as you are compatible, it is good.

2429
02:29:42,360 --> 02:29:43,680
It is completely acceptable.

2430
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:45,760
No that point.

2431
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:50,000
So now now here
I'm going to use this as bridge to deck

2432
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,040
because this is the date
I know which I'm having in unique.

2433
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:57,200
Let me take it here from this dry
and make it

2434
02:29:57,240 --> 02:29:59,920
look why I need to create two steps.

2435
02:30:00,400 --> 02:30:02,560
Right case.
We need to create two steps on log.

2436
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:06,720
Let's run it.

2437
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:08,240
Let's run it

2438
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:15,360
now. See how many steps I got, guys?

2439
02:30:15,360 --> 02:30:17,840
How many steps I got you

2440
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:20,880
two steps.

2441
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:21,720
Fine.

2442
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:25,200
Now, see, we have to divide on keys.

2443
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:27,160
Going to log into steps.

2444
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:30,520
This time we have to divide entities out
first.

2445
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:35,160
First, we will provide here

2446
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:40,640
username value and here are

2447
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:43,600
password value.

2448
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:46,080
In here we are going to provide are

2449
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:51,320
and mean well understood

2450
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:56,760
and this provides

2451
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:07,920
similarly similarly similarly here.

2452
02:31:07,920 --> 02:31:09,720
I'm not going to provide anything right?

2453
02:31:09,720 --> 02:31:12,840
I will simply write one thing
the locator of that particular one.

2454
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:13,560
Right?

2455
02:31:13,560 --> 02:31:16,000
You can provide this associating was part
the thing.

2456
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:18,120
If we keep simple.

2457
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:20,360
Oh, I'm going to take the locator

2458
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:24,200
of this particular one call it mean

2459
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:28,080
point three.

2460
02:31:28,520 --> 02:31:31,960
If we take this one
and I'm going to take this particular

2461
02:31:31,960 --> 02:31:35,040
look at the point.

2462
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,440
So this should be the look,
baby will come.

2463
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:41,720
So I'm going to take this
look at I will trade with the neighboring

2464
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:47,040
element, push forward message

2465
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:50,640
the sequence to try to find the element.

2466
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:53,080
My ID

2467
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:57,080
and I put this and I'm writing
one assertion called assert

2468
02:31:57,800 --> 02:32:01,320
not assert

2469
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:03,400
assert true

2470
02:32:03,400 --> 02:32:07,040
what to bash
good message don't is displaying

2471
02:32:08,280 --> 02:32:09,400
bad case.

2472
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:12,000
You can use this particular one
if you want to use

2473
02:32:12,280 --> 02:32:16,000
If You don't want to use you don't use
great when you provide this outlet.

2474
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,680
But everyone knows now, right?

2475
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:22,800
Everyone knows how to write this assert
don't assert equals.

2476
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:26,760
I'm using the different one
so that we know how to make different kind

2477
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:27,320
of assertion.

2478
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:30,080
So this time I'm using a third thought.

2479
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:30,920
So too.

2480
02:32:30,920 --> 02:32:38,760
Is this okay to everyone everyone?

2481
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:40,480
Is this okay to everyone or not?

2482
02:32:40,480 --> 02:32:42,800
Quick guys, come on by.

2483
02:32:42,840 --> 02:32:44,040
You guys are getting lethargic.

2484
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:46,080
It is just a matter of hold
five more minutes

2485
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:49,320
and then you guys will be on break.

2486
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:50,960
Really enjoy this for 5 minutes.

2487
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:56,360
Guys, please.

2488
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:59,440
Everyone ready?

2489
02:32:59,440 --> 02:32:59,960
Let's go.

2490
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:02,520
Here, log in, feature check and a slogan.

2491
02:33:04,080 --> 02:33:04,920
Nice.

2492
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:06,800
Going to smoke.

2493
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,720
Make your right and from draw go false.

2494
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:11,840
After making it false.

2495
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:13,600
Let's run this time.

2496
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:32,400
Let's run this time.

2497
02:33:32,400 --> 02:33:33,280
Well,

2498
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:36,560
no such element exception for

2499
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:40,440
button log in.

2500
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:45,320
Why? Let me check.

2501
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:46,760
Let me check

2502
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:48,960
log in button.

2503
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:50,840
We worked already, right?

2504
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:53,880
We vote already
for logging with the state.

2505
02:33:53,880 --> 02:33:57,520
We vote already for logging in now
after I get written,

2506
02:33:59,280 --> 02:33:59,800
it worked.

2507
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:02,880
Here, let me go into the feature.

2508
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:05,320
All there is. There's a problem there.

2509
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:07,600
A problem
We calling this log important here

2510
02:34:07,880 --> 02:34:10,920
and we are calling this logging button
one more time in our steps.

2511
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:13,000
Now see what is the issue.

2512
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,960
See when I go in my steps right here.

2513
02:34:15,960 --> 02:34:18,240
Also, I'm calling logging with the

2514
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:19,040
race. Can you see

2515
02:34:20,440 --> 02:34:23,320
here also I'm calling this logging button
in username password.

2516
02:34:23,720 --> 02:34:26,200
And here also I'm
calling this logging button.

2517
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:28,720
You see here also,
I'm calling this logging button.

2518
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:30,480
There's the problem.

2519
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:32,240
That is the problem.

2520
02:34:32,240 --> 02:34:36,240
So this case in this case,
what I have to do basically

2521
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:39,720
is I have to simply remove this code
from here.

2522
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:43,120
I have to simply remove this code.

2523
02:34:43,120 --> 02:34:46,440
It now,
if you see, my code will definitely work.

2524
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:51,480
So let me go here
and let me execute my actual scenario.

2525
02:34:51,640 --> 02:34:55,160
Let me this one right

2526
02:34:58,920 --> 02:35:09,720
now, one of good.

2527
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:13,600
No, it's working fine.

2528
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:14,680
Is it working fine now?

2529
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:17,840
Promise you'll see

2530
02:35:31,160 --> 02:35:31,880
so far.

2531
02:35:31,880 --> 02:35:34,200
But credit goes to you

2532
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:37,960
that you raise this point
so that we ended up with this.

2533
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:40,800
All the scenarios with all these scenarios

2534
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:43,240
and you see

2535
02:35:43,880 --> 02:35:45,000
all of the scenarios.

2536
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:45,960
Brady's

2537
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:49,080
ISIS username Normani log in.

2538
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:52,960
Wait minute log in and every single thing

2539
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:57,120
right, right.

2540
02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:02,480
Based, can you please
show log in two steps for us?

2541
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:03,400
Sure.

2542
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:04,240
There you go.

2543
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:11,480
This is the log in two steps.

2544
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:13,680
Would you briefly repeat
what was the last error?

2545
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:17,920
Certain is what happened
was in the in this depo.

2546
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:21,560
And so here in this particular method,
I was in the username,

2547
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:24,760
I was entering
password and I was clicking on log

2548
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:27,840
in, would read all the three things
we were doing

2549
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:30,960
because we were copying the code
from this particular area.

2550
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,280
That's what we were doing.

2551
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:37,360
And again, in my log in feature
I was calling the clicks on log in.

2552
02:36:37,560 --> 02:36:38,680
And so what happened

2553
02:36:38,680 --> 02:36:42,840
after clicking on log, it wouldn't
actually, which was happened in this step.

2554
02:36:43,160 --> 02:36:43,680
Right.

2555
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:49,360
My console was on before beach, but then
I provided this user clicks on log in.

2556
02:36:49,720 --> 02:36:50,320
Right?

2557
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:53,040
So when I provided
this particular information,

2558
02:36:53,400 --> 02:36:57,880
it was unable to find
it did find this mark understood

2559
02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:01,440
and destroyed base.

2560
02:37:01,440 --> 02:37:02,840
Then we are listing different options.

2561
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:04,280
Do we need a different project folder?

2562
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:06,080
Or we can use some other classes?

2563
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:09,280
No site for different websites
radio to create a separate project.

2564
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:11,960
That's way
one application, one project there.

2565
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:13,320
So we followed the standards.

2566
02:37:13,320 --> 02:37:16,400
You can not be having
multiple applications, one

2567
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:19,880
because every website
is having a different functionality

2568
02:37:20,040 --> 02:37:22,000
and when we say different functionality,

2569
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,960
it simply means different code,
different locators and everything.

2570
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:27,960
So we can make a new package. No. One. No.

2571
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:32,160
Then you have to config,
like I said, for framework, right?

2572
02:37:32,160 --> 02:37:34,160
Everything should be unique.

2573
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:36,280
Delete completely depending one project.

2574
02:37:36,280 --> 02:37:38,160
So if I'm making one project

2575
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:41,920
I observe the application was the nature
of the application and then only

2576
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:45,800
I implement the logic in my framework
according to that particular application.

2577
02:37:45,800 --> 02:37:47,160
That's how things work.

2578
02:37:47,160 --> 02:37:51,000
If you do one framework
which is actually implemented based on one

2579
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:54,000
application, you put it in the spec
and one it's not going to work.

2580
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:55,680
Understood.

2581
02:37:55,680 --> 02:38:00,520
Everyone,
can you upgrade the code on GitHub?

2582
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:02,040
Yeah, I'm going to do it.

2583
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:03,960
Let me just to complete the explanation
then.

2584
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:05,520
Only I can do it right.

2585
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:09,960
So let me edit, let me edit me commit
this code in the repository

2586
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:13,440
before we go on break it all this point

2587
02:38:13,440 --> 02:38:17,360
so that it would be easy for you,
as always, to understand this part.

2588
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:19,520
Let me do it and let me push the code.

2589
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:23,800
Also the repository.

2590
02:38:23,800 --> 02:38:26,960
So now the code is available
in the repository, right?

2591
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,560
You guys are living all this code. Okay,

2592
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:32,560
You guys are reading all this, everything.

2593
02:38:32,560 --> 02:38:42,760
You guys have not understood everyone.

2594
02:38:42,760 --> 02:38:45,560
Everyone understood.

2595
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:46,320
Great.

2596
02:38:47,880 --> 02:38:50,240
Now, after this, we are going to learn

2597
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:54,400
two very important topics.

2598
02:38:54,400 --> 02:38:58,200
So I said already I've committed
to my code in the repository.

2599
02:38:58,200 --> 02:38:58,480
Great.

2600
02:38:58,480 --> 02:39:03,720
I cannot open my good these understand
multiple times on every single.

2601
02:39:03,720 --> 02:39:04,720
Please

2602
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:08,240
use the reference point from repository

2603
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:11,120
one. Right.

2604
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:12,600
Because those instead of waiting

2605
02:39:12,600 --> 02:39:16,280
I see better messages also in my slide
the data that having problem.

2606
02:39:16,280 --> 02:39:19,760
If I open one thing again and again

2607
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:24,360
find this so far.

2608
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:25,160
Any questions?

2609
02:39:25,160 --> 02:39:30,440
Anyone?

2610
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:33,280
Is there anyone who has any questions
or Firebase

2611
02:39:38,080 --> 02:39:39,560
everyone good.

2612
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:43,200
Understood.

2613
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:45,440
Then let's take a break.

2614
02:39:46,120 --> 02:39:47,640
Which we are going to start

2615
02:39:47,640 --> 02:39:51,880
is blasting the data from one another.

2616
02:39:51,880 --> 02:39:54,080
We all read from one another.

2617
02:39:55,800 --> 02:39:57,920
So far what we see

2618
02:39:59,960 --> 02:40:02,400
all the combinations

2619
02:40:03,880 --> 02:40:08,280
hard order data,

2620
02:40:08,280 --> 02:40:12,320
then replace it with some external file
such as config properties by

2621
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:14,000
right

2622
02:40:20,640 --> 02:40:24,000
associated bust.

2623
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,160
But I

2624
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:30,040
hardcoded data then we pass from file
that is considered proper despite

2625
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:35,320
after they deposit their data
from our examples.

2626
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:37,360
Grade from example stable grade.

2627
02:40:38,360 --> 02:40:43,320
When I'm a transition,

2628
02:40:43,320 --> 02:40:45,600
we have seen both the scenarios
in one line

2629
02:40:47,960 --> 02:40:49,560
they mean multiple lines passing.

2630
02:40:49,560 --> 02:40:54,080
They keep correct.

2631
02:40:54,080 --> 02:40:57,280
Is this correct? But

2632
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:02,560
now we are going to talk about
the fourth one.

2633
02:41:03,080 --> 02:41:05,600
The fourth one, and the fourth one is

2634
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:08,400
Sebastian

2635
02:41:10,200 --> 02:41:11,480
the Go.

2636
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:14,200
We are going to talk about

2637
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:25,240
what we are going to talk about now.

2638
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:28,560
You were in grade four, but

2639
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:33,920
yes, I still remember.

2640
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:39,040
So now we are going to talk about data
table one right?

2641
02:41:39,040 --> 02:41:42,480
Why? I explained intentionally
this particular point.

2642
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:43,320
Which point?

2643
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:45,880
This one,

2644
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:49,240
when you see we can pass

2645
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:51,680
table that data from examples.

2646
02:41:51,680 --> 02:41:53,880
Table in multiple lines.

2647
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:55,880
Right. In multiple lines.

2648
02:41:55,880 --> 02:41:59,440
So this example tables

2649
02:41:59,920 --> 02:42:02,840
is applicable to my entire scenario.

2650
02:42:02,920 --> 02:42:05,480
Understood.

2651
02:42:05,480 --> 02:42:09,480
I misspoke.

2652
02:42:09,480 --> 02:42:12,840
It is applicable to my entire scenario.

2653
02:42:13,160 --> 02:42:17,960
However, when we talk about data table,
it is applicable to mine

2654
02:42:17,960 --> 02:42:22,920
just one particular step.

2655
02:42:22,920 --> 02:42:26,360
Is this understood now?

2656
02:42:26,360 --> 02:42:27,440
Is this understood now?

2657
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:32,200
What I just said
is applicable to my one particular step.

2658
02:42:33,080 --> 02:42:33,960
I'll read

2659
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:43,920
Fine.

2660
02:42:44,320 --> 02:42:48,600
So now see how things works,
what the scenarios, what the scenarios.

2661
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:50,840
We will see
one by one for their data table.

2662
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:51,560
Right.

2663
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:54,600
Let's dig
the really forced scenario for detected.

2664
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:58,680
But again,
the intention is to add multiple employees

2665
02:42:58,680 --> 02:43:00,960
three or data doing this to getting

2666
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:04,240
so data driven testing
using one hardcoded data,

2667
02:43:04,760 --> 02:43:10,200
then considered properties
by then some data from passing

2668
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:14,880
the parameters of something,
for example, stable now using data

2669
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:17,120
stored

2670
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:19,560
or understood.

2671
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:21,760
Now using data table just to move

2672
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:32,760
already.

2673
02:43:32,760 --> 02:43:33,240
Nice.

2674
02:43:34,280 --> 02:43:36,520
So now we are going to use

2675
02:43:36,520 --> 02:43:39,600
this particular portion called detectible.

2676
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:43,440
From our feature,
we now see how detectable what

2677
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,680
what happening is here.

2678
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:52,360
I placed my link right.

2679
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:57,480
So when I read something right here
on Sticky, I'm reading the messages.

2680
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:00,400
So when reading those messages,
I'm on sync.

2681
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:02,840
And now when I'm writing the code,
I'm looking here.

2682
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:05,920
The camera is available
here, Slack is available here.

2683
02:44:06,200 --> 02:44:07,520
That's way.

2684
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:12,080
If you talk about another camera,
then that camera is a database, right?

2685
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:14,920
So I'm not looking there.
I'm looking here and.

2686
02:44:14,920 --> 02:44:17,760
All right.

2687
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:20,320
No, no, that's fine. There's one.

2688
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:22,440
The setup is very

2689
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:23,160
weird.

2690
02:44:23,160 --> 02:44:24,400
I would say

2691
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:28,080
diversified, right?

2692
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:29,760
One thing available in this place.

2693
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:31,440
Then my light is this place.

2694
02:44:31,440 --> 02:44:33,000
And then my system here,

2695
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:36,120
my, like, here, and then the camera there
and then like this.

2696
02:44:36,240 --> 02:44:38,120
So very distributed system

2697
02:44:41,840 --> 02:44:42,680
findings.

2698
02:44:42,680 --> 02:44:46,520
So this time, this time
I'm going to add a scenario, see?

2699
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,360
So now

2700
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:51,680
what I'm going to is

2701
02:44:52,320 --> 02:44:54,720
in this point, in this point

2702
02:44:55,080 --> 02:44:57,400
we have the simulate nice

2703
02:45:01,320 --> 02:45:03,160
in this point, we have the same data.

2704
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:03,840
Right.

2705
02:45:04,080 --> 02:45:05,440
Let's copy this.

2706
02:45:05,440 --> 02:45:08,480
It's copy this for our scenario.

2707
02:45:08,480 --> 02:45:10,560
Right. And pasted here.

2708
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:14,240
We are not going to use our blame
only scenario we are going to use.

2709
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:15,400
All right.

2710
02:45:15,640 --> 02:45:19,200
And here I'm writing code data table.

2711
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:22,960
Now just see the beauty
of how to compare works.

2712
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,280
I'm going to write here.

2713
02:45:26,280 --> 02:45:28,600
I'm going to write right

2714
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:30,600
in all these things I'm going to write.

2715
02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:33,520
And then when

2716
02:45:35,840 --> 02:45:39,120
the head

2717
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:46,480
employs and

2718
02:45:46,480 --> 02:45:48,280
redefine

2719
02:45:49,520 --> 02:45:52,320
the editor.

2720
02:45:53,040 --> 02:45:56,640
Now tell me, guys here,
see in this scenario, also

2721
02:45:57,280 --> 02:45:59,720
build employment complex unemployment in

2722
02:46:00,840 --> 02:46:04,400
this scenario also build an employment
in this scenario.

2723
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:07,560
Also build an employment
and everything is the same

2724
02:46:07,560 --> 02:46:08,400
or not

2725
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:15,600
everything is going to make sense. Yes.

2726
02:46:15,600 --> 02:46:16,520
Jimmy Cutting does

2727
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:20,200
it make sense to keep writing those things
again and again repeating those things?

2728
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:23,160
No, we can do it in

2729
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:28,440
one particular tag called Big Round
and then we keep this part

2730
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:32,120
now simply removing from this system,

2731
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:37,920
remove it from this particular scenario,

2732
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:40,680
remove it from this scenario

2733
02:46:41,160 --> 02:46:43,280
and then remove it from here.

2734
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:46,320
So now in this one step, I'm

2735
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:49,520
going to add user
and they will verify they use it as well.

2736
02:46:50,520 --> 02:46:51,280
Okay.

2737
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:55,600
Okay.

2738
02:46:55,600 --> 02:47:01,560
Alright guys.

2739
02:47:01,560 --> 02:47:04,920
Now let's see what I'm going to do.

2740
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:09,040
I'm going to write here it is, first name,

2741
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:11,320
then the

2742
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:14,560
middle name, then

2743
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:18,880
lastly, edit

2744
02:47:21,600 --> 02:47:24,600
Let me use the same data.

2745
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:27,480
Let me use the same data

2746
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:29,720
guys.

2747
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:31,000
Now see what is the difference

2748
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:34,200
in between normal examples table
and this particular table?

2749
02:47:34,960 --> 02:47:35,760
What is the difference?

2750
02:47:35,760 --> 02:47:51,040
You see?

2751
02:47:51,040 --> 02:47:53,600
Oh, Glenn, look, fine.

2752
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:55,160
I'm talking about the difference.

2753
02:47:55,160 --> 02:47:57,200
No, see that your client
that is also white.

2754
02:47:57,200 --> 02:48:00,920
It is a normal you will get get

2755
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:09,480
not identical bit.

2756
02:48:10,240 --> 02:48:11,360
It's kind of the same.

2757
02:48:11,360 --> 02:48:15,600
First Evelyn's case,
we are not using example statement because

2758
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:21,240
like anything,
we are not posting these keys here.

2759
02:48:21,240 --> 02:48:23,920
And based on these case,
we're passing values here.

2760
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:26,760
We are not crossing any keys here.

2761
02:48:26,760 --> 02:48:27,400
Right.

2762
02:48:28,240 --> 02:48:29,320
And you see,

2763
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:33,560
it means there is no linking of my step

2764
02:48:33,560 --> 02:48:35,600
to my data,

2765
02:48:36,680 --> 02:48:41,000
even though my data table is applicable
only for one estate.

2766
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:45,680
And that step I have already added here
right step I already did here,

2767
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,840
but still I'm not calling any of the bet.

2768
02:48:48,840 --> 02:48:52,200
And we do these variables
in my particular step

2769
02:48:53,400 --> 02:48:53,640
right?

2770
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:54,640
Right. Yes.

2771
02:48:55,520 --> 02:48:59,360
So now see the magic magic of teaching
about how to convert books.

2772
02:48:59,360 --> 02:49:01,520
It knows it very but very intelligent.

2773
02:49:01,960 --> 02:49:02,880
Learn how things work.

2774
02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:06,240
You I go in my look,

2775
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:09,320
I'm going to write for my third

2776
02:49:09,320 --> 02:49:11,280
employee feature.

2777
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:13,600
The bag would be

2778
02:49:15,400 --> 02:49:18,000
data table and let's make it right.

2779
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:19,680
It is equal to

2780
02:49:20,040 --> 02:49:24,240
let's see in an employee
which I do have this take yesterday with.

2781
02:49:24,240 --> 02:49:25,760
I have this take

2782
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:34,360
executed.

2783
02:49:34,360 --> 02:49:37,440
So when I actually execute

2784
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:39,480
can you see this time it is giving me

2785
02:49:39,480 --> 02:49:41,000
something else

2786
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:43,600
that is

2787
02:49:46,440 --> 02:49:47,280
this time

2788
02:49:47,280 --> 02:49:50,200
the implementation of the step
is something else.

2789
02:49:50,440 --> 02:49:52,440
Can everyone see

2790
02:49:56,400 --> 02:49:57,240
first?

2791
02:49:57,240 --> 02:49:59,680
First let me copy and then I read that you

2792
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:03,640
first let me copy and then I bring that

2793
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:06,840
you hear
how things work in this particular scene.

2794
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:13,800
It says, Right, Everyone is opening here.

2795
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:16,160
What I'm thinking it's
not everyone is agreeing.

2796
02:50:16,160 --> 02:50:20,040
They see it is right code here.

2797
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:23,560
Then does the phrase above
into concrete actions

2798
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:27,000
for automatic transformation.

2799
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:29,200
Change your detective.

2800
02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:32,360
But it means the one
we provided in our feature find.

2801
02:50:32,400 --> 02:50:37,760
It says change data table to one of one
topic means from multiple things.

2802
02:50:37,760 --> 02:50:40,800
You can change it into one of either list

2803
02:50:42,240 --> 02:50:44,320
grade or list of list

2804
02:50:45,480 --> 02:50:47,640
or list of man

2805
02:50:47,640 --> 02:50:51,840
or only man or map with list.

2806
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:52,840
Right?

2807
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:56,080
And this with an element or key

2808
02:50:56,080 --> 02:50:59,880
or a new grade must be string integer

2809
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:03,720
float, double bind, short long

2810
02:51:03,960 --> 02:51:08,800
big integer or big basically.

2811
02:51:08,800 --> 02:51:09,680
All right.

2812
02:51:10,880 --> 02:51:12,680
What does it mean?

2813
02:51:12,800 --> 02:51:16,320
It means either we can back as a list

2814
02:51:17,280 --> 02:51:19,440
or we can big as a map,

2815
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:21,720
or we can take whatever I want to do.

2816
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:24,120
Point now.

2817
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:26,440
Now, let me show you something
really important.

2818
02:51:26,440 --> 02:51:28,560
Another see,

2819
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:33,240
I'm going to tell you
at this particular point here,

2820
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:36,360
when I'm passing the data in detected
when I'm passing

2821
02:51:36,360 --> 02:51:40,480
like this first name, if you understand

2822
02:51:40,480 --> 02:51:43,800
this point, then further and further
an explanation would be very easy.

2823
02:51:43,800 --> 02:51:48,000
Middle name, last name.

2824
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:50,600
You want

2825
02:51:51,160 --> 02:51:53,440
to run the element

2826
02:51:54,520 --> 02:51:56,080
in to

2827
02:51:56,560 --> 02:52:02,000
improve the need to be 3 p.m.

2828
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:03,960
3 p.m.

2829
02:52:03,960 --> 02:52:07,120
three.

2830
02:52:07,120 --> 02:52:10,560
Can you see these three points? C

2831
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:13,120
This is what first names

2832
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:18,480
these.

2833
02:52:18,480 --> 02:52:21,480
This is your key.

2834
02:52:21,480 --> 02:52:23,640
This is also your key

2835
02:52:23,640 --> 02:52:29,280
and it is also European, Correct?

2836
02:52:29,280 --> 02:52:31,280
Is this correct? Grace

2837
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:34,160
What is this?

2838
02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:37,720
This is your value.

2839
02:52:37,720 --> 02:52:40,080
This is also your body.

2840
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:42,000
This is also your

2841
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:43,680
industry.

2842
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:47,560
What I'm explaining in.

2843
02:52:47,560 --> 02:52:50,960
So now when it returns first name.

2844
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:54,400
So there you will get one key
and you will get one value

2845
02:52:55,560 --> 02:52:56,800
when you want

2846
02:52:57,240 --> 02:53:01,080
when you get renamed,
it will give you one key and one value.

2847
02:53:01,440 --> 02:53:04,400
When you will get last name,
it will give you one key and one

2848
02:53:04,400 --> 02:53:07,760
value correct.

2849
02:53:07,760 --> 02:53:11,200
And in case 111213.

2850
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:16,760
Similarly, in the next line
also it will give you one key, right?

2851
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:19,480
And then one value and then second value.

2852
02:53:19,800 --> 02:53:20,880
And then the third And

2853
02:53:22,200 --> 02:53:24,200
the third line also will give you a key.

2854
02:53:24,440 --> 02:53:29,480
And when you key and value key
and when you rate,

2855
02:53:30,600 --> 02:53:31,520
what does it mean?

2856
02:53:31,520 --> 02:53:35,200
Give a new key value
given new every single

2857
02:53:36,480 --> 02:53:38,440
every single rule,

2858
02:53:38,440 --> 02:53:41,160
every single rule is returning.

2859
02:53:41,160 --> 02:53:43,200
One man

2860
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,880
keys values means one map.

2861
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:53,040
No gear map one

2862
02:53:53,040 --> 02:53:55,040
keys values between

2863
02:53:55,040 --> 02:53:59,360
another map from here, keys and values
between another.

2864
02:53:59,360 --> 02:54:00,840
Remember from here.

2865
02:54:00,840 --> 02:54:03,200
So now, how many maps

2866
02:54:03,480 --> 02:54:06,360
this particular portion is returning and

2867
02:54:07,440 --> 02:54:09,000
how many messages returning?

2868
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:12,440
This particular table?

2869
02:54:12,440 --> 02:54:15,640
Three maps, three, four premiums.

2870
02:54:15,960 --> 02:54:16,520
Good.

2871
02:54:18,120 --> 02:54:20,280
It is returning with three particular
maps.

2872
02:54:21,120 --> 02:54:23,400
Now is recommended,
and I'm going to get just

2873
02:54:23,400 --> 02:54:28,560
three maps every day.

2874
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:34,560
So it can be in number of maps,
it can be in number of maps,

2875
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:38,440
read it can, and then maps, 20 maps,
30 minutes, whatever.

2876
02:54:38,840 --> 02:54:40,360
I don't know how many maps.

2877
02:54:40,360 --> 02:54:43,600
So it means what? One, two, three.

2878
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:47,040
When it comes to count,
it is simply a missed from

2879
02:54:49,320 --> 02:54:52,440
it is simply a list of map or not
multiple maps.

2880
02:54:52,440 --> 02:54:58,280
If I want these maps together, I need to
keep all of these maps in the list.

2881
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:00,560
Have to keep
all of these maps in the list.

2882
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:04,800
And then what I have to do, I have to keep
every single map in the list

2883
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:08,520
because every row is returning one
map based on date and venue.

2884
02:55:08,760 --> 02:55:12,280
So when based on keep and renew,
every single row is returning the map

2885
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:16,200
for every note and getting multiple maps
every row and getting unique

2886
02:55:16,200 --> 02:55:20,040
maps, multiple haussmann's, multiple maps,
I want to keep all of these

2887
02:55:20,040 --> 02:55:21,000
things together.

2888
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,720
It means I need a list of maps

2889
02:55:25,720 --> 02:55:26,200
and a

2890
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:29,520
list of maps.

2891
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:33,600
Now see now see the beauty of the Google,
what it sees here

2892
02:55:33,720 --> 02:55:36,560
when you come in the Gutenberg part here,
when you come,

2893
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:43,360
it says automated transformation, infinite
automated

2894
02:55:43,360 --> 02:55:47,680
transformation, you just need to call one
is bibs from the to jumble

2895
02:55:47,880 --> 02:55:51,880
and it will automatically transform
your maps and to list

2896
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:55,160
it will take your entire data
in terms of maps.

2897
02:55:55,920 --> 02:56:01,360
It will convert any time to list and
you will find no need to read any code.

2898
02:56:01,360 --> 02:56:03,000
Now let me show you.

2899
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,520
First, we will hide this data table.

2900
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:07,880
Instead of writing this,
we will simply imported.

2901
02:56:08,640 --> 02:56:09,120
Right?

2902
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:12,720
So just read like this table and import
class

2903
02:56:12,840 --> 02:56:17,360
from EU not to convert
or but imported from.

2904
02:56:17,360 --> 02:56:21,400
I'll start to convert
dot data table please imported

2905
02:56:23,080 --> 02:56:27,000
imported uses this data table here

2906
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:27,520
today.

2907
02:56:27,640 --> 02:56:29,640
This is the object of the data table.

2908
02:56:29,640 --> 02:56:31,440
Which object of the data?

2909
02:56:31,440 --> 02:56:33,920
Their data will be used here.

2910
02:56:34,800 --> 02:56:39,760
The object trade of this particular
one correct?

2911
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:40,160
Correct.

2912
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:49,040
Goes.

2913
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:50,640
Not the next thing.

2914
02:56:50,640 --> 02:56:53,640
The next thing. Let's do it. This part

2915
02:56:53,640 --> 02:56:56,840
here, I'm going to write a clean code.

2916
02:56:56,840 --> 02:56:58,400
I need a word

2917
02:56:58,680 --> 02:56:59,600
first.

2918
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:02,760
I'm going to write my data.

2919
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:06,280
They may not exist as list as map.

2920
02:57:07,080 --> 02:57:10,200
How how need as maps on this list based on

2921
02:57:12,880 --> 02:57:14,160
as maps read.

2922
02:57:14,160 --> 02:57:16,680
So let's take it as maps first.

2923
02:57:16,680 --> 02:57:20,320
Now, when we're taking this as maps
after this,

2924
02:57:20,360 --> 02:57:23,640
we are going to take
all these maps in the list.

2925
02:57:24,040 --> 02:57:26,400
It means list of maps.

2926
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:29,880
It means list of maps, meaning no

2927
02:57:31,040 --> 02:57:32,040
place.

2928
02:57:32,040 --> 02:57:35,440
It is returning all the maps,
but we are not making the list. Why?

2929
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,680
First, collect the map added in the list.

2930
02:57:39,240 --> 02:57:43,040
At one day we are going to use one day,
not not complete data.

2931
02:57:43,320 --> 02:57:46,680
So we need to store all the data
which we are getting from the map.

2932
02:57:47,080 --> 02:57:51,240
Once we are getting all the data coming
from the maps will keep it in the list

2933
02:57:51,400 --> 02:57:52,640
according to adequate amount.

2934
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:54,080
We can use some expensive data.

2935
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:55,200
ABC 2.1.

2936
02:57:55,200 --> 02:57:58,080
rejected depending on the request. Right.

2937
02:57:58,360 --> 02:57:59,960
So now I'm going to write here.

2938
02:57:59,960 --> 02:58:06,600
See, I'm going to write your list of

2939
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:10,240
list 12th map,

2940
02:58:10,240 --> 02:58:13,960
which I need not only because
what is the nature of my username

2941
02:58:13,960 --> 02:58:16,840
and password or the enforcement

2942
02:58:17,680 --> 02:58:20,560
element lost, then what is the nature

2943
02:58:21,440 --> 02:58:22,200
screen?

2944
02:58:22,200 --> 02:58:26,160
So my key is my key is string in

2945
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:36,640
my response was correct.

2946
02:58:36,640 --> 02:58:37,520
Is this correct?

2947
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:40,240
My DS is spring and my values also spring.

2948
02:58:40,240 --> 02:58:42,880
I'm simply providing
the name called employee

2949
02:58:46,280 --> 02:58:49,760
Employee names.

2950
02:58:49,960 --> 02:58:53,320
And as to the meaning of this line,

2951
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:54,840
now what I am doing,

2952
02:58:54,840 --> 02:58:57,800
I'm taking all the data in terms of maps

2953
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:02,240
and then via calling this particular line
and wording good

2954
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:06,360
all the maps and then adding all maps
one by one to the list.

2955
02:59:07,080 --> 02:59:07,680
And as

2956
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:12,280
we will like this complete could also mean

2957
02:59:12,280 --> 02:59:15,960
we will read the data from Excel,
we will read it will get it.

2958
02:59:16,880 --> 02:59:17,600
It's in our book.

2959
02:59:17,600 --> 02:59:20,280
It will do it right now. Is this okay

2960
02:59:30,360 --> 02:59:32,280
Lives Project folder.

2961
02:59:32,280 --> 02:59:36,720
Now I'm going to I create the values
one by one from the list.

2962
02:59:37,080 --> 02:59:40,720
Read from this list of maps
admins employs list.

2963
02:59:40,720 --> 02:59:42,680
I'm going to get the data one by one.

2964
02:59:42,680 --> 02:59:46,080
How delegates to read the data one by one.

2965
02:59:46,320 --> 02:59:48,560
What we generally use

2966
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:52,880
for each loop read advanced follow
So from map.

2967
02:59:53,480 --> 02:59:57,560
From map which I'm having on screen

2968
02:59:59,080 --> 03:00:03,040
along the screen

2969
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:06,200
here, I'm going to provide my

2970
03:00:07,280 --> 03:00:08,440
employee.

2971
03:00:08,440 --> 03:00:12,120
When my employee names

2972
03:00:28,320 --> 03:00:32,000
which expression
it is asking me to remove.

2973
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:45,680
Oops.

2974
03:00:45,680 --> 03:00:46,880
And it is called

2975
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:49,880
Yes, I removed it

2976
03:00:49,880 --> 03:00:57,960
already.

2977
03:00:57,960 --> 03:00:59,640
Map import

2978
03:01:03,080 --> 03:01:03,400
human.

2979
03:01:03,400 --> 03:01:11,160
This one it is from delegate is the image.

2980
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:11,920
It is from Java.

2981
03:01:11,920 --> 03:01:14,560
You would be simply writing.

2982
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:18,360
I was trying to name on like

2983
03:01:21,400 --> 03:01:21,760
soda.

2984
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:28,920
Dennis
can you please read java you delegate map.

2985
03:01:28,920 --> 03:01:32,880
Can someone please put this in this
like this particular input

2986
03:01:33,400 --> 03:01:35,040
so that they can take it

2987
03:01:36,640 --> 03:01:39,480
map and
list read We can take this bottle from w

2988
03:01:39,480 --> 03:01:42,720
these grapes are from W
we can take it fine.

2989
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:48,960
So far Everyone good? No.

2990
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:51,960
Now their data. No other data.

2991
03:01:51,960 --> 03:01:56,280
I'm getting every aberration made
from the map I will read.

2992
03:01:56,840 --> 03:01:58,880
Was true
administrator done supposed to map?

2993
03:01:59,080 --> 03:01:59,880
Correct.

2994
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:04,160
So from that, whatever the value,
then I'm going to store those values first

2995
03:02:04,440 --> 03:02:05,360
before using them.

2996
03:02:05,360 --> 03:02:07,520
So I'm writing the screen

2997
03:02:08,360 --> 03:02:10,640
name value

2998
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:12,720
yet I'm going to store the value from here

2999
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:17,240
from my in

3000
03:02:17,240 --> 03:02:21,440
range, from my and not released
to receive the data from any map

3001
03:02:21,920 --> 03:02:24,400
which give me use which method we use

3002
03:02:25,760 --> 03:02:28,680
if I want the value
or if I want the key we use.

3003
03:02:28,680 --> 03:02:31,680
Which method in maps

3004
03:02:33,280 --> 03:02:36,560
the way we use don't add
that any less to add something great.

3005
03:02:36,600 --> 03:02:39,280
Be used or put method
to add something in the map for use.

3006
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:43,120
Don't get the method we use target method.

3007
03:02:43,120 --> 03:02:43,800
Great.

3008
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:45,560
So now let's turn here.

3009
03:02:45,560 --> 03:02:48,080
Here the value which we are going to date.

3010
03:02:48,080 --> 03:02:50,200
We are going to pass this keys.

3011
03:02:50,200 --> 03:02:58,240
Now tell me which keys I'm talking about
here, which we are talking about here.

3012
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:00,880
The key which

3013
03:03:00,880 --> 03:03:04,640
I have provided here, this key
first name with Limited.

3014
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:06,960
Lastly, I write this keys.

3015
03:03:07,800 --> 03:03:11,160
So now,
now I'm going to end the keys here.

3016
03:03:12,280 --> 03:03:13,920
First name

3017
03:03:15,720 --> 03:03:18,240
and then similarly

3018
03:03:18,440 --> 03:03:21,440
we are going to get it for

3019
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:26,400
the name and this one,

3020
03:03:26,400 --> 03:03:30,120
we are going to get it for last
name, right?

3021
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:32,880
If we look at value

3022
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:37,880
and this one I'm going to critically

3023
03:03:43,320 --> 03:03:46,400
last understood

3024
03:03:50,520 --> 03:03:52,200
and this one

3025
03:03:57,400 --> 03:04:01,160
I now know what I'm going to do

3026
03:04:01,160 --> 03:04:04,320
is simply I'm to add rate.

3027
03:04:04,320 --> 03:04:07,120
I'm going to send this data
in my actual bar.

3028
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:10,800
So this is my first name, last and middle
name and last and write

3029
03:04:10,880 --> 03:04:13,840
in distribution, correct?

3030
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:17,880
Is this correct?

3031
03:04:17,880 --> 03:04:19,520
Okay, fine.

3032
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:20,760
So when I'm doing it right,

3033
03:04:20,760 --> 03:04:23,440
when I'm doing it,
let me first ask you something, guys.

3034
03:04:24,040 --> 03:04:25,200
First, ask if something

3035
03:04:33,600 --> 03:04:34,560
I wrote

3036
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:38,080
this particular point inside the
my for each loop

3037
03:04:39,440 --> 03:04:41,440
inside of map for each layer last for

3038
03:04:41,440 --> 03:05:01,680
what is the reason behind this?

3039
03:05:01,680 --> 03:05:03,560
Because you want them to really find a mr.

3040
03:05:03,560 --> 03:05:04,800
detectable

3041
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:07,320
to me

3042
03:05:07,320 --> 03:05:10,920
yes vibrating multiple employs
the that each value.

3043
03:05:10,920 --> 03:05:12,720
We need to do it.

3044
03:05:12,720 --> 03:05:16,440
We need to look for

3045
03:05:19,640 --> 03:05:22,800
No tell me one thing I say to your user.

3046
03:05:22,800 --> 03:05:27,480
Adam was deeply embroidered right
and verified the added force

3047
03:05:27,480 --> 03:05:30,920
to let me menu this part and then
I will take you to the further part.

3048
03:05:30,920 --> 03:05:31,640
Looking

3049
03:05:51,360 --> 03:05:55,160
I'm seeing this is right last name

3050
03:05:57,040 --> 03:06:07,400
I think is almost.

3051
03:06:07,400 --> 03:06:45,560
I know.

3052
03:06:45,560 --> 03:06:48,440
Fine.

3053
03:06:48,440 --> 03:06:51,080
We got this doing that now see,
I don't notice you.

3054
03:06:51,120 --> 03:06:53,280
You're going to correct that. Correct.

3055
03:06:53,280 --> 03:06:57,440
Now you see is how things work.

3056
03:06:57,440 --> 03:07:04,800
I wrote my first name,

3057
03:07:04,800 --> 03:07:08,320
I wrote my middle name,
I wrote my last two rate based.

3058
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:10,880
These three things I have correct.

3059
03:07:10,880 --> 03:07:12,520
For example, this is the value.

3060
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:14,240
Do you want me to be three?

3061
03:07:14,240 --> 03:07:16,560
Do you want to improve proof

3062
03:07:17,320 --> 03:07:22,640
3d133d3 straight days

3063
03:07:23,400 --> 03:07:27,000
when it returns here,
When it returns here, the first believe

3064
03:07:27,280 --> 03:07:31,200
it will give me this key
and this values, right?

3065
03:07:31,480 --> 03:07:36,600
So here the values become B1 first rate
which I will be passing to this part.

3066
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:40,800
Then D from middle name
which I will be passing here

3067
03:07:41,320 --> 03:07:45,280
and from here value would be d13
which I would be passing here.

3068
03:07:45,600 --> 03:07:45,960
Correct.

3069
03:07:47,560 --> 03:07:50,200
Then in the next iteration because still
the fourth

3070
03:07:50,200 --> 03:07:54,080
loop is going on, the for loop is going on
in the second addition, it will return.

3071
03:07:54,720 --> 03:07:58,800
Do you do do do do do do spend
which would be passing here

3072
03:07:59,440 --> 03:08:02,520
in the third articulation
because still my loop is going on.

3073
03:08:02,520 --> 03:08:05,640
It returns this keys and now this venue So

3074
03:08:05,880 --> 03:08:08,320
80 1d3d3

3075
03:08:09,600 --> 03:08:11,680
Undisputable is how things work.

3076
03:08:11,680 --> 03:08:13,000
This is the key.

3077
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,840
This is the value line
which I'm going to be one by one

3078
03:08:15,920 --> 03:08:19,440
by one, one by five.

3079
03:08:19,440 --> 03:08:22,200
So far
anyone has any question in this part,

3080
03:08:22,560 --> 03:08:25,880
is there anyone who has any question
in this particular part

3081
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:36,240
strings.

3082
03:08:36,240 --> 03:08:41,120
No question.

3083
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:44,120
Now, let's look at this scenario.

3084
03:08:44,120 --> 03:08:48,560
If I want to verify,
I need to click on also or not any any

3085
03:08:58,240 --> 03:08:58,880
I need to

3086
03:08:58,880 --> 03:09:18,080
consider that also correct?

3087
03:09:18,080 --> 03:09:18,840
Correct.

3088
03:09:19,320 --> 03:09:21,440
I need to click on separate and also fine.

3089
03:09:21,880 --> 03:09:25,680
So now let me go inside my
that is my third of steps.

3090
03:09:25,720 --> 03:09:26,880
There you go.

3091
03:09:26,880 --> 03:09:31,360
After this, I need to consider what time
do we have any functionality possible?

3092
03:09:32,320 --> 03:09:34,560
Yes. This is the place it

3093
03:09:40,640 --> 03:09:43,880
clicking on same button.

3094
03:09:43,880 --> 03:09:45,440
Is there audit?

3095
03:09:46,400 --> 03:09:51,920
Is there non non.

3096
03:09:52,280 --> 03:10:03,680
And then what is the next thing?

3097
03:10:03,680 --> 03:10:05,800
Screenshot really?

3098
03:10:05,800 --> 03:10:08,560
We need to verify first more.

3099
03:10:08,560 --> 03:10:11,520
We're not looking
what's been screenshot as of now.

3100
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:17,520
It means we need to put assertions rate
assertions.

3101
03:10:18,120 --> 03:10:21,400
So assertions in homework is of no for you
it isn't old.

3102
03:10:21,400 --> 03:10:23,600
What I'm quoting here is it will work.

3103
03:10:23,640 --> 03:10:24,640
I will keep you.

3104
03:10:24,640 --> 03:10:27,040
I will tell you this assertion also.

3105
03:10:27,040 --> 03:10:32,160
No, no one important thing
needs one important thing. See?

3106
03:10:33,120 --> 03:10:34,280
Let me do it manually.

3107
03:10:34,280 --> 03:10:35,040
First,

3108
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:38,320
remember when we talk about

3109
03:10:39,240 --> 03:10:42,320
table examples,
what is the main difference?

3110
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:45,840
Remember in examples, double

3111
03:10:46,160 --> 03:10:48,880
hooks worked before every scenario.

3112
03:10:48,880 --> 03:10:53,040
Another arbitrary
and it updating all the employees.

3113
03:10:53,280 --> 03:10:55,800
My hooks were closing the browser

3114
03:10:56,320 --> 03:11:00,640
and it.

3115
03:11:00,640 --> 03:11:05,160
But now when we work with detected

3116
03:11:05,160 --> 03:11:08,120
with my works just one day

3117
03:11:08,760 --> 03:11:11,640
it means it means if I go on be

3118
03:11:11,720 --> 03:11:15,000
if I click on an employee,

3119
03:11:15,000 --> 03:11:35,040
if I click on an employee,

3120
03:11:35,040 --> 03:11:37,600
if I go click on an employee part

3121
03:11:39,360 --> 03:11:42,560
from here,
and when I add some of the employee, let's

3122
03:11:42,560 --> 03:11:47,200
add this one, this data in listed
now when I click on see,

3123
03:11:47,640 --> 03:11:52,440
see when I click on See Wonder,

3124
03:11:52,440 --> 03:11:54,960
I will be on this page only.

3125
03:11:56,520 --> 03:11:58,760
I will be on this page only

3126
03:11:59,200 --> 03:12:04,000
Understood, Understood.

3127
03:12:05,280 --> 03:12:08,440
It means my hooks are not going to work.

3128
03:12:09,560 --> 03:12:12,000
So when my hooks are not going work

3129
03:12:12,240 --> 03:12:16,880
in the code itself,
I have to come on to that screen again.

3130
03:12:17,120 --> 03:12:17,920
All right.

3131
03:12:17,920 --> 03:12:21,240
So my big down works just one thing.

3132
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:23,640
My bitcoin also works for just one day

3133
03:12:24,160 --> 03:12:27,080
we are going
to click on an employee current.

3134
03:12:27,360 --> 03:12:29,520
So now see my hooks work.

3135
03:12:29,520 --> 03:12:31,840
How many times, how many days?

3136
03:12:33,200 --> 03:12:35,640
One day my big go to works,
how many things

3137
03:12:38,960 --> 03:12:41,240
one day trade so hooks

3138
03:12:41,240 --> 03:12:45,160
background What work did one day point
after editing the employ?

3139
03:12:45,360 --> 03:12:51,120
I am on this screen mostly after looking
at this screen, where should I link to it?

3140
03:12:51,120 --> 03:12:52,720
And then that employee

3141
03:12:59,160 --> 03:13:01,120
I have to click on this employee.

3142
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:02,400
But then again.

3143
03:13:02,640 --> 03:13:03,240
Right.

3144
03:13:03,240 --> 03:13:05,480
And then I have to
have the details correct.

3145
03:13:05,760 --> 03:13:11,640
So now just imagine when you are using
example stable, when you are using

3146
03:13:11,640 --> 03:13:17,560
examples, stable vicinity of line,
there you were unnecessarily logging in.

3147
03:13:17,560 --> 03:13:19,800
Everything okay.

3148
03:13:19,800 --> 03:13:22,240
Clicking on promotion, click on it.

3149
03:13:22,240 --> 03:13:26,080
Employee option,
then adding the employee, then step button

3150
03:13:26,280 --> 03:13:30,480
then verify their the user that ended
or not and close the browser.

3151
03:13:30,920 --> 03:13:34,360
Then again opening the browser, then again
entering username password.

3152
03:13:34,360 --> 03:13:36,480
Then again click on promotion and employ.

3153
03:13:36,480 --> 03:13:40,640
Isn't it a waste of time?

3154
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:41,800
Isn't it a waste of time?

3155
03:13:42,880 --> 03:13:44,640
Even in the scenario itself?

3156
03:13:44,640 --> 03:13:48,960
We can see if I have to add employees,
then why do repeat all the steps again

3157
03:13:48,960 --> 03:13:50,200
and again?

3158
03:13:50,200 --> 03:13:53,360
I can read just one step
that will repeat again and again

3159
03:13:53,360 --> 03:13:56,480
and all the employees open the browser
when they closed the browser.

3160
03:13:56,480 --> 03:14:00,680
One thing that's excluded and implement
this after

3161
03:14:00,680 --> 03:14:03,840
clicking on save button
what verification rate?

3162
03:14:04,120 --> 03:14:07,240
Let me intentionally put
some training or sleep because I know it

3163
03:14:07,560 --> 03:14:08,680
is going to take some time.

3164
03:14:08,680 --> 03:14:11,000
You're operating in the data.

3165
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:11,520
Fine.

3166
03:14:11,520 --> 03:14:16,960
Let's throw this exception.

3167
03:14:16,960 --> 03:14:20,040
And now after this,
we have to click on an employee.

3168
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:23,840
So where we have the
this imperative based and

3169
03:14:23,840 --> 03:14:26,120
we have right employee have been able

3170
03:14:26,120 --> 03:14:31,200
this is the one we have an employee
would not find its copy this piece of this

3171
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:36,280
underscore what I'm doing

3172
03:14:37,440 --> 03:14:39,840
create not sleep

3173
03:14:39,840 --> 03:14:42,480
3003 seconds

3174
03:14:42,480 --> 03:14:44,840
so that you know
applications loaded properties

3175
03:14:46,080 --> 03:14:51,360
guys this to come back again on

3176
03:14:52,480 --> 03:14:56,040
employee is green screen

3177
03:14:56,640 --> 03:15:00,480
because pools and big girl

3178
03:15:00,920 --> 03:15:04,400
who spend big on looks just

3179
03:15:04,920 --> 03:15:09,200
one thing looks ten big trolls works
just one thing is

3180
03:15:09,200 --> 03:15:10,080
this kind

3181
03:15:19,120 --> 03:15:22,680
is this correct Gates What I'm doing here

3182
03:15:23,600 --> 03:15:26,120
because we are dealing with digital.

3183
03:15:26,200 --> 03:15:27,480
Yes, we are dealing with it.

3184
03:15:27,480 --> 03:15:28,640
People break.

3185
03:15:29,040 --> 03:15:31,760
We have any question with this code,

3186
03:15:31,760 --> 03:15:38,000
this piece of code,
what we've written over here,

3187
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:42,720
there's clear to one.

3188
03:15:42,720 --> 03:15:46,080
So now
now if you go in your employee board

3189
03:15:46,520 --> 03:15:49,600
and you'll see how many scripts
you have written in your agents

3190
03:15:49,600 --> 03:15:50,320
in any

3191
03:15:56,040 --> 03:15:58,520
how many steps, just one.

3192
03:15:58,520 --> 03:15:59,240
Right.

3193
03:15:59,360 --> 03:16:04,680
And just think this situation now
where you have your background trained,

3194
03:16:04,680 --> 03:16:07,920
which is common to all us
and then using this feature,

3195
03:16:08,240 --> 03:16:12,400
you have your hooks which is taking
of your precondition and post condition.

3196
03:16:12,680 --> 03:16:16,040
So all you need to do
is you just need to put your piece of your

3197
03:16:16,480 --> 03:16:19,360
your piece of code in just one particular
step.

3198
03:16:19,360 --> 03:16:20,760
And step will work for you.

3199
03:16:22,640 --> 03:16:25,720
Right.

3200
03:16:25,720 --> 03:16:27,480
All right. This

3201
03:16:33,880 --> 03:16:36,040
shall we execute this one

3202
03:16:42,120 --> 03:16:43,240
line 67.

3203
03:16:43,240 --> 03:16:44,000
Can you expand?

3204
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:48,400
Please do not detectible 967

3205
03:16:54,040 --> 03:16:56,480
This part you mean

3206
03:16:56,480 --> 03:16:57,360
I see

3207
03:17:01,640 --> 03:17:03,720
this is the object of your data table.

3208
03:17:03,720 --> 03:17:05,120
Greater detail,

3209
03:17:05,120 --> 03:17:08,840
how you call your deductible,
which we have mentioned in your feature.

3210
03:17:08,840 --> 03:17:09,480
Right.

3211
03:17:09,480 --> 03:17:12,960
So you need to call your deductible
that you agree to an individual point

3212
03:17:12,960 --> 03:17:14,480
in your method actually.

3213
03:17:14,480 --> 03:17:20,120
So with using this particular with keyword
from the part you are actually calling.

3214
03:17:20,120 --> 03:17:24,320
So you see we are using this
deductible object and taking this as maps.

3215
03:17:24,600 --> 03:17:28,240
So whatever the values be
have defined over there in, that region.

3216
03:17:28,240 --> 03:17:28,720
Right.

3217
03:17:28,760 --> 03:17:31,720
It will take those values in terms of keys

3218
03:17:31,720 --> 03:17:35,440
and police statements map
and then we're adding all these maps.

3219
03:17:35,720 --> 03:17:36,920
See, this is not map.

3220
03:17:36,920 --> 03:17:39,000
This is map segments, multiple maps.

3221
03:17:39,000 --> 03:17:44,280
We are digging right in these maps
and adding the list as a multiple maps.

3222
03:17:44,560 --> 03:17:45,160
Right.

3223
03:17:45,160 --> 03:17:48,480
So taking the list of maps,
that's what we are creating here.

3224
03:17:48,480 --> 03:17:50,280
We got a list of maps here.

3225
03:17:50,280 --> 03:17:54,720
We are putting it in advance for loop
one by one zero is returning me

3226
03:17:54,720 --> 03:17:59,080
one map giesen when this we are reading
all the values based on the key.

3227
03:17:59,080 --> 03:18:01,480
So we pass the key.
We are getting the value.

3228
03:18:01,720 --> 03:18:05,680
This value we're passing
not actuals in any read

3229
03:18:08,440 --> 03:18:16,440
or write.

3230
03:18:16,440 --> 03:18:17,560
Nice.

3231
03:18:18,360 --> 03:18:21,200
Could we also use implicit
with individual rigorously? Yes.

3232
03:18:21,200 --> 03:18:23,160
So Sebastian, we can use.

3233
03:18:23,160 --> 03:18:24,560
I have a very good option for that.

3234
03:18:24,560 --> 03:18:29,400
I think they do their duty
and they do their part.

3235
03:18:29,400 --> 03:18:32,040
But let's let me execute this part now.

3236
03:18:32,080 --> 03:18:33,000
All right.

3237
03:18:33,320 --> 03:18:35,640
So let me go ahead and execute

3238
03:18:35,640 --> 03:18:45,560
this now.

3239
03:18:46,280 --> 03:18:48,280
Let's see how many games
Web browser executed

3240
03:19:02,600 --> 03:19:08,320
saved, viewed for 5 seconds.

3241
03:19:09,640 --> 03:19:11,920
Click on an employee

3242
03:19:13,640 --> 03:19:15,800
at second data

3243
03:19:15,960 --> 03:19:16,680
done,

3244
03:19:17,640 --> 03:19:23,640
wait for 5 seconds, click on an employee

3245
03:19:24,720 --> 03:19:26,480
and their data

3246
03:19:28,560 --> 03:19:30,080
frequency

3247
03:19:31,240 --> 03:19:32,400
employee only exists

3248
03:19:32,400 --> 03:19:34,560
because it already
existing the employee decline.

3249
03:19:35,560 --> 03:19:38,560
And then again, click on paid

3250
03:19:39,120 --> 03:19:39,720
rate.

3251
03:19:40,400 --> 03:19:42,760
It's passed
because there is nobody positions.

3252
03:19:42,760 --> 03:19:44,880
That's my response. All right.

3253
03:19:45,640 --> 03:19:49,480
So now see, based on number of data
which I have provided

3254
03:19:49,880 --> 03:19:53,880
in my region
by Right, it executed my best case.

3255
03:19:54,960 --> 03:19:56,520
Is this clear to everyone

3256
03:19:56,520 --> 03:19:59,640
using the digit even like this

3257
03:20:00,080 --> 03:20:00,840
based

3258
03:20:06,720 --> 03:20:15,560
everyone needs nice

3259
03:20:17,360 --> 03:20:18,080
it's you.

3260
03:20:18,080 --> 03:20:25,560
Let's
see the another usability with already.

3261
03:20:25,560 --> 03:20:30,280
Let's see another usability remote
we can use for this yellow

3262
03:20:30,320 --> 03:20:34,200
movie can use that, but instead of this
I would give you another good option.

3263
03:20:35,200 --> 03:20:36,280
So now.

3264
03:20:36,320 --> 03:20:38,360
Now let's see the another way.

3265
03:20:38,360 --> 03:20:40,600
Let's let's do the under this scenario
here.

3266
03:20:40,640 --> 03:20:43,440
See let me go into their dashboard which

3267
03:20:46,440 --> 03:20:48,720
this is the beach agent really open rate

3268
03:20:49,160 --> 03:20:52,760
might open this page
can you see as an admin taking element

3269
03:20:52,800 --> 03:20:57,360
beam leave time recruitment performance
dashboard and added options

3270
03:20:58,680 --> 03:21:02,240
rate So far we are coming on this page.

3271
03:21:02,280 --> 03:21:04,200
So far we are coming on this page.

3272
03:21:04,200 --> 03:21:07,440
We are not,
but we are not actually a very fine rate.

3273
03:21:07,440 --> 03:21:10,080
What are the options
we are getting on this particular page?

3274
03:21:11,120 --> 03:21:11,760
Right?

3275
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:12,760
So we never know

3276
03:21:12,760 --> 03:21:16,240
whether it is getting all these or not,
so we have to verify it or not.

3277
03:21:17,080 --> 03:21:19,520
It is to keep functionality
or not to these options,

3278
03:21:19,520 --> 03:21:22,320
but it is.

3279
03:21:22,680 --> 03:21:25,120
Is this the key functionality or not?

3280
03:21:25,120 --> 03:21:27,200
Yes, it is the key functionality. Right.

3281
03:21:27,560 --> 03:21:28,920
So I've got to log in first.

3282
03:21:28,920 --> 03:21:31,800
I have to modify it all these options.

3283
03:21:31,800 --> 03:21:33,960
I can get all these options I can get.

3284
03:21:34,440 --> 03:21:37,800
This is
this is a good form of detecting with

3285
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:40,960
the simulator
team will be able to use here also

3286
03:21:41,160 --> 03:21:44,520
when this time when we are actually going
to use this data table

3287
03:21:44,760 --> 03:21:47,880
in this data will be
will not use key and value.

3288
03:21:48,480 --> 03:21:50,880
We will simply use values.

3289
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:53,760
What we will use simply
we will use only values.

3290
03:21:53,760 --> 03:21:56,240
No key value
because there is no value available.

3291
03:21:56,240 --> 03:21:56,760
Right.

3292
03:21:56,760 --> 03:22:00,440
So we were allegedly
used as windows are will be leave time

3293
03:22:00,440 --> 03:22:01,800
to recruitment in everything.

3294
03:22:01,800 --> 03:22:03,680
How we will implement this.

3295
03:22:03,680 --> 03:22:06,880
Let's have a look of it.

3296
03:22:06,880 --> 03:22:12,960
So the new feature
which I'm going to create now is my is my

3297
03:22:14,360 --> 03:22:16,680
dashboard door feature

3298
03:22:17,320 --> 03:22:22,560
is my dashboard or feature.

3299
03:22:22,560 --> 03:22:25,920
See page

3300
03:22:26,760 --> 03:22:27,680
functionality.

3301
03:22:27,680 --> 03:22:30,680
And here I'm going to write some elements

3302
03:22:31,800 --> 03:22:33,880
that they're going be

3303
03:22:34,080 --> 03:22:36,680
it would be simple thing
I'm going to go is dashboard

3304
03:22:36,680 --> 03:22:39,600
just to give make it easy dashboard

3305
03:22:41,160 --> 03:22:44,880
reading for the baseboard

3306
03:22:45,960 --> 03:22:48,360
really fine dashboard or text

3307
03:22:50,600 --> 03:22:51,760
based verified dashboard.

3308
03:22:51,760 --> 03:22:52,920
Perhaps

3309
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:55,760
so, but any questions?

3310
03:22:55,760 --> 03:22:57,000
What I'm doing

3311
03:22:59,640 --> 03:23:00,560
the meaning is tips.

3312
03:23:00,560 --> 03:23:03,800
I think the meaning of steps
I think would be seem great

3313
03:23:05,520 --> 03:23:08,840
where we have this particular one

3314
03:23:08,840 --> 03:23:11,400
user interface
where it is any password to user playing.

3315
03:23:11,400 --> 03:23:13,800
So log in with the trade

3316
03:23:13,800 --> 03:23:16,240
in. We take this particular run
successfully locally.

3317
03:23:16,240 --> 03:23:20,040
It would take this three steps from here

3318
03:23:21,280 --> 03:23:23,320
if we put it in my

3319
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:24,280
name.

3320
03:23:24,280 --> 03:23:31,320
Can I use the three steps
a lot to me, right.

3321
03:23:31,400 --> 03:23:33,520
1 million times we use these steps.

3322
03:23:33,520 --> 03:23:35,120
If someone says we can't use

3323
03:23:37,320 --> 03:23:38,880
correctly, you

3324
03:23:40,600 --> 03:23:43,680
next time then

3325
03:23:43,680 --> 03:23:45,680
then ready by

3326
03:23:46,800 --> 03:23:48,680
all the

3327
03:23:48,680 --> 03:23:52,720
all the dashboard steps

3328
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:56,440
then verify all their dashboard. This

3329
03:23:56,440 --> 03:23:59,680
All right.

3330
03:23:59,680 --> 03:24:00,720
Alright guys.

3331
03:24:00,720 --> 03:24:04,240
Now see, by using the data table
how we get good data

3332
03:24:04,320 --> 03:24:07,280
table is applicable for how many steps

3333
03:24:10,360 --> 03:24:15,040
data table is applicable
for how many steps?

3334
03:24:15,040 --> 03:24:16,800
Just one step.

3335
03:24:16,800 --> 03:24:19,440
So when my detectable is applicable
only for one step.

3336
03:24:19,440 --> 03:24:23,320
So here for this last step,
I'm going to write my data

3337
03:24:23,320 --> 03:24:27,120
table point
No issues deliberated one by one.

3338
03:24:27,120 --> 03:24:29,800
What I have here in my data, in my

3339
03:24:30,920 --> 03:24:33,440
application and the motion

3340
03:24:33,440 --> 03:24:35,480
I have the option.

3341
03:24:35,480 --> 03:24:37,040
I have an option.

3342
03:24:37,040 --> 03:24:38,480
I have

3343
03:24:40,360 --> 03:24:41,400
group

3344
03:24:42,240 --> 03:24:43,120
option based.

3345
03:24:43,120 --> 03:24:46,240
Take this building
as I'm writing here, performance option.

3346
03:24:46,880 --> 03:24:51,560
And then the next one is dashboard
option and the next one is

3347
03:24:53,160 --> 03:24:55,080
an entry option.

3348
03:24:55,160 --> 03:24:56,000
Is this correct?

3349
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:59,040
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, eight.

3350
03:24:59,600 --> 03:25:00,320
Live time.

3351
03:25:00,320 --> 03:25:02,680
The group main performance dashboard that

3352
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:07,920
we did, I took myself

3353
03:25:07,920 --> 03:25:11,400
at a greenish board performance
to make time

3354
03:25:11,600 --> 03:25:15,600
leave be me for.

3355
03:25:15,600 --> 03:25:18,960
All right, so now, now let me go here

3356
03:25:19,880 --> 03:25:22,800
and let me change it

3357
03:25:23,320 --> 03:25:24,360
just to keep like this.

3358
03:25:24,360 --> 03:25:25,800
Only every time I need to change,

3359
03:25:25,800 --> 03:25:30,160
I will change only year
one point dashboard and make it plan.

3360
03:25:30,160 --> 03:25:32,600
And as it was to do,

3361
03:25:32,600 --> 03:25:35,600
like don't why I'm making a do

3362
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:39,240
and why change Degas dashboard

3363
03:25:40,040 --> 03:25:40,800
if you No no.

3364
03:25:40,800 --> 03:25:44,440
Check the recordings.

3365
03:25:44,440 --> 03:25:48,480
So again again for the data
they will here for their data table.

3366
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:50,480
Great for the data.

3367
03:25:50,480 --> 03:25:53,320
Well I'm going to copy this
particular skip from here

3368
03:25:54,480 --> 03:25:57,240
and I will create another two steps here.

3369
03:25:58,480 --> 03:25:59,640
Guide

3370
03:26:01,960 --> 03:26:07,920
Where is my gun for steps?

3371
03:26:07,920 --> 03:26:11,560
So I'm going to extend my

3372
03:26:16,840 --> 03:26:18,480
common methods,

3373
03:26:18,760 --> 03:26:20,600
right? And then put it here.

3374
03:26:20,600 --> 03:26:25,320
This particular park,
I put my common method here.

3375
03:26:25,680 --> 03:26:27,000
Now see

3376
03:26:29,560 --> 03:26:33,240
what I'm going to do again,
Trade the data table first.

3377
03:26:33,240 --> 03:26:35,480
Which one was to reach one?

3378
03:26:35,520 --> 03:26:36,720
This is my data driven.

3379
03:26:36,720 --> 03:26:39,920
I'm going to be imported
Fine. From make it.

3380
03:26:39,920 --> 03:26:42,560
You'll learn guys.

3381
03:26:43,360 --> 03:26:45,440
Now see, very interesting point for me.

3382
03:26:45,440 --> 03:26:48,600
One how can we use
how we can use this particular detective?

3383
03:26:48,600 --> 03:26:50,800
Well, here it's what I'm going to explain.

3384
03:26:50,800 --> 03:26:52,000
You see

3385
03:26:55,960 --> 03:26:56,480
this time?

3386
03:26:56,480 --> 03:26:58,280
Do we need a maps

3387
03:27:04,680 --> 03:27:06,000
where I use produced?

3388
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:08,800
I need to place from a be one
where I used words

3389
03:27:14,880 --> 03:27:16,520
just three or four active in the group.

3390
03:27:16,520 --> 03:27:17,200
Then are this

3391
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:26,840
How many of you base having nature there?

3392
03:27:26,840 --> 03:27:28,680
How many days you have

3393
03:27:44,200 --> 03:27:45,840
really important things we are discussing?

3394
03:27:45,840 --> 03:27:49,080
If someone missed and asked me
after those nationwide

3395
03:27:49,080 --> 03:27:53,360
include do it, then you will see my gun

3396
03:27:56,760 --> 03:27:58,080
is scared to say something.

3397
03:27:58,080 --> 03:27:59,400
If mistake you will kill.

3398
03:27:59,400 --> 03:28:01,560
No, no, no, no, no.

3399
03:28:01,560 --> 03:28:02,040
I don't know.

3400
03:28:02,040 --> 03:28:07,480
That is of no, no.

3401
03:28:07,480 --> 03:28:10,320
But it is for us right

3402
03:28:10,880 --> 03:28:13,720
now. See, this time we don't need maps.

3403
03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:15,960
So first clear.

3404
03:28:15,960 --> 03:28:20,240
We need simple list break.

3405
03:28:20,240 --> 03:28:23,960
Yes, yes. Time.

3406
03:28:23,960 --> 03:28:37,200
There you go.

3407
03:28:37,200 --> 03:28:41,680
So one sometimes it is good, right?

3408
03:28:42,800 --> 03:28:45,760
I you know, I'm
getting with your being with you.

3409
03:28:45,760 --> 03:28:48,520
I'm enjoying with you
at the same time of meetings with some.

3410
03:28:48,840 --> 03:28:50,400
It's good to be honest.

3411
03:28:50,400 --> 03:28:55,200
So everyone everyone
you know, can attend the class properly.

3412
03:28:57,160 --> 03:28:57,600
You can

3413
03:28:57,600 --> 03:29:07,600
all the players here.

3414
03:29:07,600 --> 03:29:08,280
All right.

3415
03:29:08,280 --> 03:29:09,000
With you.

3416
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:12,120
Having said this, I will tell you one very

3417
03:29:13,200 --> 03:29:16,920
rare scenario of my school life
after this part

3418
03:29:17,320 --> 03:29:20,440
to play the mobility,
I would tell you a story.

3419
03:29:21,240 --> 03:29:23,280
What happened to me,

3420
03:29:23,440 --> 03:29:26,520
What happened with me, actually,
what my teacher did

3421
03:29:27,560 --> 03:29:28,640
very bad.

3422
03:29:28,960 --> 03:29:33,000
So now we need this data table,
this time as a maps.

3423
03:29:33,120 --> 03:29:35,080
No, we need this, this time.

3424
03:29:35,080 --> 03:29:37,560
This simple list.

3425
03:29:39,360 --> 03:29:40,080
Correct.

3426
03:29:41,160 --> 03:29:43,680
We need it at least as a list.

3427
03:29:43,680 --> 03:29:46,200
We need it to calculate.

3428
03:29:46,200 --> 03:29:49,320
So I'm going to write simple

3429
03:29:49,680 --> 03:29:52,200
when I'm writing a list.

3430
03:29:52,200 --> 03:29:55,000
So my list is having reached a sprint by

3431
03:29:55,680 --> 03:29:57,920
and providing the name the code that's

3432
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:00,480
this line.

3433
03:30:00,480 --> 03:30:01,160
Clear

3434
03:30:03,360 --> 03:30:04,880
this line Dear everyone.

3435
03:30:04,880 --> 03:30:08,600
What I wrote
Simple and list major industry.

3436
03:30:08,600 --> 03:30:12,160
I provide the name of the list as best
So from the deductible

3437
03:30:12,440 --> 03:30:15,640
I am taking one as a list
and converting it and putting it here.

3438
03:30:16,040 --> 03:30:18,240
There's the expenditure now. Really good.

3439
03:30:18,240 --> 03:30:23,040
Then I got the code snippet
from my consultant for step five initial

3440
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:26,320
point I'm going to write here now.

3441
03:30:26,320 --> 03:30:29,840
See, I'm going to write.

3442
03:30:29,840 --> 03:30:44,880
First thing is, then I'm going to write.

3443
03:30:44,880 --> 03:30:45,640
Fine.

3444
03:30:45,640 --> 03:30:48,360
So first I need dashboard.

3445
03:30:48,840 --> 03:30:49,920
That's

3446
03:30:50,600 --> 03:30:55,520
what I need this dashboard deps,
I need a new dashboards

3447
03:30:55,880 --> 03:30:58,520
so that I can compare
the values of dashboard

3448
03:30:59,280 --> 03:31:01,840
red with the values
that I got from my feature.

3449
03:31:01,840 --> 03:31:02,360
Right.

3450
03:31:02,440 --> 03:31:06,560
So now tell me
if I need this dashboard tabs from here.

3451
03:31:06,920 --> 03:31:10,880
From here, what I can use, what I can use.

3452
03:31:10,880 --> 03:31:13,200
But see, let me show you.

3453
03:31:13,200 --> 03:31:15,400
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

3454
03:31:16,160 --> 03:31:25,000
I can take element
or I can take elements, element

3455
03:31:25,000 --> 03:31:28,080
or elements and me

3456
03:31:30,480 --> 03:31:35,880
it means from this particular class,
if we take it from here

3457
03:31:35,880 --> 03:31:40,080
and we days how I'm taking the rate
the class is equals

3458
03:31:40,080 --> 03:31:44,040
to menu slash you and

3459
03:31:45,120 --> 03:31:46,800
now you see here

3460
03:31:46,800 --> 03:31:51,880
in this UML right
in this unit I'm having all these a light

3461
03:31:51,920 --> 03:31:57,960
a light and I options or slash
and I see one, two, three, four, 5678.

3462
03:31:57,960 --> 03:32:00,480
All these options I'm getting on

3463
03:32:01,400 --> 03:32:02,160
based

3464
03:32:06,600 --> 03:32:09,040
let me take this

3465
03:32:09,040 --> 03:32:13,760
including this from here
and I'm going to put it here.

3466
03:32:13,760 --> 03:32:17,360
Tell me how to write X but what elements

3467
03:32:35,600 --> 03:32:37,160
is this correct

3468
03:32:59,080 --> 03:32:59,480
here?

3469
03:32:59,760 --> 03:33:01,160
What frenetic

3470
03:33:02,240 --> 03:33:03,560
web element

3471
03:33:04,080 --> 03:33:06,320
or web elements

3472
03:33:06,600 --> 03:33:11,880
or list of web element? Yes.

3473
03:33:11,960 --> 03:33:13,520
I should meet

3474
03:33:14,920 --> 03:33:20,040
y should take like this or not.

3475
03:33:20,320 --> 03:33:21,120
Tell me,

3476
03:33:22,680 --> 03:33:36,240
is this correct expression?

3477
03:33:36,240 --> 03:33:39,400
So now from this step,
reading from this particular example,

3478
03:33:39,400 --> 03:33:44,640
what I'm going to do is see, first
I'm going to write for my actual EPS.

3479
03:33:45,040 --> 03:33:46,840
I'm going to write under the list here

3480
03:33:48,640 --> 03:33:49,640
list,

3481
03:33:50,160 --> 03:33:53,040
which is having all the values
as is framed.

3482
03:33:53,760 --> 03:33:57,360
And I'm writing this as actually EPS

3483
03:33:58,680 --> 03:34:03,600
is it was the new edit list.

3484
03:34:03,600 --> 03:34:07,240
If someone has any question, what is that
list, What is length, the list,

3485
03:34:07,640 --> 03:34:08,680
Any question, Right.

3486
03:34:08,680 --> 03:34:10,720
I told you to revise Java.

3487
03:34:10,720 --> 03:34:12,480
It is a part of collection.

3488
03:34:12,480 --> 03:34:15,520
Go ahead and read it is
didn't have any question

3489
03:34:15,520 --> 03:34:18,800
you let Neil I will not answer

3490
03:34:18,800 --> 03:34:22,440
in advance for loop in advanced for loop.

3491
03:34:22,800 --> 03:34:25,960
We are going to compare the values

3492
03:34:25,960 --> 03:34:30,600
which we are getting from our actual thing
and from one dashboard tips.

3493
03:34:30,600 --> 03:34:32,640
I read mistakes but techniques.

3494
03:34:32,640 --> 03:34:34,080
So one value me about.

3495
03:34:34,080 --> 03:34:37,560
From there we are passing one value
in my feature point

3496
03:34:37,880 --> 03:34:42,280
and one value
we are getting from our from our script.

3497
03:34:42,600 --> 03:34:46,280
So to get the value from a script,
I'm going to write this particular part

3498
03:34:46,280 --> 03:34:49,680
called The Element, and I'm going to

3499
03:34:50,520 --> 03:34:53,920
for my on my dashboard next.

3500
03:34:54,520 --> 03:34:58,000
Great, because I need every single element
one by one.

3501
03:34:58,000 --> 03:34:59,240
So enforce tribulation.

3502
03:34:59,240 --> 03:35:02,560
It will return one element
in synchronization, it will return second

3503
03:35:02,560 --> 03:35:06,240
element organization,
it will return third element and so on.

3504
03:35:06,240 --> 03:35:06,880
Right.

3505
03:35:06,880 --> 03:35:11,400
And every time, every name
when I taking this, what I'm seeing in

3506
03:35:11,400 --> 03:35:16,440
list, just take these values
and add what I should add here.

3507
03:35:16,920 --> 03:35:18,240
And the element

3508
03:35:20,400 --> 03:35:24,480
and the
element text and after this, right.

3509
03:35:24,480 --> 03:35:29,400
Once you add all this things,
simply print here, simply print.

3510
03:35:29,400 --> 03:35:30,920
What should I paint here?

3511
03:35:30,920 --> 03:35:34,600
The first thing I would bring here
is my X.

3512
03:35:35,120 --> 03:35:41,800
In the second thing here
I want to print is my actually next.

3513
03:35:41,800 --> 03:35:45,040
Now see this, this then this dense.

3514
03:35:45,600 --> 03:35:47,640
I'm thinking what I should rename.

3515
03:35:47,640 --> 03:35:52,720
We do expect that it would be very easy
for you to understand expected depth.

3516
03:35:52,760 --> 03:35:54,480
I'm making the right.

3517
03:35:54,480 --> 03:35:57,360
So these are expected dips
which are coming from my

3518
03:35:58,520 --> 03:36:02,960
which is coming from my case, coming from

3519
03:36:05,280 --> 03:36:06,600
each of my

3520
03:36:07,120 --> 03:36:11,760
couple
that is coming from my feature frame rate.

3521
03:36:11,760 --> 03:36:15,600
I know this is a list for this list
expected coming from feature find

3522
03:36:16,040 --> 03:36:19,920
and this one is coming
from coming from application

3523
03:36:19,920 --> 03:36:23,240
or coming from simply
automation script Economist.

3524
03:36:24,600 --> 03:36:26,840
Right now when it is

3525
03:36:26,840 --> 03:36:30,160
coming from there,
I kept everything in the list

3526
03:36:31,120 --> 03:36:34,280
one by one,
all the steps I'm taking so it one time

3527
03:36:34,560 --> 03:36:37,880
from the elements
it is returning one element.

3528
03:36:38,760 --> 03:36:41,080
That element I'm taking and I'm

3529
03:36:41,080 --> 03:36:43,560
storing
that based on that particular element.

3530
03:36:44,080 --> 03:36:47,400
Three days
I'm ending the text of that element I'm

3531
03:36:47,400 --> 03:36:50,080
printing here and this what I'm doing

3532
03:36:51,680 --> 03:36:54,240
one by one, what I'm doing

3533
03:36:54,240 --> 03:36:57,240
fine after this, after this.

3534
03:36:57,240 --> 03:36:59,600
See after this what I see.

3535
03:36:59,680 --> 03:37:02,280
This is the end of my voyage loop.

3536
03:37:03,160 --> 03:37:05,960
This is the end of my polish
loop in one spot.

3537
03:37:06,120 --> 03:37:07,640
So I'm outside the loop.

3538
03:37:07,640 --> 03:37:10,080
I'm doing one of this things here.

3539
03:37:10,080 --> 03:37:13,920
I'm going to provide a solution
for a solution which is ocean.

3540
03:37:13,920 --> 03:37:14,720
I have to use case

3541
03:37:17,880 --> 03:37:19,920
which is of certain equals.

3542
03:37:19,920 --> 03:37:23,800
I can use trade
or let me tell you, that totally

3543
03:37:25,080 --> 03:37:27,200
solved software solution

3544
03:37:28,840 --> 03:37:36,000
in cucumber.

3545
03:37:36,000 --> 03:37:37,200
And I got one. Yes.

3546
03:37:37,200 --> 03:37:42,680
As with no, no, let me tell you,
we will use only to you need a solution

3547
03:37:42,680 --> 03:37:46,480
but the code way of using the C
I can write.

3548
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:49,560
I start dark, I start

3549
03:37:50,720 --> 03:37:55,480
to you must be thinking when we're going
to compare two things, how it can be true.

3550
03:37:55,880 --> 03:37:59,360
I'm telling you, I'm writing here expected

3551
03:37:59,360 --> 03:38:01,760
depth, not

3552
03:38:03,680 --> 03:38:05,400
equals

3553
03:38:07,760 --> 03:38:09,440
true pets

3554
03:38:10,440 --> 03:38:11,800
in I write this

3555
03:38:11,800 --> 03:38:13,960
I'm comparing to lisp together actually

3556
03:38:14,440 --> 03:38:16,800
expecting steps toward equals a tips

3557
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:22,200
If this particular
if this particular expression is correct,

3558
03:38:22,600 --> 03:38:26,640
this assertion will returns true
otherwise it will return

3559
03:38:26,640 --> 03:38:30,280
false guys

3560
03:38:33,600 --> 03:38:37,400
guys understood.

3561
03:38:37,400 --> 03:38:39,720
So just for information,
I'm going to write here

3562
03:38:40,800 --> 03:38:43,760
all values, all

3563
03:38:45,720 --> 03:38:48,000
are equal.

3564
03:38:48,000 --> 03:38:52,120
A lot is is is

3565
03:38:54,640 --> 03:38:56,520
my best guess is parsed

3566
03:38:56,520 --> 03:38:58,080
generate this

3567
03:39:01,160 --> 03:39:02,640
write this case

3568
03:39:10,440 --> 03:39:12,680
Yes I can write this You want really to be

3569
03:39:14,000 --> 03:39:17,720
nice as you wish X Excellent

3570
03:39:18,560 --> 03:39:23,880
excellent great.

3571
03:39:23,880 --> 03:39:26,040
Okay let's executed first.

3572
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:29,600
They should put steps right there first.

3573
03:39:29,600 --> 03:39:33,200
Let's do it we check in this part?

3574
03:39:33,200 --> 03:39:35,760
Fish brightness equals two thoughts.

3575
03:39:36,880 --> 03:39:38,600
Let's try to run this code now.

3576
03:39:38,600 --> 03:40:17,880
I'm going to run it.

3577
03:40:17,880 --> 03:40:20,160
Now you see here that

3578
03:40:20,160 --> 03:40:23,960
I printed this first,
which is coming from might be fine.

3579
03:40:23,960 --> 03:40:28,440
And the second one is coming from my from
my application just to show you

3580
03:40:29,120 --> 03:40:31,200
these two values are equal
on what you see here.

3581
03:40:32,160 --> 03:40:33,680
That's what my assertion is doing.

3582
03:40:33,680 --> 03:40:35,640
It is comparing these two values.

3583
03:40:35,640 --> 03:40:38,640
And when we consider what this doing, is
that equal?

3584
03:40:38,880 --> 03:40:40,320
It is giving with this message.

3585
03:40:42,120 --> 03:40:43,560
So all the combinations,

3586
03:40:43,560 --> 03:40:46,880
but in rotational examples

3587
03:40:47,840 --> 03:40:51,240
scenario claim
normal scenarios, detectable,

3588
03:40:51,720 --> 03:40:55,840
detectable with keys, detectable
with without keys usage.

3589
03:40:55,840 --> 03:40:59,880
Okay, use a background that every scenario

3590
03:40:59,880 --> 03:41:04,200
with every feature without region user
and or cases in their tags,

3591
03:41:04,440 --> 03:41:10,760
every single thing is that question
that you guys have in this part.

3592
03:41:10,760 --> 03:41:21,400
Meanwhile with the with this code,
it is not equal.

3593
03:41:21,400 --> 03:41:24,640
Then it will give us the associated

3594
03:41:26,400 --> 03:41:30,040
yes following output would not print
because that image will stop on that line.

3595
03:41:30,040 --> 03:41:32,520
So it will not go on
to the end of the migrate.

3596
03:41:32,520 --> 03:41:34,640
So in that time we will not that message

3597
03:41:43,960 --> 03:41:44,600
already.

3598
03:41:44,600 --> 03:41:47,400
So this is all I'm done from side
for today.

3599
03:41:47,960 --> 03:41:50,280
Now, now I'm going to give you time.

3600
03:41:50,680 --> 03:41:51,360
Right.

3601
03:41:51,360 --> 03:41:53,680
Because I committed the code
in the repository.

3602
03:41:54,000 --> 03:41:59,200
You guys can take this code
first and I'm still here.
