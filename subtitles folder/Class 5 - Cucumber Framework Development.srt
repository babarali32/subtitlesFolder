1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,200
Everyone forgot for the record.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,520
So now Hooks when we talk about

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,160
hooks, basically we have two hooks in.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,800
What are these two?

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,800
You can, you can.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,720
It's an open gate or

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,160
not the same words.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,440
If it

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,280
if you were right, then I would take it
if it is already in my mind.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,760
And then later.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,280
Then after that I have spoken before
an honorary consul.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,480
We have in order to deliver the posters
before and seconds after,

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,000
we have seen the same kind of annotations
in this dingy part.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,040
But did we had a lot of lot of information

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,160
available for victims of litigation
before up to method, before class,

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,040
after class before based on her best
before, soon after.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,040
Right.

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,520
And sometimes we get confused
which one we use, which will not be.

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,200
So let's
wait to make this job simplified for us.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
And then instead of using
so many annotations

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,640
we can simply use
just to default and appear to simply be

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,680
first states for your preconditions
and participants for your condition.

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,480
I agree with

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,960
high level.

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,680
All right.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,640
You don't need to be

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,840
imported from

28
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:42,920
the hooks.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,880
Hooks in the

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,440
obviously.

31
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
Yes, obviously

32
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,560
we have to use it, particularly
because with the J, you need to remember

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,480
whatever the things we are doing with
Jane is related to your class.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,080
It is a little

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,800
bit better class.

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,560
That was the portion we use
from the unique associates.

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,880
These are the versions we use from David.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,920
But apart from these two, all the things

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,320
we are importing
from consumer part of the trade.

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
So please take care of your worst case.

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,400
And any the if you have this code
in your machine, then

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,720
we have an improved

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,840
point.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,000
So before,

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,240
after these two hooks, we have more

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,280
information

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,240
post condition

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,800
this precondition,
both hooks would be correct.

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,200
Yes. Yes, correct.

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,200
So I am coming to this point though,
how we can really put these hooks.

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,840
When we keep these hooks in our project,
we give them enough steps.

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Package three

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,760
steps, library steps, definitions
that are available.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,440
We keep these particular hooks
class inside that each framework is, but

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,960
then we could look at group of mistakes
and we are using good management class.

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,280
It takes my hooks as a precondition
in most condition

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,960
and its package

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,600
it should

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,040
extent Common interests are common,
but they're spotted.

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,840
Like if they're tied for a little bit
about the common.

61
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,360
But there's very much time on specifically
this particular class common metrics

62
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,440
as it is very important, something

63
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
this is something we will do in Saturday's
class.

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,400
I most probably in separate
this class three and into one of the

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,520
class is very painful.

66
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,160
So yes, then you will see that
you will see things.

67
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm intentionally, you know,
taking the topics one or two here

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,080
and then because if I see that this class
is going to take 3 hours,

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,600
not even complete 3 hours, three,
including breaks and everything,

70
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,440
but then do something

71
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,560
if there is a topic that we can not can
begin this two minute 140 minutes.

72
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,160
I intentionally was one.

73
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Those topics to the bigger classes
and their topics would be completed.

74
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,160
The short class in digital.

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,320
You take those topics in these classes,
so I cannot I should not break the links

76
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,960
and I can complete
one topic in this class.

77
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,240
So you guys might be thinking
why we are not learning common methods

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,560
by going to that.

79
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,600
So there is a particular standard
that is a

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,680
I don't want to break the links
to the top of the topic.

81
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,600
I expect to be off
of the topic of extreme tomorrow.

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
And then sort of do you break the chain?

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't want to do this until you
So in one flow,

84
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,520
if we could complete one topic
because that it is intended of people,

85
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,280
it is a short topic but it's good it's
a good plan is to complete one topic in

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:11,600
1 to 3. Okay

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,040
days.

88
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,720
So now before and after,

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,360
these are two hooks we have up the ropes.

90
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,520
The first thing we learned was so far
we paused.

91
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,240
Hard coded data is not possible.

92
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,280
Simply hardcoded it.

93
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,360
And then I showed
all of the possible scenarios for you guys

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,680
to parse the data from different sources.

95
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,720
Trade.

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,000
So tell me one by one,
what are those sources

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,600
that we can predict?

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,040
First one was yes.

99
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,200
First
we simply passed are username and password

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,440
from config build

101
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
properties by right.

102
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,840
First
we passed it from computer properties, but

103
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,320
so that this time I need to pass
hardcoded data and instead of hardcoded

104
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,320
data, what I can do is I can simply code
my get property right value.

105
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,280
And then from there we are reading
the property is based on the key

106
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,560
those guys will provide and based on
those is the best data

107
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,160
by function, especially data
from confident properties mine.

108
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,040
And it could simply
it would simply be in my user password.

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,320
Correct.

110
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,360
Is this correct case

111
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,400
nice.

112
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
Second we deposited that is stronger

113
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,400
feature rate

114
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,760
feature by now that we showed
how we pass this data

115
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,960
in terms of double quotes rate,
we passed this data.

116
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,800
So you see

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
that's how we passed the data.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,400
So now this time we are not passing
these keys to add the employee

119
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,400
from my confident properties,
but instead I'm passing it

120
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,880
directly from my cementing right
in my feature point.

121
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,120
So this is the second one, how it reads.

122
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,160
It will convert these particular steps

123
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,480
along with them and then we would see
when I actually implement

124
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,320
this step, it will give me this
stable step definition

125
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,400
where I'm handling previous strings
but force them really last that right.

126
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,000
And then based on the keys
that have voided values are that provided

127
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,800
in my feature while it is taking the data
in my function.

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,040
And then I'm calling
this a number of different

129
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,480
so for any question in this part,

130
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,120
instead of calling this data
as a hardcoded or instead of calling

131
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,960
this data from computer properties,

132
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,400
I'm simply passing this data
from my feature.

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,640
Right. But again, that is a problem.
I see.

134
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,680
That is a problem.
I see. What is the problem?

135
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,200
The problem is
I can use this in a new build

136
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,880
in one bank for just one import.

137
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,400
If I use this particular step,
then I can implement my decision

138
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,600
and make it execute this scenario just
for one employee, not for all the inputs.

139
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,120
Correct.

140
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,680
Okay.

141
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,400
But when it comes to our principle,
what is our target?

142
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,560
The target is to achieve data driven
testing,

143
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,400
right?

144
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,880
So when I see the target is to achieve
data driven distinct, it simply means

145
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,280
my one scenario should execute
across my deposits of data.

146
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,560
So I need to come up with the idea through
which I can execute my escape across

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,760
multiple people's books of data.

148
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
So it is pretty much

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,400
clear that
if I want to make these kind of scenarios,

150
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,800
I can execute once multiple names
across different sets of data.

151
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,560
I have to either
rely on some external point

152
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:19,680
to achieve the speed or I need to search
more and more functionality.

153
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,200
Right?

154
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,040
So when I searched
more functionality of the toolbox,

155
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,680
then I found one concept
calls the matter of like

156
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,240
right.

157
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,640
Then I found one concept
called scenario of this.

158
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,480
It would put all of these things
in the process, but

159
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,280
first thing is,

160
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,480
the second thing is

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,320
seeing the data from

162
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,560
the box.

163
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:31,560
People.

164
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,800
So now next thing,
what we didn't really do

165
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,400
is we simply provide scenario outline
instead of scenario.

166
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,840
And then when we provided, then
how do you apply it to the real examples?

167
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,960
Table three This example statement

168
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,400
generally gives us how we can
muster data based on key.

169
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,000
And when

170
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,320
you see you, when you talk about examples

171
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,560
tuple based on key
and we can pass the data

172
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,560
gradients.

173
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,480
So these keys
we will pass in our scenario.

174
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,160
Now tell me one more thing.

175
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,200
This example statement
is limited to just one step,

176
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,680
but we can be use
all the keys can be used in multiple steps

177
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,360
once in any

178
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,160
equal step straight,
it can be using multiple steps.

179
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,800
For example, if I was them with them.

180
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,280
Lastly, and I want to handle this post,
the post system made a limited

181
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,360
second one and last.

182
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,920
The third one is I can do this on,

183
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,560
I can do this.

184
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,040
But so this is the second
we know how it works.

185
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Basically
when you actually execute your scenario.

186
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,560
So executes three names here.

187
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,680
My because the data I mentioned in line
number 2424 disease, it creates three

188
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,040
region in when it creates create region,
I will simply get this data.

189
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,320
I can simply execute this in any one time,
but it will get executed.

190
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,280
Three things.

191
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,720
This is the functionality of the Google
G data

192
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,560
team on disk.

193
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,600
Is this clear? Everyone

194
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,080
wants?

195
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,800
Then what is the other way?

196
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,040
The other bit on behalf of B is

197
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,960
to parse their data by our data table.

198
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,640
Correct

199
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,160
data.

200
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,240
Right. So.

201
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,600
So now what we are going to do
is we are going to parse the data.

202
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,160
But tell me guys, what is the difference
in between detectible in examples?

203
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,640
Examples is also a table

204
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,480
is also going to be a passing data
from both basis.

205
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,240
Then what is the difference?

206
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,240
If you see in data table
there is a key and false

207
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,800
name with the last name is the key, right
is to 1 to 3 M is just 4.6 is the value.

208
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,320
So there is a key and value in the name
Elizabeth

209
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,680
No steps

210
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,840
lost in any argument.

211
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,040
Yes. Yes. Got it.

212
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,120
So one detectible. The major difference.

213
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,520
The major difference
most in any of is body

214
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,360
major differences.

215
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,760
We can use examples
table for multiple steps.

216
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,440
Right.

217
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,640
The keys which we are defining and values
which were DV.

218
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,400
We can use this keys in values
in multiple steps.

219
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,760
But here in this particular
detectable part, we can use this data

220
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,200
only for one particular step,
nor for multiple step.

221
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,280
Yeah, got it.

222
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,040
Where were you guys?

223
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,160
I was expecting your answer.

224
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,240
Since long

225
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,680
a great.

226
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,360
All right, guys.

227
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,720
Now they did.

228
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,640
I do tapes of scenarios.
We have been detected with.

229
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,040
What are those two?

230
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,600
The first one we are seeing here
and what we are doing.

231
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,120
We are simply passing
first name with a them.

232
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,560
And lastly,
and we are providing the values.

233
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,800
That's what we are doing.

234
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
So now here what we have to convert
according

235
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,840
to the functionality of the convert.

236
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,240
When I actually create this,

237
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,200
it will give me a different
kind of like this when it gives me

238
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,480
the argument, quantitative grade
this that I would have any to handle.

239
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,160
I need to create a data
the debates automatically insert

240
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,600
this table with
I know key and the loop is a concept I'll

241
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,160
develop it as a concept. All

242
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,000
maps in Java. Right?

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,640
So when we talk about mapping,
do what we have to do.

244
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,760
Every single line is returning the map.

245
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,680
If I have multiple rules, multiple maps,

246
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,000
okay, If I take one at one time, fine.

247
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
But I have to put it somewhere, right?

248
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,880
So my people maps.

249
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,280
If I have to do that, I need one list.

250
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,000
Then I can store these multiple maps
so listed or add.

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,240
This is the last thing
this particular function.

252
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,720
And then I'm adding all the members
together.

253
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,880
However, these things that are working
internally, but I'm just explaining it

254
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,440
the functionality and from there
we can read this database from the key.

255
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,240
So inverse preparation.

256
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,640
By passing all the guides, it will read
the complete data from the of these

257
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,600
I am passing values which is reading
similarly passing in the Keys.

258
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,360
We have already provided values.

259
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,120
It will read similarly Bertoldo excellent.

260
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,360
There are some things working here,

261
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:48,760
right?

262
00:15:48,760 --> 00:16:01,960
Great.

263
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,560
Great. Someone forgot the homework.

264
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,120
I I'm not to remember the need.

265
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
Someone forgot I was.

266
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,560
I woke up last year, right?

267
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,240
I mean 530 or six I woke up
and I saw a couple of messages

268
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,480
from students and someone was discussing,
Hey, I forgot the whole room better.

269
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:26,720
Well,
so even if everything they do let me know

270
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:33,240
so that I will remind you again
and again and again.

271
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,640
All right.

272
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,760
I see you are the culprit.

273
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,160
There

274
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,400
is going to

275
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,720
Angelino, Chicago.

276
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:43,920
Really?

277
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:56,640
Not a great one for like.

278
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,480
Fine.

279
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,640
Excellent.

280
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,720
Excellent.

281
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,320
So now let me put this part of the books

282
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,440
in the data from examples
and then from 830

283
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,880
oh, we're supposed

284
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,880
exempt books.

285
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,160
That is

286
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:32,320
a keeper, because that word

287
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,480
simple statement, we keep

288
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,280
it. We do

289
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:52,400
that.

290
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,600
So for any questions, a student,

291
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,680
any questions, anyone

292
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,720
here?

293
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,720
Excellent.

294
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:17,080
Is there any other one
who has any question?

295
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,840
Just fine.

296
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,000
Now, now,

297
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,720
let's come back to this particular
topic here.

298
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
Again, important point is

299
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,560
now we are going to be a little bit
on not much.

300
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,760
Obviously, that framework
is not deep down, but two years

301
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,120
from now onwards,
we are going a little bit deep

302
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,840
and will try to understand how things
connected internally in the framework.

303
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,520
Right.

304
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,480
So from now onwards
we are starting to give the real sheet

305
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,920
of one compute framework and we will see
how this thing works for rate.

306
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,720
Right now we are using Neven Project,
but I know we do not have this memory

307
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,680
do it right even though I have been
writing in my machine.

308
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,880
But you guys looked at it so I wish it

309
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,920
when reading and we think you would meet.

310
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,520
Great.

311
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,320
I hope for Mac users Bruins join everyone.

312
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,840
Everyone has a room in your machine

313
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,640
and for

314
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:23,640
Windows users always easy to download
to create memory in your local machine.

315
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,800
So I mentioned the reduce
bottleneck. Great.

316
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,720
No idea.

317
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,120
Nine such

318
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,800
good idea

319
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,960
slide

320
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,080
illuminated

321
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,720
only two days.

322
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,520
Now see one more scenario left
so far for passing their data.

323
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,560
Again, this data table examples

324
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,600
Table feature While parsing the data
from config properties.

325
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,280
Fine.

326
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,960
All these options are available.

327
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,160
Very good options.

328
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,920
Data table.

329
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,080
Excellent options.
Let's say game scenario.

330
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,320
They will show you here we are passing
the data would not based on gain value

331
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,920
there
we parsed as maps here we are passing

332
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,600
this detectable as

333
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,880
in list

334
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,200
rate in passing this data as list point.

335
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,200
No issues.

336
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,720
So now this time
when we are simply passing the options,

337
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,840
we can take all of these options
in the list.

338
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,960
Similarly, we can take these options
from the application on the list

339
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,640
and we compare these two options. This
to list together.

340
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,640
It would list adequate possibilities.

341
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,720
But again, like I said, these

342
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,840
are these scenarios
that are applicable and appropriate.

343
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,920
When the volume of your data is small,

344
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,600
the volume of

345
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,320
your data is not small,
then this to not use

346
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,160
more use that.

347
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,040
In that case, what we have to do,
we have to keep our best

348
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,040
data separate from our best script.

349
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,560
This is very important.

350
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,600
We need to learn this line
so that the model, the world,

351
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,240
we do it.

352
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,400
What we are going to do is
this is my Alexa

353
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,520
script, my class.

354
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,440
I should be having one district
of finance trade

355
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,440
separate district of late this time.

356
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,200
I will write my script everything here
and I will keep my data here.

357
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,720
I will pass this data in my script
from here.

358
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,320
Right?

359
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,640
I have to create a function through

360
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,120
which I can read my data
and use my trade in my classes.

361
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,120
So what is the advantage that advantages

362
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,480
this fight could
be a large amount of data.

363
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,400
This particular district

364
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,200
file can be a large amount of readers.

365
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,920
Even the volume of the data is large.

366
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,560
I can keep it the same thing
if I am changing something in my code,

367
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,280
if I'm changing something
that the class is, it's

368
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,080
not going to affect my business
development

369
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,680
or if I'm changing or playing
with the data, it's not going to affect

370
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,720
with my code

371
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,720
or district the advantage

372
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,760
of using this data to replace

373
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,560
everything.

374
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Whenever you will be working
in the daytime

375
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,480
industry or on the project grade
that you have to follow

376
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,360
this particular functionality,
this concept you have to follow.

377
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,920
You cannot pass here today.

378
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,440
You should not passing to this particular
individual based or not because let's see

379
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,800
if you are working with Facebook
or if you're working with a Netflix

380
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,320
or maybe any company data
the big fight next.

381
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,600
Big James If you're working with them,
you have produced every single application

382
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,800
across millions of years,

383
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,480
right?

384
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,320
Invest in mine.

385
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,920
We did not millions of users,
maybe hundreds of users.

386
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,280
We don't have that much of time to invent.

387
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,480
Every single user was named middle name,
last name, similarity, date of birth,

388
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,680
location, nationality,
passport number and love level.

389
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,280
So many things in your example.

390
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,560
Stupid.

391
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,480
Do you have that window of time?

392
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,360
No. Right.

393
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,200
So we're to pass this data.

394
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,840
Simply
keep this data in your one particular

395
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,360
apps migrated from that find you can read
so now need we use sequence for data

396
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,160
sequel is for data
this it's not a my great support

397
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,560
so when you will be actually studying
the database that you will read

398
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,960
the database connection and everything
but I'm talking about one particular

399
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,880
result no data right?

400
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
So what, what would be the data plans?

401
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,480
We can have

402
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,240
sort of options see us to do together.

403
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,480
We can mix them all by.

404
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,080
We get faster in this environment, we can
pass stricter directly picture weight.

405
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,360
Similarly,
we can pass data from our Excel,

406
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,840
find your is correct data, but

407
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,120
all right.

408
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,600
So now the next thing

409
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,560
which we are going to study is excel

410
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,400
in how to read data
from Excel in our scenario.

411
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,160
So we will be writing a function
which will be the global function,

412
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,400
whatever the things that we will going
to provide in this data by,

413
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,440
except why it will read all the data
based on the gives from there

414
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,560
and it will simply pass
through that framework.

415
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,560
Is it clear?

416
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:43,640
So class, it's very easy.

417
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,880
I should

418
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,080
clean and clear.

419
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,920
We have one option simple

420
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,400
with the name clean and clear,
crystal clean.

421
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,080
You get about it.

422
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,400
You do that

423
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,640
well.

424
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,080
Shampoo in progress.

425
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,400
If everywhere it is
now, people are not afraid of this.

426
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,680
This how convenient.

427
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,640
Really? And made in India.

428
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:32,160
So how would we Indians
maybe adopt things?

429
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,840
All right.

430
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,680
Like with Indian, with the right industry.

431
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,200
You see faith.

432
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,120
People from India, the U.S.A.,
they become the CEO of the companies

433
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,840
and the managing director, assistant vice
president, president of marketing,

434
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,720
and so many things.

435
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,200
Right.

436
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,960
Is it Asian?

437
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,240
We read by.

438
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,400
I had never come across
with this kind of information in books

439
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,760
I never meet

440
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,600
says, Well, to be honest

441
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,440
right they look like in like

442
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,960
this piece

443
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,560
to the founder of please
to make him I made in person

444
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,640
yeah look in the category

445
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,840
All right

446
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,360
thanks.

447
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,400
Why I always request my experience.

448
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,000
Stop watching television.

449
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,920
There's some memories.

450
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,640
Right?

451
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,840
So now what we have to do is see

452
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:08,160
if I am going to provide my decided
that it one particular place to tell me

453
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,800
this providing this data in a bite,
it is a part of Java

454
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,320
or non Java

455
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,440
has seen.

456
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,240
My question is if I'm going to provide
Wendy's did that in one particular funny

457
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,520
right to this Baileys Java or non
Java called mystic Mundo Excellent point.

458
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,120
Passing their data in a Katrina
search on is non

459
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,960
java good.

460
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,960
So now.

461
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,760
Nor is it possible that I can be passed.

462
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,200
I can pass my data in from my people.

463
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,280
Excel likes language
possible for particular module.

464
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,400
Speak to them readable by trained.

465
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,520
We can do that to tell me
which position I have in my framework.

466
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,120
The framework.

467
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,880
Now we are starting to break slowly.

468
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,640
We are starting to be

469
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,720
good me which part I have
where I can keep all the non java stuff

470
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
and the resources

471
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,920
and the resources.

472
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,600
Fine. So let me do one thing.

473
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,960
If you see I have features, I have config,
I'm going to create one of the default

474
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,440
and I'm going to create another directly
component

475
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,080
is data

476
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
release.

477
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,880
I created another pool
directly under resources called this data.

478
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,800
The reason behind
this is because in this disaster now

479
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,880
I can have an Excel point
or I can have multiple exceptions

480
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,680
to bring me on the situation
depending on the request.

481
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,240
Because if I keep only one Excel point
here, then obviously it is of no point,

482
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,040
no use because no multiple examples
would make this resource structure

483
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,200
complex way.

484
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,160
So I need to have separate position,
separate

485
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,440
location for separate kind of things.

486
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,680
All right.

487
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,640
And in save this particular I can provide

488
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,160
my Excel point.

489
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,880
It's not going feature on us.

490
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,920
It started will be to expand
independent resources.

491
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,680
You'll see if it wasn't a feature
it should be.

492
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,080
And this under feature it should again.

493
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,520
But it is in the same line
with the feature

494
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,840
I hope is
you know how to read this header,

495
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,360
how we can observe this error
in everything in the project.

496
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,440
Everyone knows it.

497
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,480
Great, simple book.

498
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,880
So now, now remember we have

499
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,960
we have
two versions rate of Excel in mind.

500
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,360
The first is DAW excellence
and second is DAW excellence.

501
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,160
It's these are two for amount of Excel
we all have.

502
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,960
We only started this to excel points
and not only not excellence

503
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,640
and not excellence,
everyone is available this

504
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,600
nowadays in the latest in of this we use

505
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,400
we use which one

506
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,080
majority of bunch we use both

507
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,560
Excel is ex getting

508
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,440
by and so here also with it

509
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,760
I use both nice silver
jack of almost four month clean.

510
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:37,760
So now dart excel s extra
we are going to use here.

511
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,280
Let's see.

512
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,760
But if your Microsoft office
is the older one right

513
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,040
and you guys are using the word Excel
this time to probably point

514
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,400
well, we should change that.

515
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,760
I reached any rate in our code.

516
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,200
So let's start.

517
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,320
Let me prepare one excellent post.

518
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,760
So let me open the exam. Find this

519
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,760
fine line.

520
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,560
So let me create a new exemplar control

521
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,480
and now I'm going to provide I'm
going to provide the data

522
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:21,640
by voting support, check
how to district come up.

523
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,280
You mean this one?

524
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,000
Well, you

525
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,880
simply right

526
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,840
click on resources
and you going to directly

527
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,600
and rate is required
and then it can use this data.

528
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,880
So now whatever the excel
by which we will be using to master data,

529
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,520
we will keep all those exit points here.

530
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:46,320
Okay. So

531
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,760
any name.

532
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,440
Right?

533
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,640
So now, guys,
let's prepare the district of Post

534
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,480
and now to prepare their district
that we must know the scenario

535
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,080
which we would be using.

536
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,680
So let's talk about this scenario first.

537
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
I would go here

538
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,600
even as do I need to pull the enemy
username and password from that particular

539
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,480
base?

540
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,440
Do I need to pass admin username
and password to simply know

541
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,120
it is a one time activity
which I am dealing already with

542
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,120
and paid with my configured properties?

543
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
Fine. So I didn't.

544
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,560
I don't need the password
for my particular

545
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,120
by the data
which I would be using every now and then.

546
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,640
Made for news
and where the value would be.

547
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,120
Large bank. But I need to pass from Excel.

548
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,760
But the upfront rate.

549
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
So now

550
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,040
what I'm see is basically I need to pay

551
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,080
the employee getting

552
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,440
credits, I need to add the employee.

553
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,360
So when I'm going to add employee,
I need to pass force to me,

554
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,320
I need to pass,
I need must be asked to me.

555
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,280
This time we will provide for do but
photograph visible.

556
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,200
All right.

557
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,840
So we will upload the photograph
also will select this create login details

558
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:25,160
will provide username password, confirm
password and then will simply separate it.

559
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,040
Okay.

560
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,200
I hope you understand my point.

561
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,520
What I'm excluding whatever the are
there needs to be able to save me.

562
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,960
We are sending
mostly we are sending within them.

563
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,640
We are sending last two names.

564
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,880
We are sending photo that we are taking on
to create login details checkbox.

565
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,200
Then we will enter the username password
convoke password

566
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,400
and then we will click on Save
and that's how we add the employee.

567
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
This time

568
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,360
it is going to be one

569
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,400
nice.

570
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,360
So let's go ahead and do it

571
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,280
with is.

572
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,440
My ex implied that this is my exit

573
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,480
from external. Right.

574
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,640
Right right.

575
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,800
But real employee. Correct.

576
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,480
So now the first thing I'm going to write
it is mine

577
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,480
forced me.

578
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,000
The second one is mine,

579
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,120
isn't it?

580
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:40,160
The third one is my last name.

581
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,960
Then the fourth look is mine

582
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,800
for the Ram.

583
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,720
That is the remote point. What?
I'm doing it.

584
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,360
Then it would be my username

585
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,680
and the last one would be my password.

586
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,760
So I need to pass anything for logging

587
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,400
checkboxes here.

588
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
No need to pass anything for checkbox.
Norm.

589
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,640
Do you think that we need to pass
or confirm password field as well

590
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,400
in exit by?

591
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,440
Because whatever the things we are passing
in, our password rate does seem to

592
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,240
be killed by something.

593
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,880
The password is well, same as password.

594
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,080
We can use.

595
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,600
But then why do it unnecessarily?

596
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,840
When instructed, we can use the same.

597
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
Right? Exactly.

598
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,600
Now, now let's create

599
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,080
a user security force
name with an impossibility.

600
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,800
So first name will be alone. And Aisha.

601
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,720
So it would be Alicia.

602
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,960
This would be the first name

603
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,400
is always be Ms..

604
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,120
It is no better than this for Milena.

605
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,120
And then the last name will be

606
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,200
the Ms.

607
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:12,080
nine and both have in it
and a definite trade in the last.

608
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,760
So now, even if I mix

609
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,480
it, it could be seen

610
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,640
for a and with the same

611
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,760
photograph part trade photograph by trade.

612
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,160
Just to keep it, keep it like this.

613
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,200
I will tell you what to do
with the photographs.

614
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,920
Also.

615
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,440
Then the user name would be here.

616
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,480
The user name would be should be open.

617
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,280
Excellent volume
if you want to. Sebastian.

618
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,720
You can also you can do this.

619
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,080
No issues, but in the end you will get it.

620
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,800
See the last four words of someone's
name, right is the complete name and

621
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,120
unusual almost.

622
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,160
Really? Yes.

623
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,920
Or one I know.

624
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,200
All right, so now the username.

625
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,560
I'm going to grow a trade, so make sure
that this username must not exist there.

626
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,120
There's white indentured.

627
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:19,440
I provide this kind of name so that
my data don't match their contract, but

628
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:27,880
whenever I meet them, I.

629
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,360
Okay, so now let's take the username
and password.

630
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,400
So here I'm thinking for these below show.

631
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
One, two, three.

632
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,880
The username and password would be

633
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,360
one, two, three,

634
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,560
four, five,
and then the password would be replaced.

635
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,120
It's based.

636
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:54,240
One, two, three, exclamation mark.

637
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,160
Now the only thing remaining here,
the only thing remaining here

638
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,200
is the photograph getting

639
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
selected.

640
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,560
So how we generally buzz
the photograph in know exactly.

641
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,560
But we need to post the bad photograph.

642
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,200
Yes, yes, yes. Correct.

643
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,760
So unfortunately, I do not have any
images of its downloaded post

644
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,880
of images

645
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,920
of the images.

646
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,800
Lipstick. Anyone from here?

647
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,920
Maybe

648
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,520
like this? Something.

649
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,440
So this one

650
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,640
and save the image.

651
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,320
So which format we need GBG.

652
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,440
I will take the GBG one
and let's keep it in the download.

653
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
The name of the image would be badge

654
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,640
image, the image of the Bachelor.

655
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,720
When this very political

656
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,800
not wanted to exist or gbg

657
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,880
image point record
this image is not really.

658
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,520
We have this particular image. Mm.

659
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,720
Nice one.

660
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,760
Someone use this one

661
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,360
is a take it from here.

662
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,160
Right. And

663
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,920
would be listed here

664
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,600
now can you see this actually
would be image behavior on my text.

665
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,440
Always

666
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,240
going

667
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,320
be one.

668
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,400
See this particular part.

669
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,040
Right.

670
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,160
I have to provide the body of this image
in my excellent Right.

671
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,880
So how to get the path of this.

672
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,640
In which case when should I go

673
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,360
this?

674
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,680
Should I go to get the bad

675
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,080
properties?

676
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,200
Thank you, sir.

677
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,960
You see here
it says this is the bottom, right?

678
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,560
This is the board.

679
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,920
And here I have to provide the name
with the extension.

680
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,360
Right.

681
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,080
So we take this particular path from here.

682
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,160
Okay?

683
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,120
No reason why.

684
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,880
Excuse, I.

685
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,960
I have to go in my exit.

686
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,360
I will be used to this particular block.

687
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,000
Is this the complete board
or do any to do anything else here?

688
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,960
This can

689
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,440
slash

690
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,960
image talk

691
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,240
g b g name of the file with extension.

692
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,720
So now if you see I have this
match element image right.

693
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,000
Would really name would simply image

694
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,800
image file.

695
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,840
So this is that image or gbg

696
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,880
copy is part of it.

697
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,240
Right click by the gentleman.

698
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,040
But everyone is not using this right.

699
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,400
So that's why I have to read this

700
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,080
image.

701
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,120
Don't you be? Is this the correct one?

702
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,240
People might be having Windows
eight, Windows eight.

703
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,760
Right.

704
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,200
So for them also, I need to take, you
know, there's going to be a single person.

705
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,960
Everyone can understand the things.

706
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,000
If I'm one of those vendors
of an operating system,

707
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,360
we people who are using
the little logins, right.

708
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,160
They might be having the problem
or the older the problem

709
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,760
now is create looks created.

710
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,320
Thank you, sir.

711
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,360
Do you want to

712
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,760
take another image
for on that user of the scene

713
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,720
which we can use
whatever the other user, any

714
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,920
similarly we can use?

715
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,920
Or do we need to remove symbol for

716
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,000
one, let's take the neutral name.

717
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,120
It would be Silva plus Marina, Silvana

718
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,000
Right.

719
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,480
And middle name is always the best one. We

720
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,080
but the last name be

721
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,000
along

722
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:35,880
the same.

723
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,160
But it would be

724
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,440
said one the near one

725
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,520
right it is

726
00:42:50,520 --> 00:43:01,360
1235.

727
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,600
I can come up with new names. All right

728
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:13,920
then. Once

729
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,560
then after this.

730
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,600
The third employee.

731
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,400
The third employee.

732
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,320
We need

733
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,120
is So the third one

734
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,120
It with the grid is noble.

735
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,520
So Hanna thumb.

736
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,760
So see is going to

737
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,800
observe a nice fade.

738
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,960
Next take this.

739
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,800
So Hanna nice once you look mine only

740
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,280
in as Google using same image for the

741
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,880
oh five.

742
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,520
Audrey let's take this and then simply

743
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,200
we need to change this one.

744
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,840
So I'm changing it too.

745
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,160
So one, two, three, four, five.

746
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,760
For these three employees,
we prepared this data.

747
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,080
Is this correct?

748
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,000
Let's now
the very first thing I need to do is

749
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,280
let's change the name of this particular
sheet from here.

750
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,040
So when I change the name of this sheet,
I will provide this neat

751
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,680
name as I would name as employee data

752
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,920
because I want to add on the employee

753
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,840
copy,
I need to add on the employment database.

754
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,880
So for any question how we prepare this,

755
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,040
this data and let's see,
this file is excellent.

756
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,120
You see it is asking for the text
unless it is asking for the text this.

757
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,880
So I'm going to save
and it's not excellent.

758
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,040
It's fine.

759
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,440
And the name would be it's

760
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,880
taken.

761
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,120
Believe it, Jared.

762
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,360
It was fine.

763
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,200
Would be nice to

764
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,560
remain

765
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,840
documents

766
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,400
or big stock because it would take

767
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,840
yes it is an index to know what I'm doing.

768
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,920
I see. I'm simply copying.

769
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,560
I'm simply this particular part because.

770
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,720
Thank you, sir.

771
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,640
Because this file should be
in my framework, not in my local machine.

772
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,640
But it right now
it is in my local machine.

773
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,400
Does it make any sense
to have this right on my local machine?

774
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,240
No, because tomorrow
my goal will be in the repository.

775
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,120
My good will be in someone else's machine
and then also they will use

776
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,280
the same database.

777
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,560
And we need to make everything
organized, everything unique and uniform

778
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,240
across all the platforms.

779
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,880
Doesn't matter

780
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,600
which operating system we are using,
which location we are in, right?

781
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,560
Every single thing doesn't matter.

782
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,040
But whenever I want to call this data,
I should be able to call this data, right?

783
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,880
So that's why this fight
must be having in my in my favor.

784
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,440
So let's go.

785
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:23,440
And simply copy this particular mine
and pasted under your district apart

786
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,440
instead of like,
see if this does their day job.

787
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,560
Every store in this.

788
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,360
Yes. Okay.

789
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,760
And Eric,

790
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,200
now you'll see I have this

791
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,840
decided that each mistakes
the list explained here available in my

792
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,640
lists.

793
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,960
Anyone has any question in this part

794
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,200
why we kept to this particular example
in the framework.

795
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,640
Is everyone good

796
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,960
for now?

797
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,280
First,
let me give you the overall scenario.

798
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,960
What we are going to do, the function

799
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,280
see, we have four spec

800
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,000
to be

801
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,200
every last name,
be a username and password.

802
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,600
Can you do it again
please. I this to find.

803
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,160
So what you have to do is

804
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,240
go wherever your excel file is available.

805
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,520
Just right
click on add fight or simply copy

806
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,760
the code simply copy the point.

807
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:37,440
When you copy this file from here,
go to your intelligent.

808
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,080
What is your project with your project?

809
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,560
Development Goal input is data
heart rate click and paste it.

810
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,120
Or simply, you can use concurrency control
for Windows

811
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,040
one in command C command we put make once.

812
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,680
All right.

813
00:47:51,680 --> 00:48:02,520
City.

814
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,040
The very human I was giving the name,
I would have given you the name as Koroma

815
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,200
with the Katrina

816
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,000
this take

817
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,880
all right case

818
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,400
so now now here

819
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,880
see these are these are the keys
I have provided in here.

820
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,480
Let's see.

821
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,680
I appropriate the values.

822
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,360
I'm just giving the random values going.

823
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:33,960
Okay.

824
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,080
So did you can see

825
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,400
is this looks like my ex

826
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,640
and we read the data which I'm passing
from makes it like correct.

827
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,640
Is it same or not?

828
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,120
Now just imagine.

829
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,720
Just imagine the concept.

830
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,000
Somehow you have a three for now.

831
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,960
Just there's been a noisy
way is the concept of data table

832
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,160
in detail also

833
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,200
when passing the key and value data.

834
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,200
Also we were getting one map correct

835
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,040
correctly.

836
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,240
We were getting a map
from every single room.

837
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,680
Remember he's coming from here, values
coming from here.

838
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,360
Right?

839
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,600
And when we talk about key
and value, it creates a map.

840
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,360
It creates the map.

841
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,080
But the problem is now the
what is the problem?

842
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,240
The problem is when we were actually using

843
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,320
art or detectible,
right in that detective,

844
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,400
we had all these things be implemented,
we had all these things pre implemented.

845
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,000
But as a pre implemented,

846
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,800
it means the function was already building
function, right?

847
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,600
So we were not actually
writing the function,

848
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,200
but we were simply implementing
the function, calling that function.

849
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,680
But now this, the menu is different.

850
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,320
This time we have to write this function
to parse the data

851
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,320
from our excel by not actual script.

852
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,000
There's what we need to do
on our own coding.

853
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,880
And to do this, we need to put this
how we can create this particular part.

854
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,360
Okay, so first
we have to get onto already this data

855
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,280
in Excel by now we will create
a global function to read that.

856
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,880
It doesn't matter
how many boots I would be having,

857
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,520
how many drawers,
how many columns and everything.

858
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,640
Just one function will identify this
and that function.

859
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,920
We definitely read the data for me
from my cell phone.

860
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,520
I wrote Case,

861
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,040
so we are going to write that particular
function, how things will work there.

862
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,920
That's what I'm going to spend you
now first with this example

863
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,040
and then when we see this example,

864
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,560
then only we will proceed further
and we see how things are going to work.

865
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,800
Okay, Is this okay to everyone? Want

866
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,280
nice.

867
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,880
So now see,

868
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,400
now see,

869
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,160
this rule

870
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,920
is your key.

871
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,920
This rule is your window

872
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,760
bistro again.

873
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,520
Similarly, if one more rule,
it means also one more value.

874
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,760
So remember one thing.

875
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,120
If you observe,
if you can see here, you're one

876
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,720
that is your key is always constraint.

877
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,160
It means your key is on risk
coming from just one rule.

878
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,080
Every name values are changing.

879
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,800
Three would be level d
d 30 defaulting deep.

880
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,200
And so on.

881
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,080
This particular part, this particular part
is always unique, right?

882
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,800
So we can provide the value for this one
and then yes, got it.

883
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,480
And then for every single rule, when will
I treat it will give me the values.

884
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,480
So these will come
always from the same point,

885
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,200
but every time values will come
from the different points.

886
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,280
Great values will come first from B1, B2,
then B3, then reboot, etc.

887
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,040
Based on the number of lines here. Great.

888
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,880
Understood what z 20.

889
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,400
Now here, here.

890
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,720
Let me tell you another important point,
because when this point is clear

891
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,320
how we're going to take the data
right in the form of G in the loop here.

892
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,600
So these will be constant
values would be changing everything.

893
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,600
For the second thing here,
what is more important,

894
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,920
see how to read every single detail
from every single.

895
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,400
Remember, first we have Excel workbook,

896
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,680
what we have Excel file,
we call it Workbook

897
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,520
release.

898
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,720
Now, like I said, in automation,
we have to do

899
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,960
what automation wants,
what we need to do way automation.

900
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,480
Your automation doesn't know
in this workbook you have so many sheets

901
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,520
from which we have to read it.

902
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,280
So the ready force thing,
what we have to do, we have to look in

903
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,920
this workbook in our code.

904
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,840
To my point,

905
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,200
we have to locate this workbook
in our code.

906
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,840
Second thing in this workbook,
if you see a lot of small

907
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,360
sheet names available here,
we're deploying the name code employee.

908
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:36,200
Did the grade, so we have to build hey,
going to this particular workbook

909
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,480
and in this particular workbook
go into this particular worksheet

910
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,240
because my need to be

911
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,680
I can have the same kind of data
in some other worksheet as well.

912
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,280
But your code will not want to read
anything like this, right?

913
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,560
We have Google what to read,
what part you need, read this.

914
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,320
So first we will locate the workbook.

915
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,280
Inside
the workbook will locate the worksheet.

916
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,360
Inside the worksheet
we will provide this rule

917
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,520
where we are having all the keys,
all the keys played,

918
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,320
and then we will provide the data
for all the rules.

919
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,320
We will be having all the values.

920
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,600
So remember for reading the data,
for reading the data

921
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,800
and getting the physical number
of rules we have a function

922
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,400
for getting the physical number of rules.

923
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,280
How many rules are available?

924
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,600
We have the function,

925
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,080
but we do not have a function,
but physical number of columns.

926
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,520
For physical number of columns,
we do not have a function.

927
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,400
So how we will do it,
I will tell you in the function.

928
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,960
But right now I'm
just giving you the overview.

929
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,240
Things which we are going to implement
is first we will identify

930
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,440
Workbook three,
then we will identify worksheet in their,

931
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,480
we will read the data for all the keys,
all the rules in terms of math.

932
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,720
So now, now see, when I have this

933
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,880
particular key force to read

934
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:08,400
because it is part.

935
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,560
So now if you see
my first rule is return me first

936
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,480
met one great map, one using the key.

937
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,240
And when you read
from this particular room

938
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,520
next time in the next position

939
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,840
when it will return the values,
it will return the value from this rule.

940
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,600
So my map will also be having
key and value.

941
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,800
It will also be have a key
and then the correct.

942
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,280
Is this correct?

943
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,040
So every row is returning one
particular map.

944
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,040
If it was returning one particular map
or not,

945
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,400
big keys always seem
like value is different for us.

946
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,440
It is coming from one second.

947
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,160
It is coming from we would.

948
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,000
Yes, correct.

949
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,880
And every rule is returning the new web.

950
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,920
Now, what is the problem here?

951
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:04,320
If I don't stay this map anywhere

952
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,680
next time, if it returns the new map.

953
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,720
So this map will overwrite the old.

954
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,520
I think

955
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,600
if I look see then what would happen

956
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,360
if I take the over rate simply replaced.

957
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,000
So before getting and reading data
from this, they can rule.

958
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,520
First I have to get this map

959
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,120
and then I have to add this member state,
this map somewhere.

960
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:37,680
So how we will read,
we can take map 1.17 and then map two,

961
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,560
then see, then map three,

962
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,040
then see if and so on and so on.

963
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:44,840
Read this.

964
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,520
So when I see this same option,
it simply means

965
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,000
I need multiple maps in one place,
one map to remember.

966
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,080
It's one depending on the dataset
I will do, provided

967
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,840
I read all of these maps there.

968
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:00,840
Right.

969
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:05,560
So to get all of these maps in one place,
which point of collection

970
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:14,640
I can use here from Java.

971
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,400
Yes, we can use here list read.

972
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,680
What we can use here is

973
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,960
we can use this list.

974
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,680
So in this list of map, right

975
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,920
where I would be having de comma value,
but it is free trade.

976
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,680
And then I would be using your classic
ABC function.

977
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,800
Something that gives
this is something work

978
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:45,280
my data table is A to
Z on my list of map connect.

979
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,320
So now what I'm doing, I have a list

980
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,160
and in this list I'm having multiple maps.

981
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Correct. And making multiple maps.

982
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,760
And this particular function,
if you observe closely your data

983
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,600
when you go into your deductible,
it is actually returning us.

984
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,160
This particular mark

985
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,200
in your data

986
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,240
when you see it is returning as this,
but only data table is maps

987
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,680
in your suitcase.

988
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,880
My detective is returning

989
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,000
the same function
what we are going to implement.

990
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,440
So this is specifically for detecting,
but we are going to create this function,

991
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,680
a global function, to read
any kind of data, any value from any cell.

992
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,520
In my example

993
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,720
is everyone,

994
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,640
should we go ahead
and write this function?

995
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,160
Right?

996
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,520
So now this one function

997
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,760
will be applicable to my entire framework,
right to my implement.

998
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,440
The same function will work.

999
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,320
So tell me if I have something
that is applicable to my airplane work.

1000
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,840
And this is a part of Java
because I with great Java codes

1001
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,640
where we keep all of these things

1002
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,440
common, we

1003
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,600
is in utils

1004
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,520
correctly,
we're getting a better job of this.

1005
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,760
We will keep this particular thing. Right?

1006
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,680
So when I go utils right lives, click here

1007
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,840
another find and the name of this file
would be a new class

1008
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,360
the name of the new class would be

1009
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,680
excellent.

1010
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,080
The the name of this fight,
it would be Excel.

1011
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,640
Really great case.

1012
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,520
So the code read my excel by
I will write this

1013
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,040
code here industry

1014
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,000
in the spirit of one

1015
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,240
point

1016
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,880
should be in this function

1017
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,640
is everyone with me

1018
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,440
doing or support as you said.

1019
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,760
So I will follow

1020
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,760
public

1021
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,280
stating

1022
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,440
like open exit.

1023
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,720
The very first thing.

1024
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:22,080
What I have to do is I have to open the
my category.

1025
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,400
We have them the right.

1026
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,200
So first I have to open the excellent
right to expand.

1027
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,280
Unless if I open the fight,
how would I read the data?

1028
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:35,360
I can't read so I will not pass anything
hardcoded again,

1029
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:40,120
I will provide the fighting party
of frames, but I the file

1030
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,280
fight board for my exam like this.

1031
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,520
Very very well.

1032
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,320
We'll call this particular matter.

1033
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:53,200
I will provide this, but wherever
I want to read this particular thing.

1034
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,440
So it is here.

1035
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,840
How many of you guys still remember
for the data to open the fight?

1036
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,600
The go to open the fight

1037
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:03,960
lights.

1038
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:04,920
Come on.

1039
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,120
We have done it. Then millions of times.

1040
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,880
The new fight

1041
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,600
the stream to
We are passing this particular

1042
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,640
file input stream right is

1043
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,720
it should ask for a fight,
not form exception.

1044
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,320
So we put it here. Correct.

1045
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,760
And then here
I'm going to raid for my vulnerable.

1046
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,080
But it would be my workbook.

1047
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,160
I'm taking rate of workbook
which can begin here

1048
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,720
from my user model.

1049
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,480
This particular one, what textbook?

1050
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,760
So from being I'm taking this or argy

1051
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,920
bargy 0.0 is

1052
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,200
is don't use at a moderate or workbook.

1053
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:55,640
All right.

1054
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,840
What is

1055
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:03,320
equal to which I'm speaking here
is equals to new X.

1056
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:08,520
This is the workbook X is the workbook.

1057
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,560
Now let's make sure here.

1058
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,840
Okay, fine.

1059
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,760
Excess baggage clause. Fine.

1060
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,280
Let's get the get across here guys.

1061
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,320
Whoever is using whoever is using

1062
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:25,360
Excel as X fight, you have to call X.

1063
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,560
This is F workbook

1064
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,520
and whoever is is in not excellent fight.

1065
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,080
You have to call edge.

1066
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,840
Is this

1067
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,520
workbook

1068
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,240
Silva You have all the files, right?

1069
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,040
So for different files
you have to call different marks.

1070
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,360
The first one is acceptance of workbook
is for the ones

1071
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,880
who are using not a 6.1,

1072
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,200
but if you're using not explicit plain
Excel point, then be able to use Edge.

1073
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,000
Is this one you see?

1074
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,000
You'll see here you

1075
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,120
will get the edges of visible

1076
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,320
rate again.

1077
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:05,600
Book one

1078
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,080
edge bit of this if

1079
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,560
workbook can you see guys

1080
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:17,000
we are getting this page
is this F workbook also does this

1081
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:21,560
for the ones who are using
you're not Exelis by appointment

1082
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,200
since majority or I think everyone
is using a six by appointment.

1083
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,520
We are using x.

1084
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,120
This is one book.

1085
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,720
Is it clear to everyone?

1086
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,480
Fine.

1087
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:40,680
So this is my this is my post function
that I have three days.

1088
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,640
This is my post function.

1089
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,840
After this
I need to write another function nicely.

1090
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:52,280
I open,
I open my excellent multi excel played.

1091
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,480
What is the next task?

1092
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,840
I have to identify which sheet
and would do work upon

1093
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,360
getting

1094
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,480
that it would sheet and working in.

1095
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:08,040
If the fight is not X,
then the end of it x and the end of will

1096
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,760
no flag.

1097
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,160
We can't take the extension. Right.

1098
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,520
It should support.

1099
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,080
I mean it depends on the Microsoft Office
word and which one you use.

1100
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,840
If it is in 1997 it will not support.

1101
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,120
Don't extend it six
If you're using this 2003 in the later

1102
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,960
one, it would support or take to six

1103
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:41,880
point.

1104
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,680
Now the next thing is
we have the particular sheet

1105
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:47,040
here.

1106
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,680
I'm going to write the function
public element is why

1107
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,680
I'm making one of this functions
the statement.

1108
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,480
What is the reason behind this one?

1109
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:01,720
Making this function
is treating invalid functions.

1110
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,000
Yes, because I'm going to use
all of this functions in other classes.

1111
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,680
I know which class I'm
going to read the data so I can read it.

1112
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:13,840
Anyway, this data way
I'm making, this functions as static.

1113
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,080
I don't need to create
the object of the class.

1114
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:19,080
And because this function now, I'm
not returning anything.

1115
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,720
That's why I'm making them void

1116
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,440
reusable.

1117
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,480
Great, ma'am.

1118
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,680
So now here also

1119
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,600
they will provide sheet because today
I'm busing the data from one sheet.

1120
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:34,280
Tomorrow I might be passing the data from
some one of the shooters would be erased.

1121
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,440
So sheet again belongs to your or not

1122
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:42,160
Apache or boy or assistant user model.

1123
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,560
So from here
I would provide this sheet equals

1124
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:49,400
to in this book don't

1125
01:05:50,480 --> 01:06:01,120
look don't get that

1126
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,560
What is the issue here?

1127
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,120
That is why I'm not getting this book
object

1128
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,760
any any data.

1129
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,240
Yes. Correct.

1130
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,320
This is not my variable,
which is look and see.

1131
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,440
This is middle my one function.

1132
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,840
So the accessibility
is limited to one particular method.

1133
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,360
So what I have to do,

1134
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:31,680
I have to define it on a class level
because I will be using it

1135
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,200
in different methods.

1136
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,440
So let me do it.

1137
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:36,600
I'm going to make it this technique,

1138
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,120
this workbook as book,

1139
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,840
and this time I read deleted from you.

1140
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,000
Now see, in the end it is called

1141
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,440
similarly sheet.

1142
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:53,840
I will be using everywhere,
so I'm going to use this sheet as sheet.

1143
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,400
And here I will remove this part.

1144
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,600
Now see,

1145
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:05,640
it is working on what we did this time.

1146
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,080
Make sense?

1147
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,600
Gates First I opened the template,

1148
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,920
then I got the sheet name in this sheet.

1149
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:18,960
Now I am going to read how many Jews
I had right there from visual.

1150
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,240
I'm going to get what kind of data.

1151
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,720
So now let me write another function here.

1152
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,280
The function is public

1153
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,440
static.

1154
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:33,240
I'm seeing in is

1155
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,320
why I'm singing for the to count

1156
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:44,120
is why I wrote
the return type is in digital

1157
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,120
in this particular function

1158
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:49,360
because it will return
the total number of rules

1159
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,760
and then it will return
to the number of rules.

1160
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,960
It will be in the digital form
like there's when I'm writing.

1161
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,440
It is in digital function,
so it will return me.

1162
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:03,720
What it will eliminate is a function
called from this sheet.

1163
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,720
It will return get

1164
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,840
physical number of course

1165
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,800
retains this function due
to physical number of rules will return

1166
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:17,000
How many rules I have in particular sheet

1167
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,840
is this being

1168
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:30,880
every one, each

1169
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,080
let's now.

1170
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:41,360
Next thing I need is a public static

1171
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,080
and now I need gained

1172
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,200
columns. Come

1173
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,680
this time.

1174
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,040
This time I'm having a problem

1175
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,240
because there is no function
that I have in Java which returns

1176
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,520
the actual column column for example,
the physical number of columns.

1177
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,920
That is no method. I don't have anything.

1178
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,840
So here I have to rely on my rules

1179
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,480
right from which rule
I am getting the data.

1180
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,480
So remember

1181
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,080
how to get the actual column
going to every rule.

1182
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:19,240
One example here, this is the Ruby

1183
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,760
here.

1184
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,920
It gives value, a new value value, right?

1185
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:33,200
So when we go into this rule,
the last the last number of column, Right.

1186
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,840
Which is a physical column.

1187
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,320
Physical column. Right.

1188
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,000
So we will see every single scene in

1189
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,880
last number of physical scene,
which would be easier to read.

1190
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,360
It means the total number of columns
that are relevant.

1191
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,760
For example, how many physical
since I have available in digital?

1192
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:51,360
One, two, three, four, five.

1193
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,960
So how many columns I have in this room?

1194
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,600
Five.

1195
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,640
Similarly going to this look again?

1196
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,400
Five and so on.

1197
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,240
Understood how I'm going to read it.

1198
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:06,240
We're going of columns.

1199
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,880
So here I have to rely,
I have to rely on my

1200
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,080
first row index right?

1201
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,000
I have to rely on my windings.

1202
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,960
So from here
I will see what it will return.

1203
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,000
It will in my first

1204
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:21,760
sheet.

1205
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,200
Don't get

1206
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,240
it through here.

1207
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,280
I will pass my drawings.

1208
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,600
Don't it says get

1209
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,040
physical. No at all.

1210
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,800
Since it physical since.

1211
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,520
This is the function.

1212
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,160
These are the two functions
which will return my overall

1213
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,560
total rules, scope and total the cops.

1214
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,360
So for any question is reduce

1215
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:02,440
opening the exam by opening the sheet
in Excel point with sheet

1216
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,880
taking the total rules
and then taking the total columns

1217
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:07,480
so far.

1218
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,560
Is this understandable to everyone?

1219
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,920
What I'm doing

1220
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,960
now, whatever

1221
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,120
the things we are seeing here, right,
you're seeing as of now,

1222
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,160
it is returning me
draws, counts, sheet name by name.

1223
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,200
But in the end I need to work,

1224
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:30,240
I need values, I need to read the data
which is available in every drawer.

1225
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:33,760
And but in this still screen,
I need to read that data.

1226
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,760
So how can it read the data to me
right under the function of late standing.

1227
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,760
And this time I'm my function name is

1228
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,560
Gate Gates to

1229
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:51,120
why I make this gates as a stream face.

1230
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,800
I am it is a string because the data
which I'm widely

1231
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,960
available in my excel,
it is available in which forward

1232
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,960
I'm passing User name Password.

1233
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,800
First name William last name.

1234
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,920
We are this in which former days
stream forward.

1235
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:06,800
Right?

1236
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,000
So when I'm passing this
in the spring forward,

1237
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,320
I'm going to take this data

1238
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,440
as a return of this particular function
industry.

1239
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,280
Fine.

1240
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,440
Let's go ahead and do it.

1241
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,080
So first, what I would write,
I would write in integer.

1242
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:26,760
First thing is going to the part.

1243
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,120
So take index Second thing is

1244
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,840
go into the column parts
of 30 column or index.

1245
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:39,200
It means in which rule, which column
you're going to one rule, one column

1246
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:44,800
it reads once it contains in that still
we will assume that it will read the data.

1247
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,680
So let me read your return in this sheet
straight

1248
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,360
post to get through on this little index.

1249
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:53,600
Don't get

1250
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,680
sent from here.

1251
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:59,440
And in this state based on the column
index,

1252
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,840
don't do the last thing

1253
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:06,760
because now we got the rule,
we got the steel in this.

1254
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:11,600
And what it the data
I'm having convert it into a string.

1255
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,880
So to convert something into string
that is a method in Java we use

1256
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,240
which is don't do is bring
that can would simply table

1257
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,320
string for

1258
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,280
all the here on the Java

1259
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,760
the easier case which is

1260
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:37,040
getting whatever we want not.

1261
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,320
Is there anyone who has any question
in this part what we are doing.

1262
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,760
I hope I'm I'm expanding it
in your satisfaction level.

1263
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,000
It is that anything
if I'm missing, do let me know

1264
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,120
what you do in 43 point.

1265
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,520
So I'll see you See what I need?

1266
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,240
Let me open myself.

1267
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,760
This is my exit point.

1268
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,400
I got this rule.

1269
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,880
I. I got this column.

1270
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,840
For example, second row, first quarter.

1271
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,000
I got this identified.

1272
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,720
But still it is of no use.

1273
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,280
If I don't read this data correct,

1274
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,440
I have to read the
data which is available in every state.

1275
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,680
So this one, the highlighted one is in
this one is also said.

1276
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,800
This one is also state.

1277
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,480
This one is also saying
how we can identify the state,

1278
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,000
identify the state based on rule
and quantum mechanics.

1279
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,280
So for this one, the rule is two,
column is one,

1280
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,600
this one rule is two, column is two,
this one, the rule is three columns one.

1281
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,160
This one rule is three.

1282
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,600
Column is to install, right?

1283
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:47,120
So here in my function
I'm passing groupings in column index

1284
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,680
to identify a bristle
when I'm taking in the single center

1285
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:54,720
data, which I'm heavy,
I'm converting it into string.

1286
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,320
So this function is returning the data
from every single cell

1287
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,440
and converting the people that spring upon
which so in the to find the important

1288
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:08,520
thing
is the string from every single set. Now

1289
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:19,560
nice so far right

1290
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:24,800
raw ingredients spaces are really good.

1291
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,920
Maybe not

1292
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,400
opening the excel by cinnamon,

1293
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:34,200
cumin, seeds, oil, everything being played

1294
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:38,320
good shit, row, count, column count.

1295
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,240
So data, everything we now know actually

1296
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:45,920
starts from year grade
with Hollywood movie.

1297
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,960
Which one?

1298
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,600
Now we are going to make
Every single rule is a map.

1299
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,920
We will create the function
where we can see

1300
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,640
that every single row
is returning me somewhere.

1301
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,080
After taking that the in the map,
I will it in the list

1302
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,320
and then again I will do it in a digital
and then the little

1303
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,360
and then another little thing.

1304
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,080
So this is what we want to do now.

1305
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,560
So just one function
I have to write just one function.

1306
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,320
Should I write the break rather than

1307
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,520
I think we should continue.

1308
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,560
We should continue right now.

1309
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,480
Okay.

1310
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,760
Yes, yes, yes.

1311
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,440
That's what I'm thinking.

1312
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:34,240
Before, if the rate before rates
that let's hook it.

1313
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,400
I'm going to write in

1314
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,640
public

1315
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,480
static

1316
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:46,080
all use all format

1317
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,080
and where every map is returning me

1318
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,160
string in terms of key
the string in terms of value.

1319
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,680
So I am writing this function excel

1320
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,120
in two

1321
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,760
Excel and to list my

1322
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,320
client launch was important

1323
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:17,120
is very case exiting to list map rate.

1324
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:20,200
So from the Excel,
we are taking the data in the form of MAP

1325
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,800
and we are putting
all of these things in the list.

1326
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,040
That is the thing we are going to do
that is not good.

1327
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,520
Things
don't take this much attention rate days.

1328
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,760
I see a lot of people
not commenting though

1329
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,400
because everyone is busy in typing
till there is just a five lines of code.

1330
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,080
This code can not make you afraid of
anything.

1331
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,520
Don't worry,
we are doing it and we will do it.

1332
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,080
I will experiment with great stuff.

1333
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,440
I know, I know.

1334
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,480
I'm When I say that you're not yet
you always ready And I have just seen.

1335
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:51,120
Don't pay any attention. All right.

1336
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,960
Good extras. It's very easy.

1337
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,760
We are going to do
it now. See, first thing news

1338
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:57,840
is there.

1339
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,800
Discord will be reusable,

1340
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:01,320
y'all.

1341
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:03,760
Whatever things I'm writing,
it is reusable.

1342
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,000
There is nothing which we can not reuse.

1343
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,160
That's why we call it framework.

1344
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,320
Those things is for getting the data
from the Excel.

1345
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:11,880
Find.

1346
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,880
First, I need to identify the Excel points
so to to get the Excel value

1347
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:19,040
we have any function.

1348
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,080
Do we have any function
to get the accent by

1349
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,000
students?

1350
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,480
Yes, we do have Open Excel.

1351
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,240
We do have open Excel. Great.

1352
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,320
And it is asking for five months. So fine.

1353
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,320
I have to provide this.

1354
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:40,960
I have to provide this here
argument is string file, but comma,

1355
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,720
the string next thing will be mine

1356
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,280
sheet

1357
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:52,160
shooting rate.

1358
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,720
So it would be my file.

1359
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,080
But in this Excel fight in this sense,

1360
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,280
by any token
do we have any function to get this unit

1361
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,720
is do we
have any function to get the sheet name.

1362
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,440
Come on

1363
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:15,000
you just we do have that function called

1364
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,800
get sheet and here we are operating me

1365
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,160
see how easy it is.

1366
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,160
This function is reading the sheet name.

1367
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:29,280
This function is going to return the file
name read file pop.

1368
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,280
So now my file is opened,
my sheet is open.

1369
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,440
In that sheet,
I am going to get the data right.

1370
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:40,440
So first the first thing,
let me define my function call list

1371
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,160
inside this list,
because I'm going to prepare for

1372
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,520
this is the preparation

1373
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,760
screen as a user.

1374
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:53,400
Name the string also as a key
and as a value right here.

1375
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,440
I'm going to give it C as my

1376
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,280
data is equals,
but I'm going to make it in the edit list

1377
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:02,560
for which

1378
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:06,520
reason we are making it Grace
because we are going to get the maps,

1379
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:09,400
we are going to get the maps
from every single row.

1380
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,320
Those maps we have to add this list,
so I am putting it in the list.

1381
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,280
Okay.

1382
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:15,720
Okay.

1383
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,280
That's why we made this a list.

1384
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,320
As of now, we just declared it.

1385
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,760
We are not using it as of now
if someone has any question

1386
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:27,160
why we declared it,
because we are going to receive the map

1387
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:31,440
from Excel by at every the map
we have to add in the list.

1388
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,160
All the maps declare it as of now.

1389
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,440
Fine.

1390
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,920
Let's go ahead

1391
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,520
because I'm going
to write the code for Outlook.

1392
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,280
So my outlook is going to define the over

1393
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:48,440
all complete rules
that I would be having to read.

1394
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,280
The keys.

1395
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,800
My outer loop, which I'm going to write
here,

1396
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,720
is going to define the keys that I have.

1397
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:55,840
Fine.

1398
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,240
So what I'm going to do here
see, I'm going to write a for loop.

1399
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,640
I'm going to make a look.

1400
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:05,480
And this loops the integer.

1401
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,920
The rule is equal one

1402
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:09,400
line.

1403
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,480
There's always a concern.

1404
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,320
One this

1405
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,120
and then simple.

1406
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,600
This rule

1407
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:20,320
book.

1408
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,800
When the rule counties less than three,

1409
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:28,360
then I'm seeing here again Great rule

1410
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:34,080
plus last plus, plus, plus.

1411
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,880
Now see,
because I'm going to read the data.

1412
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,920
I'm going to read the data.

1413
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,440
So my zero through my zero
draw is already there.

1414
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,720
Is I one this excel
find this excellent line if you see

1415
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,120
So my business is already booked
it is already constrained.

1416
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,160
I don't need this right now.

1417
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:59,160
I need the data from the hospital
and then swans one so on.

1418
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,320
Right to explain digitally.

1419
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:04,880
I buzzed equals to one.

1420
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,680
Those are indisputable.

1421
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:10,040
I am passing two is equal to one
and then two and I would be getting right.

1422
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,440
So rule count minus one.

1423
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:15,480
It is the last rule in the last rule
one by one because increment of greater

1424
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,560
I would it.

1425
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,040
So it will read the data for all the rules
from here this particular function

1426
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:25,320
let's cross further
while I am reading this.

1427
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:29,600
I'm reading this I'm going to write here
Creating a map.

1428
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,480
Creating a map. Every rule.

1429
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:36,520
Now see this If I am in the force total,

1430
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:41,120
if I'm in this or actually rule one,
it means second rule.

1431
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,760
If I in this rules
principle one not as good

1432
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,960
index is always a spread from zero here.

1433
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:51,400
But rule one we're taking
because my values start from little one.

1434
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,400
Okay, now here, see,
when we are in the rule one,

1435
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,320
we are getting here,
that's also an index of keys.

1436
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,240
We are getting values from the rule.

1437
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,240
So when we are ready and value both.

1438
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:06,360
We have to prepare and we have to create
a map right for every rule.

1439
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,000
That's what we are going to do now.

1440
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,360
So first

1441
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,880
I'm going to write a map, root,

1442
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:19,440
key and value out of the string forward
or not, based on case

1443
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:24,160
what key and value is available

1444
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,520
in my string one.

1445
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:28,760
And I'm going to link the hash map here,

1446
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:32,000
which is why we use

1447
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,120
Java clusters of link is,

1448
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,240
but it maintains the order.

1449
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,720
The order of insertion maintains.

1450
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:48,560
It means if I am going to read first row,
it will maintain it the first place only

1451
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,560
and then second place, third place
and so on.

1452
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,680
It's using the link map. Yes.

1453
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,480
Right.

1454
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,960
You see everyone understand?

1455
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,280
Everyone knows already.

1456
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:02,200
So I do need to teach you, but a mini code
you can write on your own days.

1457
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,800
No issues.

1458
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,640
Then the next thing is I'm going to write
the looping

1459
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,000
through the values.

1460
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,920
Looping through the values.

1461
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,920
Oh, on

1462
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,720
I. No, sir.

1463
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:25,440
But if you do everything,
then what would I do with C?

1464
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,120
We are going to create a map.

1465
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:31,480
So not inside this map and I'm
going to add the value for a string.

1466
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:34,680
Read string as a key
and spring as a value.

1467
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,920
So first we are taking fine.

1468
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:40,360
I don't have any issue for that,
but for getting the data

1469
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:43,640
from every single from every single set
we have to write it.

1470
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,800
Let's write another for loop.

1471
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,960
This for loop
is under my previous or loop.

1472
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,000
Make sure. Let's

1473
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,280
make sure

1474
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,160
this for loop is under my
this particular follow

1475
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:04,920
character correct.

1476
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,440
So now I'm going to write
for this particular one.

1477
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:12,080
I'm saying
integer column is equal to zero.

1478
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,120
Then you to my appointed a column zero
when I provided

1479
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,080
rule one

1480
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,440
you had nested for the print case.

1481
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,240
I have related column zero but draw one

1482
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,960
Earlier time I provided

1483
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,880
Yes because doesn't matter read
which rule we are in.

1484
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:35,680
We will always read the values
from the first column to columns.

1485
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:38,000
You know what it means?
First column three.

1486
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:41,880
So my first name is all relevant
in first column, middle

1487
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,800
name and second columns of next zero
means first column.

1488
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,840
That's why I'm waiting here.

1489
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:53,120
And then my column is going to
define is defined by total column counts,

1490
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,680
which is coming from my group
in which you am right, guys.

1491
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,520
And then simply I'm putting it
here, column,

1492
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,120
column plus plus again, increment operator

1493
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,080
again increment.

1494
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,400
Any issue in understanding
this particular line

1495
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:23,120
index,
my column count is depending on room rate.

1496
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:28,160
It is so how many rows
I have based on these rules

1497
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,200
I will use

1498
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:34,480
before my code.

1499
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:39,280
Nice line.

1500
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,720
So now see here, read
my column count is depending on my rules.

1501
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:48,120
Railways doesn't matter
how many rows I have.

1502
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,000
My This particular part
will read all those rules

1503
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:55,000
and based on these rules
my this particular function works

1504
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,120
and will give me the data
from every single column great

1505
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:03,880
progress.

1506
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,000
Now in the map.

1507
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,880
In the map, I'm going to put the data

1508
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:13,240
so when I use what method, it
simply needs to be the use Mr.

1509
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,720
Dot egg to build something in the list.

1510
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,120
We use map
to put to add something in the map.

1511
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,280
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

1512
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,960
My concepts of governance
is very, very sympathetic.

1513
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,720
Is this correct?

1514
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:28,400
Thank you.

1515
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,200
Thank you so much.

1516
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,400
Next, I will ask if I have any problem.

1517
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,800
You got it right.

1518
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:39,560
So now here in this map,
right in this map, I'm going to put what

1519
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,120
simply stated
that there is the use of this case.

1520
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,920
I'm reading from one here already.

1521
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,040
I need only send to read to select
from every single column.

1522
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,760
So let me call this particular my text.

1523
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,600
It is asking for two things row
index and column index

1524
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:01,080
and I'm providing
intentionally through index zero.

1525
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,400
What does it mean? The row index is zero?

1526
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:09,640
I wish I knew the meaning of this function
and column index coming from my column.

1527
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,360
It coming from my column

1528
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,400
in case.

1529
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:19,160
So when I provide this data rule

1530
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,520
in data
zero and column index, it means what

1531
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,120
it means, what it means.

1532
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,520
This is my key.

1533
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:29,400
Now I need a value.

1534
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:33,560
So for value, simple go here rule column

1535
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,040
will come on.

1536
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,680
Now let me explain you
this particular function,

1537
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,280
how this function will work

1538
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:03,440
now sees my memory
density and value correct

1539
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,200
categories.

1540
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:09,240
Display display is something important and

1541
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:12,640
when I write this line

1542
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:15,440
map don't put right this matter.

1543
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,640
Look straight here.

1544
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:19,640
See, this is my key and this is my value.

1545
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,720
When I see zero, it means my force.

1546
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,120
See, consider.

1547
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,400
This is my exactly.

1548
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,680
When I see rule zero, it means only this.

1549
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,640
We not

1550
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,160
only destroyed it and when I say column

1551
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:39,720
counter,
if column is zero, so zero zero, this one

1552
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,960
zero comma one, this one zero, comma two,

1553
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,400
this one, zero three, this one.

1554
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,840
That's how it will read all the keys

1555
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:53,160
from this particular line or not.

1556
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,680
And that's good how we are getting
the keys from this function.

1557
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:00,240
Now see this second after comma,
we get values.

1558
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,200
So in values are requesting zero.

1559
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,360
I'm passing through.

1560
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,640
This row is coming from me
and from the rule one.

1561
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,600
It means that it is starting from
it is a starting.

1562
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,880
Come on, it is starting from here.

1563
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,000
Right? So it is giving me all the rule.

1564
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:17,320
Count one by one,
one by one, one by one column control.

1565
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,400
So coming from here

1566
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,840
because it starts from zero,
so one by one, one by one, One by one.

1567
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:23,400
Right.

1568
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,840
So next time I go from here, value
over from here.

1569
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,960
The next time I go from in value,
I go from here.

1570
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,680
Next time I go from here and value
I got from the right place.

1571
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:43,280
When I got this value in value,
it is making one simple grade again.

1572
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,760
It is also creating one map.

1573
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,160
It is also creating one map and so on.

1574
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,920
That's how my function will work.

1575
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,120
Any issues?

1576
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:55,600
One understanding this,

1577
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,600
what we are doing
and the issue in this part, students

1578
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,480
noise.

1579
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:03,240
Good.

1580
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:08,720
So now, now, now see here so far
what we are doing,

1581
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:14,480
we have created a map for every tool,
but it forced migration.

1582
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:18,840
This particular part will return me
forced to read

1583
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:23,000
this particular will return was to map
not all the maps.

1584
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:25,120
One maybe one thing too.

1585
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:28,160
When I got this one map, remember
I told you

1586
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,560
we have to speed this map at one place.

1587
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,920
If we don't save this map,
then what would happen?

1588
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,160
My map.

1589
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:40,520
My next map, which is upcoming that will
override this particular menu correct.

1590
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,640
And then I would be able to utilize it.

1591
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:45,040
So first, I have to keep this map.

1592
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,200
I have received this map somewhere.

1593
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,120
Let's do it.

1594
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,320
How would I do this?

1595
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:53,760
So the moment I complete,
I dreamed of the first map.

1596
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,880
I'm going to put in the E mystery data

1597
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,600
and to add something in the list,
there is a method called list mode.

1598
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,920
What I'm going to add simple.

1599
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,800
So now what map?

1600
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,000
One map collected from here.

1601
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,360
Added here.

1602
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:12,720
Sacred map collected from here.

1603
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:15,360
Added a third member collected from here.

1604
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,840
Added here.

1605
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,560
Great

1606
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,240
place.

1607
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:27,320
Is this correct?

1608
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,320
And then?

1609
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:33,240
Then once I'm done with all the maps,
it means up out the outer.

1610
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,640
This to this.

1611
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:38,080
For once I'm done with all the keys,
all the rules on the columns.

1612
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,800
I've read every single thing.

1613
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:43,080
And in the end I need this function

1614
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:48,400
to return me the list down the list, the

1615
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:55,320
rest so far.

1616
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,560
So far. Understood.

1617
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,520
Can you please repeat line
number 68.3 display?

1618
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:01,720
That was good

1619
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,680
looking by non

1620
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,400
see my this particular key

1621
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,680
in this particular row with returning map

1622
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:17,320
if. I got a sacred map from here
and I didn't see this map.

1623
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,760
Then what would happen?

1624
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,560
This map will override
the value of this map

1625
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,360
that it.

1626
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:28,280
So I don't want this condition what I want
when I got this map

1627
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:32,800
first I will save it somewhere
and then I will see a second one.

1628
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,240
And then I will see the third one
and so on.

1629
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:44,200
Great.

1630
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:48,000
I will tell you how split the split

1631
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,960
thinking everyday
director equals of Whenever we do,

1632
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:56,720
we get this great type of opportunity
right to work in the industry.

1633
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:02,040
So as a as an architect trade, what
I generally follow is here in the company,

1634
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:03,840
it's not a leap.

1635
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,960
See, my job title is something else.

1636
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:08,120
When my responsibilities
are something in trade.

1637
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,920
So they are also me also human being,
and we could not

1638
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:13,600
equal it.

1639
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,840
Every single thing that we use it often

1640
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:20,040
see it is a one day in the case.

1641
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,360
This is one name.

1642
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,680
You don't have to do it every day.

1643
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:24,120
Once you

1644
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:27,560
created a new framework in every industry,
all these methods.

1645
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:31,360
So most of what we generally do
is basically we follow this particular

1646
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,440
big thinking speed, think,
what does it mean

1647
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,280
if there is a big task
or big role responsibility

1648
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:42,600
you have or so many technical aspects,
just bring them in shorter pieces

1649
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,320
and when you spread them in shorter
pieces, just identify

1650
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:52,800
which are very important, which is
you will be using every now and moment.

1651
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,440
Memorize all of the things you see.

1652
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,560
Okay, I can go from here and there.

1653
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,760
Then don't memorize those points,
memorize those.

1654
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:01,240
That happens

1655
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:05,120
Just so next time we just open
those appearances, you will get the data.

1656
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,000
Put it here.

1657
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,320
Your work is done.

1658
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,360
Right. So there.

1659
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,160
So you need to perform this.

1660
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:13,720
You can save this building, implement.

1661
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:14,600
We can save this

1662
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:15,840
move.

1663
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,240
Just copy copying your front.

1664
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:20,280
There also is a best thing you can do
listening,

1665
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:21,760
right?

1666
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:25,320
So it's not only about writing
this particular function, it's

1667
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,640
a long term,
great long term tip I'm giving you.

1668
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,800
If you want to really survive
in the industry,

1669
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:35,080
remember the moment you speak up, right?

1670
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,560
The moment you speak of the moment

1671
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,480
you introduce yourself,
it shows your thought process,

1672
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:45,040
it shows you thought process.

1673
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,520
Everyone is doing the same thing.

1674
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,560
I need to talk about the waste
because the trade of the industry

1675
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,080
is also doing the best.

1676
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:54,960
No static. No.

1677
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,640
Sorry.

1678
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:58,960
Yeah.

1679
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,600
Many of them
are going to be up in one hour anyway.

1680
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,000
We are going to complete the class

1681
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,720
or we're going to be okay
if we take a call after the class.

1682
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:11,800
And I will tell you this,
but the way we generally do,

1683
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,840
every class way
they share the link with everyone

1684
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:18,120
sort of enjoying their rate
and we can work this fine days.

1685
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:22,200
So far, we created this function
to read the data from the X,

1686
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:25,920
and by now the next task is
we are going to use

1687
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:30,120
this particular function
in our scenario right?

1688
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,440
So let's take a break first.

1689
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,640
And after the break,
we take the scenario into consideration.

1690
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,360
Okay?

1691
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,960
Okay. Let me do it
first. Don't want to break anyone.

1692
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,320
I go from Marina.

1693
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,400
I have to do it first

1694
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,920
in line number four or in three lines.

1695
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:10,520
You better.

1696
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:10,880
Yeah.

1697
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:14,880
Review part is okay,
but I hope everyone understood this point.

1698
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,880
Everyone understood this
what day spent and there is nothing

1699
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,760
which you guys are not understanding.

1700
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,160
Is there anything if you guys think that

1701
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,960
you should explain Once again,
I will explain.

1702
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,040
Once again, I don't have any right.

1703
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,360
But I need from you.

1704
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,040
I need to hear this from you.

1705
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,560
It's all good. It's

1706
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,280
all right, guys.

1707
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:40,480
Let's take a break for maybe 15 minutes.

1708
01:37:40,480 --> 01:38:40,160
And after 15 minutes.

1709
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:40,880
All right,

1710
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,160
so now we have written this function
great.

1711
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:49,640
We have written this function
so that we can read all the data

1712
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:53,400
from our Excel like correct allotment.

1713
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,440
Yes. So I know you're here.

1714
01:38:56,440 --> 01:39:00,120
You are also in the last two weeks
for the president elections.

1715
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:01,960
I'm going to declare
three names this time.

1716
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,040
By now,

1717
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,960
let's use this function
in our feature way.

1718
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:11,280
Okay? How we can write this.

1719
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:14,360
So to add in the feature value
in any employee,

1720
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:17,320
I will come here
and I will write a scenario.

1721
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:22,560
So my segment you name would be any

1722
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,720
employer from X

1723
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,520
rating, employees from x someone.

1724
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:36,960
So now my frequently shown
is already available in the books.

1725
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:38,320
We all know this.

1726
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:43,080
We don't need to write to use the speech
elements, application or anything else.

1727
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:47,080
The time user clicks on, add employee,
but then you build their time

1728
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,440
user place on an employee button. Right?

1729
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,160
We had this function available
already in our recruitment

1730
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,560
days.

1731
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:58,400
We already have this functions
in every growing part time.

1732
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,200
So now after that we have to write.

1733
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:02,640
So I'm going to write your rent

1734
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,200
user and

1735
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,640
keep my employees from.

1736
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:14,760
We have a good way to get it from

1737
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,720
simplifying using

1738
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:22,880
Excel by using sheet

1739
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:27,880
and redefine

1740
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,600
employee.

1741
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,760
So I am C user X multiple employees
from Excel.

1742
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,760
My rate how we can provide the data

1743
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:42,240
for the x
and by the but I that using the sheet.

1744
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:44,960
So now see it one time.

1745
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,400
How many should I'm going to use in once
in any one day?

1746
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,920
How many should I can use

1747
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:54,680
only one sheet.

1748
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,440
Right.

1749
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,760
So isn't it a good idea to provide

1750
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,760
a sheet name here for the employee.

1751
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,400
Repeat,

1752
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:07,920
this is my sheet
and if I'm going into how I got the sheet.

1753
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:12,760
BMC If you go here, right,
this is your data that we provided,

1754
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:16,320
not this one.

1755
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:21,520
This is your data and you'll see the name
of my sheet is employee data, correct?

1756
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:27,360
Is this correct?

1757
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:30,000
So here I am providing my sheet.

1758
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:33,800
Now everyone knows already
if I provide something

1759
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:37,440
like this, it converts can do

1760
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,160
it converts it into even.

1761
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,160
I created this definition.

1762
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,680
It converted into what

1763
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:45,240
is print grade.

1764
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:49,760
So let me do it for exudate liquid,
do it for exalting.

1765
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:54,280
I put this exalting way because I want to
create the is to be finished.

1766
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:57,120
Fine going to smoke this time

1767
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:59,800
and change this dashboard data

1768
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,240
so to exceed day grade

1769
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:06,680
and then make but is equal to true.

1770
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,200
So when I write it is equal to true.

1771
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:14,720
It simply means this time
I'm going to create a step from here right

1772
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:19,760
now, see what happens.

1773
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,840
It give me this step.

1774
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,080
It is using this particular string.

1775
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:29,320
So my sheet name, my sheet name,
I will be passing through string.

1776
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:34,280
Let me pull into my post.

1777
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:35,520
Let's make it

1778
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,800
now. We're going to an employee steps.

1779
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:42,360
And here, here
I am writing this particular function.

1780
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:47,360
Now see how I'm going to use this function
posting

1781
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,880
In this particular function I need to.

1782
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,440
And the first one is my final name, right?

1783
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:57,440
And the second one is my sheet name
should.

1784
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:01,760
Name is coming from my feature point,
but still file name is a problem.

1785
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,880
Finding is a problem.

1786
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:07,200
So first let me handle this.

1787
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:14,360
The spring is sheet and putting the handle
this is issued me now.

1788
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:17,640
See that is what I'm going to do here.

1789
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:20,640
Tell me which function we have,

1790
01:43:20,640 --> 01:43:23,320
which function we have,
which we use to read the data

1791
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:25,680
from the Excel.

1792
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:29,640
Reading this is my explaining
which function we have to use

1793
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,560
to read the data Open Excel sheet
go through the column.

1794
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:37,520
Government will consider data
or excel in to list which function

1795
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:45,280
the open exit

1796
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:46,880
alone.

1797
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,240
I can see opening
signal already used. Yes.

1798
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,200
Whatever. The font.

1799
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,280
Yes. Correct.

1800
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:56,520
Whatever the functions
we defined the line number 49.

1801
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,440
We used all those functions here
to make one global function,

1802
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:05,040
and that global function
is excel in the list map.

1803
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:08,040
So this one, we need this one.

1804
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,040
We need didn't

1805
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,920
because we made it already static.

1806
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:16,520
So what I can do,
let me go into my employees

1807
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,160
and here I'm reading

1808
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:23,960
from my accelerating point Dart

1809
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,200
excel into list.

1810
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:27,960
Correct.

1811
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:30,240
And here it is asking for duty.

1812
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:32,040
The most is file book.

1813
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:34,640
And the second one is should me. Right.

1814
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,840
So now let me put the sheet name forced.

1815
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:41,120
It's a sheet and it was coming from here.

1816
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,560
So you see sheet name is coming from here.

1817
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,800
But my file but I can take

1818
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,600
from it.

1819
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,080
This is the book.

1820
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,320
Now let me revise your concept.

1821
01:44:56,480 --> 01:45:00,520
Remember we provided the file,
but it is today's financing.

1822
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:03,160
But remember for configured properties.

1823
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:04,320
Then we were reading.

1824
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:04,680
Right?

1825
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:07,080
Let's see in config properties

1826
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:11,480
we provided the file, but from here
you see this is the dynamic file.

1827
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:17,360
But so do we have any particular with root
package?

1828
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,000
Yes. Correct.

1829
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,760
So do we have any particular place
in our framework

1830
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:24,480
from where we can pass this book,
the part of the file?

1831
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:29,280
Do we have anything in our dream
because of no

1832
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:33,560
strings?

1833
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,320
Constants, Constants for hard.

1834
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,360
You see, in constraints,
I provided the path of my file

1835
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,680
for configured properties.

1836
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:47,480
Remember system
don't let property user build it for you

1837
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:51,000
and it gives us the path
it returns the path of the project.

1838
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:54,600
And in that project,
whatever the things we have read,

1839
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:58,440
whatever the file we want to call,
we can call this finally here like this

1840
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:03,600
there is one.

1841
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:08,280
Remember this button or tell me.

1842
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:10,560
Yes, but we have to create a path for it.

1843
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,040
So that's what I'm saying.

1844
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:15,400
Do we have any place in our framework
from where we can provide the path?

1845
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:18,480
So, yes,
we do have this place straight, see

1846
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:21,920
under this resources grade,
and that is resources.

1847
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,720
We have this data line.

1848
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:30,360
So let's go ahead and do this.

1849
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:34,080
I'm going to write this
and I'm going to provide is as

1850
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:39,360
is due to the school

1851
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,400
my grade.

1852
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:45,240
So when I said instead of file
but here I'm having a world record is

1853
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:49,320
did not slash here
I'm having the venue called

1854
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,080
the test data

1855
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,360
and each part is not fixed.

1856
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:58,680
It is

1857
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:03,520
correct.

1858
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,920
Now school. Where did you find me? Fast

1859
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,520
in this part

1860
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:18,960
because we just started
after the pre printing.

1861
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:22,080
Before the break, everything was pointing

1862
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:32,080
nicely, made really fast.

1863
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:36,280
Okay, let me repeat it again.

1864
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,760
Yes, yes, yes. So here, here.

1865
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,880
Remember this particular part, right?

1866
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:45,600
Remember this constant class
that we have from here?

1867
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:50,400
We are passing all the file,
but the things which are constants.

1868
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:51,640
So what are constants?

1869
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:53,520
All the file parts are constant.

1870
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,360
This part of, the files.

1871
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,640
I'm not going to change in the framework.

1872
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,480
And if there is something,
we have enough beam

1873
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,680
which is constant to provide those things
in our constants.

1874
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:09,320
The but super confident properties
by the configuration file.

1875
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:13,920
But we provided using system
the property grade.

1876
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:18,000
If you guys watch this video,
then you must be having the knowledge

1877
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,440
of this part, this the stronger
object property, any user dot bigger

1878
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:25,560
it returns the part of your project

1879
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,800
when it returns the part of your project.

1880
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,760
Inside this project, you get this data.

1881
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:35,800
When you get this,
do not grade, it returns the complete.

1882
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:40,240
But similarly for this data
also I'm doing what systemd

1883
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:44,440
did property user data which is returning
the part of this project.

1884
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Inside the project I am writing this RC

1885
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:51,640
based resources and the resources.

1886
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:57,320
I have this data under this I have this
particular byte, this data batch element

1887
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:01,440
X in a sixth grade case.

1888
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:06,760
So now this part will return the file
part of my excel sheet.

1889
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,440
Now clear for constants

1890
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:18,120
everyone knows good at any

1891
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:32,280
right now is what I'm waiting on some is

1892
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:38,360
great.

1893
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,800
Now let's come here
it is asking for two things.

1894
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:47,280
See now I'm doing is it is asking
for two things and it's accelerating.

1895
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:51,400
Bit C is the most display
but so now I can take this file.

1896
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,960
But from here from my

1897
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:58,560
constants don't is data mind

1898
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:02,360
and the sheet name
I am getting from my feature like

1899
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,960
this particular partly

1900
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:08,000
this particular.

1901
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,560
What I'm doing is

1902
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,280
now C

1903
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,600
here when I'm calling this particular
part.

1904
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:16,600
Right.

1905
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,960
It is returning me what

1906
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,240
it is returning me the list of maps.

1907
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:22,440
Right.

1908
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:27,240
So let me back here
to handle this list of maps,

1909
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:31,280
which is having my keys and values
in the stream form.

1910
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:34,400
And I'm going to provide this is new

1911
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:42,720
drawings, mostly what I'm doing.

1912
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,120
I'm reading accelerating class.

1913
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:47,600
From there,
I'm calling this particular function,

1914
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,240
which is calling
this particular is data file,

1915
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:53,160
but it means my excellent file
and in this sheet.

1916
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:56,320
So this particular part is returning me
the list of maps.

1917
01:50:56,520 --> 01:51:00,800
So to handle this list of maps, I call
this particular object new employees.

1918
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:06,040
Now, my new employees will be having
this particular object, new employees

1919
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:09,960
going to be having all their data,
all their data from, the exam point,

1920
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:15,000
and now this data
I can use via migrations In my script,

1921
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:21,960
I find our industrial

1922
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:27,680
grid.

1923
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:33,480
Now see what I'm going to do here.

1924
01:51:33,480 --> 01:51:38,040
I'm going to write this function ten days
if I'm having something right.

1925
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:43,040
The object, for example, new employees,
which is having multiple values

1926
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,720
and I want to fetch
every single value from there.

1927
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,760
What is the best approach in Java?

1928
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,640
We have to edit all the things,
delete all the things.

1929
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:51,800
One by one, one moment

1930
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:54,960
I did a

1931
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:58,680
simple thing, so let me use it.

1932
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:03,240
We use I bring that
I had written on this particular map

1933
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,320
where I am having this dream

1934
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:12,160
come the string which is returning
every key and value for me.

1935
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:17,160
So let me rate
idea is equal to which I written

1936
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:21,960
for which object
then going to use it for my new employees.

1937
01:52:22,160 --> 01:52:25,680
Part matrix.

1938
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:26,960
Any confusion in this code?

1939
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:31,440
I'm going to break the map rate
based on keys and values using Trigger.

1940
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:35,760
And this is the list of maps
I'm having new employees

1941
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:39,240
replace.

1942
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:42,640
Now the limit is what is the force
to matter to be called When we use article

1943
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:46,480
which look
we have to use here for a trigger.

1944
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,360
They look very good

1945
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:51,200
inside of a look
which method has next or next

1946
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:57,120
idea behind has next method we use.

1947
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:00,960
What this method does gives
my views as mixed method.

1948
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:03,440
What is the function of

1949
01:53:14,280 --> 01:53:15,040
it? Returns

1950
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:18,800
true builder type elements
one by one, one by one.

1951
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:21,360
It is checking right?

1952
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,480
It is taking one by one.

1953
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,280
Whether we have a new,
whether we have a new way

1954
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:27,040
that we have a new builder time
we have values.

1955
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:30,600
It keeps returning the operation moderate.

1956
01:53:30,600 --> 01:53:31,560
That's it.

1957
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:34,920
His next
method is the first part of my iterator.

1958
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,200
Fine.

1959
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,600
Now, when I came inside this

1960
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:44,480
because I know I'm going to get my keys
and my spirit in the form of map.

1961
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:50,840
So I'm writing a new map to make this
new map for work for every new employee.

1962
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:53,280
I'm getting one key in one way, right?

1963
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:57,960
So I'm reading here idea
not next for every single one.

1964
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,840
Now, this map

1965
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:04,080
map new employee is having key and value

1966
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:08,000
for one employee again
for one employment again for one employee.

1967
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:11,920
Read every single thing
I'm getting one by one into

1968
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,240
my mind is beginning
right at this point here First

1969
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:24,240
with the B and

1970
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,000
it returns

1971
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,320
when the key

1972
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:41,080
employee's right

1973
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:44,240
So now now what I'm going to do
is see first,

1974
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:48,480
whatever the data I'm getting in this map

1975
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:52,560
and I know I'm having keys,
I know I'm able to keys.

1976
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,400
Tell me what gives me here.

1977
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,440
We have force name in middle name.

1978
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,360
We last name.

1979
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,760
You have so many other use relays.

1980
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,920
We have so many other keys
which we can use here

1981
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:08,240
right?

1982
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,800
Getting my point done.

1983
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,080
So now let's use all these keys.

1984
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:15,280
Let's use all this keys from here.

1985
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:18,760
So first what I'm going to do,
I will take this both memory,

1986
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:20,400
the name and last name. Three locators.

1987
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:24,000
I already have like three locators
I already have.

1988
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:28,600
So let me copy
three locators and let me pasted here

1989
01:55:29,640 --> 01:55:30,560
this three locators.

1990
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:33,280
After taking this data from here
like this.

1991
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:37,520
Now, I wrote of this post number,
so how can I get this new

1992
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,040
I can get this value from here.

1993
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:43,080
I'm writing here

1994
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,960
map new employee.

1995
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:50,840
Don't tell me guys which material to use
to get the key from the map

1996
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,560
for this
to add to get something from the key.

1997
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,600
Get to my right.

1998
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,440
Get What is the key.

1999
01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:00,920
My first name

2000
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:01,720
is this correct?

2001
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,800
My keys Postman

2002
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:09,240
the my point to one

2003
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,880
point similarly similarly

2004
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,640
for the name

2005
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:21,440
also I will get the key
course immediately.

2006
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:25,760
I will show you where are these keys
available and last name.

2007
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,680
Also I have a key to go Go ask

2008
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:33,320
now see let me open.

2009
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,040
Right. Excellent.

2010
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:37,160
Right. As said, this is my first name.

2011
01:56:37,160 --> 01:56:38,080
This is my middle name.

2012
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,240
This is my last name.

2013
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,600
Right? This.

2014
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:43,160
And you see, these
are the keys available on my first title.

2015
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:45,960
So when I have all these keys
in my first room,

2016
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:49,480
I'm calling this keys map new, right?

2017
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,640
This map is aiming all that is target.

2018
01:56:51,640 --> 01:56:53,040
So what? It returns.

2019
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:57,360
It returns the value against these keys
one by one.

2020
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,440
Correct.

2021
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:01,200
So in the first iteration,
in the first iteration,

2022
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:05,440
false name, whatever the Muslim, whatever
the last name, whatever the middle name,

2023
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:08,520
I'm going to get. Fine. Right after this.

2024
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:11,640
The next thing which I'm going to do
is see what I'm going to do.

2025
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:14,320
I'm going to write

2026
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:18,880
here first,
let me open the application that we have.

2027
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:21,560
We need to look of this particular
path or not.

2028
01:57:21,720 --> 01:57:22,560
Did me

2029
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:30,920
guys, do we need

2030
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:39,480
look again or not?

2031
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:40,720
Let me take this. Look at that.

2032
01:57:40,720 --> 01:57:48,320
Yes. Do we need to without locator,
how can we pass something?

2033
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:51,760
What I can see and I only

2034
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:55,960
can we see a negative value based?

2035
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:58,200
Let me take this idea.

2036
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:00,520
Let me go here
and I'm going to rank there.

2037
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:04,440
And let's see

2038
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:06,680
for both equal to driver

2039
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:12,360
or find any element by dark by D
This is the photo.

2040
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:13,400
Fine.

2041
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:14,600
And then I'm working here.

2042
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:18,120
Photo for CINETIS And here

2043
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:20,600
in this case, I'm going to pass more.

2044
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:23,880
I'm going to pass from my map

2045
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:29,080
door again Gate And what is the key?

2046
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:31,640
The key and the key
which are provided here.

2047
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:32,960
So what is the key?

2048
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:35,520
The key is photograph you see

2049
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:37,400
right.

2050
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:40,520
Whatever this building drop baggage claim

2051
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:42,840
or to

2052
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:48,840
frame.

2053
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:54,520
Now see these three things for things
the enforcement rate

2054
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:58,880
middle name last name,
photograph should be first click.

2055
01:58:58,880 --> 01:58:59,520
Yes. Yes.

2056
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:00,960
I'm coming to my notebook.

2057
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:01,960
I'm coming for that one.

2058
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:09,520
Good.

2059
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:11,560
Now you'll see here

2060
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,200
if I go in my application, read C

2061
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,960
first name with the name
last in photograph I selected.

2062
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:21,280
But let's say I create log in details
checkbox is not

2063
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,200
available, is not selected.

2064
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:25,160
Will I get the username?

2065
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:26,600
Yeah, but I will do that.

2066
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:29,280
Will I get the username password face? No.

2067
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:31,760
Right. I won't do this.

2068
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:35,280
So first what I have to do,
I have to select this checkbox

2069
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:40,320
or I have to check whether this select
the box is already selected or not.

2070
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:44,280
If it is not selected
then only I will select the checkbox

2071
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:51,000
right.

2072
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:51,600
Fine.

2073
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,080
So now let me take
the expert of this particular

2074
01:59:57,720 --> 01:59:59,160
check log in

2075
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:01,600
again. I need to block.

2076
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:02,800
I will pick.

2077
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:06,480
So after after sending the photograph
here, I'm writing one

2078
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,840
if I see whenever I think if

2079
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:14,280
my right

2080
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:15,520
influenced

2081
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:16,680
reality.

2082
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:17,640
He made

2083
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:23,040
chunks in sequence to

2084
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,400
try to find.

2085
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:29,000
That was my idea.

2086
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:36,960
So if my checkbox store is

2087
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:40,440
if not checkboxes,

2088
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:41,880
then I set this exclamation.

2089
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:44,040
It means the opposite grade.

2090
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:47,160
If I don't use this,
it means checkboxes selected.

2091
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:49,320
It will check, it will be selected.

2092
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:53,200
If I put this exclamation,
it means it means check and performs

2093
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:56,160
the operation when it is not selected.

2094
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,600
Just opposite.

2095
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:01,560
Have you guys remember if you guys
understood this point, exclamation means

2096
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:07,320
opposite simple trade so not checkbox is
selected simply checkbox is not selected.

2097
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:11,400
So if it is not selected
then simply do one thing to.

2098
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,800
Go start, click

2099
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:15,160
next.

2100
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,840
And that's put the logic What I'm doing.

2101
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,120
If my checkbox is not selected,

2102
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:23,840
the checkbox simply

2103
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:26,680
reads.

2104
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:29,160
And now after, after clicking

2105
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:32,600
here, after clicking here,
what is the next thing we have to do?

2106
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,960
We need all these points.

2107
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,240
We need your username, your password.

2108
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:39,440
You can confirm password
and everything. Great.

2109
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,800
So let's go ahead and check
if I select this particular one.

2110
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:46,520
It opens username password confirm
plus what point.

2111
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:50,040
Take this locator one by one

2112
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:50,640
exists.

2113
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:52,680
User name

2114
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:53,560
Client

2115
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:55,480
element.

2116
02:01:56,320 --> 02:02:02,480
User name as it is to.

2117
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:05,160
I'm typing it fast
because we all have this code right?

2118
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:07,640
You just need to confirm this. This. Okay.

2119
02:02:07,640 --> 02:02:10,160
The second thing is

2120
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:13,080
password user password

2121
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,800
element

2122
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:22,480
constant, which is impossible trying,

2123
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:25,560
but trying to find elements.

2124
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:28,080
I think this is the password.

2125
02:02:28,600 --> 02:02:33,120
And the third one
I'm going to get is confirm password. So

2126
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,600
this would be my origin password.

2127
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:38,320
I'm going to get my

2128
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:41,760
password, my

2129
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,680
verbatim link.

2130
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:46,680
I shall try the compound

2131
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:49,120
password is equals prior word or

2132
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:55,480
element by got a D
it should be my password.

2133
02:02:56,160 --> 02:03:00,320
Well forced constant encoding, correct?

2134
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:01,720
Correct.

2135
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:07,000
So now C first username don't send a keys.

2136
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,840
You take the incoming
from my new employee.

2137
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:13,200
Don't get

2138
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:16,920
and then this would be mine username.

2139
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:18,600
Correct. I need to check the keys.

2140
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:22,440
By the way,
this gives username and password to you.

2141
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:23,840
Capital B

2142
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:26,160
This would be my username.

2143
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:29,040
Similarly for password or

2144
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:31,720
same keys.

2145
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:34,200
Again, make it

2146
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,120
so it would be my password.

2147
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:40,160
And the third thing here is my

2148
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:42,360
password there.

2149
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:47,160
All I need to do to do this
again, it take from here or

2150
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:49,440
not, I might.

2151
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:53,320
Again, I'm passing the same key
password in control password Also

2152
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,640
put the places to redeem.

2153
02:03:56,640 --> 02:04:00,640
Plus the way we can consider this,
we can add

2154
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:05,480
one more in the exit fight with the name,
confirm password or password.

2155
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:08,200
And then also we can pass the symbol
there.

2156
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:09,480
Also, we can do it.

2157
02:04:09,480 --> 02:04:11,640
It's completely up to you guys.

2158
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:16,880
It's completely understood.

2159
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:18,880
If you want to do it, just do it.

2160
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:23,000
I don't have any problem since it's just
we need to save our time.

2161
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:25,080
I'm doing this here

2162
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:27,200
now. One more point.

2163
02:04:27,200 --> 02:04:28,080
So far. So far.

2164
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:31,360
Tell me any question in this first memory,
the name, last name,

2165
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:34,600
photograph part,
which we are providing here.

2166
02:04:34,600 --> 02:04:36,760
And then after this username, password

2167
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:46,040
control, password,
everything is clear to everyone.

2168
02:04:46,040 --> 02:04:48,040
Now just look at this part first.

2169
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:49,800
Look at

2170
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:52,840
this point it says invaded by the error.

2171
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:54,280
Namely,

2172
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:59,880
it is taking one more thing
verified and an employee can you see this?

2173
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:00,760
Everyone

2174
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,400
assumptions be able to use mine.

2175
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:18,800
But how that is the main questions.

2176
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,520
There it is the main question.

2177
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,800
Think midway. I'm just committing.

2178
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:25,640
I'm just writing a new could

2179
02:05:26,240 --> 02:05:29,440
see this after entering username password,
click on Steve.

2180
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,360
But not everyone knows.

2181
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:32,200
Everyone knows.

2182
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:35,360
When we're clicking on Steve, we're Done
apparently conceived

2183
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,440
but it will take me which please

2184
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:41,400
guys again remember it is also a part of

2185
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:44,000
it is kind of similar to my table

2186
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:48,240
and remember in their data table
what was happening in Detective.

2187
02:05:48,680 --> 02:05:53,040
It was just executing one
simple step again and again.

2188
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:53,720
Right?

2189
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:57,600
So there we had to click on option
and they were options.

2190
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:01,520
Remember this part we did this eight
employment and again, we have to click

2191
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:06,400
guys.

2192
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,000
Remember this part we were doing

2193
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:15,440
right?

2194
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:20,480
So first let's take this particular part
from here clicking on their button.

2195
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:21,360
Also, we have to do

2196
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:25,080
and then clicking on an employee
would then let me show you how this works.

2197
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:28,640
Then we translated
insert the look around the room.

2198
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:29,600
This part

2199
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:46,080
inside of confines.

2200
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:47,960
So let me do it

2201
02:06:48,240 --> 02:06:49,200
first.

2202
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:52,160
Let me simply aim for the save button.

2203
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:56,680

first.

2207
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:14,320
So far, so far, what I'm going to do is

2208
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,880
let me come here for some data.

2209
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:20,440
Make this

2210
02:07:21,520 --> 02:07:22,520

this is waiting for my

2212
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,920
password is to be worksheet

2213
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:36,440
one briefly for

2214
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:51,120
exclusion.

2215
02:07:51,120 --> 02:07:54,240
See? Well,

2216
02:07:55,360 --> 02:08:00,640

02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:39,280
Going to see this employee everyone.

It is by default,

Right?

2225
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:49,120
So now see this employee
and just look at this employee

2226
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:53,560
in when I'm clicking on Steve Button,

2227
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:57,280
when I'm clicking on Steve, when it is
coming to this particular report,

2228
02:08:57,600 --> 02:08:59,880
it is coming to this particular part
and you see

2229
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:14,040

Here you see employer is available here.

2232
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,160
Also, we want

2233
02:09:32,760 --> 02:09:37,240
right now now two ways of verification.

2234
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:40,800
First thing in homework,
what you have to do

2235
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:45,960
when you come to this particular part,
when you come to this particular bar,

2236
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:51,000
next thing
do one thing going to employee list.

2237
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:53,760
Once you go into

2238
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:56,680
employee list, you'll see
all the employee's available here.

2239
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,560
Can you see these?

2240
02:09:58,560 --> 02:09:59,840
All the employee's available?

2241
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:03,880
How many of you is in this?

2242
02:10:03,880 --> 02:10:04,200
Again?

2243
02:10:04,200 --> 02:10:08,120
I'm giving you their task, this task C
And then here

2244
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:11,640
you have to provide the employee ID
value, right?

2245
02:10:11,960 --> 02:10:13,360
You have to provide the employer

2246
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:17,040
ID which you got, which you will get
while creating the employee.

2247
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:22,120
So enter this employee search from here.

2248
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:24,320
Then you actually search from here.

2249
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:27,240
You will get this data in this particular
part, right?

2250
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:29,480
You will get this data in this law here.

2251
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:34,240
And when you are getting this data
in this line from the table in directions,

2252
02:10:34,360 --> 02:10:38,280
you have to verify that you're
getting your first name, middle name

2253
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:42,400
and last name, same as the previous one,
one you have added.

2254
02:10:42,600 --> 02:10:46,440
You are having the same plus name
with elements in each industry.

2255
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,480
What you really want

2256
02:10:52,080 --> 02:10:52,920
Everyone in

2257
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:56,760
this room, this is their task
you have to do.

2258
02:10:57,360 --> 02:11:00,520
Now let me go back to my employee page

2259
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:03,600
after clicking on Steve
and what it is doing

2260
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:07,920
after clicking on Save Button again,

2261
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:11,640
it is blending into one page
where I can get this employee option.

2262
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:14,640
Oh, there are multiple steps, but yes, I'm

2263
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:17,840
going to do it.

2264
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:20,120
So now after clicking on See it were done.

2265
02:11:20,280 --> 02:11:21,880
It is taking me again.

2266
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:25,280
It is taking me again to the employee
beach database

2267
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:36,440
days.

2268
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:38,400
It is taking me to a template.

2269
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:42,360
So again I will click on it employment
and then it will go on and on and on.

2270
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:44,480
Trade goes there.

2271
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:47,800
So we can correct

2272
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:50,080
so far in this particular portion.

2273
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:53,640
So far in this particular part,
do you have any question this part?

2274
02:11:53,640 --> 02:11:56,280
See, again, I'm repeating here we started

2275
02:11:56,960 --> 02:12:01,160
we put a greater to the values
from the Excel

2276
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:05,240
which we are getting in the form
of list of maps trade.

2277
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:09,680
When we got this list of maps,
I came here, I did the value.

2278
02:12:09,720 --> 02:12:14,040
I provided one map because it returns
the gain value for every employed.

2279
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:17,960
It means the data from every single rule
which we are getting.

2280
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:20,520
I'm putting this data here in their name.

2281
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:21,560
It is checking.

2282
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:26,400
Once I have all the data of my supply
available in this particular object.

2283
02:12:26,720 --> 02:12:29,760
I am calling this particular object here
based on the keys.

2284
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:34,800
Whatever the keys I have,
I will provide this kizzire retrace

2285
02:12:35,160 --> 02:12:39,200
when I provide this key here
and I provide the data, it will send

2286
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:45,200
all the values against this keys
available in the exit right in here.

2287
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:49,440
I'm doing this and after adding
all of these details I simply click on

2288
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:50,600
say button.

2289
02:12:50,600 --> 02:12:53,760
When I click on
Save it returns B on would be to it.

2290
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:55,240
I will point this to an employee.

2291
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:56,800
But again, why?

2292
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,240
Because my background is work.

2293
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:02,520
One day it's going to work one time
my hook is going to work one day.

2294
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:05,320
So I will be on this page from here.

2295
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:07,800
I have to see the workaround.
A workaround is to

2296
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:11,760
click
on an employee again, go to that screen

2297
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:15,320
and one more employee, one more employee,
one more like this.

2298
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:17,760
And this tool

2299
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:22,320
is this and just what everyone,
just a handful of ways.

2300
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:27,000
Just a hint for you, for associates,
what you have to do right.

2301
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,200
An employee I.D.

2302
02:13:30,120 --> 02:13:32,960
like by

2303
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,280
creating the employee while adding them.

2304
02:13:36,280 --> 02:13:39,680
When you're adding the employee there,
you will get the employee great.

2305
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:42,920
And you get the employee
from there. Right.

2306
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:45,240
What you do after adding the employee

2307
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:49,040
third group in the employee list,

2308
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:51,600
search it in the employee list.

2309
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:54,080
Once You search it in the employee list.

2310
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:57,160
We need to give the employee nonmember
with the code.

2311
02:13:57,920 --> 02:14:00,000
With the code, you can do it.

2312
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:01,720
It is in even the code.

2313
02:14:01,720 --> 02:14:19,320
Should I tell you how to get this
via code?

2314
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:21,880
Now there is a method written
so the name of the member

2315
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:26,240
did attribute so against the entry
would just do it instead of work

2316
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:27,440
so there won't be a pending

2317
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:29,120
definitely

2318
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:32,000
loophole if the post and giving it
this will work.

2319
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:32,880
Right.

2320
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:34,840
And then after that, great.

2321
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:38,400
What I will do tomorrow
I will load this here in the note with it.

2322
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:42,240
List a link everyone try
and if someone is panicking

2323
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:45,760
or if even if you guys are able to do it
or not do it, I will do it.

2324
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,760
Get in the people okay.

2325
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:49,480
I will do it in the class.

2326
02:14:49,480 --> 02:14:51,520
The verification part

2327
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,040
already

2328
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:02,040
in line

2329
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:06,000
101, we put shooting.

2330
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:11,000
So this is coming from your feature file
you see in this feature file disconnecting

2331
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:22,440
and it's like

2332
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:26,040
shred on this code now goes post

2333
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:29,720
started in the employee list.

2334
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:32,280
You or do do

2335
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:36,840
all the links

2336
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:55,600
with text from the

2337
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:12,360
Oh no

2338
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:16,560
see you got the image.

2339
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:17,200
Can you see this

2340
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:21,000
and go to the image to our jpg.

2341
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,760
Right see the employee created images

2342
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:30,560
there.

2343
02:16:30,560 --> 02:16:37,160
Know what is happening.

2344
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:39,480
Unable
to look at the element statement. Fine.

2345
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:45,200
Because my execution was so fast,
I didn't put the weight in between there,

2346
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:50,520
so I find no issues.

2347
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:52,760
Let's do it one more time.

2348
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:56,040
Let's do it if we go here

2349
02:16:56,640 --> 02:17:01,280
and of the clicking on saved one,
I would do provide the vertical trade

2350
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:09,920
or sleep minimum for this.

2351
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:13,200
And then after adding implement and again
I'm going to provide

2352
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:16,280
its third JP

2353
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:18,840
the same one trader sleep for 56

2354
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:22,840
that is getting it.

2355
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:25,680
I provided the weight
when putting the rating.

2356
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:31,080
Let me open this file somewhere.

2357
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:31,720
Right.

2358
02:17:32,840 --> 02:17:35,200
And then I'm going to change this. Name

2359
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:42,800
one one. So

2360
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:46,960
you would probably close

2361
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:52,120
one. Now

2362
02:17:52,120 --> 02:18:16,320
let's run it again. Now.

2363
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:21,240
See it got the data for the first one.

2364
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:22,440
Username exist.

2365
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:24,480
Fine, but that's okay.

2366
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:26,480
We are going to click on the second one.

2367
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:30,440
Second data came right.

2368
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:31,200
Great.

2369
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:33,600
Noisy third one click.

2370
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:36,680
When they're internet data

2371
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:39,320
for the third one, upload the images

2372
02:18:40,320 --> 02:18:42,160
working plain username exist.

2373
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:43,240
That's why

2374
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:47,760
it's closed

2375
02:18:50,040 --> 02:18:50,920
names

2376
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:54,240
data.

2377
02:18:54,240 --> 02:19:01,600
It is taking from excel file or not
can be.

2378
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:04,200
It is taking the data
from your existing file only.

2379
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:07,160
We are putting all this data
in the actual filing.

2380
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:09,480
We are using this data there. So now.

2381
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:12,080
Now see my this function right?

2382
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:17,120
Even if I have been fi it didn't lose
ten rules in columns, 15 columns.

2383
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:21,800
I don't care about this
single function will read all this data.

2384
02:19:21,800 --> 02:19:24,040
Bear in mind steps.

2385
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:28,760
So if you go in my steps, you'll see here
I'm calling this particular function,

2386
02:19:29,360 --> 02:19:32,200
which my this object employs, is holding

2387
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:35,360
all these nice documents importing the AJ.

2388
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:40,200
Do you get all the maps one by one
where one map is having all these vendors

2389
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:43,280
from every arrow
and it is returning the values

2390
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:45,600
based on these keys
which and providing here.

2391
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:47,360
And then I'm putting this data

2392
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:49,400
this to

2393
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:53,240
underscore that

2394
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:59,560
we want this part.

2395
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:01,680
Yeah, I got it, got it.

2396
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:04,320
But isn't it easy
it is a one name activity

2397
02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:07,040
and if we have the
we have to close the Excel point in

2398
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:10,160
and of course we are already closing it
in already.

2399
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,000
It's already closed.

2400
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,120
We are just reading was open closed
and then we are reading in simple.

2401
02:20:15,120 --> 02:20:17,640
So we don't need to do
any additional store.

2402
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:22,840
We don't need to open it
and close it again.

2403
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:27,000
If the exception is to be visited
when people should get employed to do

2404
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:30,760
our code exception, to do the exception
instead use it as well.

2405
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:33,200
People employed by converting mine runs

2406
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:36,240
meaning? Yes.

2407
02:20:36,240 --> 02:20:38,440
Yes it is for better for the shooting
naming rate.

2408
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:42,600
Just check whether you provided
the shooting name like this or not.

2409
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,280
If you provided with this job

2410
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:50,440
greater than the smaller than symbol,
then this would be the error you get

2411
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:54,920
right just provided like this

2412
02:20:54,920 --> 02:20:57,600
because then it becomes the driver.

2413
02:20:58,600 --> 02:20:59,120
Right.

2414
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:01,320
So this is the issue.

2415
02:21:01,320 --> 02:21:02,920
Your code with related to.

2416
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:05,960
By the time
we are not providing this by yesterday

2417
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,800
the must have been by the time
this screen is loaded properly

2418
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:14,120
taking you further
fluidly will resolve your queries.

2419
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:17,600
So far based on me,
any question is for you.

2420
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:18,880
If you provide this

2421
02:21:18,880 --> 02:21:21,960
a greater than it is, one or two things
in one writing becomes key.

2422
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:23,680
We're not passing the key. We're passing.

2423
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:25,920
This is a better eight here.

2424
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,320
See, this is the key
you passing like this.

2425
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:31,520
So it is expecting
some from getting triggered.

2426
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:35,400
Not reading the data from itself,
but we we need to store any

2427
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:37,800
data to excel in the future.

2428
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:41,080
We destroying their data in future.

2429
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:43,440
There's nobody using your grades
or from simply

2430
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:46,760
in the future.

2431
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:49,480
Also in your company is right.
When will you go?

2432
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:52,560
When you will go in your companies
and you will be working on your name

2433
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:55,600
projects, Then you have to deal with Excel
in your current

2434
02:21:57,600 --> 02:22:11,560
operating on this is just to

2435
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:16,000
but is a must or reason for just this
and what it is for practice.

2436
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,160
Just do it. Otherwise
I will do it tomorrow for you.

2437
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:20,280
That's okay you are in jobs.

2438
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:22,440
So when you have to, you have to.

2439
02:22:22,440 --> 02:22:23,680
That's why I'm calling it right.

2440
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:25,440
It is a one time ability.

2441
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:27,040
It's not something you do very often.

2442
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:29,480
And every now
and then it is just a one time activity.

2443
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:33,360
Once you write this function,
once your function is working right,

2444
02:22:33,480 --> 02:22:35,720
then you are reading this data point.

2445
02:22:35,720 --> 02:22:36,880
Everything is more than a

2446
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:39,280
more.

2447
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:41,600
Next time simply call this things it

2448
02:22:50,600 --> 02:22:51,920
Can someone please copy this

2449
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:55,080
particular part in this life.

2450
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:57,600
Questions. This is to please.

2451
02:22:57,600 --> 02:22:58,120
Yes, yes.

2452
02:22:58,120 --> 02:22:59,800
Yes. I'm a

2453
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:03,840
of this method called detected.

2454
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,840
No, not detectable.

2455
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:06,600
Not detected.

2456
02:23:06,600 --> 02:23:07,640
That's what I'm saying.

2457
02:23:07,640 --> 02:23:10,720
It's a simple,
you know, remember this particular one?

2458
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:13,680
This one, it was not a detectable trait.

2459
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:17,080
Nothing just provided
one key, the parameter.

2460
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:19,120
And then we it

2461
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:24,440
then you have someone remember this one.

2462
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:26,840
Similarly,
this method is we correlate this.

2463
02:23:26,840 --> 02:23:29,440
See with one pattern.

2464
02:23:29,440 --> 02:23:32,320
So now you see this method properly.

2465
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:35,480
In the end of the method,
what you're getting just one shoot me.

2466
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:36,640
That's it.

2467
02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:39,400
The barometer, the start of supply.

2468
02:23:39,560 --> 02:23:47,640
If this is the start of dependency,
you'll see it just as shooting him.

2469
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:48,560
There'd be a passing

2470
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:49,760
from.

2471
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:52,920
The feature
of this is when we are handling you exit

2472
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:26,160
already committed

2473
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:29,640
a good straight in the time we did
whatever the good we did.

2474
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:32,280
So far I have committed
already in the repository.

2475
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:34,520
You guys can take this code from there.

2476
02:24:34,520 --> 02:24:37,680
Every single thing is available so far.

2477
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:40,360
Guys, tell me any question. Yes.
And please wait.

2478
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:40,800
Please.

2479
02:24:40,800 --> 02:25:10,840
Good.

2480
02:25:10,840 --> 02:25:18,680
I see you're asking the question.

2481
02:25:18,680 --> 02:25:20,840
Is there any other one
who has any other question?

2482
02:25:22,720 --> 02:25:23,320
So one.

2483
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:25,200
And what then is?

2484
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:25,480
What?

2485
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:36,960
Boss, did you use?

2486
02:25:36,960 --> 02:25:39,680
So which practice is better
to use a web driver route?

2487
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:46,120
In our framework, we will use this.

2488
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:48,240
This one. Right.
We've already passed from here.

2489
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:51,160
You'll see it in this state.
I showed this on your own.

2490
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:52,360
So let me show you.

2491
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:55,680
Existing takes 1 to 3 exclamation mark.

2492
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:56,880
This one

2493
02:25:58,440 --> 02:26:00,120
is the ideal one that you guys can use.

2494
02:26:00,120 --> 02:26:03,680
Okay, everyone.

2495
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:09,080
Right.

2496
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:12,880
On rainy days.

2497
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:17,080
Nice holidays

2498
02:26:17,080 --> 02:26:21,720
then I think time
then from my side for today's class.
