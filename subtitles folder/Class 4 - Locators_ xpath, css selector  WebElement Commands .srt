1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:29,800
The. Yes.

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,200
Okay. So you saw there is. Okay.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,240
So some people used and.

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:41,720
Okay, that's really good. Yes.

5
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,280
You didn't know we can do that.
Absolutely. Right.

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,920
Because we didn't cover that. Right.

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,480
So there is a lot of different ways
of using X plus guys.

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,160
Okay.

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,040
So for people who use that, that's
very good.

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,360
It means that you guys
doing your research.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,200
Okay, so there's different ways of using

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,680
and locating that element as well, which

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:12,240
which I showed you.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,000
I think I showed you to use index thing.

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,480
Okay. That's where you can implement that.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,640
And you should be able
to locate that element by,

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,840
by using an index.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,560
Okay.

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,320
The difference between following seven
preceding siblings,

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,640
you need to use one of other. And

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
the difference between it depends.

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,280
It depends on it
depends on your HTML, right.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,120
It depends on your HCM
and it depends on your element.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,360
So if your element
has a following siblings

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,360
and you can't locate that element

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,560
uniquely,
you want to go to the one that you want,

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,800
you can locate uniquely
and then go to the preceding sibling.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,560
Okay.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,200
It all depends on the HMO
and how it's built.

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,160
Okay. That's
how you move through the nodes.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,280
Okay, guys.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,160
So it's you need to pay attention

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,520
on on the nodes in your HMO
and then decide whether you want to go

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,360
to following or preceding siblings

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,080
for the videos.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,880
I'm not sure I haven't

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,600
watched any in YouTube myself.

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,720
And I forgot
there was one guy who was really good.

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,760
I've I forgot his name.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
I used to watch him when I was

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,200
when I was at syntax studying as well.

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,160
I forgot.

43
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,840
I'll tell you if I remember that his name

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,240
he he has really good class is actually

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,640
not Alex.

46
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:05,000
We know.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,080
So you were confused.

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,880
Okay. On the siblings.

49
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,880
That's fine On the contains
Contains is easy right guys

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,560
so contains you using contains in order to

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
to get some partial value

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,640
or is that example right here.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,280
Right.

54
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,160
This is the partial value of the
of the of the place holder attribute.

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,800
Right.

56
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,880
So there was email or phone number
or something like this.

57
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,560
We only used one part of it. Okay.

58
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,600
So you don't have to use the whole value

59
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,920
when you use contains.

60
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,880
When I was. Yeah. When I was a student.

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:59,800
That's correct.

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,760
All right.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,640
Any other

64
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:16,880
questions, guys?

65
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,720
Walk you through the homework.

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,920
Okay. We'll do an example.

67
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,240
Okay.

68
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,960
We'll, we'll do the same example,
but we will do it a little differently

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,760
with CSF selectors, but I'll show you

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I'll walk you through that homework.

71
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,480
We're not going to be covering

73
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,400
end at all because as far as I know, guys,

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
you can use
and but I haven't, I haven't seen it

75
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,960
in in use at all

76
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
because there is a lot of difference

77
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,640
difference what's called ways to do it.

78
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,360
And you can use indexing instead of using.

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,200
And sometimes, as I said, if you force
I mean you can use end

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
and you can use index, okay?

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,560
But if you do your research on and that's
fine, that's more information for you.

82
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,120
Okay.

83
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,600
But we won't be covering
and in your in of expertise done

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,280
so we had only one class on next part
so I don't want to overwhelm you

85
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,160
with all those ads
and different kinds of ways for X.

86
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,760
Okay.

87
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,960
So that the the,
the things that we learned yesterday,

88
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,920
they should be enough
for you to locate any elements

89
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,320
freely

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,360
or any other questions

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:51,480
before we start.

92
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,400
All right.

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,360
Today's fun, right?

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
Yeah, I promised fun. Okay, guys.

95
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,120
So I'm class today. Exactly. Yes.

96
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,000
So bear with me.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,160
As we talked before, guys, we will be
going through the boring part first.

98
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,120
Okay,
But the second half of the class, we will.

99
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,320
We will have a lot of fun.

100
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Okay, so let's talk
let's do a quick recap.

101
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,080
Okay, Let's do a quick
recap of yesterday's class,

102
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,360
what we've done so far and what we know
so far from yesterday's class.

103
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:36,600
Guys,

104
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,200
let's see.

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,440
Yeah,
I tried to give you different homeworks

106
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,400
that are a little tricky so that you guys
can find ways to resolve the issues.

107
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,520
Okay?

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,160
Because if I

109
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,920
give you straightforward things,
you won't be able to resolve the issues.

110
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,800
You're just going to be sending
keys, clicking on elements.

111
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,280
Okay.

112
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,120
All right, guys, what about recap
What's going on?

113
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
I see you guys passive again.
What happened?

114
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,800
We need some coffee.

115
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,920
We need a we tired.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:32,880
What is going on, guys?

117
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,360
Okay, Everyone is active. Okay.

118
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,520
What did we cover yesterday?

119
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,400
Guys?

120
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,480
Expats, types of expat, right? Absolutely.

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
And relative expats.

122
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,400
Okay, so what is an expat, guys?

123
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:53,000
What do we know about expat?

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,480
Okay, it's a locator, right?

125
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:02,280
And it's a query language to locate the
element uniquely on the web page, Right?

126
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,920
So we said there's two two types of expat,
there's absolute and relative expat.

127
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,400
So what do we know
about absolute expats? Guys

128
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,960
The longest way.

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,520
Okay, that's good.

130
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,560
Starts from the starting note, right?

131
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,520
Start from the very top of the HTML
or from the DOM.

132
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,960
Right?

133
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,840
And how do we started guys?

134
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,160
It starts with a single slash

135
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,600
and we have to start from the very,
very top.

136
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,600
Right. Okay.

137
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,000
What else do we know about it?

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,400
And we go back and forth
in Absolute Express.

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,840
No, right.

140
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,440
We can only go forward.

141
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
Okay, good.

142
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,880
So what about relative X path, guys?

143
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,880
You can start from any note
you want in HTML,

144
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,640
depending what element you want to locate.

145
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,160
You don't have to start from the very top,
right?

146
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,560
It also starts with two slashes
or double forward slashes.

147
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,600
Right. And

148
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,680
what what else can we do with the relative
x file?

149
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,960
You can go back and forth. Okay.

150
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,240
You can go back and forth,

151
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,640
which is which
is going to be your advanced X class.

152
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,280
Okay. What else, guys?

153
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,520
What about the attributes?

154
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,720
What did we say about the attributes?

155
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,520
Which attributes can we use

156
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:46,760
in in our X back?

157
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,280
We can use any attributes
in our x path, right?

158
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,480
So it doesn't have to be ID, name,
class or link tax or whatever.

159
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,880
You can use any attributes you can see,
even if it's a placeholder, if it's

160
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,000
even if it's this on click or whatever
it is, type

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,600
any attribute,
you can use it with X path, right?

162
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,360
And you can start at any point
of the of the DOM.

163
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,760
As you wish.

164
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,400
All right. So

165
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,600
what kind of methods did

166
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,040
we learn of in X Path, guys?

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,000
What are different methods that we learn?

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,280
What are different manipulation scenes
that you can do with us?

169
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
There we go. You can get a text, right?

170
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,480
And you can find an element by its text.

171
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,240
Okay.

172
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,480
We'll also learn
how to get the containing value right,

173
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,520
and we'll also learn how

174
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,720
to get the starting value
of any attribute, right?

175
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,720
Okay.

176
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,160
What about the ending value?

177
00:10:53,160 --> 00:11:00,600
You guys?

178
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,400
It's not available, right?

179
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,800
It was available
in an extract version 1.0.

180
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,200
Now we all use 2.0.

181
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,480
So that's why
it is not available right now.

182
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,600
Okay, so let's go over the advanced
X path of what do we know about

183
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,120
advanced X path plus

184
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,160
as a big family, right?

185
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,520
So it's a it's basically parent child
and sibling relationships, right?

186
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,160
So Advanced X

187
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,240
path is based on parent and child
and sibling relationships.

188
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,920
Right.

189
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,560
So if I want to go to a

190
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,960
to a node forward, guys,

191
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,720
and it is my sibling,
it is going to be what

192
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,280
if I if I want to go forward, guys,
not not backwards.

193
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,880
Right.

194
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,720
It's going to be my following sibling.

195
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,360
And if I want to go back,
it is going to be my preceding sibling.

196
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,360
Right.

197
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,280
So what do we know about the parent?

198
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,880
What is the parent class?

199
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,640
What is the

200
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:31,320
parent node?

201
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,960
Let me actually go in here
so that we can see what is going on.

202
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,720
It is the container, right?

203
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,320
It is the container
which contains the element.

204
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,840
We we want to we want to locate.

205
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,640
Right. So if we're looking here.

206
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,040
So that's input as a parent
which is that div.

207
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,360
Right.

208
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,640
What does DIV stands for.

209
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,880
It's a division. Right.

210
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,880
So this division has a label in here
and input.

211
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,440
Right. How do we know?

212
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,560
How do we know these two are siblings
guys,

213
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,240
label and input?

214
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,800
How do we know

215
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,800
they are indented inside the division?

216
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,800
But if you look vertically
they are on the same level, right?

217
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,360
So it's inside the division,
but they are of the same

218
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,600
at the same level inside this division.

219
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
So they will be our siblings.

220
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
Okay,
So what is considered as an ancestor,

221
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:48,680
guys, grandparents.

222
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,040
Okay, what did we say

223
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,560
about ancestors?

224
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,800
Anything above the parent, Right.

225
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Anything above this
div will be considered as ancestor.

226
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,680
Okay, good.

227
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,280
All right.

228
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,600
Okay. Any questions, guys?

229
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:25,440
Any questions on X path?

230
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,760
Everyone was ready and active.

231
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,720
Yes, that's good.

232
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,840
That's really good.

233
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,480
So I promise
you today, a little bit of fun.

234
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,440
So let's do this right.

235
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,240
Okay,
So let's talk about the CSF selector.

236
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,720
Okay, today.

237
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,560
And then we're going to be doing
some element commands

238
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,520
and then we'll go over the tag name.

239
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,400
Okay.

240
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,480
And the most fun we're going to have about
today's

241
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,680
class is with

242
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,560
tag names. Okay?

243
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,080
We're going to be doing a lot of stuff.

244
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,040
Okay.

245
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,320
So CC selector guys,

246
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,600
is is there anyone who did a research on
CSF selectors?

247
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,440
Let me create

248
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,640
a file

249
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:29,160
here.

250
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:36,120
All right.

251
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,080
CSF selector.

252
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,160
Okay, so CSF is a stylus, right?

253
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,080
Okay.

254
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,080
Like x path. It is like x fat. Exactly.

255
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,480
But it is a little bit faster
in finding the elements, right?

256
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,600
So it is a selected
that is related to styling.

257
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:07,960
Okay,
so does anyone know what CSF stands for?

258
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,040
Cascading styling sheets. Right.

259
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,200
Okay, that's very good.

260
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,040
So let's put it in here.

261
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,840
It's getting styling sheet.

262
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,200
Right.

263
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,000
So anything so for the developers guys. CC

264
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,040
So if you go in here, this here

265
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,520
guys, as you can see,
they are styling it in here.

266
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Okay?

267
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,560
When you, when you inspect the page,
you can see here margins, right?

268
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,160
The box sizing.

269
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,800
So the display is if it's a block or
whatever, they want to display it right.

270
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,880
The text alignment
there all it's all done by using the CSF.

271
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay. So all the

272
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,240
design

273
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,800
is being done by CSF by the developers.

274
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,560
Okay.

275
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,840
All right.

276
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,000
So let's move back in here.

277
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,000
Okay.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
So CSF selector, we know it is

279
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,760
another way of locating the elements
uniquely, right?

280
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,000
The syntax of it is a little bit

281
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,040
it's very similar to express,
but it has no different elements in there.

282
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,280
Okay, so

283
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,400
say it is

284
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,760
another way of locating

285
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,680
elements, right?

286
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,600
Elements.

287
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,240
So to say on the web page.

288
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,000
So now let's dive into this syntax.

289
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,480
Okay.

290
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
So the syntax is going to be simple
because it's going to be so

291
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,040
it's simpler than X path.

292
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,360
Okay, So the syntax in here
is going to start a little different.

293
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,040
So if you remember in relative X path,
we used to start CSF selector,

294
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,560
I mean we used to start an X path
with double slash right in here.

295
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,920
What we will not
do, we're not going to start

296
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,560
with double slash,
we will directly start from this tag name.

297
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,720
Okay?

298
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,360
So it's going
to be tag name and then again

299
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,920
square brackets in here.

300
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,240
So if you remember in relative X path,
we had X signed

301
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,920
before that attribute in CSS selector,
we don't have it.

302
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,320
Okay.

303
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,440
So you could just type in your attribute
directly in here

304
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,880
and that equals sign

305
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,520
and single codes in here and here

306
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,920
you can put your attribute value.

307
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,080
Okay, any questions on this?

308
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,800
So this looks a little similar.

309
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,040
I mean, it looks very similar to export,
but it looks simpler

310
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,600
then the next path, right?

311
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,160
It's easier and it's simple.

312
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,120
Okay.

313
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,040
All right.

314
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,840
But CSF selector has its own disadvantages
and we will go over those in a bit.

315
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,040
Okay.

316
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,360
So let's go

317
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,320
here and try to identify
an element here by using CSS.

318
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,320
Okay. So yeah, so selector,
it's like x path.

319
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,560
So that means we can use any,

320
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,400
any attributes we want in CSS as selector
as well as we do an export.

321
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,520
Okay. So

322
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,560
what I'm going to

323
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,480
do let's
identify this log in button in here.

324
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,080
Okay.

325
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,560
And let's use a type

326
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,640
what's called type attribute in here.
Okay.

327
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,640
So what am I starting with guys

328
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,840
by looking at the syntax.

329
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,200
If I want to see
if I want to write a C as a selector

330
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,560
and here I'll be starting with a tag name,
right?

331
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,760
So button right away
and then square brackets in here.

332
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,600
So we set that we don't have an assigned
before the attribute in here.

333
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,080
So what I'm going to do
is just start typing the attribute

334
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,440
and equal sign single codes

335
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,080
and then I'll to submit.

336
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,600
Okay.

337
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,080
So pretty easy and straightforward, right?

338
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,920
The tag name, your attribute
and that value.

339
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,680
Okay, So let me copy this

340
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
and paste it in here

341
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,440
and we check here exactly one of one.

342
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,000
So that means this element is unique,
right?

343
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,200
Any questions, guys, on this?

344
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,360
It's clear, right? Okay, good.

345
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,600
All right. So

346
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,040
an X path.

347
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,400
Plus, if I wanted to identify the element
by text guys, what did we use?

348
00:20:50,640 --> 00:21:02,240
What did we use yesterday?

349
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,480
We use a text method
right inside our X path.

350
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,160
Right. So I have bad news for you guys.

351
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,120
SS does not support that method.

352
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,160
Okay?

353
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,840
If you use the SS, you won't be able
to identify an element by its text.

354
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,400
Okay.

355
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,400
So I'll put it in the notes.

356
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,480
See, SS

357
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,320
does not give and

358
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,320
opportunity to

359
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,400
locate an element by its text.

360
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,160
Okay.

361
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,680
You can do it only, but by using extract.

362
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,200
Okay. Is that out there?

363
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,080
Guys? Any questions on this?

364
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Obviously
not pretty straightforward, right?

365
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,600
Okay.

366
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,720
So now we have

367
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,680
so for
as selector, we have some shortcuts.

368
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,680
Okay.

369
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,560
So if you
if you remember for x path, whenever

370
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,320
you want to locate something by ID,
you have to type it in.

371
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,280
Right?

372
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,560
So there are some shortcuts
for some attributes in CSC selector.

373
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,480
Okay.

374
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,600
And they're given by by some symbols.

375
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:19,840
Okay.

376
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,160
So what I will do in here, let me put

377
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,200
shortcuts for C says, okay,

378
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,640
so let's go ahead and start with shortcut

379
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,920
for classmate.

380
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,320
Okay, So the shortcut for class
name guys is really easy.

381
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,840
It's just a dot. Okay?

382
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,120
So whenever you're using a CC selector,

383
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,360
you instead of putting a whole class,

384
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,000
a whole attribute in there,
we can just put a dot

385
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,600
instead of it, and I'll show you
how it's done in a minute.

386
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,800
Okay.

387
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,280
So out for class
name and let's go in here.

388
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:12,080
Let me see what we can identify.

389
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,280
Okay, so let's do this.

390
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:18,120
Okay, So this is our I want to identify

391
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,160
this textbox in here by using a class

392
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,160
attribute,
and I want to write a CSS selector for it.

393
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,360
Okay, So usually, guys,

394
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,720
if you want to write down a

395
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,280
what's called
if you want to write down a CSR selector

396
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,400
with a class attribute, you would go by

397
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,960
tag name square brackets.

398
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,280
Class is equal to

399
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,960
and I think it was this one

400
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,040
right form control.

401
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
Right?
So there's three elements. It's fine.

402
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Right now we don't really have to have a
what's called.

403
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,200
We don't have to have a unique element.

404
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,120
I just need to
I just want to show you how it's done.

405
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,320
So normally,
if you want to use a class attribute,

406
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,600
this is how you would go, right?

407
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,680
If you want to go with X class,
you want to start with double slash

408
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,600
and assign,
and then you attribute an attribute down,

409
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:21,840
right?

410
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,720
So in case it's made very easy.

411
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,280
So what you can do in here,

412
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,760
you can actually do a tag name, dot

413
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,320
and class value.

414
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,120
Okay, So this

415
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,400
can be your success selector.

416
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,080
Okay, So let me go back in here.

417
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,080
So in this case, guys, in this case, my

418
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,760
let's see.

419
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,520
Okay, so my tag name.

420
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,280
So let me locate this again

421
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,040
here.

422
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,280
My tag name is input, right?

423
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,040
So if I want to use the class
value in here,

424
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,880
what you can do is just put a dot

425
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,000
and go ahead and write down for control.

426
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,080
Okay, so it located three elements,
but that's not important for us.

427
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,160
The most important part for us
is that we are able to locate the elements

428
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,720
by using the shortcuts of CAC selector.

429
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,760
Okay, Pretty cool, right?

430
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,600
It's it it's really readable.

431
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,240
And it's not that difficult

432
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,840
to write.

433
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,360
It's not that long.

434
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,520
It's just input.

435
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,640
You put a dot in there
and the class name value.

436
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,840
Right.

437
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,640
Okay.

438
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,800
Let me your

439
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,440
syntax

440
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,480
class value.

441
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
And I'm just thinking, okay, any questions

442
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
on this shortcut?

443
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,320
Yes. That DOT has a lot of class. Exactly.

444
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,240
All right.

445
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,760
Any questions on this?

446
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,520
You wish that?

447
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,360
Yeah, I wish.

448
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,600
I wish we had shortcuts or X path as well.

449
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,200
But they didn't do this,
so they didn't build it for us.

450
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,880
Okay,
so there is one more shortcut for I.D.

451
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,520
Okay, so let's
go ahead and go over that as well.

452
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,720
A shortcut for it.

453
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,520
Actually,
it's it's going to be really easy as well.

454
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,240
So this time that I did
the shortcut for it

455
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,320
in CC
selector is represented by the pound key.

456
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,720
Okay.

457
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,240
Or the hash tag,
whatever you want to call it.

458
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
Okay. So

459
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,720
instead of

460
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,760
having ID is equal to the ID value,
what you can do, you can do the tag name,

461
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,400
the pound and the ID value.

462
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:17,280
Okay, so syntax would be the tag name

463
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,520
found in here and the ID

464
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,880
value.

465
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,360
Okay.

466
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,280
Yeah. It's not a unique.

467
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,360
Yeah, that's fine. Guys.

468
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,880
I just wanted to show you
how it's used for the class.

469
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,440
Okay.

470
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,720
How you can use the shortcuts to identify
the elements by using the class.

471
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,440
Okay.

472
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,480
You need to use the actual syntax.

473
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,440
You don't have to. It's.

474
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,760
It's a shortcut, right?

475
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,760
So you don't have to do.

476
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,400
You don't have to use the class name
and ID the whole CSS selector.

477
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,800
What you can do, you could just use this.

478
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,120
Okay, so it's just two options for you.

479
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,120
Sometimes you forget what symbols

480
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,160
it was, so
you just want to use the attribute itself.

481
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,040
But if you remember them and you

482
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,040
learn them by heart, so that's, that's

483
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,840
how you want to go and it's more readable
and it's really short.

484
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,440
Right?

485
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,680
Okay.

486
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,680
So let's go in here and identify

487
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,880
one element. Okay.

488
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,760
So we'll see.

489
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,600
So let's see this textbox.

490
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,080
Okay, so this textbox has an ID in here.

491
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,720
So what I want to do,
I want to identify it by ID,

492
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,360
I want to use a CSF selector
and I want to use the shortcut.

493
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,880
Okay.

494
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,440
So what I can do in here,
I'll start with a tag name.

495
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,760
So the tag name here is input.

496
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,000
Right?

497
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,160
What I will do,
I will put a pound sign in here

498
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,480
and I need to grab the value of this ID.

499
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,760
Right. So

500
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,880
copy this and pasted in here.

501
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,600
And you can see that
we identified that element.

502
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,640
And this element is unique enough to use.

503
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,720
Right.

504
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:20,600
Any questions on this?

505
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,320
I hope it's clear
it's pretty easy and straightforward.

506
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,000
Right, guys? So

507
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,640
just put a

508
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,880
dot and
you could just put a pound key in here

509
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,120
so that you can find an element
by its ID or by its closely.

510
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,520
Okay.

511
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,720
All right.

512
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,760
Okay guys.

513
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,760
So now, so yesterday when we did X pass

514
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,920
right, we used some of the contains

515
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,160
some of the starts with

516
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,360
methods
to identify element by its partial values.

517
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,960
Right.

518
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,440
So we're going to do the same
for CSV selectors,

519
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,040
but it is a bit different for CSV
selectors.

520
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,000
Okay.

521
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,840
So if you remember yesterday
we actually were writing

522
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,320
contains or starts with

523
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,480
right in our class.

524
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,360
So in CSV selector
it's completely different.

525
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,400
It's given

526
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,400
those methods are given in

527
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,720
in shape of symbols. Okay.

528
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,960
Like the symbols we use for these.

529
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,560
Okay. These are the shortcuts.

530
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:36,320
But for CSV selectors,
when you use containers

531
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,120
starts with and ends with,
you won't be able to use those methods.

532
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,400
You will only be able to use them
by the symbols.

533
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,360
Okay.

534
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,120
And I'll show you what symbols we need
to use in order to use those methods.

535
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,360
Okay, so let's go and start with contains
method.

536
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,120
Okay.

537
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,960
So in order
for you to use contains method in SAS,

538
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,480
it's the method within C assess

539
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,080
you will be using the star symbol.

540
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,480
Okay.

541
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,280
Star symbol

542
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
represents

543
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,480
contains

544
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,720
method.

545
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,480
Okay.

546
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,400
So how this works is so this is how
the syntax is going to look like.

547
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:38,400
Okay, so we as usual,
we're going to be starting with tag name.

548
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,080
Okay?

549
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,960
Then we're going to put a square bracket
and then we're going to go

550
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,200
over the attribute that we want to use.

551
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,880
Okay, So

552
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,120
attribute in here.

553
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,640
So this is the usual, right?

554
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,800
Actually used or in here

555
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,280
partial

556
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,920
absolute value.

557
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,040
But the catch in here is before the equals
sign,

558
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,720
what you need to do,
you need to put this star symbol.

559
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,880
Okay?

560
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,880
So whenever you do this,
this will mean that you using a CSV

561
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,960
selector with the contains method.

562
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,680
Is that clear?

563
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:30,760
Guys, any questions on this?

564
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,360
Okay.

565
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,840
It's pretty interesting, right?

566
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
But you just need to memorize these

567
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,480
these symbols, and that's it.

568
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,720
Guys,
it may look a little confusing at first,

569
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,160
but it's really shortcuts in here.

570
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,400
There is nothing too difficult.

571
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,040
Just we just need to

572
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,480
memorize this. Yep.

573
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,800
We can't. Yes, we cannot.

574
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,960
We cannot use text in CSS.

575
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:05,760
Correct.

576
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,520
So text

577
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,560
only applies for the text.

578
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,360
Right.

579
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,000
But here the partial value,

580
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,360
we're talking about the partial value
of the attributes.

581
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,960
Okay.

582
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,840
We're not talking
about the text of the element.

583
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,520
Okay. So if you see this in here.

584
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,800
So this class has a very long

585
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,360
attribute value. Okay.

586
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,240
So you can use that contains in order

587
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,720
to have some partial value from here.

588
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,560
Okay.

589
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,520
That actually C

590
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,840
in here, what can we use

591
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,520
C contains.

592
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,760
So we used contains for this
for this placeholder.

593
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,280
Right.

594
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,800
So let's use this in here. So

595
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,640
what is,

596
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,880
what is my tag name guys in here

597
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,760
it's input, Right.

598
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,800
So I'm going to start with my tag name.

599
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,440
Square brackets right.

600
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,600
Let's go in here.
So we sat in CSF selector.

601
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,280
You can use any different
any attributes that are available for the

602
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,920
for the element.

603
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,840
So I'm going to use this placeholder.

604
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,760
Okay.

605
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,840
Pasted in here

606
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,440
is equal to

607
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,640
email. Right.

608
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,600
It is not working right now.

609
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:48,840
Why you guys?

610
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,640
It's not working right now
because we didn't

611
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,320
enter the whole attribute value.

612
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,240
Right.

613
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:03,560
So here what you need to do,
you need to enter a star or asterisk

614
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,560
sign in here and then you can see

615
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,600
that we identified this element uniquely

616
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,960
and by partial value of this place.

617
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,240
Holder attributes. Okay.

618
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,320
Any questions,

619
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:27,960
guys, here?

620
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,440
Okay.

621
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,600
So let me copy this.

622
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,760
Go back in here and paste it into.

623
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,760
Okay, so you have a tag name,
you have your attribute.

624
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,400
The asterisk, right?

625
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,640
Equals and then partial attribute.

626
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,000
So, okay. All right.

627
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,200
So now let's do this.

628
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,360
So now let's go over. This starts with.

629
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,320
Okay, It

630
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,360
starts with method in CCS.

631
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,680
Okay.

632
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,120
So starts with in

633
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,480
in insists it's

634
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,080
it's represented by a very weird symbol.

635
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,480
Okay. I'm trying to find this right
now. Yes, I found it.

636
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,600
So I'm not sure what this is called.

637
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,560
It's called in different ways.

638
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,320
So this

639
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:25,880
right?

640
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,360
Really sure what this symbol called? Yeah.

641
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
So whatever triangle it is,

642
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,360
whatever triangle it is on the top.

643
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,200
So we're going to be using this
as this starts with method

644
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,960
in C, Okay.

645
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,520
Symbol

646
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,520
presents

647
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,320
starts with,

648
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,760
starts with method being C assess.

649
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,840
Okay.

650
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:06,240
So same way, okay, same way
as did with the contains.

651
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,640
What we're going to do.

652
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:12,240
I'm going to start with our tag name
and put our square brackets in here.

653
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,640
Okay.

654
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,840
I'm going
we're going to go with our attribute.

655
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,400
Then this triangle equals sign, right?

656
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,800
And here we have starting

657
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,960
attribute values.

658
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,480
Okay.

659
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,720
Since we're using this starts
with in here, we will be carried okay.

660
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,400
There you go. It's called care.

661
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,320
Thank you.

662
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,720
Okay, so starting to attribute values
since we're using starts with

663
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,680
we will be

664
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,160
we will be using the starting attribute
value.

665
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,880
Okay.

666
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,600
All right.

667
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,600
So let's see what we can actually

668
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,800
do in here.

669
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,320
See this element

670
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:15,920
and let's
try to find out anything different.

671
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,280
Okay.

672
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:28,040
So let's see if we can do this here.

673
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,560
Okay.

674
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:30,680
So let's see.

675
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,600
Let's use this type in here, okay?

676
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,680
And let's use the CC selector

677
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,680
by using this starts with okay,

678
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,320
so what is my tag name in here?

679
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,760
It is again the input tag name.

680
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,760
Right.

681
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,640
Again, square brackets in here.

682
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,240
The attribute that I'm using is type.

683
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,080
Okay, so now the current design

684
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,920
is equal to single single codes in here.

685
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,080
And I can just use the first two
or three letters.

686
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,480
Right.

687
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,400
With the starting attribute value
that I have for type attribute in here,

688
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,240
just pass
and you can see that it is locating

689
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,680
my elements uniquely and it is one of one.

690
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,400
Okay, Any questions

691
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:33,360
on this, guys?

692
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,000
Do I think that would really need
that many?

693
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,000
Not really guys. Not really.

694
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,440
As I said, guys

695
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,480
in our company,
we mostly use x python IDs.

696
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,960
Some people use CSS selector.

697
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,040
It depends, right.

698
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,960
It depends on the preference guys. Okay.

699
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:56,520
So some people may not like x path,
some people like using CC selectors.

700
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,280
Okay.

701
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,240
So it all depends on the preference.

702
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,880
As you can see,
some people might like the shortcuts

703
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,160
that I just showed you guys,
which we don't have an X path.

704
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,720
Okay.

705
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,280
If we put password instead of pass that,
nothing's going to happen.

706
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,800
It's going to, it's going to locate
your element anyways, right.

707
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,000
So I can do a password.

708
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,400
So it still starts with that expression,
right.

709
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Our, our CC doesn't know that it ends
with that or this is the whole expression.

710
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,000
It sees that it matches the starting value

711
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,720
and that's it.

712
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,000
Okay.

713
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,600
All right.

714
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,680
Let me copy this

715
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,560
back in here

716
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,640
and sit in here.

717
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,720
So now, guys, CC selector,

718
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:00,240
unlike the Express selector has ans with

719
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,320
method.

720
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,000
Okay, so let's go over that as well

721
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,120
and with method in CC.

722
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:09,960
Right.

723
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,480
So this sign is going to be your favorite
sign, right guys?

724
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,600
So our favorite sign is
what is a dollar sign guys?

725
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,520
Okay, so after you find a job,
you will see

726
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:30,280
a lot of numbers in your paycheck.

727
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,360
Money. There you go. Exactly.

728
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,080
So this is going to be
the easiest one to remember.

729
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,920
I think. Right.

730
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,520
Okay.

731
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,720
So this symbol, this symbol

732
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,600
represents and with method and

733
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,160
cses, like same way,

734
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,840
guys, as we have in here,

735
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,000
we copy this.

736
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,360
But instead of sign in here,
we have dollar sign.

737
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,000
And instead of signing attribute value,

738
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,600
we actually have the ending attribute
value.

739
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,080
Okay.

740
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:11,840
All right.

741
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,680
Not not yet.

742
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,080
That's not the fun part yet.

743
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,040
We're just getting started. Okay, guys.

744
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,880
All right.

745
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,200
Okay.

746
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,200
So let's go and identify some elements

747
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,760
and see.

748
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,840
Okay.

749
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,320
Wonder.

750
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:43,920
Okay, there we go. See?

751
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,280
Okay, so let's assume that we have

752
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,000
this one, right?

753
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,400
So let's let's find out

754
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,720
by using the source attribute.

755
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,920
Okay? So let's locate that element.

756
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,320
I know we're not going to be having
a unique element in here,

757
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,000
but our purpose is to use
the NS with method for S, right.

758
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,040
So what is my
what is my tag name in here, guys?

759
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,560
It is an IMG, which is an image.

760
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,560
Right.

761
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,440
So what I will do
or actually let's use this.

762
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,160
Okay,
so let's locate the logo guys in here.

763
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,920
Okay. So this is going to be unique.

764
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,200
I think so.

765
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,360
It has an IMG,
so let me put my square brackets in here.

766
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,880
My attribute.

767
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,600
Right.

768
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,400
Our favorite sign in here, dollar

769
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,800
sign equals to let's see in here.

770
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:48,000
Let's use the last
the last part of the source.

771
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,760
The last part of the source
attribute value. Okay.

772
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,200
So let me use syntax that P and G,
All right.

773
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,280
There you go.

774
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,080
So you can see that
I only use the last part

775
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,000
of the attribute value
by using the dollar sign.

776
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,560
And now what we have in
here is a unique element

777
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:13,320
identified right.

778
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:13,800
All right.

779
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,000
Any questions on this?

780
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,800
Yes. All good.

781
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,040
So for as selectors, guys,
you just have to remember these symbols.

782
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,240
Okay, So that's it.

783
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,440
And so worth doesn't work with.

784
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,840
But he works with CSF selectors.

785
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:45,600
That is correct.

786
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,880
All right, so this is CSF selectors.

787
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,880
It's pretty easy

788
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,000
then expense, right?

789
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,760
But let me jump in here.

790
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,040
But guys, notice
this, that in CSF selector,

791
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,600
what we cannot do,
we cannot identify an element by its text

792
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,160
and we won't be able to go back and forth

793
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,200
like we can do it in X Files.

794
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,080
Okay. Is that clear?

795
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,960
You guys?

796
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,000
Oh, I did class. Okay.

797
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:29,400
Thank you.

798
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,840
Zero. For now.

799
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,800
Let's create a Java class.

800
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:48,480
And here.

801
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,280
Okay. The last part was CSF selector.

802
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,400
We won't be able to identify the element
bytes text.

803
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,080
Okay.

804
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,880
And you cannot go back and forth
like we do it an X path.

805
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:05,800
So if you use an advanced x path, you can
do you can go to parent siblings, right?

806
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,800
In siesta lecture that there's no option.

807
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,200
You can do that. Okay.

808
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,880
And in CSF selector you cannot identify

809
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,880
an element by its text.

810
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,480
Okay.

811
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,120
All right.

812
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,320
So let's have a main method in here.

813
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,880
Okay.

814
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,200
So now let's go over the steps
for the homework, guys.

815
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,440
Okay.

816
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:42,200
So let me see.

817
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,120
Can anyone

818
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,000
show you the example of the text

819
00:46:50,520 --> 00:47:02,480
for X path?

820
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,600
That's

821
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,120
right. So, okay. Okay.

822
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,320
So I see what you're saying.

823
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,400
Okay, So let's say this element, right?

824
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,200
Log in, button in here.

825
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,240
So as you can see, there is a text in here

826
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,560
so it doesn't have an attribute
and it's not a value of any attribute.

827
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,840
So this is considered as text.

828
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,320
Okay.

829
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,080
So if I want to identify this,

830
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,240
okay, you got it.

831
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,560
You don't want me to go over the whole X
path?

832
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,640
Is everything clear now?

833
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,320
Okay, cool.

834
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,480
All right, let's go back now.

835
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,120
Sure.

836
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,440
The homework.

837
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,440
Okay, So c text.

838
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,320
I think I have
it self. Right. So let's see.

839
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,920
Right.

840
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,320
Okay, so let me get this.

841
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,080
So I'm going to grab this one, guys

842
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,360
place in here.

843
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:39,080
Then I just need to get the.

844
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,920
Yeah, I know, right?

845
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,280
I know.

846
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,920
I was ready. You just got you.
Just stop me.

847
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,560
Not cool.

848
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,600
Okay.

849
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,120
All right, guys.

850
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,120
Okay, so I'm navigating here, right?

851
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,120
I set up the properties, I launch
the browser, I navigate to syntax project.

852
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,560
So now, let's see

853
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,720
this.

854
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,520
Okay, so we here the home page in here.

855
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,560
So now let's start identifying
all the elements by CSV selected.

856
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,520
Okay,
so what is the first step that we have?

857
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,920
We need to click on start practicing.

858
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,640
Okay, so what I am going to do in here,

859
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,360
Magic Arrow, right click on this one.

860
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,320
Let's expand this a little bit.

861
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,040
Okay. So now here I have

862
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,400
what's called I have a text in here.

863
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,120
Can we use text when using the C selector
guys?

864
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,600
No. Right.

865
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,920
So what we can do in here,
there is an ID for this element, right.

866
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,520
So we can use that ID,
but let's use the shortcut for this.

867
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,920
Okay.

868
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,840
So what is my tag name on this case?

869
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,560
Guys? It's a tag, right?

870
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,880
So I don't need
any double slashes in here,

871
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,840
so I'll simply start with a tag
and what I can do.

872
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,720
I'll put the square brackets in here

873
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,880
and or what we can do in here.

874
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,680
We can use the shortcut
without putting the square brackets.

875
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,280
Right.

876
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,000
What is the symbol for ID,

877
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:30,600
guys?

878
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,320
Is it a dot?

879
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,720
What was the dot for? It?

880
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,040
There you go. It's a pound key.

881
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,160
Right? Or the hash tag. Right.

882
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,440
So let's put this

883
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,280
sign in here and let's grab

884
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,360
this ID value and pasted in here.

885
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,600
There we go.

886
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,240
So we have it identified one of one

887
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,320
we use our CSS selector
and we use the ID shortcut.

888
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,160
Right.

889
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,320
So let's go back to our script.

890
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,920
So now what we want to do in here,

891
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,680
we want to find that element, right?

892
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,200
Find element.

893
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,520
What am I finding it by?

894
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,560
Guys?

895
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:21,280
So this time what we have here,
we have a CSS selector, right?

896
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,400
We need to choose that.

897
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,960
And inside the parentheses
I need to paste that value in here.

898
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,520
Okay.

899
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:43,920
What am I getting in return
when I find an element,

900
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,280
I'm getting a simple web element, right?

901
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,880
Element

902
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,480
store

903
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,400
practicing equal to this.

904
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,640
So now what I will do in here,

905
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:10,320
go ahead and click on this.

906
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
Can I do class attribute?

907
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,080
Let's see here.

908
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:16,760
Let's try.

909
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,200
Let's see if we can do this.

910
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,880
Oh, in this case, guys.

911
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,640
Okay, so I see what you see.

912
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,600
Okay, so let me delete this.

913
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,440
Okay I'll put here

914
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,760
this dot and

915
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,560
copy this

916
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,480
place. Live in fear. Okay?

917
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,320
What happened, guys? Why?

918
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,280
I am using the class shortcut in here,

919
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,400
and I can't really find out
or I can't locate that element.

920
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,240
Exactly.

921
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,920
That's because of the spaces
we have in here, right?

922
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,440
So that's why we won't be able
to use the class

923
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,520
and shortcut for CSS selector.

924
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,840
Okay.

925
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,320
One, it has space too.

926
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,040
It's really

927
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,040
what's called its really long
attribute value.

928
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,280
So what you want to do,
you want to shorten it

929
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,320
with by using contains
or you could just use it in here.

930
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,040
Okay.

931
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,680
Space matters in class because you don't.

932
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,400
You do not get it
in the container of single quotes.

933
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,720
Okay.

934
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,000
So here you don't have any quotes.

935
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,000
That's
why it looks like everything is a part.

936
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:36,960
Okay.

937
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,040
But if you have single quotes
and you put this value inside

938
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,600
the single quotes, that should work.

939
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,520
Okay?

940
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,840
And if you put the class and everything
with this square brackets,

941
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,840
it won't work with your

942
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:59,080
with a shortcut in here.

943
00:53:59,080 --> 00:53:59,440
All right.

944
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:09,280
Any other questions, guys?

945
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,600
Okay.

946
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,840
It's not the and let's click on this

947
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,040
and start clicking on sample form
demo then.

948
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:26,560
Now the tricky part comes here, Right?

949
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,080
Okay, guys,

950
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,960
some people identify it by indexing.

951
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,560
Some people used

952
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,680
and write

953
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:41,520
to identify this element,
which is which is good.

954
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,840
You guys did your research.

955
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,120
That's fine.

956
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,160
So I have a class attribute in here
which is not unique.

957
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,360
Obviously, you can see there's different
different class

958
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,920
and class action values that are the same.

959
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:04,080
The only thing that is not the same is,
I think this is the address, right?

960
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,120
So if I want to use

961
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,240
a text, guys

962
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,640
from here, what would be
how would I do this with CSS?

963
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,840
Ask us

964
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:22,920
exactly.

965
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,560
We can't use text words.

966
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,480
Right?

967
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,520
So in this case, let's go ahead and use

968
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,880
let's go ahead
and use the what's called the x path.

969
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,640
Okay.

970
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,920
But let's use the X path with the

971
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,880
with the text.

972
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,080
Okay.

973
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,360
Ends with and starts
with well ends with and starts with.

974
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,800
We're not going to
they're not going to use the text.

975
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,040
Right.

976
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:59,000
We can use text at all with C selected
no matter

977
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,120
it ends with or starts
with, starts with and ends with.

978
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,880
We won't be using with only

979
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,400
the attribute values guys

980
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,720
do not I think everyone is confused

981
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,760
with starts with and ends with guys.

982
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,560
Okay.

983
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,200
Because you try to use starts with

984
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:26,560
with the text in CCS which we can't do.

985
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,200
We can try using attribute.

986
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,160
Yes, we can try using attribute a trap
and see if that's going to work.

987
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,200
Okay. So

988
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,000
let's go ahead and do the Xbox.

989
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,240
And here we have an eight tag, right?

990
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,360
And then

991
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,880
let's do this.

992
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,200
This is what is my next step. Guys.

993
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,720
I have my

994
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,040
my eight tag in here.

995
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:59,520
Okay.

996
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,320
Okay. Yeah, that's going to work as well.

997
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,800
Yes, that's going to work as well
that you've done.

998
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,280
So here
we're trying to use with eight tracks.

999
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,080
Guys, what is my next step?

1000
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,800
So I'm using an X path

1001
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,240
there.

1002
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,720
Okay. Okay.

1003
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,880
So if I type in a graph
and here is equal to

1004
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,960
and then

1005
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,960
I click on this,

1006
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:40,480
go to the next page, you'll see.

1007
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,360
Copy this, we copy the values

1008
00:57:49,320 --> 00:58:00,880
of. All right, guys.

1009
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:09,280
So why is this not working?

1010
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,440
What did I missing here at sign?

1011
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:11,760
Right.

1012
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,440
Okay, so let's put a net sign in here.

1013
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,440
Okay. What happened?

1014
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,840
So we can use this,
But it's not unique, right?

1015
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:24,360
So I'd rather use the text in here.

1016
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,080
And let's see how this is going to work.

1017
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,120
Okay, So

1018
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,200
text.

1019
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,960
So let me delete this.

1020
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,520
I think it's simple

1021
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,880
for demo, right?

1022
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,920
Again, it's one of two.

1023
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,720
So there is a
let's do this right there and

1024
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,160
there. Okay.

1025
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,200
So what happened, guys?

1026
00:58:56,200 --> 00:59:00,400
If we identified this,
what did I just identify it

1027
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,920
in this case,

1028
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,960
I identified the whole division
of these elements.

1029
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:09,760
Right.

1030
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,400
So if you look in here,
I identified this and this.

1031
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,920
This division
has multiple elements inside.

1032
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,440
Okay.

1033
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,600
So what I want to do,
I don't want to really go

1034
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:30,600
any further
or any up in the hierarchy, Right.

1035
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:35,160
So what I need to do,
I simply have to go to my second element.

1036
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,640
So here what we can do,

1037
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,200
we can use the indexing
and it's not going to work.

1038
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,440
Why is this not working, guys?

1039
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,200
Because we have to wrap it up inside the

1040
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,000
container, Right?

1041
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,520
So let's do this.

1042
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,120
There we go.

1043
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,720
So now we have one of one in here.

1044
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,800
So it identified that exact element
that we want to interact with.

1045
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:06,960
So, yes, the question was here.

1046
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,760
That's why I said that this
this one might get a little tricky.

1047
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,440
Okay, so let's go in here

1048
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,560
with element.

1049
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,360
All right.

1050
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:26,680
Simple.

1051
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,640
Why It's not working.

1052
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,800
Simple for them, right?

1053
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,560
Why it's not working for the first one.

1054
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:37,200
Okay, so let's go back in here.

1055
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,960
You mean if you do this one

1056
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:46,520
and this?

1057
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:53,320
Oh, if I put one like this

1058
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:59,160
Because there is a hidden element
inside your web page, guys.

1059
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,440
Okay, So sometimes that happens.

1060
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,760
Developers. This is developers doing okay.

1061
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,680
They do what they want to do
in cmd, right?

1062
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:12,800
Yesterday, as I mentioned, guys, they
built this as they want to build this.

1063
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:16,960
And what we need to do is

1064
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,280
we need to

1065
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,560
identify the element as we want to.

1066
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,760
I mean we need to, right?

1067
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,440
So it's,

1068
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:32,520
it is unique, but this is not the element
we want, right?

1069
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,040
This is a completely different thing
inside the HTML.

1070
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,320
That's why it is not working.

1071
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,600
Okay.

1072
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,320
So this is completely different thing.

1073
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,120
This is a hidden element
that we can not see.

1074
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,600
Okay.

1075
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,960
And we don't need this

1076
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,680
because we don't even see
how it's highlighted on the web page.

1077
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:57,640
Right.

1078
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,480
So what we need,
we need the second element

1079
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,600
and we can visually verify that it is

1080
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,040
it is highlighting
that element on our web page.

1081
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,160
Okay.

1082
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,320
That's why
we're going to be using the second one.

1083
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:12,640
Okay.

1084
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,640
So let me copy this.

1085
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,760
Simple form is equal to driver dot

1086
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,360
find element

1087
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,200
selector.

1088
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,440
There we go.

1089
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,120
All right.

1090
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,360
So what we want to do

1091
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,960
X path? Yes. Good touch.

1092
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,760
Thank you.

1093
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,800
X Exactly.

1094
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,680
It's new and then

1095
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,560
simple in the demo dot click.

1096
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:52,720
Right.

1097
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,000
All right.

1098
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,520
So we click on this one.

1099
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:58,880
Okay.

1100
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,920
So now will land on this page.

1101
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,040
So now all we need to do,
we need to enter some text in here.

1102
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,640
What do we want to do in here, guys?

1103
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:14,920
So I want to use an X,
I want to use a C selector.

1104
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:15,920
Okay.

1105
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,920
I to use the placeholder attribute and

1106
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,720
I want to use contains. Yes.

1107
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,800
How do we want to do this?

1108
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:33,960
Or let's do this with start with guys.

1109
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:36,720
We will probably add some thread
that sleep later.

1110
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:38,560
Okay?

1111
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,520
After we run
and see how it's going to run.

1112
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,360
Okay.

1113
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,760
So I have my

1114
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:50,280
input tag.

1115
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:50,680
Okay,

1116
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,400
so now

1117
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,120
square brackets right

1118
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,400
place holder.

1119
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,520
All right, so what is my

1120
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,080
start with symbol?

1121
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,640
Is it a star or asterisk or or a cat?

1122
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:20,640
Which one?

1123
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:26,920
Yeah, in the beginning I said contains
but let's do it with starts with.

1124
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,000
All right, there we go.

1125
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,200
So let's do this is equal to

1126
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,520
and then the starting

1127
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,640
value right
you can see you could do displays

1128
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,160
or you could do please enter

1129
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,400
whatever whichever you want to do.

1130
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,560
Okay, so copy this.

1131
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,200
Get back in here.

1132
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,080
All right, So

1133
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,480
what you can do

1134
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,760
element

1135
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,440
just textbooks, list, name it like this.

1136
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,560
Right word.

1137
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:06,800
The second element

1138
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,880
by CC

1139
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,280
X for starts

1140
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,240
seventies.

1141
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:24,720
What are we sending guys?

1142
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,440
We can see

1143
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,160
it's good. It's selenium.

1144
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,480
I love selenium.

1145
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,120
Let's do let's see. Corbett sucks.

1146
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,280
How about that

1147
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:39,120
or moneybags.

1148
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,760
Right. That that's that's it.

1149
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,320
That's a good one.

1150
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:47,240
Okay, let's do this.

1151
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,160
Moneybags. Okay, there we go.

1152
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,800
So are we sending this text in here?

1153
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:56,400
And then we need to click on this one.

1154
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,760
Okay,
so now what I want to do, let's use a

1155
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,720
CC selector, let's use

1156
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,640
an on click attribute
and let's use contains guys.

1157
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,360
Okay, So

1158
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,680
then in here,

1159
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,840
what is my tag name?

1160
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,000
Attack name is button. All right.

1161
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,800
And then we'll have

1162
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,880
my square brackets in here.

1163
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,840
Let's identify it again.

1164
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,680
So what I can do

1165
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,400
here on click right

1166
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,360
and what is
what is the sign for contains guys

1167
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,480
asterisk.

1168
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:48,840
Right.

1169
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,960
So let's put this in here
is equal to square brackets

1170
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,600
and what we can do with just
to show in here.

1171
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,360
Right. Or

1172
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,640
you can just do

1173
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,640
that in the middle

1174
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:09,040
whatever containing

1175
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,720
containing attribute value
you want to get.

1176
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,560
You can get any
and you can see that it's one of one.

1177
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,680
So it is unique.

1178
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:23,000
And what you need to do.

1179
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,640
One element

1180
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,600
or find element.

1181
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,600
So you say selector is sitting here.

1182
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:38,640
All right,

1183
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,720
then what we need to do, we need to click.

1184
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,240
Okay. All right.

1185
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:57,840
So let me run this
and see how this is going to end up.

1186
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:07,000
Okay.

1187
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,880
This beautiful.

1188
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:19,200
It sounds right away nice.

1189
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,320
Okay, guys, why did it fail?

1190
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,600
Anyone?

1191
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,280
Any guesses?

1192
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:31,320
Okay,
we can add some fours in here, right?

1193
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,840
Right after we navigate in here.

1194
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:40,720
Okay, let's see if that's going to work.

1195
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:47,560
Let's wait for 2 seconds.

1196
01:08:47,560 --> 01:09:00,840
Okay, Let's run this.

1197
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,200
Yours work fine. Okay.

1198
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:13,920
See? Okay,
So where did we end up going, guys?

1199
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,400
So we clicked on Start practicing, right?

1200
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:22,520
So now what we did here,
we can't click on simple form, right?

1201
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,240
It says element, not interactive.

1202
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,400
All Okay, that's fine.

1203
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:29,400
So after we click on Start practicing

1204
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:34,560
button, let's put another

1205
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:36,320
weight.

1206
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,240
And after this, let's put another word
just in case.

1207
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,520
Okay. Yeah.

1208
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,600
It's it's really fast probably.

1209
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,800
So let's run this

1210
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,680
a working on simple demo.

1211
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:09,320
All right,
there we go, Moneybags show message.

1212
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,840
And we can see the message in here,
so everything works fine, right?

1213
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,360
And at the very end,
what we need to do is we need to

1214
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,520
quit the browser.

1215
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,520
Okay.

1216
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,280
All right, guys,
any questions on CSS selector

1217
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:42,120
before we go on a break?

1218
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:42,760
Okay.

1219
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:47,360
It's no.

1220
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,400
Yes, sure. I'll leave this open.

1221
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:52,120
Okay. It's no questions.

1222
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,120
Let's take a break. Okay.

1223
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,280
So 15 minute break.

1224
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:15,360
Let's get back at 835.

1225
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,040
I'll push the code at the very end.

1226
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:24,360
Okay, guys,
how do we create reports on those tasks?

1227
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,800
We will be going over those
a little bit later during the course.

1228
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:28,640
Okay, guys.

1229
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,560
So right now,
we don't have to worry about it

1230
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,640
because we're just learning steps. Okay.

1231
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:40,400
So we will be learning
how to create reports, notes.

1232
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,280
No, not in the canvas.

1233
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,640
I'm pushing them to the GitHub guys.

1234
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:51,000
They're all in GitHub.

1235
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,280
When you maximize. Yeah, that's fine.
That's it.

1236
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,120
Sometimes it works
because of the different

1237
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,600
Internet, what's called Internet
speed, right?

1238
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,640
So it all depends on some

1239
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:12,600
different various situations.

1240
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,560
And it's selenium.

1241
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,200
It's you can never predict
how it's going to run.

1242
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,800
You always have to give it some time

1243
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,240
If you don't have any steps
in your requirement.

1244
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,480
Is it okay
if you add some steps by your own,

1245
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,720
what kind of steps are you talking about?

1246
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,840
Like actions to click on something

1247
01:12:51,920 --> 01:13:06,080
in your script?

1248
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,840
Oh yeah. These, these are normal.

1249
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,480
Your job is to verify some functionality

1250
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,560
and it's all up to you

1251
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:21,840
how you want to implement your weights,
your sleep time, your maximizing.

1252
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,720
Okay, So your job is to make sure
everything is working.

1253
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,600
They're not going to

1254
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,280
they're not going to ask you
about how long you've for this button.

1255
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,200
They're going to ask
you if this button is working

1256
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:42,400
okay, Sorry.

1257
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,040
All right, guys, let's take a break.

1258
01:13:44,040 --> 01:28:56,400
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

1259
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:06,400
All right, guys, let's get back.

1260
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:14,720
See, everyone is back.

1261
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:15,040
Okay.

1262
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,760
Good.

1263
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,200
All right.

1264
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:26,080
So let's go over some now Web element.

1265
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,680
Two months.

1266
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:30,240
Okay.

1267
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,360
So, yeah.

1268
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,840
Okay.

1269
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,200
Element two months. Okay.

1270
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,400
If anyone do a research about Web element

1271
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:51,560
commands, guys,

1272
01:29:51,560 --> 01:30:07,280
what do we know about Web element
commands?

1273
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,400
We've used them already. Okay, Which one?

1274
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,360
Which ones did we use already?
Guys, click.

1275
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,760
Okay. That's very good.

1276
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,400
What else?

1277
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,920
Send keys. Right. Okay. There we go.

1278
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,960
So what relevant commands are

1279
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,120
methods or actions

1280
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,320
that we can perform on our elements?

1281
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:36,280
And sometimes we can get an element state
on the web page.

1282
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,920
Okay, so Web element commands there.

1283
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:43,360
It consists of several methods
where we can perform actions

1284
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,200
and get elements state of on the page.

1285
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:47,520
Okay.

1286
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:51,480
So consists

1287
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,560
of several

1288
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,520
methods where

1289
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,680
we can perform

1290
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,600
actions and get

1291
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:08,320
elements.

1292
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,400
State

1293
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,720
on the web page.

1294
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:13,480
Okay.

1295
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:14,440
All right.

1296
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:18,480
So we've already done
click we've already done send keys.

1297
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,160
Right.

1298
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,000
So now there are a couple
of different commands

1299
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,080
that we need to learn guys
in order to perform

1300
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:30,080
some validations
and verifications on the page.

1301
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,520
Okay. So the first one,

1302
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,560
when I said
we can get a state of that element, right?

1303
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:41,200
What kind of state of the elements
do we know, guys?

1304
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:46,520
Anyone in research on that?

1305
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:49,920
Like if, if I go to this page right now,

1306
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:55,200
if I go to this page,
what is what is the state of this

1307
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:59,200
login button?

1308
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:01,520
Okay, it is displayed. That's very good.

1309
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:06,600
What else?

1310
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,120
Stand by. Not really

1311
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:11,720
the state guys.

1312
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:13,080
So it is displayed.

1313
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,400
That's one of them.

1314
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,280
Okay,

1315
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:18,720
it is clickable.

1316
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:21,520
Okay, that's. That's very good. What else?

1317
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,800
Interactive block.

1318
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,920
What?
What would be the state of this button

1319
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:37,680
if I won't be able to click on this?

1320
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:38,880
Great. Right.

1321
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,040
What is the state.

1322
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,960
Okay, so that's the color, right?

1323
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,880
So the color enable.

1324
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:47,560
Okay.

1325
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:51,480
So this this button is enabled

1326
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,600
and it is displayed.

1327
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,760
Okay. So there's two there.

1328
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,320
There are two states
for this element, right?

1329
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:02,640
So there are a couple of methods
that will need to go through insulin.

1330
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,480
You okay.

1331
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:08,760
Which is the first one is is enabled.

1332
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,160
Okay.

1333
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:13,320
So this is the first method
that we to go through

1334
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:17,040
which will return us what anyone gets.

1335
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,480
It can guess what what
what are we getting in return

1336
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,160
whenever we use this is enabled method.

1337
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,120
We're getting it fully, right?

1338
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,400
Absolutely right. So boolean

1339
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,280
value in return

1340
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:35,280
and we said is displayed.

1341
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:40,160
There is a second method
and here we're getting a boolean

1342
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,000
value again.

1343
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,360
And what about some checkboxes guys?

1344
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,760
So let's go

1345
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:50,640
in here.

1346
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:56,040
Let's see me actually of this.

1347
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,600
Let's go to checkboxes. Right.

1348
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,560
So what did I do right now?

1349
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:01,920
I clicked on this.

1350
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,680
It got selected, right?

1351
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:10,440
So this the state of this checkbox
is selected, right?

1352
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:16,000
So there is another method
which is called selected.

1353
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:17,480
Okay.

1354
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:21,360
Which will return a boolean value as well.

1355
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:22,360
Okay.

1356
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,720
So now let's go back here,

1357
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:27,800
let's go back and see.

1358
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,480
So okay guys,

1359
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:35,640
if I navigate to this page
and I want to enter and we already did,

1360
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:40,200
right, and I want to enter something
and here we do senses, right?

1361
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:44,760
But when I navigate to this page,

1362
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:48,520
we don't know if there is already text
in this text

1363
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,720
box, right? So

1364
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:54,120
I don't want to guess.

1365
01:34:54,120 --> 01:35:00,480
I just want to perform an action
to delete everything.

1366
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:05,800
So in this case,
there is a simple method to delete.

1367
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:10,280
Everything from any text
box is called clear.

1368
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,560
Okay, so clear method.

1369
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,720
What is what am I getting in return?

1370
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:20,040
In this case, guys?

1371
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:21,520
Any guesses?

1372
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,880
If I clear the text box,
what am I getting in

1373
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,400
return?

1374
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,440
Okay, now that means what am I getting?

1375
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,200
I'm not getting anything right.

1376
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,760
So This method is void.

1377
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:40,800
Exactly.

1378
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,920
Okay, so I'm not getting anything.

1379
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:46,120
So that means it is a void method.

1380
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,280
Okay, so now, guys,
when we entered something in here

1381
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,800
and we clicked on show message,

1382
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,960
the the message that we entered in here,

1383
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:00,800
it popped up right here.

1384
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:01,400
Right.

1385
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,480
So what I want to do,

1386
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:07,560
I want to verify that this

1387
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:11,760
text that I entered appeared in here.

1388
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:12,920
Okay?

1389
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,960
But this element that I just

1390
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:19,880
selected in here, it's not interactive,
all right?

1391
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,720
You can't really click on it.

1392
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,240
You can't do anything. Right.

1393
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:28,320
I just need to verify that this text

1394
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,480
that I entered in the text box
appeared in here.

1395
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:33,880
Okay?

1396
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,200
It is only visible.

1397
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:42,360
Yes, but I need to get that exact text
from here, which we have a method for.

1398
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,720
It's really easy.

1399
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:47,520
It is called get text.

1400
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,880
Okay.

1401
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:54,000
So any, any text,

1402
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,200
I mean any element
that you want to get text from,

1403
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:02,160
you can use the get text
method from selenium which will return us.

1404
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,120
What guys.

1405
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:12,160
What am I getting in return in this case,
we're getting a strength value.

1406
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:13,840
Absolutely.

1407
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:14,440
Right.

1408
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,000
So now, guys, there is another method
that I want to mention,

1409
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,680
and we will go through this

1410
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:24,600
during our automation right now,
which is called

1411
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:28,120
Get Attribute

1412
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,200
an attribute in here.

1413
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:39,360
What do you think it's going to return us
guys?

1414
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:46,080
It's going to return us a string value.

1415
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:46,760
Okay.

1416
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,160
All right.

1417
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:49,680
We use get text, whatever.

1418
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,840
The text is not tangible. Not really.

1419
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,080
No. I mean, you can

1420
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:57,080
you can use get text whenever you want
to get text from the element.

1421
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,200
Okay.

1422
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,440
It doesn't have to do anything
if it's tangible or not tangible.

1423
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:06,840
You just need if you want if are required
to get the text from that element,

1424
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:11,640
you just use the get text method
and I'll show you how everything is done.

1425
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:15,600
Okay.

1426
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,080
All right.

1427
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:20,200
So let me create one class

1428
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,240
in here. A

1429
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:38,040
and clear content.

1430
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:38,600
Okay.

1431
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,600
So I'm just going to

1432
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,040
copy and paste

1433
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,400
where is the web order?

1434
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,880
So we had okay, it's right here.

1435
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:56,760
I'm just going to copy and paste this

1436
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:00,000
or let me actually

1437
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:25,640
see this.

1438
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:26,640
All right.

1439
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,040
So here, let me paste this in here.

1440
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,840
So this website, you guys know it's

1441
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:35,240
navigating to this website. Okay.

1442
01:39:35,240 --> 01:39:37,680
So what I want to do, I want to enter

1443
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:41,000
my username and password.

1444
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,000
Okay?

1445
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,720
In here and what I need to do after this,

1446
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:52,880
I'm going to have to clear my texts
that I enter.

1447
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:56,000
Okay.

1448
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:56,920
Can I share?

1449
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:02,120
You should have this right?

1450
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:06,880
Or if you're talking about the link,

1451
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,280
I can share the link.

1452
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,120
There you go.

1453
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:13,600
Okay.

1454
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,920
So we all know what is going on
on this website, right, guys?

1455
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:20,800
So I'm navigating to this web page.

1456
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:24,760
I am entering my username, I'm
entering my password.

1457
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:32,400
So now what I want to do,
I want to clear text.

1458
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:36,560
So now do I have to do
I have to identify my elements

1459
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:41,040
again, Guys? No.

1460
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:47,880
Why not?

1461
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:50,800
We already have a variable, right?

1462
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,280
We stored that in a variable

1463
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:58,000
so we don't have to identify this element
again and again.

1464
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:58,920
Right.

1465
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:03,640
So in here, what I will do in here,
I'll give it a pause

1466
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:08,040
so that we can see the visually
what is going on on the page.

1467
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,080
Okay, so throw this in here.

1468
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:17,040
So now what
I am going to do, I can do username got

1469
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:22,840
clear and I will clear my password

1470
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,240
as well.

1471
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:28,480
Okay, so now let's go ahead and run this

1472
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:39,160
and see what's going to happen.

1473
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,240
There we go. There you go.

1474
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,000
I hope you saw the difference.

1475
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,200
What happened guys in

1476
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:48,240
after we waited for 2 seconds.

1477
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,000
So we entered our username.

1478
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,400
We entered our password
and then after 2 seconds,

1479
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,040
they all got removed.

1480
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:59,720
Okay.

1481
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:00,800
Pretty cool right, guys?

1482
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,800
So you entering now
you can clear everything on the text box

1483
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:11,720
and it's very straightforward
and very easy.

1484
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:21,480
Any questions on this?

1485
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:24,720
All clear. Okay, good.

1486
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:28,000
So now let me create another class in here

1487
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:33,600
and just say element.

1488
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:34,320
Okay?

1489
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:40,720
I have main method in here.

1490
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:45,720
Okay, So now we're going to be navigating

1491
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:52,640
to two radio buttons.

1492
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:57,000
Okay, So this is the website
we will be navigating to.

1493
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,640
Okay, So let me send it to you.

1494
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:02,040
There we go.

1495
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:05,200
Okay. So what I want to do in here,

1496
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:09,560
I want to navigate to this page.

1497
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,160
Okay?

1498
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:15,920
I want to verify that this age group,

1499
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,560
5 to 15, is selected or no.

1500
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,040
And I want to know if it's enabled or not.

1501
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:27,440
Is that clear?

1502
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:33,280
Any questions on this, guys?

1503
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:33,880
Okay.

1504
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:37,600
All right.

1505
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:39,720
So let's go back here.

1506
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:43,360
So let's start with setting up

1507
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:46,880
properties

1508
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:53,360
right, Like Chrome

1509
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,680
Driver and

1510
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,200
Forever

1511
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:05,760
web driver.

1512
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,920
This is the new

1513
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:10,960
Chrome driver, right?

1514
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:13,280
And now

1515
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:15,160
the driver

1516
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,920
gets so

1517
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:22,280
I think posted in here.

1518
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,080
Okay.

1519
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:25,480
So we navigated to this here.

1520
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,480
So what is my next step, guys?

1521
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:41,640
What do I need to do?

1522
01:44:41,640 --> 01:44:45,240
So I navigated to that
to that particular web page.

1523
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:50,160
Now we need to find the elements, right?

1524
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,960
So let me do the services, inspect

1525
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,920
and let's go here.

1526
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:00,280
Okay.

1527
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:04,040
So I need to identify this 5

1528
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:08,200
to 10.

1529
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:09,000
Okay.

1530
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,440
So what is the element
that I need to identify right now? This

1531
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:17,240
is it the label or is it the input?

1532
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:18,440
Which one?

1533
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:22,400
So I want to write
and I want to write a question here.

1534
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,800
How would I started

1535
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,240
input?

1536
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:40,480
Okay, let's start with input.

1537
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:41,000
Input.

1538
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:48,000
So which one I was looking for in here?

1539
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,960
Can I use type guys in here?

1540
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:55,200
So let's see, type

1541
01:45:56,720 --> 01:45:59,160
is equal to

1542
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:01,560
radio.

1543
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:03,720
So is it unique?

1544
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:07,160
Goes. No. Right.

1545
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:10,080
So we need to go with another.

1546
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,680
We need to go
with another attribute in here.

1547
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:15,320
So let's go with the value

1548
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:19,080
right value and let's do five

1549
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:22,440
things system.

1550
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:24,880
All right, there we go.

1551
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,360
So it's one of one.

1552
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,680
So now we have a unique,

1553
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,280
unique element will locate it.

1554
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:37,880
So now let's go to our script
and now let's identify this driver.

1555
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:41,160
But find

1556
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,400
element of finding this by CSV selector

1557
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:49,240
and I will paste this in here.

1558
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:49,760
Okay,

1559
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:54,200
Now let me assign this

1560
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,600
a great deal, but

1561
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,440
okay.

1562
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:03,640
All right.

1563
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:05,640
So we identified our element.

1564
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,600
We assigned it to a different variable.

1565
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:09,240
Right?

1566
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:12,120
So now I want to know

1567
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:16,520
if this element is enabled

1568
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:21,280
right now, what do I do, guys?

1569
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:27,840
Any guesses?

1570
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,320
I'm not really. Not yet. Right.

1571
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:33,480
So first of all, we need to use the

1572
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,880
we need to use the method.

1573
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,120
How do we use the method?

1574
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:41,920
Guess variable that is enabled, right?

1575
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:42,840
There you go.

1576
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:47,840
So a radio button that is enabled,

1577
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:49,200
right?

1578
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:50,200
What is it going to return?

1579
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,760
We guys, we said

1580
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:57,280
it's going to return me
a boolean value, right?

1581
01:47:57,560 --> 01:48:02,000
So Boolean is a

1582
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,160
scuse me, is a radio button

1583
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,880
enabled

1584
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,400
is equal to this.

1585
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,000
Right.

1586
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:18,080
So what I'm going to do,
let me print this out.

1587
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,200
Okay.

1588
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:22,000
So if I print this out, what am I getting?

1589
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:28,800
Guess what is it
going to print in my console?

1590
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,720
As some people say, False.

1591
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,800
Some people say true.

1592
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:35,960
Okay, false.

1593
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:38,600
Okay, that's fine. So let's run this.

1594
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:42,840
Okay, and see

1595
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:49,880
what's going to happen.

1596
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,720
Running it here.

1597
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:53,840
Okay. So let's go back in here.

1598
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:55,080
All right.

1599
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:58,920
What did we get, guys?

1600
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:02,880
We got the true value in here, right?

1601
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,200
So when we navigate it

1602
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:10,120
right, that means our

1603
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:14,320
our radio button in here is enabled.

1604
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:19,120
So if it's enabled,
then we should be able to click on it.

1605
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:20,640
Right?

1606
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:25,360
Okay, So

1607
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,160
what I can do. So

1608
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:29,280
in here, guys,

1609
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:33,040
what I want to do,
I want to print something.

1610
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:36,680
If this radio button is not enabled,

1611
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:42,720
how would I do this?

1612
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,120
Okay, if, if, if statement. Right.

1613
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,480
So if condition and here
what am I having inside my

1614
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,800
if condition

1615
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:58,320
if a variable

1616
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,360
variable name

1617
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:06,720
or am I using the variable name in here

1618
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:10,200
the web element name or on line 16

1619
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:12,360
which one

1620
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,160
online 16. Right.

1621
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:18,120
Because that's a boolean value
and we need a boolean

1622
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:21,240
value inside our can edition.

1623
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:25,160
Okay, so I want to print out.

1624
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:35,560
Okay, So let me copy this.

1625
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:39,520
So I want to print out something in here.

1626
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,120
Let's say whatever it is, right?

1627
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:48,840
So we're printing something like this.

1628
01:50:48,840 --> 01:50:50,720
Okay, there we go.

1629
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:56,120
So if so, if I run this right now

1630
01:50:56,120 --> 01:51:07,480
is, it going to print this value in here?

1631
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:08,440
No. Right.

1632
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:14,160
Because I have a condition in here
stating that if this is not true.

1633
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:19,200
So if this is false,
only then you need to print this.

1634
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:20,080
Okay, so

1635
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,800
here we could do else

1636
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:27,160
and we can print it out.

1637
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:33,880
That enables or whatever.

1638
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:36,480
That's fine. Okay, there we go.

1639
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,440
Any questions on how we use the is enabled

1640
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:48,560
method guys?

1641
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,360
All right, cool.

1642
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:52,440
No questions. Right.

1643
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:52,760
Okay.

1644
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:59,280
So now I want to see
if this radio button is displayed.

1645
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:03,120
Guys.

1646
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:05,400
See the meaning of enabled.

1647
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:08,520
If it's enabled,
you should be able to click right

1648
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,720
if your element is disabled
or your button or your radio

1649
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:18,280
button is disabled,
you won't be able to click on.

1650
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:22,320
Okay, is that clear?

1651
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,040
Sure. All right.

1652
01:52:24,040 --> 01:52:25,240
So now

1653
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:28,920
I want to see in my console

1654
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:32,600
whether this element is displayed or not.

1655
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:34,920
Okay. Okay.

1656
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,440
So it's going to get me another boolean,

1657
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,160
right? Is

1658
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:44,760
radio button

1659
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,640
displayed

1660
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,880
is equal to a radio button

1661
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:53,600
that is displayed right?

1662
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:58,960
And here, let's print it out.

1663
01:52:58,960 --> 01:52:59,920
This guy.

1664
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:00,520
Right.

1665
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:03,600
So obviously, if I ran this,
what am I getting in return?

1666
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,440
Is it true or false?

1667
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:09,920
I'm getting a true value.

1668
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:11,120
Right.

1669
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:22,280
Okay, so let me run this.

1670
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,920
Okay, So we're here.

1671
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:25,320
All right.

1672
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,720
So true. Enabled.

1673
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:29,160
Then again, choose.

1674
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:32,040
So that means our element is enabled

1675
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:35,960
and it is displayed right on the webpage.

1676
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:37,480
Okay.

1677
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:42,360
So now, guys, what I want to do in here,
I want to make sure

1678
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,520
that my radio button is selected on. No.

1679
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,680
Okay, So

1680
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,240
in here

1681
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:55,560
we would talk that we have an is selected
method, right?

1682
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:59,920
So let's use that so a radio button that

1683
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,760
is selected.

1684
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:04,080
Right.

1685
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,560
And we can assign this to a boolean value

1686
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,480
in here.

1687
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:10,160
Right.

1688
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:14,640
Is a button

1689
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,560
selected.

1690
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:23,400
And what I am going to do actually

1691
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:27,120
let me print out before clicking.

1692
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:29,440
Okay.

1693
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,560
So let's put this here before

1694
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:39,600
clicking, then I'm

1695
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:42,400
going to copy this place to see here.

1696
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:43,320
Okay.

1697
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:49,160
So if I run this before clicking,
what's going to happen?

1698
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,520
So false, right?

1699
01:54:50,520 --> 01:55:04,400
So let's run this.

1700
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:07,080
Okay, well, here, there we go.

1701
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:11,640
So before clicking, it's right
that that means

1702
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,880
it is not selected, right?

1703
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:17,400
Because it's not selected yet.

1704
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:18,760
So now

1705
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:22,800
what I want to do, I want to click on this

1706
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:26,720
and then I want to see if this becomes
true.

1707
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,200
Okay? Is that clear, guys?

1708
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:32,160
Any questions?

1709
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,200
Okay, cool.

1710
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:39,560
So now what I need to do, I simply need
to click on that radio button

1711
01:55:40,720 --> 01:55:43,360
and then let's print out

1712
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:47,960
after

1713
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,000
clicking.

1714
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:56,000
Then is a radio button selected?

1715
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,520
Oh, clear. Okay, not clear.

1716
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:02,560
Right click.

1717
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,680
Okay, so I'm clicking and then.

1718
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:11,760
So now what should be the result
in my console guys?

1719
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:17,520
So first of all, when we check false and
then the second one should be true, right?

1720
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:17,960
Okay.

1721
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:22,560
So let's see.

1722
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:24,000
Let's see. I'm running this.

1723
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:26,400
Let's see what's

1724
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:31,920
going to happen.

1725
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,560
Okay. So it clicked.

1726
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:35,640
It is selected right now, right?

1727
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:38,240
So let's take a look at the console, guys.

1728
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:43,400
What happened?

1729
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:46,320
So here before click in is false

1730
01:56:46,680 --> 01:56:49,360
and after the clicking is false as well.

1731
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,560
Why So that means
something is going on in here.

1732
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:58,200
Why did it not turn as true guys

1733
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,160
need some sleep.

1734
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:04,360
Okay.

1735
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:07,120
We will need to resign.

1736
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:10,720
What are we really signing in here?

1737
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:12,600
That is a very good point.

1738
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:16,240
What are we really signing in here?

1739
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:18,240
The boolean variable.

1740
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,160
Right. Okay, guys.

1741
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:21,840
So now pay attention in here.

1742
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:26,280
Why do we have two false outputs in here?

1743
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:32,560
Because we're using the same variable
on line 27 guys.

1744
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:34,800
Okay, What is that?

1745
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,440
What is the value of this boolean
on line 27?

1746
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:41,160
Does.

1747
01:57:41,160 --> 01:57:42,960
It's false, right?

1748
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:49,520
So after I click,
what am I putting in here?

1749
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:53,880
I'm putting that false value again, right?

1750
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:59,040
So after I click on the radio button,
what I need to do,

1751
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:03,080
I need to reassign this

1752
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,440
boolean value again

1753
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:12,000
and I need to check if it is selected

1754
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,720
after I click that, but

1755
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:18,360
I click that radio button.

1756
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:19,920
Okay.

1757
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,960
Is that clear, guys? Why?

1758
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:26,560
We had two false outcomes.

1759
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:30,000
So now let me run this

1760
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,480
and see what

1761
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:38,800
we're going to have.

1762
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,400
Okay, so we click.
It is selected right now.

1763
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:45,360
So now if you see before clicking,
we have false.

1764
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:49,280
After clicking we have a true value.

1765
01:58:49,880 --> 01:58:56,760
Okay, so we had to reassign this bool,
this boolean value and check

1766
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:59,920
if it is selected again
and then print this out.

1767
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:01,240
Okay.

1768
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:07,960
Any questions guys? Yes.

1769
01:59:07,960 --> 01:59:16,600
We need to check after we click as well.

1770
01:59:16,600 --> 01:59:17,320
All right.

1771
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:19,240
And then

1772
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:25,680
quit.

1773
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:28,920
Okay, so let me check

1774
01:59:29,080 --> 01:59:43,040
one more.

1775
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:44,400
Okay, Guess so.

1776
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:46,480
Let's go back to our notes.

1777
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:48,760
Okay, so we're here.

1778
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:54,360
So there's one more method on for Web
element commands that I want to show you

1779
01:59:54,680 --> 01:59:58,640
is this submit method.

1780
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:02,480
Okay.

1781
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:06,400
What what do you think
we can get in return when we use

1782
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:15,720
submit method, it is a void, right?

1783
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:18,480
So we're not getting anything.
So we're clearing.

1784
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:19,560
We're not getting anything.

1785
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:21,600
We click in, we're not getting anything.

1786
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,680
Okay, I'll give you some time
to write down the court.

1787
02:00:24,680 --> 02:00:27,280
Okay, One
second, guys. Let me explain this.

1788
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:28,680
Okay.

1789
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,480
So it's a void.

1790
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,760
We're
not getting anything in return in here.

1791
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:36,440
So this submit guys will

1792
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:40,080
mostly be using on

1793
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:44,600
on the buttons like, okay.

1794
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:47,480
Or log in or submit itself.

1795
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:48,360
Okay.

1796
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:51,240
So let's actually try this

1797
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:56,160
in one of the

1798
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:58,920
let me see.

1799
02:00:58,920 --> 02:01:01,480
Okay, so we have this right?

1800
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,440
So we have this web order script in here.

1801
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:07,920
Okay?

1802
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:10,680
And instead of clicking on log in button,

1803
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:13,360
let me try the one submit.

1804
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:14,480
Okay.

1805
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:22,560
And let's see
if we're able to log in to this website.

1806
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:24,400
So I'm running this.

1807
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:29,880
Let's see.

1808
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:30,320
There we go.

1809
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:33,600
I think it clicked,
but what happened with the

1810
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:37,080
first

1811
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:42,240
ad was too fast.

1812
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:43,960
Probably.

1813
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:45,440
We don't want to try this.

1814
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:55,320
Did anyone get it worked?

1815
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:56,000
Same result.

1816
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,360
Okay. Same result as mine.

1817
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:07,160
Okay, let me close this.

1818
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:08,440
We close these.

1819
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:13,560
Or maybe we can try this and Facebook
log in.

1820
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:21,080
Okay, So let's see.

1821
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:21,440
Okay,

1822
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:23,760
So instead of

1823
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:29,080
clicking here, what I'm going to do,
let's submit this, okay, on Facebook

1824
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:39,400
and let me run this
and see if this is going to work.

1825
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:40,560
There you go.

1826
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:43,200
So now it clicked on log in, right?

1827
02:02:43,200 --> 02:02:45,560
It should navigate to somewhere.

1828
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:47,760
Yeah. There you go.

1829
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,280
So after this,

1830
02:02:50,280 --> 02:02:54,200
it went to click on the forgot password
and he quit.

1831
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:57,360
But I hope you guys saw the difference.

1832
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:57,720
Right?

1833
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:02,880
You guys saw how it clicked on log in
and then it informed other actions.

1834
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:06,840
Okay, so this submit most of the time

1835
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:10,800
is use on submitting
something or clicking okay.

1836
02:03:10,920 --> 02:03:13,120
Or finishing something.

1837
02:03:13,120 --> 02:03:14,800
Okay.

1838
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:28,520
Any questions on this?

1839
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:29,800
On submit.

1840
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:32,160
So submit is like a click guys.

1841
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:34,360
Okay, click And submit.

1842
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:36,840
They are pretty much doing
almost the same thing.

1843
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:43,520
Okay.

1844
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:48,600
But as far as I have read about submits
most of the place

1845
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:54,240
it says submit works better than click.

1846
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,920
Which one is preferable?

1847
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:56,880
It's all up to you.

1848
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:57,120
I'm in.

1849
02:03:57,120 --> 02:04:00,280
Click is mostly used.

1850
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:01,200
Okay.

1851
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:04,200
I haven't seen
submit actually even at work

1852
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:07,320
there is

1853
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:10,040
no unique
difference between click and submit guys.

1854
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:13,640
They they they basically doing

1855
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:16,680
the same thing on the web page.

1856
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:17,520
Okay.

1857
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:35,400
You can say
they're are like synonyms. Yep.

1858
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:44,680
There you go.

1859
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:46,000
All right.

1860
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:50,280
Any questions, guys?

1861
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:52,480
Let's see

1862
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:57,240
Claire so far.

1863
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:59,400
Okay, good.

1864
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,000
So we did submit.

1865
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,560
We did all the web element
commands in here.

1866
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:06,960
Not all of them, but we'll be doing
the rest of them right now.

1867
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:09,480
Okay, So what I will do

1868
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:12,760
in here, let's actually

1869
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:15,800
go and do this first manually.

1870
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,080
Okay, So I'm going to go to eBay.

1871
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:20,360
Okay, guys.

1872
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:24,000
So what we are going to be

1873
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:31,840
what we're going to be doing in here
is something really cool.

1874
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:35,480
Okay. So let me actually inspect this.

1875
02:05:35,480 --> 02:05:45,720
See? Well, yeah, it's
almost the same as I said, right

1876
02:05:56,600 --> 02:05:59,040
to submit function.

1877
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:02,040
There you go. It's applicable
for the form.

1878
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:04,800
Okay. And click applicable for any types.

1879
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:05,400
Right. Okay.

1880
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:12,040
There you go.

1881
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:12,600
Okay.

1882
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:24,960
Any other questions, guys,
before we move on?

1883
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:25,680
Okay.

1884
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:26,600
All right.

1885
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:29,760
So let me open up the box in here.

1886
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:34,160
So what we going to be doing in this exact

1887
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,720
task that we will be getting

1888
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:43,680
all the links from this website?

1889
02:06:44,080 --> 02:06:44,600
Okay.

1890
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:48,400
So I'm pretty sure you can see there's
a lot of stuff going on in eBay, right?

1891
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,720
So a lot of links in here.

1892
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:55,120
You click on this one,
you redirected to another page, you get,

1893
02:06:55,120 --> 02:07:01,520
you click on some other things, you get
redirected to a different page, right?

1894
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:07,400
So as we can see, there's a lot of
different links on this page, right?

1895
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:12,200
So how can we check
how many links we have inside this page?

1896
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:17,560
Guys, Any thoughts?

1897
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:19,720
A lot.

1898
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:21,680
Can I get the number guys?

1899
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:24,400
How can I get the number of links
on this page

1900
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:35,760
using an aid tag?

1901
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,440
Absolutely right.

1902
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:39,440
So we had

1903
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:44,840
a tag is used only for links, right?

1904
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:48,440
So what I will do,
just going to put double slash in here

1905
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:51,360
and I'll put in a tag in here.

1906
02:07:51,360 --> 02:07:53,800
How many links did I just find?

1907
02:07:53,800 --> 02:07:58,200
Garth? 406.

1908
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,440
Right.

1909
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:02,960
So some of you guys may get different
numbers.

1910
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:08,120
It depends on your location as well
okay, so 400

1911
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:12,400
more than 400 links on this web
page alone.

1912
02:08:13,080 --> 02:08:13,600
Okay.

1913
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:16,360
So, Kevin, you got four 417.

1914
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:19,560
So sometimes you get different

1915
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:22,440
links
because most of them are hidden as well.

1916
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:27,360
So some of them,
we don't see it as as you remember,

1917
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:32,160
we were doing this homework
and there was two same elements,

1918
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:36,320
but one of them was not visible, right?

1919
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:40,360
So some of these links,
they're not visible as well

1920
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:44,040
to us on the web page,
but they exist inside the HTML

1921
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:47,520
485 on Amazon.

1922
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:48,720
Beautiful.

1923
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:50,960
Okay, So let's go back.

1924
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:54,000
Let me create a new class in here.

1925
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:58,320
Okay. And

1926
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:07,200
from eBay.

1927
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:09,120
All right.

1928
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:13,320
So let's put a main method in here.

1929
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:15,160
Let's set

1930
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:17,400
our properties

1931
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:25,480
forever.

1932
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:36,480
Whenever a

1933
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:45,680
new chrome driver.

1934
02:09:45,680 --> 02:09:50,160
Okay, so now what need to do is go

1935
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:53,160
to the

1936
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:55,800
eBay.com, right?

1937
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:59,680
And see the thing.

1938
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:05,520
Okay, so we are navigating to eBay, right?

1939
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:09,000
So now, guys, let's go back in here.

1940
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:13,000
So we have 406

1941
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:16,280
links in here.

1942
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:19,200
So I want to get all of them

1943
02:10:19,720 --> 02:10:25,160
and print them out in my console.

1944
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:25,840
Okay.

1945
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:29,360
How do you think we can do this?

1946
02:10:29,360 --> 02:10:33,440
Any thoughts in here?

1947
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:34,680
Array? Okay.

1948
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:40,600
Anything else?

1949
02:10:40,600 --> 02:10:41,280
Loop. Okay.

1950
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:44,720
That's good.

1951
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:46,640
That length.

1952
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:50,760
So, okay,
before we get into the arrays and length.

1953
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:51,440
Right.

1954
02:10:51,480 --> 02:10:56,680
So where do we store these.

1955
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:00,360
So since before guys before.

1956
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:03,280
If you remember, we were trying to do what

1957
02:11:04,920 --> 02:11:06,760
we are trying to

1958
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:11,920
locate only one element
and we cared about how unique it was.

1959
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:15,600
Right. And we cared about this.

1960
02:11:15,600 --> 02:11:19,200
We really cared about
if it was one of one right,

1961
02:11:19,480 --> 02:11:21,520
because we really wanted it to be unique

1962
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:25,440
because we were interacting
with only one element here.

1963
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:28,560
We interacting with more than one element.

1964
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,320
Okay, so now

1965
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:36,280
it is time for us to use
the Java data structures.

1966
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:40,720
Okay,
so what do we know about collections guys?

1967
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:49,800
What can we use in here from collections?

1968
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:58,800
What kind of container can
we use to put all these elements in there?

1969
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,800
You haven't seen them.

1970
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:10,560
You didn't
you guys didn't cover collections.

1971
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:11,640
How is that possible?

1972
02:12:11,640 --> 02:12:13,880
You guys didn't cover

1973
02:12:14,080 --> 02:12:15,760
the array.

1974
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:27,760
Did you guys cover list? What

1975
02:12:31,560 --> 02:12:32,680
what is the topic you're

1976
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:42,960
on right now?

1977
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:45,240
Encapsulation.

1978
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:47,480
Okay, this is not good.

1979
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:48,880
Okay.

1980
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:54,160
Okay.

1981
02:12:54,160 --> 02:12:58,320
List is only this Saturday.

1982
02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:02,360
A lot of time on reviewing the homework.

1983
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:04,680
Oh, okay.

1984
02:13:05,120 --> 02:13:07,080
Okay. This is really sad.

1985
02:13:07,080 --> 02:13:13,440
You guys,
because we're not going to have fun today.

1986
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:17,040
Okay? All right.

1987
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:22,080
I thought you guys covered this.

1988
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:27,200
This is not good.

1989
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:28,200
Not the end of the class.

1990
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:29,520
I'll show you anyways, guys,

1991
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:32,360
but it would be really good
if you covered this.

1992
02:13:32,360 --> 02:13:36,040
So it's okay

1993
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:40,600
now. I'll show you anyway.

1994
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:42,960
Okay, But that's fine.

1995
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,720
Okay, Let's do this.

1996
02:13:44,720 --> 02:13:45,480
Okay.

1997
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:48,840
So before
we used to find only one element.

1998
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:50,760
Okay?

1999
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:53,680
Before we used to find

2000
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:54,800
only one element.

2001
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:57,840
So now it's time for us to manipulate

2002
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:00,800
with different, different elements.

2003
02:14:01,240 --> 02:14:01,560
Okay?

2004
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:05,520
At the same time,
we won't be able to use our race, guys.

2005
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:08,000
Okay, so here's what I will do.

2006
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:11,640
If you remember before, what we were doing

2007
02:14:11,880 --> 02:14:15,600
is only finding one element.

2008
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:19,600
Okay, so now, since we have a

2009
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:24,520
lot more than we have than we used to
do, right?

2010
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:27,000
So it's more than one right now.

2011
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:32,280
So now what we need to do,
we need to find multiple elements.

2012
02:14:32,440 --> 02:14:32,840
Okay?

2013
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:38,880
So we will be using different
and different elements right now.

2014
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:39,360
Okay.

2015
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:42,960
So I'm going to go ahead
and put find elements now.

2016
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:46,200
And what we're going to do in here,

2017
02:14:48,120 --> 02:14:49,880
we will be

2018
02:14:50,240 --> 02:14:52,240
finding elements by what?

2019
02:14:52,240 --> 02:14:54,480
What am I finding my elements by now?

2020
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:58,400
So if you look here,

2021
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:00,840
what am I getting my all my lengths

2022
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:05,520
by? What is the locator in here

2023
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:14,280
by tag name?

2024
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:15,960
Right, exactly.

2025
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:20,400
So what I will do in here,

2026
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:25,920
I'll do a tag name
and what I can do, I'll just put as

2027
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:29,560
the a tag.

2028
02:15:29,560 --> 02:15:32,200
Okay, So pretty simple.

2029
02:15:32,200 --> 02:15:36,240
And I'm finding now multiple elements

2030
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:39,480
by the tag name.

2031
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:42,840
Okay. Is that clear, Guys,

2032
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,480
any questions on this?

2033
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:47,160
Exactly.

2034
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:51,600
Find element returns only one element
Find elements

2035
02:15:51,720 --> 02:15:55,080
will return you a list of web elements.

2036
02:15:55,560 --> 02:15:56,160
Okay.

2037
02:15:56,160 --> 02:16:00,560
So if you see in here
you're getting in return.

2038
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:03,160
If I can find

2039
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:05,920
find element

2040
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,080
A yet

2041
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:12,240
you are getting less of the web elements.

2042
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:13,800
Okay.

2043
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:18,960
So what I will do, I will simply assign it

2044
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:22,080
to a list of web elements in here.

2045
02:16:22,200 --> 02:16:26,120
I know you guys didn't cover this,
but it's okay.

2046
02:16:26,120 --> 02:16:28,200
So I'm just going to show you this.

2047
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:31,880
Okay.

2048
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:35,480
List of web elements and I can do
all links

2049
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:39,520
is equal to these driver dot

2050
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:43,040
Find elements by the tag name. Okay.

2051
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:46,920
And you can import the list from java.

2052
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:49,920
Util. Okay. Library.

2053
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:52,880
So now guys, what I did in here,

2054
02:16:53,480 --> 02:16:57,880
all these elements are stored inside

2055
02:16:57,880 --> 02:17:01,960
one container.

2056
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:03,200
Is that clear, guys?

2057
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:06,120
So you don't have to understand
this one for now, okay?

2058
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:09,080
Because you guys didn't
cover this for Java.

2059
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:11,240
Okay, so what I did?

2060
02:17:11,240 --> 02:17:15,600
Basically,
I got all those links by the tag name

2061
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:18,040
and I stored them inside the container.

2062
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:23,280
Okay, so now it's time for me to go ahead

2063
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:27,000
and see how many links I have.

2064
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:27,920
Okay.

2065
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:30,440
So I want to print out

2066
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:33,240
the number of links in my console.

2067
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:35,600
Okay.

2068
02:17:35,600 --> 02:17:46,960
So number of links in here, it's
not an integer, it's just a content.

2069
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:49,120
It's a list of the web elements.

2070
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:50,160
Okay?

2071
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:52,960
So that's why what I will do in here,

2072
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:58,200
I'll do all links dot size.

2073
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:01,760
Okay, So in array guys,

2074
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:04,680
you use the you used to use

2075
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:08,280
length

2076
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:12,680
or in in strings you can use length,

2077
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:17,320
but in list you use size.

2078
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:18,240
Okay.

2079
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:20,840
Is that clear, guys?

2080
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:26,840
So whenever you use size,
then it will return you the integer okay,

2081
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:30,440
you can't just use all links this variable

2082
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:32,720
because it won't return you.

2083
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:35,920
The number of the

2084
02:18:37,040 --> 02:18:39,240
of how many elements you have.

2085
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:42,120
Okay, so now let's run this.

2086
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:45,480
Okay, let's run this and see

2087
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:52,840
what's going to happen.

2088
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:54,480
You can't use length, okay?

2089
02:18:54,480 --> 02:18:56,800
Because this is a different data
structure, that's why.

2090
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:59,160
Okay, so we it here.

2091
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:01,880
So now you can see it decreased.

2092
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:03,360
It was 406 before.

2093
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:05,680
So now is 397. Okay.

2094
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:08,840
So if you remember guys

2095
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:11,480
in arrays you use length, length.

2096
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:15,680
So for the list you will be using size.

2097
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:17,480
Okay. So

2098
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,520
So yes, for list

2099
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:24,560
you will be using size for arrays.

2100
02:19:24,560 --> 02:19:29,400
You use length.

2101
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:31,560
I'm not sure why the number decrease guys.

2102
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:34,440
I'm not sure it's
probably something going on with the

2103
02:19:35,880 --> 02:19:37,400
what's called

2104
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:40,200
it's probably something going on
with the website.

2105
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:42,000
Okay. It's not on our side.

2106
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,240
We can't really do anything. Goodbye.

2107
02:19:45,240 --> 02:19:47,120
Okay So now,

2108
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:51,480
guys, since.

2109
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:56,040
So now what I want to do, I want to print

2110
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:58,760
each and every what

2111
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:02,440
Each and every link in my console guys.

2112
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:05,040
So any.

2113
02:20:05,480 --> 02:20:10,760
Any guesses how we can do this?

2114
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:15,480
Now this returns
this size method will return integer only.

2115
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:19,480
Okay, this is not an integer guys.

2116
02:20:19,480 --> 02:20:20,160
Okay.

2117
02:20:22,760 --> 02:20:23,280
All right.

2118
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:26,640
So now we will be using Java, right?

2119
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:31,400
So now we're going to be looping
through each and every element

2120
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:34,200
inside our container.

2121
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:36,360
Okay.

2122
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:39,560
So now let's
go ahead and create a for loop in here.

2123
02:20:40,120 --> 02:20:44,600
So there is one shortcut
I'm pretty sure you guys familiar with

2124
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,640
advanced for loop or for each loop right

2125
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:52,160
there is advanced loop.

2126
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:55,280
Regular loop, right? Or

2127
02:20:55,560 --> 02:20:57,000
okay, good.

2128
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:57,360
All right.

2129
02:20:57,360 --> 02:20:59,760
So there's a shortcut to create a
for each loop.

2130
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:02,880
Okay. In here.

2131
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:04,080
Okay. Yes.

2132
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:06,000
You haven't done for it yet. That's good.

2133
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,520
And you're learning encapsulation already.

2134
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:11,200
Okay. Nice. Okay.

2135
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:11,520
Okay.

2136
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:15,760
So there's shortcut in here
to create a for each What you could do,

2137
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:19,200
you could just write down for each
one here and click enter

2138
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:22,200
and you will have something like this
ugly.

2139
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:25,320
But we don't really need that

2140
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:26,640
like this.

2141
02:21:26,640 --> 02:21:29,520
So let's just take this here. Okay?

2142
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:32,640
So what are we looping through,

2143
02:21:32,640 --> 02:21:39,360
guys?

2144
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:42,600
Links, right? What are what are the links?

2145
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:47,000
So as as far as Selenium objects, guys,

2146
02:21:47,200 --> 02:21:51,680
so the link is what?

2147
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:53,800
It's a web element, right?

2148
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:59,200
So what we do and we're looping
through each and every web element,

2149
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:02,720
Okay, so going to put this in here,

2150
02:22:03,080 --> 02:22:05,880
but we are all our links

2151
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:09,200
are stored inside this container.

2152
02:22:09,720 --> 02:22:12,240
Okay So what I'm going
to do, I'm going to copy this

2153
02:22:13,320 --> 02:22:14,600
paste is in here.

2154
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:18,320
And on the other side
we will have a web element

2155
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:22,880
because we are looping through each
and every web element.

2156
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:25,040
Guys, it's not a string, right?

2157
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:26,400
It's a web element.

2158
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:30,360
So what we can do web element link,
and we're looping through each

2159
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,600
every

2160
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:35,720
element from this container.

2161
02:22:36,080 --> 02:22:36,600
Okay.

2162
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:39,320
So now, guys, I want to

2163
02:22:40,320 --> 02:22:42,840
let me actually print out the

2164
02:22:43,640 --> 02:22:46,680
the text for each and every link.

2165
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,640
So if you go in here,

2166
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:52,480
look, if I inspect this, right.

2167
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:55,920
So is a link, right?
This matters. Our link.

2168
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:57,080
Fashion is a link.

2169
02:22:57,080 --> 02:22:59,160
Electronics is a link.

2170
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:01,680
These are all

2171
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:04,080
elements are links.

2172
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:04,840
Okay.

2173
02:23:04,840 --> 02:23:08,760
And these are what this music deals toys.

2174
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:10,560
What are these for?

2175
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:22,080
For the elements, guys, it's a link text.

2176
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:23,040
Right?

2177
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:27,840
So now what I want to do,
I want to get the text from each

2178
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:32,840
and every web element
that I have in my container.

2179
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:34,440
Okay.

2180
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:41,040
So now if you remember,
we talked about the web

2181
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:44,720
element command,
which is which says get text.

2182
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:47,440
Okay.
So what we are going to be doing now,

2183
02:23:47,480 --> 02:23:51,320
we will be getting
text from each and every

2184
02:23:52,840 --> 02:23:53,920
element.

2185
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:56,000
Okay. So

2186
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:58,920
my link.

2187
02:23:58,920 --> 02:23:59,560
Right.

2188
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:01,200
Get text in here.

2189
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:02,760
What am I getting in return?

2190
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:12,160
Guy? See, I'm
getting in return a string, right?

2191
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:15,000
So I can do string

2192
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:15,360
link.

2193
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:18,080
Text is equal to this.

2194
02:24:18,480 --> 02:24:21,320
Let's actually simplify.

2195
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:21,880
Okay.

2196
02:24:21,880 --> 02:24:24,360
So now what I simply want to do,

2197
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:27,240
I want to print this

2198
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:31,080
link text in my console.

2199
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:33,160
Okay, so now let's run this, guys.

2200
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:37,360
Okay, let's run this and see

2201
02:24:37,400 --> 02:24:45,920
what's going to happen.

2202
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:48,600
Okay. When navigated to IB.

2203
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:51,200
Okay, now let's pay attention to our

2204
02:24:55,520 --> 02:25:01,480
console.

2205
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:02,080
Okay.

2206
02:25:02,400 --> 02:25:03,400
Nothing's popping out.

2207
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:06,560
Beautiful. Why?

2208
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:11,840
Nothing is happening, guys.

2209
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:13,280
Any thoughts?

2210
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:23,960
Your computer shut down.

2211
02:25:23,960 --> 02:25:24,880
All yours is good.

2212
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:30,960
Okay, that's good.

2213
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:34,200
Okay. Okay.

2214
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:36,120
So you getting a lot of them, right?

2215
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:38,360
Okay, so this is really weird.

2216
02:25:38,360 --> 02:25:51,440
Why mine is not working.

2217
02:25:51,440 --> 02:25:53,040
Well, Yeah.

2218
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:58,200
Okay, good.

2219
02:25:58,200 --> 02:26:00,960
Okay, maybe I.
Oh, there we go. Now we're talking.

2220
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:02,600
Okay, I have to scroll down.

2221
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:04,920
Okay. Okay, Now we're talking.

2222
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:05,360
Okay.

2223
02:26:05,360 --> 02:26:06,040
There we go.

2224
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:09,400
So we have a lot of stuff in here,
right? So.

2225
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:13,000
But see, guys in here, what I am seeing

2226
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:16,160
is something empty

2227
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:22,200
in here. Why?

2228
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:24,680
Why am I getting so many spaces in here?

2229
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:28,760
Guys?

2230
02:26:28,760 --> 02:26:30,840
Are those the hidden links?

2231
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:33,160
Or they

2232
02:26:33,160 --> 02:26:37,080
might be the links with no text on them.

2233
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:38,760
Okay, there we go.

2234
02:26:38,760 --> 02:26:42,520
So they might be links,
but there's no text for those.

2235
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:45,480
Okay.

2236
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:46,400
All right.

2237
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:50,480
19 to 21 because we have a container

2238
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:55,720
on line 16 and we want to go through each

2239
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:59,480
and every element from that container.

2240
02:27:00,440 --> 02:27:01,120
Okay.

2241
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:05,960
And then what we need to do, we want to
get the text and print that text.

2242
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:11,640
Okay, list is like an array,
but it's a little different.

2243
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:14,480
So you guys are going to cover this
this weekend.

2244
02:27:14,480 --> 02:27:17,600
I'm really surprised
you guys didn't cover this.

2245
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:18,520
Okay.

2246
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:20,040
But it's okay.

2247
02:27:20,040 --> 02:27:22,920
So it should be straightforward.

2248
02:27:22,920 --> 02:27:24,680
It's not that difficult.

2249
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:27,400
Okay.

2250
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:28,640
Okay, guys.

2251
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:31,600
So now what I want to do, I want to print

2252
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:35,640
only the text,

2253
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:39,000
which has an actual value.

2254
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:47,680
You guys, how would I do this?

2255
02:27:47,680 --> 02:27:52,760
Am I and Asger
going to have a boxing match now?

2256
02:27:52,760 --> 02:27:53,480
Not really.

2257
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:55,240
I'll probably win

2258
02:27:55,240 --> 02:28:02,880
anyways, but we'll see.

2259
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:03,600
Okay.

2260
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:08,440
Yeah.

2261
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:09,520
This is fun, guys.

2262
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:10,920
I'm telling you

2263
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:12,560
is this is the fun.

2264
02:28:12,560 --> 02:28:15,400
Okay? Yeah.

2265
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:17,320
Ask him on Saturday. That's fine.

2266
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:19,600
Go ahead, guys. Okay.

2267
02:28:19,720 --> 02:28:20,640
All right.

2268
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:21,200
Okay, guys.

2269
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:27,760
So now I only want to print the text,
which only has the values.

2270
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:30,760
Guys, how would I do this

2271
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:35,000
is empty.

2272
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,160
Absolutely right.

2273
02:28:36,160 --> 02:28:39,600
So only if my condition.

2274
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:42,480
Only if my text is not empty.

2275
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:45,120
I want to print that out. Right.

2276
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:50,640
So if my link text

2277
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:54,840
is not empty, right?

2278
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:57,520
Only if it's not empty,

2279
02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:04,480
what I am going to do,
I am going to print this out.

2280
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:09,080
Okay.

2281
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:09,480
All right.

2282
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:15,040
So let's run this.

2283
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:18,600
Let's run this
and see if we can get anything in here.

2284
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:29,880
Okay?

2285
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:31,040
We're getting this again.

2286
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:31,440
Okay.

2287
02:29:31,440 --> 02:29:41,120
Beautiful.

2288
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:44,520
Okay.

2289
02:29:44,520 --> 02:29:45,600
I need to remove this.

2290
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:48,600
Guys. Right.

2291
02:29:49,080 --> 02:29:49,520
Okay,

2292
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:51,800
Move this.

2293
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:54,360
Okay. It's

2294
02:29:54,560 --> 02:30:02,040
around this again.

2295
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:03,080
Okay, so now not.

2296
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:06,880
This should work.

2297
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:07,800
Okay.

2298
02:30:07,880 --> 02:30:10,560
Navigates here.

2299
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:12,880
Obviously works.

2300
02:30:13,560 --> 02:30:14,520
Yep. There you go.

2301
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:19,400
So it's printing now,
but there's no spaces, anything.

2302
02:30:19,920 --> 02:30:24,160
So we printed all the

2303
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:27,120
all the link texts which are.

2304
02:30:27,240 --> 02:30:29,880
Which have only values.

2305
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:30,960
Right.

2306
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:35,240
So now, guys, what I want to do in here,

2307
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:38,880
I want to print the links as well.

2308
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:42,040
So I want to see the links for advanced.

2309
02:30:42,200 --> 02:30:44,280
I want to see the link for sign in.

2310
02:30:44,440 --> 02:30:47,280
I want to see the link for register

2311
02:30:47,480 --> 02:30:50,520
right by right after this.

2312
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:51,600
Okay.

2313
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:53,680
So can we do this?

2314
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:56,080
Hopefully, yes. Right.

2315
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:58,280
So now, guys, the only

2316
02:30:59,920 --> 02:31:02,280
command left for us

2317
02:31:02,280 --> 02:31:05,720
to use is get attribute.

2318
02:31:06,440 --> 02:31:08,760
Okay, where is our link

2319
02:31:08,760 --> 02:31:13,520
is specified in our html
guys under what actually execute

2320
02:31:16,760 --> 02:31:18,160
on their address.

2321
02:31:18,160 --> 02:31:18,600
Right.

2322
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:22,560
So if you look in here
a trough eBay feed or whatever.

2323
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:23,240
Right.

2324
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:26,240
So see if we have any different ones

2325
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:31,080
of this

2326
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,880
see in here.

2327
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:33,760
So there we go.

2328
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:36,760
So we have a trough
and then another link, right?

2329
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:41,880
So when we use this get attribute guides,

2330
02:31:42,280 --> 02:31:47,680
it will not get the attribute itself,
but it will get the value of,

2331
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:50,640
the attribute we will be providing.

2332
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:53,760
Okay, Is that clear, guys?

2333
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:57,760
So the attribute we provide

2334
02:31:57,760 --> 02:32:01,280
by using get attribute method,

2335
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:05,520
it will get the attribute itself,
but it will get the value.

2336
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:09,480
Okay, so let's go back in here.

2337
02:32:10,440 --> 02:32:13,240
So what I am going to now in here,

2338
02:32:14,200 --> 02:32:18,120
I'm going to do link dot

2339
02:32:18,800 --> 02:32:22,920
get attribute and what is the attribute
we need in here guys.

2340
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:26,240
We need an address attribute,

2341
02:32:26,840 --> 02:32:31,040
right?

2342
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:34,520
The link would not be clickable
in the result.

2343
02:32:34,720 --> 02:32:37,480
Right now we don't really care
about the click ability.

2344
02:32:37,880 --> 02:32:40,480
Right. Right now we are caring.

2345
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,120
We care about capturing that length.

2346
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Okay, we're going to capture the link

2347
02:32:47,240 --> 02:32:49,520
and then what we're going to do,
we're going to print it out.

2348
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:55,320
Okay, So now
we're going to do a track in here because

2349
02:32:55,320 --> 02:33:01,120
all our links, any link, will be stored
inside that, a track attribute, right?

2350
02:33:01,560 --> 02:33:04,120
So it's going to return me

2351
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:12,360
a string value as well.

2352
02:33:12,360 --> 02:33:13,120
Okay.

2353
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:17,440
So now, guys,
what I need to what I see in here

2354
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:21,120
this full link is going to be my link.

2355
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:24,200
And now what I can do in here

2356
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:31,600
is just put some space in here and last

2357
02:33:33,120 --> 02:33:34,600
full length, okay?

2358
02:33:34,600 --> 02:33:38,120
Only if link text is not empty,

2359
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:43,080
I will print out the link
text and I will print out the link

2360
02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:47,040
itself.

2361
02:33:47,040 --> 02:33:55,280
Okay.

2362
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:56,960
So I'm running this right now.

2363
02:33:56,960 --> 02:33:58,560
So let's go ahead and see.

2364
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:02,880
So if this is going to work, there we go.

2365
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:06,360
So if you look in our console

2366
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:13,280
right now, we have the text

2367
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:18,560
and the link itself
right by its side, right?

2368
02:34:18,560 --> 02:34:25,440
So we captured all the link texts
and the links themselves

2369
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:28,440
by getting the text
and getting the attribute values

2370
02:34:28,800 --> 02:34:31,200
and printing them inside

2371
02:34:33,480 --> 02:34:35,160
inside the console.

2372
02:34:35,160 --> 02:34:40,440
Okay, Pretty cool, right?

2373
02:34:40,440 --> 02:34:45,600
This was the fun part, but I think Asghar
ruined it because he didn't cover list.

2374
02:34:46,680 --> 02:34:47,280
Okay.

2375
02:34:47,560 --> 02:34:49,520
But anyways, it's pretty cool guys.

2376
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:52,920
We just, we just written what,
five lines of code in here

2377
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:59,080
and we have this kind of outcome in here.

2378
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:01,200
Okay, so this is pretty cool

2379
02:35:02,120 --> 02:35:05,360
working with the get attribute
and get text.

2380
02:35:05,360 --> 02:35:09,320
So now guys, we,
you know all the commands, right

2381
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:12,320
for the web elements.

2382
02:35:12,320 --> 02:35:15,560
You know a little bit
about the list in here.

2383
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:16,800
Okay.

2384
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:19,880
But you're going to be covering it
in more details

2385
02:35:19,880 --> 02:35:22,200
this weekend So

2386
02:35:26,040 --> 02:35:29,200
it's not that difficult guys

2387
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:31,320
so yeah here

2388
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:35,360
and then we started actually
using the logic from Java, right?

2389
02:35:35,360 --> 02:35:39,000
We're not only doing
clicks and keys and everything,

2390
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:43,320
but we using Java language and building
Java.

2391
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:48,880
Logic's in here as well.

2392
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:52,760
How you will be teaching lists now. Yes.

2393
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:56,160
Teach list So as dark

2394
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:03,160
we're going to be
using a lot of Java. Yes.

2395
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:06,680
So we will be integrating Java
with selenium.

2396
02:36:06,680 --> 02:36:07,400
Okay.

2397
02:36:07,440 --> 02:36:10,040
So, so selenium

2398
02:36:10,040 --> 02:36:12,920
is for you to perform actions
on the web page.

2399
02:36:13,080 --> 02:36:16,080
Java is to build that logic. Okay.

2400
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:19,760
So like we did today,
the logic is built by the for loop

2401
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:24,200
and for loops are coming from Java,
but getting the text,

2402
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:27,760
getting the attribute right,
these are coming from Selenium.

2403
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:28,560
So we're basically

2404
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:32,560
using two different tools
in order to have some different outcomes.

2405
02:36:32,560 --> 02:36:38,400
Okay.

2406
02:36:38,400 --> 02:36:39,320
There you go.

2407
02:36:39,320 --> 02:36:41,840
Yes, do this. Do this to us. Go. Okay.

2408
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:46,880
Tell them to at you first

2409
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:49,400
tomorrow review.

2410
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:50,720
I'm not sure.

2411
02:36:50,720 --> 02:36:51,720
I don't know what was.

2412
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:54,600
I'm has on his

2413
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:59,320
on his notes
pretty much I'm sure you will be covering

2414
02:36:59,560 --> 02:37:03,560
some of these classes.

2415
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:05,840
That's why you're learning Java.
Absolutely right.

2416
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:09,360
Because your whole logic
will be going through the Java guys.

2417
02:37:10,080 --> 02:37:15,000
Okay.

2418
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,520
Using pairing.

2419
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:18,200
Absolutely.

2420
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:18,960
You guys,

2421
02:37:18,960 --> 02:37:24,440
you will be using all the parent classes,
children, neighbors, whatever it is.

2422
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:25,080
Right.

2423
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:28,320
So you will be using
a lot of polymorphism.

2424
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:30,480
You will be using a lot of inheritance.

2425
02:37:30,480 --> 02:37:31,760
Okay.

2426
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:34,920
I'm not sure if we're going to be
using a lot of encapsulation,

2427
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:39,360
but you will be using a lot of inheritance

2428
02:37:39,360 --> 02:37:43,800
and polymorphism.

2429
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:44,400
All right.

2430
02:37:44,400 --> 02:37:46,200
So let me see.

2431
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:48,920
Okay. Homework, guys.

2432
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:52,240
Let me check.

2433
02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:53,480
Okay. I need to

2434
02:37:56,280 --> 02:37:57,920
log in from here,

2435
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:59,000
look out

2436
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:20,960
and know.

2437
02:38:20,960 --> 02:38:25,720
Okay.

2438
02:38:25,720 --> 02:38:27,840
Okay. So three tasks for you.

2439
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:32,280
Okay, guys,

2440
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:35,440
Three tasks for you.

2441
02:38:35,440 --> 02:38:37,400
I will push the code. Okay.

2442
02:38:37,400 --> 02:38:40,320
Any suggestions for websites

2443
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:43,320
to practice to practice Java or

2444
02:38:43,320 --> 02:38:48,320
which one?

2445
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:49,680
Selenium. Not really.

2446
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:50,080
You could just

2447
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:52,280
Google selenium practice
and it's going to give you

2448
02:38:52,280 --> 02:38:53,840
a lot of different websites, guys.

2449
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:58,800
Okay.

2450
02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:04,960
For Java, there are some late code, but
that's that's really advanced stuff guys.

2451
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:05,760
Okay.

2452
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:08,960
So late code.

2453
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:11,960
And then I forgot what the other one was,

2454
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:15,560
but meet code I think it's it's

2455
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:21,200
you need to pay for that.

2456
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:22,040
Yeah, it's been a while.

2457
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:33,000
I didn't really look into these practicing
websites. Yes.

2458
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,560
I'll post the course announcements
in class announcement.

2459
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:37,600
Let me explain you what it is, guys.

2460
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:41,400
Okay,
so first of all, what you want to do?

2461
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:42,440
You want to

2462
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:47,040
go to this website which is here.

2463
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:47,880
Okay.

2464
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:51,080
And then log in. Okay.

2465
02:39:51,080 --> 02:39:57,000
I put the username and password in here.

2466
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:58,000
What you want to do?

2467
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:02,600
You want to log in?

2468
02:40:02,600 --> 02:40:02,920
Okay.

2469
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:06,720
When you logged in, I want you to verify

2470
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:09,000
that this logo is displayed.

2471
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:11,000
Okay?

2472
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:14,720
And then you can quit the browser.

2473
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:18,120
So the second one,

2474
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:21,480
what you want to do is the same thing
as we did for eBay.

2475
02:40:21,800 --> 02:40:24,440
But you're going to be doing it
for Amazon.

2476
02:40:24,440 --> 02:40:26,880
Okay, Get all the links from Amazon, get

2477
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:30,040
the text,
the links themselves and print them out.

2478
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:33,200
Okay, second one is easy as well.

2479
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:36,080
So now

2480
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:39,320
the third guys.

2481
02:40:39,320 --> 02:40:42,560
Third one, what you want to do is

2482
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:47,880
go in here, let me logged out.

2483
02:40:47,880 --> 02:40:50,120
Okay, so you want to

2484
02:40:51,480 --> 02:40:55,680
go to this page, enter the valid username

2485
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:59,400
and leave the password

2486
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:02,720
field empty and click on login.

2487
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:03,680
Okay.

2488
02:41:03,680 --> 02:41:07,120
When you click on log in, verify that this

2489
02:41:08,200 --> 02:41:10,480
message is displayed on the page.

2490
02:41:11,320 --> 02:41:14,480
Okay, guys,

2491
02:41:14,480 --> 02:41:19,640
is that clear?

2492
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:20,520
Okay.

2493
02:41:21,120 --> 02:41:21,480
All right.

2494
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:26,840
Seems like you guys like the
like the task, so that's good.

2495
02:41:26,840 --> 02:41:27,160
All right.

2496
02:41:27,160 --> 02:41:30,800
I'll be giving you more attacks
diff and further classes.

2497
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:31,720
Okay, guys.

2498
02:41:31,720 --> 02:41:34,200
So please
complete this until the next week.

2499
02:41:35,720 --> 02:41:39,240
And please pay attention
to the collections that you will be doing.

2500
02:41:39,240 --> 02:41:40,320
It would ask.

2501
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:43,200
Okay,
so those collections are really, really

2502
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:46,560
important guys.

2503
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:51,840
We will be using them a lot in Selenium
as well.

2504
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:52,560
Okay.

2505
02:41:54,440 --> 02:41:56,080
All right.

2506
