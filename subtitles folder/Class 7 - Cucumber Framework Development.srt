1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,440
All right,

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,240
guys, let me.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,480
Yes, ma'am.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
Got to get

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,160
last number.

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,760
Students, seven

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,400
points.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,960
Start with

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,320
the get.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,040
Okay, guys, I'm not talking about trivial.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,280
I'm talking about class number six.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,720
What are the things we learn in the class
number six?

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,360
Tell me

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,800
which object model design paper on file.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,160
So now we'll start from page.

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,960
Object model Design

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,880
images.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,440
What is beige object model Design.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,800
Let me call it design.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:31,560
What is the reason we call it design?

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,320
High school.

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,880
Okay.

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,640
Well, it is a pattern to organize a code.

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,680
Right. And expect.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,920
So basically, basically,
according to this, on

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,840
whatever
the screens we have in our application,

27
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,640
according to those screens,
we create separate classes.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,920
Right.

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,680
We create separate classes

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,640
according to this concept,
according to this pattern in our framework

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,920
and in these respective classes,
we put all the Lupita's all the functions

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,600
which belong to this particular screen
in the application.

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,440
What example,
if we talk about loading screen, right?

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,560
So in login,
we have a login page in our application

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,720
for that, we created one particular page

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,840
which is log in Beach.

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,240
Now all the

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,520
locators are related
to this particular login page.

39
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,720
Your username be your password,
be your logging button.

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,480
Your error message may be forgot password
link if exist.

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,160
Maybe a logo.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,360
Maybe something else.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,600
If all this locators
you want to protect one please.

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,800
Then very
you will put all of these things.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,280
You will put these locators in Laguna
Beach plus

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,160
in Laguna Beach class.

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
What is the reason behind this?

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,920
Because if I'm using this particular

49
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,760
username and password see log,
it is kind of mandatory operation.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,360
Without log in,
we cannot perform any of the operation.

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,720
So if I had 1000 guests

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,000
in 1000 because this I have to call this

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,040
driver or client element,
I need to use a name.

54
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,360
And equanimity was name
because it is a we.

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,600
Now let's consider tomorrow.

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,880
The leopard is always instead late.

57
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,440
So if developers change in this username
and password for you

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,480
something for example, the locator
which we are using it change the locator.

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,200
The locator.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,840
You have to change this locator 1000.

61
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,280
This is now because you're calling
this particular one it 1000.

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,440
This is where 96, by the way, that I.D.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,840
raid.
So your maintenance name will increase

64
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,480
because of small change
in the application.

65
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,960
So your framework is prone to change

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,360
and your maintenance time is going high.

67
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,320
Right.

68
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,520
So to avoid this problem,
to get rid of this issue.

69
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,560
What we have to do, we have to change this
only in design method.

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,600
So according to page object modern design,
by then we can keep this new data

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,880
in one place and everywhere, wherever

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,840
I want to use this particular locator
instead of using this idea.

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,000
But what I can use,
I can simply use one particular key right?

74
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,440
So now my key is being called everywhere

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,760
and my locator is placed in one place.

76
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,120
Maybe someone might look at a desert,
one place only.

77
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,360
This time
instead of changing it 1000 places.

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,040
I have to change it.

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,480
One place, right?

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,560
And then one change
will fix to my entire script.

81
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,800
So it will going to save my name.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
It will make my framework more robust.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,200
And the tool

84
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,120
industrial everyone.

85
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,560
So now page object model design better

86
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,640
allows us to

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,760
create

88
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,600
pages

89
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,080
according to the screen.

90
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,720
Plus this new

91
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,400
is according

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
to the

93
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,360
ages.

94
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,760
The application

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
replace

96
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,920
all those

97
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,760
functions

98
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,280
functions

99
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,000
of this particular

100
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,760
class into this particular page

101
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,880
and it's printed class

102
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,160
A. Now,
let me give you one just one example.

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,480
Right in that one
example would be more than enough scene

104
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,240
I am providing here.

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,680
This time you'll see

106
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,080
if I open this page.

107
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,760
Right.

108
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,160
Let's add this one employee search.

109
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,280
You'll see in the background
I'm providing user clicks on log input

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,960
rate, user interface valid
a domain of user name and password.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,760
Correct

112
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,560
categories.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,480
So here you see
user name begins to employee list.

114
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,760
Now, precondition
I already provide precondition.

115
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,440
I already provide in my

116
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,080
command, in my

117
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,680
background.

118
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,400
Really?

119
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,040
Exactly.

120
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,240
Preconditions.

121
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,880
We have already provided in books.

122
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,400
So my precondition it means open browser
method is being closed from my books.

123
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,280
Right.

124
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,920
Then again, I see a lot of information
is available right in this background.

125
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,160
Now see how I can replace
how I can replace

126
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,640
these three steps right into one.

127
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,440
What I can do.

128
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,920
I will simply go in my login feature

129
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,240
and you see this is my log.

130
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,320
Integrate

131
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,080
students.

132
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,040
Now, in this login page,
I'm going to write here one thing.

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,160
Public void

134
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,280
log Sinek

135
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,680
and I'm writing here.

136
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,640
See username.

137
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,960
Please don't send cookies.

138
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,640
So their data is coming from my history.

139
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,680
It could be any string they

140
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
and then

141
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
password on send

142
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,960
keys.

143
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,480
Then come password.

144
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,200
So here.

145
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,320
Now see this username

146
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,600
and password

147
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,240
arguments.

148
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm calling in my log in function.

149
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,480
Correct? Correct.

150
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,000
Now, now what I'm going to do is here.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
See here.

152
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,760
If I go instead of writing
these three lines, read these three lines.

153
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,080
We will put this new little successfully
logged in.

154
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,160
Read a solution. Also, they're not ready.

155
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,840
So what I'm doing is this time
I'm going to write here, right?

156
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,760
I'm going to write here.

157
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,920
Very simple function this time, see?

158
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,880
And what function I'm going to write.

159
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,840
I'm going to write here.

160
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,280
End user is logged in

161
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,440
with valid, valid

162
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,360
email credentials

163
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,080
and credentials.

164
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,960
So now see, this time
what's going to happen?

165
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,600
I'm going to commit these three lines

166
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,800
Instead of these three lines,
my one step will work and

167
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,400
it will start with the end.

168
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,600
Yes, you can start
even with stocks as well.

169
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Trade.

170
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,760
Let me start with when nothing

171
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,640
legally nothing

172
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,960
you can start with.

173
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,600
Then you can start with
and also write both because in given

174
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,960
you don't know
how many actions are performing,

175
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,040
it's a precondition
you've already provided.

176
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,360
And I told you,
even if you provide only start

177
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,840
as street sign, that is also fine.

178
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
That is also fine.

179
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,160
Correct.

180
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,720
So now then we can replace this
three steps with just one.

181
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,880
Now, this time
because of using one particular function.

182
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,640
So every time I don't need to call,
see here now, every time I don't need

183
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,760
to call this log in page, start
logging button, don't click everywhere.

184
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,960
Right.
Or this two steps everywhere instead.

185
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,560
Now I can simply create one step
and then one step I'm going

186
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,240
to call one function from my actual page
and that function will work.

187
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,000
So how?

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,520
Let me show you this time when I go here,

189
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,160
Let's see in my employee feature,
I think employee search feature, right?

190
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,840
Employee search feature.

191
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,360
I'm going to write this for best.

192
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,720
Let's say, and let's create this template.

193
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,440
So I am writing here Test

194
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,160
now. We'll see what I'm going to do.

195
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,840
First, I'm going to create a step for this

196
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,120
particular one, right
and is equal to true.

197
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
I'm like, forgot that.

198
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,280
Yes, I forgot that.

199
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,640
Let me do it.

200
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,200
Yes, Yes.

201
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,880
Anyway, it will give me
it will give me the step.

202
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,760
Yeah.

203
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,640
It gave me this to see that you.

204
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,480
So let me copy.

205
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,480
This is Tidbinbilla is full login
credentials in which

206
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,240
each of the steps
I have to put this function

207
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,360
log in the steps
in which page I have to put this

208
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,400
in login page played in log in steps.

209
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,320
Fine.

210
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,720
So let me put this function here.

211
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,520
See how this things work now

212
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,200
instead of calling username,
password and login button.

213
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,280
This time I'm going to call for this page.

214
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,600
Log in page dot.

215
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,280
Can you see it is giving me the function
logging function based

216
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,160
logging function.

217
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,920
Now tell me this data
we can call from here

218
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,880
username and password.

219
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,360
We can call from various

220
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,680
where we have username

221
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,080
and password in my configurator.

222
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,160
Remember

223
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,760
I'm on

224
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,520
guys configurator

225
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,360
dot property value username

226
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
I can provide right case

227
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,520
basis description.

228
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:44,160
Not any.

229
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,480
Is it correct?

230
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,920
Is this correct?

231
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,080
But one more thing.

232
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,360
Yet after the username and password

233
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,080
I have to call log in Bertelsmann

234
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,840
database

235
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,920
logging button.

236
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,480
Don't click.

237
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,000
So now my this logging

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,240
function is having entering
the username field

239
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
password functionality and log in within
doc click functionality.

240
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,120
Correct?

241
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,600
Correct.

242
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,960
Makes sense.

243
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,640
And this function
I'm coming here in my log in.

244
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,040
So now if you see my
if you look at my agents

245
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,680
in any of here now
see it's converted to just a one line.

246
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,280
Just one line instead

247
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:50,320
of three names.

248
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,480
So now let me show you
how these two scenarios work.

249
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,080
I'm going to change the tag for these two.

250
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,600
And this time I'm going to run it.

251
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
Let's see

252
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,360
this run smoke

253
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,200
working

254
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,960
fine, taking the data.

255
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,560
Right?

256
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,400
Whatever the field I want to take the data
from.

257
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,680
Right.
You're just picking exactly from there.

258
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
And this now this time function, I'm

259
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,080
calling from my perspective page
object model designed.

260
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,520
Right.

261
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,520
So similarly for all the other class, this

262
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,320
we can write the functions
in the respective pages, right?

263
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,240
If you want.

264
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
Right now
we don't need that much a function,

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,800
so we're not going to call all of those
functions into the respective pages.

266
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,360
But you'll see here
I just made one function along

267
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,240
with the locators in one particular class
according to Beach Object model design.

268
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,400
By then in when I actually implemented
and called it in my particular step.

269
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,680
Right, it's working extremely fine.

270
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,560
So the intention
was to remove overall steps

271
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,240
and then after execution,
if I look at this part,

272
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,720
if I look at this bar, PFC,
instead of providing three steps grade,

273
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,600
I provided just one step where it is
working fine.

274
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,480
Mention the basic
and you see that to get accomplished.

275
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Whatever we were looking forward to,
we got that.

276
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,080
Similarly, we can change whatever
we want to change in wherever we see, or

277
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,680
we can call this particular
one in a big jump.

278
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
We can go and find no issues

279
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,520
so far.

280
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,440
Any questions in this part?

281
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,560
Students

282
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
No question.

283
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,480
Clear.

284
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,160
Yes, sir. Why not?

285
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,680
So what I did, what you what I did
this particular code

286
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,720
instead of calling this username
and password, we don't.

287
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,520
Same is everywhere.

288
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,280
Everywhere in other classes.

289
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,760
Also like creating the object
of this class log in page

290
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,840
dot username logging
based out of my spawn.

291
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,400
Logging
based on the log in content. Right.

292
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,360
And then performing operations.

293
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,800
I'm calling
what particular function. Right.

294
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:33,320
So that function I created in my page
itself, again, I'm depleting my words.

295
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,560
I am creating my page
and contributing a function

296
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,800
in the page itself, in the ad
and also in background.

297
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
They are seen in both scenarios.

298
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,960
Yes. Got it.

299
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,000
Got it.

300
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I can go to the next what we did.

301
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,840
So one step we didn't
because we added in background example

302
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,960
simple would.

303
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,640
Yes. Yes. Correct.

304
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,920
So next time I don't need to call logging
dot username door

305
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,600
and then call that little bit of the key
from the configurator.

306
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,600
Instead, just call this logging function
every then you don't need to write

307
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,160
even multiple steps in feature file
when you use any

308
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,600
when logging in password
and click on logging button.

309
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,720
Not just one
particular step in feature file

310
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,760
will handle all user is logged

311
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,080
in with admin credentials.

312
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,120
Correct.

313
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,440
So just single line single line function.

314
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,680
We will call in that function
with postpandemic work.

315
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
If we get the username and password
from configurator

316
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,840
member configured proper.

317
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,400
These is the file in which we mention

318
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,640
it automatically from logging,
which is going to be correct,

319
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,720
in which we mention user name and password
rate.

320
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,840
MySQL in configurator is the class
in which we are actually

321
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,880
reading the properties we have mentioned
in confidence properties by.

322
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,600
Okay, so config reader is nothing

323
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,080
but a function but a function right?

324
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,920
That is reading the code,
reading the properties from configure

325
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,560
properties like okay
this is my is Dempsey.

326
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,080
So now in business
that what I'm doing instead of calling

327
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,960
like this log in username and password
and simply calling log in page

328
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,560
the object of my plus function
and in this function

329
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,560
because I need to pass username
and password, I'm simply passing username

330
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,160
from my config properties contributor
and password also from confidence

331
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,320
rate is equal name record

332
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,880
students.

333
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,120
This part you know even how we are getting
this username and password.

334
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,640
This part you know when you well right.

335
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,320
This is the object of your login page.

336
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,640
Correct and this is the function.

337
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,160
So everything is treated
and explained individually.

338
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,960
The first one is the object of the class.

339
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,080
Let's take in log.

340
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,240
It is the function that we have defined
in that particular log beach class.

341
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,200
And then that look, the arguments
which we are passing, the parameters

342
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,160
which we are passing in,
passing it from our configurator

343
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,200
class, Any questions
so far in this particular part?

344
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,800
Any question

345
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,880
nutrition

346
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,520
methods could be good or not.

347
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,920
And when you push

348
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:04,960
open, shall we cross it further?

349
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,880
No. Students

350
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,200
where it shows error like this.

351
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,440
Very serious. So one,

352
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,400
let me show you my code.

353
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
We just executed
this code red C noida. Don.

354
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:38,560
It's working fine.

355
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,560
The government says please ask

356
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,200
why do we have a printed in the light
above

357
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:09,400
here?

358
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,560
This one

359
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,120
then this one.

360
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,920
This particular one.

361
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,720
Because.

362
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,760
Because we were passing it
right for the verification.

363
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,200
So what kind of user we are passing,

364
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,040
whether we passing admin user
or we are passing something else.

365
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,400
Right.

366
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,840
So that's why when you created

367
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,600
this particular one, C is doing admin,
we are handling

368
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,800
MAID,
so we must, we must have passed this.

369
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,480
Let me open my log in feature.

370
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,680
See here.

371
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,680
That's one because I wanted to check
remember

372
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,600
welcome admin text we got when we enter
when we logged in as an admin user.

373
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,880
So when we logged in

374
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,480
as an admin use of the message,
we got this welcome data, we got it.

375
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,040
So we need to capture
that particular part.

376
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,280
I told you in the class three, I believe

377
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,040
Class four I believe it was class
three of Class four.

378
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,280
Then I told you that this particular
username

379
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,680
and password
example staple is not limited to one.

380
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,760
Is that right?

381
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,360
We can use this case in multiple steps.

382
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,120
So intentionally I provided keys both
using one step and third in another one,

383
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,440
and then we can verify it either
with the existence of this particular

384
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,400
look at what I did or you can get captured
that based on this welcome any grade.

385
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,640
So you can see which is this.

386
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,040
I told you,
you can handle it and you can use it.

387
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:41,800
Right.

388
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,480
So the intention was to show you
in the case that we provided examples

389
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,560
table is not limited to just one step
because before that

390
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,600
we were doing all of those things
in one step right here.

391
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,960
Also, be positive in one step. So where

392
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,920
you know, some people are

393
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,840
passing the data in one step here,
so you're passing the data in one step.

394
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,840
So that's why I should to give you

395
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,320
the difference
in between data table and example.

396
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,240
Stupid.

397
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,840
Anyways, what is the difference
between detectible and examples?

398
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,120
Table students?

399
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:26,200
Jimmy, come on,
what is the difference in someone?

400
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,560
Data table walks only it one step made.

401
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,480
But when we talk about examples table,
we can use it for the whole scenario.

402
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,640
That's what we are doing here.

403
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,400
They do not see we are passing the data
in multiple systems we are passing.

404
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,960
This gives in multiple steps.

405
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,200
So what holds the nebulas?

406
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,200
It will work.

407
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,080
Now you got 1.3.

408
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,440
Still, if you have any question,
please feel free to ask.

409
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,960
I would be more than happy to answer. So.

410
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,160
All right,

411
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,440
guys, now

412
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,800
now let's talk about ones that you come

413
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,880
ready to learn something new again.

414
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,920
Students

415
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,200
Great.

416
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:36,240
If you guys are attentive in the class
today, I will leave your class to a great.

417
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,560
If I followed you, then I take it then.

418
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,800
Yeah, I'm doing it anyway.

419
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,880
Next to start.

420
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,560
See? Don't leave us

421
00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:02,960
nice and easy.

422
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,920
Not too good.

423
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:10,560
Seriously.

424
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,640
Okay.

425
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,960
Three, maybe three.

426
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,080
Five is very early.

427
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:27,680
It's too early to hit.

428
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,400
Final

429
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,360
race winner in drink username

430
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
or let's say I'm

431
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,320
a great password.

432
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,280
Great.

433
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,080
Right?

434
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:49,320
I was talking about 3 minutes
and Nicola was asking for 5 minutes.

435
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,760
Okay.

436
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
Or or let's say one more thing.

437
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,120
See, let me give you one more example.

438
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,560
He had been enforcing this username
or password or I'm passing

439
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,320
data, so let's see.

440
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,400
I want to bust employ Addy.

441
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,080
I want to bust in 8786 right.

442
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,280
This is the employee I.D.

443
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,240
I want to pass now.

444
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,560
Tell me if I'm busting seven, eight, six
as an input employee.

445
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,760
Right.

446
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,680
And I provide a solution
using normally daughter

447
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,440
gives method and providing 7x6
in this particular field.

448
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,720
Okay.

449
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,400
Yet I'm providing plus name using same
gives middle name using psyche's last name

450
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,240
using changes and employ it using same 776
Now when it comes to a solution,

451
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,320
I provide a solution a set dot
assert equals two values I should expect.

452
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,480
One is expected, one is action.

453
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,920
So one is coming from my feature
frame through

454
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,560
which I am providing the data here.

455
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,960
All right.

456
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,120
So again, what I'm going to capture
this particular employee

457
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,680
after paying the employer getting and then
these two expected in actual values.

458
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm going to compare using the solutions.

459
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
That's what we generally do.

460
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,880
Correct?

461
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,800
Correct.

462
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,600
Now, now if I use the same gives

463
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,480
method here
and I provide seven, eight, six.

464
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,640
Right.

465
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,360
You'll see already one employee
an existing here.

466
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,640
Can you see
and if I provided 76 what would happen

467
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,840
the employee and becomes 245411076.

468
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,480
So in this case my assertion is
going to be parsed or three

469
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,280
being made to feel

470
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,520
similarly when you work in real time
technicians, when you work in building

471
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,640
projects, right, So you are more likely
to get the fix where you want to think.

472
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,200
You're supposed to bring back some data,
but before entering your data,

473
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,080
there might be some data
already available.

474
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,480
There may be some data already
available, right?

475
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,120
So dark clear is the method

476
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,440
in selenium
have that we generally use before

477
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,640
sending some data
so that we can clear the field.

478
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,280
So that we can clear the rate. No.

479
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,880
Now let's think let's think about
like an automation engineer.

480
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
We don't want to work multiple times

481
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,440
the bleed in implementation
in one day, in execution multiple times.

482
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,440
But let's see about the current scenario
that we have right now in the application.

483
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,840
So when I go in my framework next

484
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,040
on any page, let's take a log instance,
the really basic one.

485
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,080
I'm providing this
same operation here, but it

486
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,640
any place.

487
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,280
So if I want to make sure that there
should not be any data available before

488
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,080
sending the data in this particular field,
I have to call

489
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,560
clear my 38 first.

490
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,400
Got to make this.

491
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,120
I'm just calling them here

492
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,640
like this.

493
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,440
Correct.

494
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,760
And then again,
I have to call this login page

495
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,840
or password field door clear like this

496
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,080
right

497
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,200
now. Imagine. Imagine it.

498
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,200
How many places I provided this

499
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,760
and then how many places in my script.

500
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,800
We have provided this data

501
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,120
a lot of places, right?

502
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,040
And this is just this project.

503
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,880
We're using nuances two times,

504
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,960
2000 times.

505
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,960
So just it is just a small project.

506
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,000
But they're also they're also we providing
they take multiple places.

507
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,040
Correct? U.S.

508
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
gives method.

509
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,120
So I am supposed to provide this clear
method everywhere

510
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,800
if I want to get the clear fields
before passing the data

511
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,560
and I don't want to do it again and again,
fine.

512
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,520
So now, now, according to the framework,
what standards?

513
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,560
See, according to the framework standards,
we have to come up

514
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,760
with a universal function
for sending their data.

515
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,880
In all the fields of my application.

516
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,600
We have to come up
with a universal function

517
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:40,080
for sending their data
in all the fields of my application there.

518
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,720
If I send my data by default,
it will clear all the fields.

519
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,240
It will save my value
and it will perform the operation.

520
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,240
Understood what I'm seeing.

521
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,200
So that is just listening like a story
and then I will implement.

522
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,560
Yet I will show you how to implement.

523
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,800
Don't believe me, I know how to read
and I will tell you

524
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,120
how good my code
is working in a single shot.

525
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,240
You can see
and you have been watching it, right?

526
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,120
So just believe me, I'm
going to take you to any other place.

527
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,760
Great.

528
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,360
But this explanation is very important
to believe you.

529
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,080
Thanks for your belief that

530
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,800
maybe when you've been hired

531
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,040
by. All right,

532
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,080
the monthly record is pretty.

533
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,360
And Maryam's favorite word is beautiful.

534
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,320
This is the seventh time in seventh class.

535
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,720
I can see

536
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,360
it goes to God's will.

537
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,640
Only that we know
a lot of places in India.

538
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:49,240
Nice.

539
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,280
All right, fine, fine.

540
00:31:51,800 --> 00:32:02,200
So what I'm saying is Italy's. Yes.

541
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,120
Silva got correct.

542
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,200
Lot of killer made for her,
but is on this talk about,

543
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,680
you know, poetry
things should even heart rate

544
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,560
because name is waiting you always think
of particulars is likely to select

545
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,040
like I would not I

546
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,920
would not be so shocked surprised
if he changed fate.

547
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,520
If it changes name from the heart.

548
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,960
Obviously

549
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,640
for those who don't know, it was like,
is it is.

550
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:56,400
He was a famous poet.

551
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,200
Yes. Gudu

552
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,760
gudu gudu gudu
already gets back to the point.

553
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,280
Back to the point, you know, for embracing

554
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,240
all of the perseverance.

555
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,560
You are very dedicated.

556
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:18,040
But I can see that.

557
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,440
So guys, what I'm saying basically is,
according to the concept,

558
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,560
according to the standards of framework,
instead of writing this,

559
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,880
it gives method here and gives
method there not clear method

560
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,080
here, not clear
whether this is not the best approach.

561
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,120
The best approach is to write one

562
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,440
universal function
and that function is accountable.

563
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,680
But those same they do not everywhere
make this metric common method.

564
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,480
Yes, and
I will make this matter in common.

565
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,960
But there any other solution for me.

566
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,600
So here, here we have to come up.

567
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,920
We have to come up with this
universal function right.

568
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,760
It's completely final exam, getting.

569
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,240
Sometimes you don't get so

570
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,680
in this particular
in this particular common methods class.

571
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:08,880
Right.

572
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,680
We have to write this universal function.

573
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,840
Okay.

574
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,400
Now in this function
we will implement the functionality

575
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,240
which will clear my fixed plate here.

576
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,480
What I am going
see I'm passing username value.

577
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,520
So this particular door said this function

578
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,560
will work only for user name,

579
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,640
right? Only for user name.

580
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,040
This then gives function
will work only for password menu.

581
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,440
But now the function
which we will divide that function.

582
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,920
Same function.
We will call for the user username.

583
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,920
We will call for password
we will call for plus.

584
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,520
Then we will name last name.

585
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,120
It will call for user name
password confirm password

586
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,120
for every single thing for employee
search by name.

587
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,280
By any rate, for every single place
where we need to send same this method,

588
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,680
we will simply call that particular method
that particular method

589
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,360
another concept of Java,
another concept of Oops.

590
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,520
We are going to implement
that is polymorphism.

591
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,440
The concept is retained
polymorphism, dynamic

592
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,520
polymorphism,
simple language method over they

593
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:26,280
took remember it

594
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
polymorphism body means multiple
form is a means form.

595
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,760
So more mixture polymorphism.

596
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,080
We have two types of polymorphism,
the static and dynamic right

597
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,600
polymorphism combining
polymorphism type polymorphism

598
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,600
exemplars method overloading in method
overnight rating.

599
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,080
So we are going to implement better
rating. Now

600
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,840
right?

601
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,160
I don't know. Yeah.

602
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:08,160
You tell me whether I'm correct or not.

603
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,840
Fine.

604
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,960
So now see how things work here.

605
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,400
If I need to provide 80 as a username,
I need to provide.

606
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,000
I need to provide
false name, middle name, last name.

607
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,440
So many values

608
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,680
about polymorphism asks for one.

609
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,560
Definitely so one was the explanation
correct the mod.

610
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,320
So now on all these places if I call
this same gives method again and again.

611
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,920
It's not going to work
because dart player Dawson is not clear.

612
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,800
Dawson is.

613
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,120
I'm going to write 12 or 15 or 16
unnecessary lines in just one,

614
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,080
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
because I don't need to do it.

615
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,360
I don't want to do it.

616
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,520
Actually in Stuart

617
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,160
I will call the same function
every bit, same function everywhere.

618
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,240
So I will wait one function here.

619
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,360
Right, for Java
and that function will work here.

620
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,320
Look here, here, here
in all these three places was understood

621
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,120
and that's going to be one.

622
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,640
Let's go ahead and implement it,

623
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,760
emulate the function
which is common across all the framework.

624
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,440
What is the place? Which place is this?

625
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,200
Which place?
We have to write this function.

626
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,280
Eight Common Methods.

627
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,240
Excellent days. Let's go ahead.

628
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,600
What is my common with this?

629
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,240
I know your days.

630
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,360
Let me open my common methods. Right.

631
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,880
And let me write this function here.

632
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,520
Right then we is
if I want to use this function vertically,

633
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,840
which given I am to use first, I want to
use this function throughout my project.

634
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,960
Let's start one by one
throughout my project.

635
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,000
So first, making

636
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,960
public

637
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,160
exist modifier.

638
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,080
Now I want to use this function better.

639
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,520
I don't want to create the object
of this class again and again.

640
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:00,920
Make it

641
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,720
static.

642
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,520
I don't want any return type
of this method, no return date.

643
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,440
Right.

644
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,520
Because this material performs
an operation employed

645
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,320
in the name of this function, because I'm
going to send the data everywhere.

646
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,760
So I'm going to provide
the name of this function and send it

647
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,760
next.

648
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,840
Any question in this work,
do you think it is at all good claims?

649
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,160
No, it's not rocket science.

650
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,440
It's simple. Very simple.

651
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:50,600
One great.

652
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,920
Who is this?

653
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,000
I don't know anybody.

654
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,840
Almost rocket sense polymorphism.

655
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,280
No, you'll see. It will be easy.

656
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,080
So Sigma is what I'm saying here.

657
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,040
What I'm saying first,

658
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,000
according to the concept.

659
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,600
Right.

660
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,920
According to the concept of method
over 80.

661
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,400
Right. I need to boss element. Right.

662
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,120
And that element will overlaid
with the current one.

663
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,120
For example, if I'm passing here in digit
E next day making passing digital

664
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,240
in the same operation
will be performed on integer B or not

665
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,160
there.

666
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,960
So things work.

667
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:39,040
Let me explain you first again
just to brush up your one six.

668
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,480
If I write any function,
the function name is a right,

669
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,440
so I'm passing here in digit
eight comma be

670
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,360
right in providing here z is equal

671
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,120
because is equal to eight plus B getting
it means three plus two.

672
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,120
So here
when you actually call this function,

673
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,560
you will call three two,

674
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,320
right?

675
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,600
You can call this function in your main
method.

676
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,120
Three common two.

677
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
Next time,
if you want to call this function,

678
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,320
you can call for comma place.

679
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,640
You can call next time eight comma seven

680
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,640
next time we can call three
comma one five or something.

681
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,760
Can we do this?

682
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,240
Can we do this or not?

683
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,520
It means what we are doing.

684
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,560
We are overwriting, we are overwriting it.

685
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,480
Correct. So what is important?

686
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,040
This part is important.

687
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,080
What we are mentioning cutting.

688
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,280
So now I'll meet.

689
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,160
According
to this concept of method of writing,

690
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,400
we are going to perform our
operations on work on integer

691
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,200
one, characters

692
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,440
on byte, on long and short, where

693
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,440
we are not going to perform long,

694
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,560
we are going to perform our operations
on very minute

695
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,400
days.

696
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,720
User name is a string or user
name is very limited.

697
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,720
Password field is a string or password,

698
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,760
which is very relevant, very simple.

699
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,920
So let me write web element
and I'm providing just an element,

700
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
just a name element content

701
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,320
categories, just to name Fifth element

702
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,360
second thing.

703
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,600
Second thing in the same function.

704
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,000
See, great.

705
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,280
I got my element, but here
the intention is to send some data.

706
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,160
The intention is to send some data.

707
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,080
So what I have to pass now,
I have to send some data

708
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,480
in the data I pass in the form of string.

709
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,280
So I will write a string, played string,
and the name is a text

710
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,600
to send something like this exclusive.

711
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Understood,

712
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,320
Understood.

713
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,360
So first thing, see how easy it is.

714
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,960
Now see, I'm writing here.

715
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,840
Element dot, dot clear.

716
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,000
So first it will make my really clear

717
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,280
segmenting element

718
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,880
not sending use words and keys

719
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,360
x to sync simple text to simple.

720
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,880
Now this method is really

721
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,880
this method is really

722
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,320
now see

723
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,280
now see how this method is going to work
this time.

724
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,760
C Let me go into my log instance.

725
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,560
Let me go into my log
in two steps again and

726
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,720
let me take any, any method.

727
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,680
See this one for example? Great.

728
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,560
For example, this one,
when I'm passing works and it gives method

729
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,760
I don't want to use right this time.

730
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,160
Let's take in scenario first,
which we can easily execute

731
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,640
because we are in any

732
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,440
big meeting.

733
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,160
This one only. Right?

734
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,960
So see what I'm going to do this time.

735
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,480
First, I'm going to like send text.

736
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,760
Can you see the method is coming?

737
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:32,520
Same next place, click
here, send text method.

738
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,040
It is asking for two things.

739
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,240
Element.

740
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,160
So tell me where MMS coming from. Where

741
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,040
pages Page's login page dot

742
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,480
username

743
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,560
username.

744
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,280
Now it is asking for the second parameter
is string next to do it.

745
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,440
So the string is coming
from where you see from this step.

746
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,080
Only it is coming

747
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,480
here from this step only just coming in.

748
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,760
You see, I'm handling the parameters,
your username and password.

749
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:04,880
Correct.

750
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,120
So let's take a username and

751
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:09,720
username.

752
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,440
Ready now. See,

753
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,880
I changed my function

754
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,760
similarly here.

755
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,280
Also here also I can call this same next

756
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,080
log in page password field comma password.

757
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,080
Wendy Right now see how easy,
how easy this function becomes.

758
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,600
Great.

759
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,200
Just one like now
this one name is going to

760
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,760
this one line is going to clear the data,
which is already available in my field.

761
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Second thing, what it does, it will send
the data, whatever the data I'm sending.

762
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:48,800
Right.

763
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,400
So now let me go to my login page

764
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,920
and here I'm calling these methods
like this.

765
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,880
Don't send these methods to places.

766
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,400
I'm calling this word here.

767
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,600
It's not clearing any privileged data.

768
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,680
So do I need to call methods like this?

769
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,360
Do I need to call methods like this?

770
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,960
Tell me.

771
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,320
No, we don't need to call these methods
like this.

772
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,920
What we can do is simple.

773
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,800
Same text, same text here,

774
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,960
direct it, user username to trade, comma.

775
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,920
The data data is coming
from configurator fine.

776
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,800
So take this configurator.

777
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,200
Don't get property value. Fine.

778
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,120
Take the data from username.

779
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,360
Similarly going to say next great

780
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,920
password field dark

781
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,240
password first comma configure.

782
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,560
Don't get it property value password.

783
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,600
So now I don't need this to even

784
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,400
see close.

785
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,280
Now this is the perfect example of method
over writing.

786
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,640
Next time.

787
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,880
How how interview
one Ask questions in the interview.

788
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,920
They never ask questions like this.

789
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,640
What is their definition of polymorphism?

790
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,400
Our are experienced people.

791
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,880
They are not expecting definitions
from you.

792
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,160
What they will ask you is always
how much would you rate

793
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,720
yourself on Java out of five to yourself?

794
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,120
And then you say, I would rate myself 3.5

795
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,880
out of 3.5 out of five
is it will get white text grade

796
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,000
3.5 with almost 70% rate.

797
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,080
So you are considering your subject,
you know, 70% of Java.

798
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
Excellent.

799
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,640
So the most important topics

800
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,320
of one of the most important
topics of Java is oops concept.

801
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,200
Fine.

802
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:47,160
Can you please tell me in your project
when you implemented oops concepts.

803
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:51,280
So now this time
you have to explain that how

804
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,200
you have utilized Java in your framework.

805
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,160
You see two three examples
I can show you making this right

806
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,520
and then providing this is a
D made it public.

807
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,320
That is the process of data binding.

808
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,520
Wrapping up our data in a single unit.

809
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,200
The process is what we called

810
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,280
ramping up of data

811
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,840
encapsulation rate encapsulation
one concept.

812
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,000
Second concept acquiring the property

813
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,320
of one class
in another class is what we call

814
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,640
inheritance.

815
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,760
So you see common methods part.

816
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,320
So for inheritance we use which keyword
extends keyword we are using.

817
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,720
These are not here 3030

818
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,040
Overriding method
overriding is the example of polymorphism.

819
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,160
So you see
this is the polymorphism cutting.

820
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,120
This is the polymorphism.

821
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:56,160
No, the why you make this method public
because you want the username private.

822
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,960
So you made it
public grade concept of access modifier

823
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,480
void non treating type.

824
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,600
This is constructed by we use constructor,
we use constructor right.

825
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,040
Constructor has been called automatically
to initialize the object

826
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,280
of the class
to initialize the object of the class.

827
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,240
Right?

828
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,200
So when we create the object
with new keyword, this constructor

829
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,920
is automatically been called.

830
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,880
If there is no constructor we create,
then there is a default constructor

831
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,920
available in Java

832
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,560
right.

833
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,760
The definition of constructor
is basically the constructor

834
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,920
is having the same name as that last name,
but it looks like a method.

835
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,360
Correct?

836
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:37,880
Correct.

837
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,360
So Java is everywhere.

838
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,240
Can you see how. No. No.

839
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,280
I hope you're understanding
how you can to correlate your Java

840
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,680
concepts in your framework.

841
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:56,280
Strings.

842
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,840
Things are making sense now.

843
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,080
We are working

844
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,520
right

845
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,920
now. Let's proceed for the next project

846
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,080
for our No.

847
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,400
So no, we don't use those methods.

848
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,800
Usual common.
But there zero means I'm going there.

849
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,960
I'm going to come on with this

850
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,280
because our entire class or to the right
is depending on common method.

851
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,800
So don't worry I will be.

852
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,960
You can find me always in common.

853
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,960
But this class you'll see
this is the common methods.

854
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:40,680
This is the only two liner code
we have written.

855
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,040
We will change.
We will gender entire code variable.

856
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,960
We were passing this to dark side
gives method attribute.

857
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,000
We don't clear,
we change. They don't want.

858
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,840
We do it
because we need excellent piece of code.

859
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,400
Right? We need masterpiece. We do

860
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,400
like I said right.

861
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,160
Just two more classes and then you will
get the fully functional plane.

862
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:18,880
But the lot of things
we are going to implement.

863
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,320
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

864
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,360
We don't use good governance.

865
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,960
Sector six What I'm saying we don't need
to use as of now because transactions

866
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,560
we make the keys,

867
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,680
we make the keys,
there is a public keys we're using.

868
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:37,400
So the functionality we store,
the functionality, we make it seal, right?

869
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,880
So we never allow our users
to change those particular locations.

870
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,160
We we make them private
and we provide the keys as a public one.

871
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,320
Correct.

872
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,120
So this locator is safe in one place.

873
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,560
Everyone needs using
what keys here in their

874
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,600
duty.

875
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,800
One insured insurance data, the security.

876
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,040
That's what we are achieving here. Correct

877
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,800
or replace Now

878
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,040
do common do common

879
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,120
operations.

880
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,040
We are performing in an application.

881
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,720
One is sending the data.

882
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,000
It is already played.

883
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,720
We can function for today
and now this function is working for me,

884
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,360
which is clearing the fields

885
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,040
and then which is sending the data
I will show you right

886
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,360
when we actually implement this part,
I would choose it.

887
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,520
Then Me What is the second operation
we perform every

888
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,640
now in the

889
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,440
Let me look using

890
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,280
no time for screenshots.

891
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,360
No, no, no, no. Front click operation.

892
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,840
She got this for me.

893
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:50,960
I'm able to use it but can not explain it
exactly like so many as I read.

894
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,360
And you have to explain later

895
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,960
whatever you are doing,
you just need to explain it.

896
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,640
Simple.

897
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,600
Just see whatever you are doing.

898
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,720
This is what we call explanation.

899
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,800
Getting terminology is something right.

900
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,520
Even if you read, if you say
for pure 60% of the design, right,

901
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,440
if you are knowledgeable.

902
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,760
Right, and you use baking terminology,
that is also point.

903
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,160
People will get the idea
that, okay, he knows everything like that

904
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,680
because
the moment you have confidence, right.

905
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,080
And then if you start speaking, the volume

906
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,920
rate of your voice and your voice speeches
and they will go higher

907
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:30,840
because of confidence,
not because of the terminology,

908
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,080
that's why we always at
least have the knowledge, right?

909
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,440
If you have a knowledge,

910
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,640
you will be on a different level
when it comes to confidence.

911
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,040
Think it, then you make it.

912
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,160
Yeah. Now you're not fake anymore.

913
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,480
Remember one thing,
you got six months straight.

914
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,120
Why can't you sprint
grade the people in the industry?

915
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,320
Right? They were only three or 4 hours
in a day, max.

916
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,440
Two weeks for the label
was not more than this.

917
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,840
Working professionals.

918
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,680
I'm talking about them. Right.

919
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:03,160
So less than 5 hours,
five days, 25 over 30 in a week.

920
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,440
You're also running the same thing.

921
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,720
Spend 50 hours on your practice
for six months.

922
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,520
It means you're already having one
European time experience

923
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,920
and you are not big anymore.

924
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,800
Great

925
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,600
doesn't make sense to you, right?

926
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,880
If you practice practice in practice,
it means just consider yourself

927
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,400
believing yourself yourself
Good. Working on your dream project.

928
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,560
You're getting this environment time
and put your money in extremely important.

929
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,080
And for that for that there is no excuse.

930
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,360
We have to spend time

931
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,560
because this is something
you need to understand.

932
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:42,600
One thing is what is the difference
in between Mississippi and villages

933
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,240
was to segregate these two things

934
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,280
extremely important.

935
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,680
That's this what we are going to chart
the moment you start

936
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,360
understanding the difference
in between Beijing and Mississippi.

937
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:56,920
Right?

938
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,600
And then you invest your time accordingly.

939
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,440
You see, this is my necessity
is spent 90% of your time or necessity,

940
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,920
and this just 15% of time
you can spend on your paycheck

941
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,040
unnecessarily.

942
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,120
Unfortunately, train what we are doing.

943
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,240
We are spending 70% of pay on the things
which are below

944
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:27,240
complete pleasure category, not necessity.

945
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,040
Right.

946
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,160
Go and grab a sandwich.

947
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,200
Necessity not simply just

948
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,720
sleep for eight 9 hours, complete sleep
so that I don't get dark circles.

949
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,240
Necessity later

950
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,400
whoever says you have to sleep 8 hours
been 9 hours.

951
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,880
Otherwise your brain will not work.

952
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,240
Stop making excuses just because
you want to sleep more hours straight.

953
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,320
You're just afraid of this sort of
because you're afraid of this, you know,

954
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,960
wrinkles on your face and so many things.

955
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,960
So if you really want to achieve
something in your life,

956
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,680
you really want to do something.

957
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,840
5 to 6 hours sleep is more than enough.

958
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,520
6 hours more than enough.

959
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,960
You just have 24 hours
and you can't sleep.

960
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,800
Do 3% of your time everyday.

961
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,840
You can't do that.

962
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,600
Yes, yes.

963
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,560
That's what I'm saying.

964
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:28,200
Six is new work. No.

965
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,560
Fine.

966
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,840
So far, so good.

967
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,400
Yes, Correct.

968
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,200
And if you want to him right.

969
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,480
What you have to do,
start sleeping 5 hours.

970
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,840
Great. What? We are in the same boat.

971
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,600
We are in the same boat.

972
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,760
I always wish that I can sleep for 6 hours

973
00:55:52,760 --> 00:56:08,000
in. All right.

974
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,560
Now, the point is, if not, don't sleep
when this debate induces sleeping.

975
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,960
You give this correct look.

976
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,800
Now, the point is, if no one is sleeping
for more than 5 hours,

977
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:24,640
maybe a lot of operations and support,

978
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,440
if no one is sleeping, everybody is doing

979
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,800
18 hours, 19 hours.

980
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,640
People are awake.

981
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,800
Makes you better waking up
within 19 hours.

982
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,240
But still problem.

983
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,800
Problem is seen just not sleeping. Right.

984
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:46,280
So the difference Asian in between leader
and this is is still required.

985
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,240
I see

986
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,080
already is the

987
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,240
next operation which we are going to do

988
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,360
is click operation. Okay

989
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,920
now now see one more thing
when more will see,

990
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:20,160
let me show.

991
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,320
I'm glad.

992
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,000
I'm glad future geniuses

993
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:31,080
are attending my classes.

994
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,040
Maybe, maybe they had experienced on
base 21 or 22 something. So

995
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,120
maybe.

996
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:42,480
Right.

997
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,920
You're making a pipeline for us
for 22, 20, 30 batch

998
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,000
and then further from the code,
what was it, 18

999
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,400
nights?

1000
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,960
You should you should add in.

1001
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,960
Now, remember, guys, we are projecting
digitally three dot sleeper

1002
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,600
every match multiple times, right?

1003
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,760
But but actually
when we use this particular application,

1004
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,880
when everyone uses
this application, everyone.

1005
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,560
So what happens?

1006
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,640
Excessive use of application
makes it slow.

1007
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,440
Correct.

1008
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,960
Integrates existing use of application,

1009
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,720
makes it very slow.

1010
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,480
So now sometimes if sometimes my selenium,
if it is so fast,

1011
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,440
it won't, it won't break rate
and it will make my script fade.

1012
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,080
Correct.

1013
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,920
This is what happening
with me is what happening with this.

1014
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,360
One more in me.

1015
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,920
For example, if I click into the username

1016
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,720
and password blinking on logging button,
sometimes you must have observed it.

1017
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,040
My screen is just rolling and running.
Right?

1018
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:03,120
It's rotating, but it's not uploading
completely in the time it's load.

1019
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,280
It gets loaded right after that.

1020
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,840
If I want to click on Dashboard live,

1021
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,640
see or click on Beam option, read my test
because it's going to fill

1022
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,000
because my selenium is not going to wait
all that time in.

1023
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,200
That gives what I have to do whenever
I come across this type of scenario.

1024
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:19,960
Right?

1025
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,560
I have to provide one condition
according to the way we have in selenium.

1026
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,920
Guys tell me we have implicitly

1027
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,640
we have

1028
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,000
explicitly rate fake based.

1029
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,240
What is the example of implicit week

1030
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,240
I gave you?

1031
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,360
I gave you this example based on
what is the example of implicit

1032
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:48,920
would

1033
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,080
implicit

1034
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,400
wait based on being explicit best true

1035
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,920
to driver
not managed or would start implicit

1036
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,600
to wait five or more time,
You need to start thinking, what is this?

1037
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,880
This is implicit
which which is depending on time.

1038
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,480
Once again, 10 seconds, 5 seconds.

1039
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,600
Another very good points in my right.

1040
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,440
Thank you for remembering
with this point. Great.

1041
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,720
I'm going to give you a very good concept.

1042
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,160
See? So now, now here,
see what we are doing.

1043
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,880
So this is driver manager
by Mozart in particular,

1044
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:27,000
five SEC instance against 20 seconds,
whatever their name. Why?

1045
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,480
Because this type of rate is relying
on the name one time

1046
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,760
and again is also a type of things
like a bit of nine, five, six or nine.

1047
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,320
Another way is explicit to right.

1048
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,800
It doesn't require time.

1049
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,440
It's not depending on time.

1050
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,640
Instead it is depending on condition.

1051
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,560
So tell me by looking through
the application here are very nine on time

1052
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,160
or are we relying on condition?

1053
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,800
If I want to click on emotion,
we are relying on condition.

1054
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,560
I want to know the speech.

1055
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,240
I want to know my element.

1056
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:04,080
So whenever my element is ready,
clickable, then only I want to click,

1057
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,040
read,
or I am going to see that, Hey, Selenium

1058
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,240
v builder time,
my element becomes clickable

1059
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,000
and when my element becomes clickable,
then only go in and click on.

1060
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,320
That's what we are going to do, right?

1061
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,160
So now the things
we are going to implement first click

1062
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,160
function inside click
function functionality.

1063
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,800
So before clicking for that particular
element, it will read builder names.

1064
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,440
My element becomes clickable
and then only selenium will perform.

1065
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,800
Click completion. Understood.

1066
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,080
So not normal click operations
not required any more.

1067
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:46,000
This universal function for click
operation with the it is required

1068
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,560
and this could

1069
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,760
a student's

1070
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,680
must.

1071
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,440
So I hope you guys are understanding
what I'm saying.

1072
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,040
Right.

1073
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,560
And it's not
my lecture is not leading you to

1074
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:11,160
of late

1075
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,760
nor did

1076
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:21,560
but I will remember this property

1077
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,000
right
So now no, I'm going to read one function.

1078
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,160
See, my function is public state.

1079
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,360
Big gig.

1080
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,160
Wait, get wait.

1081
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:36,960
I'll read

1082
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,800
this function will return the weight

1083
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,920
dying rate the read which I want to make.

1084
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,840
I want to provide this function
will return with that particular big.

1085
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,080
Understood.

1086
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,120
Understood.

1087
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:59,320
So now when we talk about explicitly
or implicitly, we have one implicit.

1088
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,520
We have a function called
implicit would wait for explicit way.

1089
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,760
Do not have anything like that explicitly.

1090
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,880
We have something else.

1091
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,600
What is that?

1092
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,320
The meaning of being for explicit

1093
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,600
which would be a for explicit guys.

1094
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:16,320
Come on, wait.

1095
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,440
Trendy, but wait until it's coming from.

1096
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,720
It's coming from the driver

1097
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,240
V It's coming from the driver.

1098
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,440
Big guys.

1099
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,600
Remember review number four

1100
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,240
after your synonym class,

1101
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:39,560
then I was explaining the difference
between implicit and explicit way.

1102
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:56,280
It was Thursday, remember?

1103
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,320
And they're temporal you to me, right?

1104
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,120
So basically the implicit way,
depending on time and explicit

1105
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,800
work, depending on condition
and I gave you the example is but

1106
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,640
fine, fine.

1107
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,840
So now this function, this function
will return the big distinction.

1108
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,120
Yep. Nice.

1109
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,480
No. Alexey, no.

1110
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:29,080
Alright,
so now see what I'm going to do here.

1111
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,120
I'm going to write one function here.

1112
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,600
Function is big driver, big rate.

1113
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,440
I'm creating the of this in the new

1114
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,760
driver week in here.

1115
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,760
Then media is which driver
I can use the same driver which I have

1116
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,040
the same driver we can use

1117
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,680
driver.

1118
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,400
Right.

1119
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,880
And here here
I need to provide the time frame.

1120
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,000
So just doing 20 a.m.

1121
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:59,800
in seconds, such as of

1122
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,240
15, 11, ten, whatever their name.

1123
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,440
Now see now see one very excellent thing
we are going to implement.

1124
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,280
Now what I'm going to do

1125
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:16,040
I have to use this driver don't manage
your time would start implicit with here.

1126
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:19,640
Also I'm using this date
and providing this file

1127
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,320
again I see again I see this is hardcoded

1128
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,000
in you see the is

1129
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,000
this part is also hardcoded this time.

1130
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,280
Okay.

1131
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,400
In second this is also hardcoded

1132
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,960
and according to according
to the definition of the framework,

1133
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,320
we should not pass anything
anything hardcoded

1134
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,480
for we should not pass
anything in hardcoded form.

1135
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,880
Correct.

1136
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:53,200
Is this correct face?

1137
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:53,840
Fine.

1138
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,480
So now now I have one particular place

1139
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:00,880
called constants.

1140
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:06,760
I have one place called Constants
right now here in this constants,

1141
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:11,800
what I'm going to write to see, I'm
going to write a public static

1142
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:17,400
find the that is my name is a string
or it is an integer or it is what?

1143
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,760
What kind of digital behave in by

1144
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,240
integer in. I am writing here.

1145
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:27,040
See in please see

1146
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,080
we tried implicit way.

1147
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,000
Let's see then

1148
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:34,640
let's say

1149
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,360
ten and I'm writing one for public.

1150
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,160
The mistake.

1151
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,160
Public static final is

1152
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,600
it needs to

1153
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,040
be let's see, 15

1154
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:51,440
maybe you can take any of the number
according to your choice.

1155
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,920
So now see this time.

1156
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,840
This time, if I go here, I don't need
to call this five directly speed.

1157
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,240
Instead I can force

1158
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,400
constants dot implicit object.

1159
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,960
It will take weight from my constants
class.

1160
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,760
Similarly here, similarly here.

1161
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,400
Here.

1162
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,920
I'm going to call constants.

1163
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,880
Don't

1164
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,240
explicitly

1165
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,800
and it will take the code
from my constants class.

1166
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,320
Right. So next time.

1167
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:32,800
Next time, wherever you call this
implicit weird, but how does it know

1168
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,680
the number count
meant this implicit weight, right?

1169
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,120
This Implicit weight and explicit way.

1170
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,800
If you go
if you go in your constants class,

1171
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,400
you'll see
we are passing ten or 15 here or not.

1172
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,600
So the value of implicit with an integer
is how much

1173
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,080
the value of this particular variable is.

1174
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,640
How much. Then, Right?

1175
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,400
And the value of this explicit
weight is 15, right?

1176
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,560
So now this ten and 15, wherever

1177
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:08,520
we will pass this particular part,
we make this common throughout my project.

1178
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,680
So we just need to call implicit.

1179
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,800
We just need to call explicit
wherever we want to call it,

1180
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,880
and then it will give me ten and it gets

1181
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:21,040
we don't need to define five individual
different weights everywhere.

1182
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,920
We don't need to do it anymore.

1183
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:29,360
So far, is it clear to you or not?

1184
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:29,760
Clear.

1185
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,240
Excellent.

1186
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,200
Excellent.

1187
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:38,040
Let's proceed further now, After this,
after this, when we actually work

1188
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,480
on this particular part, what I'm saying
here, this particular part,

1189
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:47,280
this particular function is going
to is going to return

1190
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,960
is going to return this particular break
rate, this particular width.

1191
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,840
So this particular function
is going to return this rate

1192
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:01,120
in which I'm going to wait
for particular element for how much time.

1193
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,760
But how much time?

1194
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,360
15 seconds. Right.

1195
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,800
So whatever the element
where I am going to provide

1196
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:15,240
this particular big time,
it will wait for 15 seconds straight.

1197
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,960
15 seconds. Fine.

1198
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,320
Now see how we can utilize this particular
method called get rate.

1199
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,200
This is the way
this method is returning me.

1200
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,200
What based on this method

1201
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,400
is returning rate but not condition.

1202
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,960
Condition is still remaining.

1203
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,000
Great condition
is still yet to be implemented.

1204
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:41,000
So what I'm going to do now,
I'm going to write another function

1205
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:46,080
in this class, in that function,
I'm going to define a condition.

1206
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,200
And in that condition
I'm going to provide this spread.

1207
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,440
So condition is the one function.

1208
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:56,880
In that function I'm calling this and both
this function will love it one time

1209
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,640
and that function will call in a click
method.

1210
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,280
Right? We'll call this in click method.

1211
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,600
So now let me write another function here.

1212
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,960
I'm writing here public is dead big void

1213
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,920
rate for

1214
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,760
capability.

1215
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,360
Great for applicability.

1216
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,080
Great. Fine.

1217
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:22,520
So I need to wait for element, correct?

1218
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,920
Correct.

1219
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,880
We need to wait for particular element.

1220
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:33,440
So let me boss here that element because

1221
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,840
which element I want to it
every single element.

1222
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,400
I want to wait what Every single element.

1223
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,080
Great.

1224
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:45,640
Again, the concept of method overriding
polymorphism concept.

1225
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,920
So what I'm writing
see I'm saying get wait

1226
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,160
until

1227
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,840
extended conditions

1228
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,920
are expected

1229
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,600
conditions, element to be eligible. Right.

1230
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,120
So it is asking for which elements
of my web element

1231
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,520
of simple.

1232
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,680
Can you see just one line of function

1233
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:18,000
and this one line of function
sees big builder time.

1234
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:20,640
My element becomes clickable.

1235
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,320
Now see, everything is that I'm interested
with every single thing

1236
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,320
is that I'm replaced. You see the element.

1237
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,040
The element is coming from somewhere else.

1238
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,800
The web is coming from one function.

1239
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:37,440
In this work, explicit name is coming
from somewhere else.

1240
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:40,320
The driver is coming
from somewhere. It's getting

1241
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,120
correct

1242
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,600
an industrial

1243
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,320
so far.

1244
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,040
Do you guys have any question in this part

1245
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:01,280
so far?

1246
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,880
Do you guys have any question
in this part?

1247
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:12,240
How about others?

1248
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,440
Clear.

1249
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,160
All good.

1250
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,760
Nice, nice.

1251
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,880
Let's go ahead and it

1252
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,320
see how I'm going to use this function.

1253
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,880
So far we have just defined it, right?

1254
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,400
We have defined the function in this.

1255
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,600
According to this function,
we are going to read

1256
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,720
according to the condition
which we have provided.

1257
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:40,640
Right.

1258
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,960
But still, the most important point

1259
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,480
using this function in a major operation
is the still pending.

1260
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:47,960
Right. So let's do it.

1261
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,640
I'm going to write
one function called Public

1262
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,840
static void click right click method.

1263
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,280
I'm going to use this click play.

1264
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,360
Now, in this click one,
what I'm going to pass is,

1265
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:12,080
I want to click on one element
or multiple elements.

1266
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:12,600
Come on.

1267
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,720
We have so many elements, right?

1268
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,760
We have so many elements.

1269
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,040
If it was just one element, right,
why do we need to implement this

1270
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,600
universal function?

1271
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,520
We have to click on some we none.

1272
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,080
We have to click on search option.

1273
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:29,240
We have to be option and employ employed
used in point of mission.

1274
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,760
See so many business rate

1275
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,200
one at a time obviously moment

1276
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,000
if there is no look,
it means want it to one day again

1277
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,200
and statement finally and state
and I can make that

1278
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,520
because nice

1279
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:53,840
All right so I'm going to implement again
the same concept

1280
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:57,240
that we have been using
lot of polymorphism to date

1281
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,360
we are calling rate

1282
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,280
now see now see how easy we made it.

1283
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,680
I'm waiting wait for click it will be

1284
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,480
wait for click ability for element.

1285
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,720
Fine.

1286
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,160
And then what I want to do element dart

1287
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,600
click simple again you see

1288
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,680
element or click right now
this tweet for click it will it be

1289
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,600
called appear element will come from

1290
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,760
this work for applicability

1291
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,200
will break in the expected conditions.

1292
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,480
Then the time element becomes
clickable element This coming from script

1293
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,000
based on the weight
radius coming from one function.

1294
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,520
In this function
we are calling the driver big

1295
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:46,200
in the way we defined in our constant
class, in the driver, which is coming from

1296
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:51,760
a global level to push and thus to know
dependency on Haiti hardcoded data.

1297
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:56,520
Now see now
see how we can implement simply this time.

1298
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,720
Go here, this time go here.

1299
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,960
Instead of using this log input from God,
click.

1300
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,480
Simply
replace this part with click method.

1301
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,680
It's asking for log input and provided.

1302
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,640
See? Can you see

1303
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,840
that is on

1304
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,880
right now.

1305
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,920
Now let me execute this particular one

1306
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:27,560
because here, here in this function,
let me show you in this particular step.

1307
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,840
If I go inside this
and if I go here inside

1308
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,720
this log in function,

1309
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:39,600
you'll see I am calling this newly

1310
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:42,080
developed universal functions

1311
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,880
atrium common methods getting

1312
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,800
categories.

1313
01:15:49,800 --> 01:16:14,960
So let's execute this.

1314
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:20,680
So it gives method is working fine, right
click method is also working fine.

1315
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:26,120
Everything is working
absolutely fine or not any time

1316
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,360
group

1317
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,400
or working fine.

1318
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:45,440
Okay.

1319
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,160
The first high rate.

1320
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,800
Let me commit this code forced.

1321
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,840
Otherwise people will ask once again.

1322
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:54,360
So before they ask
if we commit before Class seven

1323
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:00,680
committed.

1324
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:07,000
I'm very much habitual
not working with mentally on people.

1325
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,200
So now

1326
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,280
let me push this code into the repository.

1327
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,120
It's pushed code is already available
right.

1328
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,520
People who is built

1329
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,880
who still are not aware
that I am within the code and busy typing.

1330
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,320
Right. I'm telling you,

1331
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,680
everybody should be ready.

1332
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:26,840
Specific add something.

1333
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,160
Yeah.

1334
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,920
Show them to great.

1335
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,640
So guys code is already committed
in a variable rate.

1336
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,440
You can take a key from the repository.

1337
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,080
So far.

1338
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:41,040
Any question in this dark scripting,
please ask if you have any

1339
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,080
any questions So far?

1340
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,360
No question.

1341
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,800
Don't worry about this particular common
method straight.

1342
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,000
All these three functions rate
all these three functions.

1343
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,360
I will explain.

1344
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,320
I will explain.

1345
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,240
This functions once again after the break.

1346
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,640
Don't worry about it. Okay.

1347
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:02,400
So let's meet after the break.

1348
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,040
Fine.

1349
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,760
So now

1350
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,680
to reduce the

1351
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:13,360
to reduce rate,
this use of code rewrite again and again

1352
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,880
every now and then in the framework rate
wherever we need.

1353
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,560
So gives we are calling them matter
directly from selenium.

1354
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,280
Interestingly, restricting it
to just one particular element.

1355
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,680
And then Norvig
providing hardcoded gateway take slip

1356
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:31,920
providing hardcoded implicit
with hardcoded explicitly.

1357
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,160
Right
and then simply clicking operation again

1358
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:38,760
and restricting this particular method
to one particular element

1359
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,880
to get rid of all of this problems,
to get rid of all of this problems.

1360
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:46,160
We came up with two universal functions.

1361
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,840
The first one is send a text.

1362
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,240
The first one is

1363
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:54,240
send a text and the second one is click

1364
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,320
right.

1365
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:04,640
Second one is click it.

1366
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,600
Now, in this two functions,

1367
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:13,040
we identified a couple of more scopes,
a lot more scopes.

1368
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:16,000
So here, before sending their data,

1369
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,360
I need to have my fields cleared

1370
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:24,600
right?

1371
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,520
I need to clear the field

1372
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:30,000
so that there should not be any privileged
data available.

1373
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:32,120
Right. If I can do it.

1374
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:35,760
If I want to do it explicitly
without function, then what I have to do,

1375
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,240
I have to call.

1376
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,200
I have to call this particular clear
method

1377
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,960
everywhere before sending their data.

1378
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:43,480
Right.

1379
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,200
Does it make sense
to write this element out?

1380
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:49,080
Clear view everywhere before is

1381
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,760
one example. If we are

1382
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,640
performing this training operation,
it did this so it has to be able to read.

1383
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:57,520
Not clear.

1384
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,320
And then this goes to the business
name to write send his method.

1385
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,160
Does it make sense? No it doesn't.

1386
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,080
It doesn't.

1387
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,400
According to the principles of object
oriented programing language,

1388
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:08,280
we can use it.

1389
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,640
One place in Java says radio function it.

1390
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,480
One doesn't use it everywhere.

1391
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,360
Trade with the concept of polymorphism
object oriented programing method.

1392
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,880
All right, so we are doing it simple.

1393
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:19,760
We are

1394
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,840
writing this function in one place, right?

1395
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,920
Extending the property of this particular
class everywhere.

1396
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,960
And now, because my function is a static,
I don't even need to create

1397
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,840
the object of the class
can simply call this method everywhere.

1398
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,960
All I need to do
is according to my current condition,

1399
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,120
according to my current text,
according to my current element,

1400
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,120
I need to pass this button with this.

1401
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,760
So this is a generic, but I would
I can pass user name.

1402
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,200
It will perform the action on user
name. Right?

1403
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,880
I can pass password.

1404
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,760
It will perform the actions on password.

1405
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,600
I can pass some other employee ATP. Right.

1406
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:54,800
It will clear the pool.

1407
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,360
It would be internally installed.

1408
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,160
That's
what my say thanks to method does you

1409
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:10,480
guys nice second thing.

1410
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,560
So again thing we were waiting
this traders

1411
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,600
legitimate were waiting
when everyone had already exhausted.

1412
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,640
This is not a good practice right

1413
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,360
we have implicit and explicit
both in synonyms the way we use them.

1414
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,640
That was the question.

1415
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,080
So we came up with the ends of it.

1416
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,400
Yes, we can use
both implicit and explicit,

1417
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,680
which according to the needs
of my framework in my application right.

1418
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:36,360
So implicit,
which is the one which is relying on time.

1419
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:37,040
Right.

1420
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:40,760
So wherever we come across the situation,
the condition in the application

1421
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:43,640
or in the framework
where we have to provide the rate

1422
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:47,240
which is right on time,
we will use implicitly

1423
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:50,480
we will read the data from exceptions
mostly, yes, sir, yes.

1424
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,760
But most of the times
we read the data from Excel file

1425
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,040
because we perform data driven based right
data driven test.

1426
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,760
So data driven just implements

1427
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,240
your scripts, executes a couple of times,
you know on thousands of users.

1428
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:03,960
Right.

1429
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,560
And the best part is you don't need
to maintain this sheet trade.

1430
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,920
You get this should from many investors
they already have this data.

1431
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,080
Should we just put this should
in your script, in your framework.

1432
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:17,520
Right. You read the function
to read all of these things.

1433
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,880
So function is always the same.

1434
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,960
The function which we have written, right.

1435
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,280
It's all about number of keys
that you have more or less right.

1436
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,000
And the name of the files
that you need to change

1437
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,160
the same function controls C control.

1438
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,200
We put it into the accelerator

1439
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,320
called this accelerator everywhere
based on the process.

1440
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,360
Right. And then simply called exit

1441
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,320
the stored

1442
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,680
nice.

1443
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,720
So here he had understood
one thing that yes,

1444
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,320
we have one explicit condition

1445
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,320
because the second really
common object, it

1446
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,600
might application is click operation.

1447
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,840
Sometimes my application is not loading.

1448
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,760
I'm having this issue right.

1449
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,240
So for performing click operation,
if my application element is not there,

1450
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:14,520
then my selenium would make
it will make my script feel unnecessary.

1451
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,480
I don't want to.

1452
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,480
I don't want this to be happening
right in my application scenario.

1453
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:22,440
So what I did here,
I came up with the function

1454
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,720
and big function
is giving me a big build time.

1455
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,320
One condition is make
what is the condition?

1456
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:35,280
According to the web primary,
which is a category of explicit rig,

1457
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:40,360
we are going to rig, build a time
my beam element becomes clickable.

1458
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,280
In the time my element becomes clickable,

1459
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,000
my beam driver is going to read
Wake Radius.

1460
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:48,920
That's what I wrote.

1461
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,000
One function called
Wait for applicability.

1462
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,320
Which element?

1463
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,760
So element is generic one.

1464
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,040
I simply provided web element element.

1465
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,400
So this element I can provide user name,
I could provide login

1466
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:02,440
button, I can provide beam option,
I can provide any employer

1467
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,880
option, employee list option
and so on list is very low rate.

1468
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,240
I can provide anything simply again,
the concept of Java

1469
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,680
polymorphism method or what
enemy Polymorphism.

1470
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,960
That's what we are doing making

1471
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,720
right now in this function.

1472
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,680
Like I said, there is no hard
coded thing at all in my entire framework.

1473
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:26,880
So what is the next thing?

1474
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,480
The next thing is the rate
which we are going to provide

1475
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:33,480
should always come
from one particular function.

1476
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:36,000
So that function
we have written over here,

1477
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:41,200
this function is specifically written
so that this particular method

1478
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:47,000
will repeatedly read, which will explicit
with which explicit will driver be fine.

1479
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:51,640
So I would work disregarding me based on
the time that I'm going to provide.

1480
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,560
So again,
not even time I'm providing hard.

1481
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,040
The time is also coming from
one particular class

1482
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,960
where my fields are constants.

1483
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:05,280
So for all the fields which are constants
which are not going to change

1484
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:09,400
throughout my project code,
my framework state right,

1485
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:16,040
those things I keep in mind
constraints, class, right?

1486
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,080
Those things I keep in my constants class.

1487
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:24,520
So from Constants Class, I'm calling this
explicit, I'm calling this implicit here.

1488
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:33,480
Understood.

1489
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,040
Now let's go into this particular part
straight.

1490
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:41,200
Let's go to this particular mark
and change and change here.

1491
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,760
Rate change in all these operations.

1492
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:47,520
First, go here,

1493
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,040
this log in button, not click.

1494
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,680
Can we change it to like this click

1495
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:59,400
log in beech start log in.

1496
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:02,520
Can we do this weights similarly this one

1497
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,880
and we do the same next

1498
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,400
log in page thought

1499
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:09,840
password.

1500
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,120
So it is asking for their data. Fine.

1501
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:17,080
So their data is my password.

1502
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,240
Simple

1503
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:22,640
right?

1504
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,600
I don't need this bar then.

1505
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,760
Here I can also send text

1506
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,600
log in page or username comma username.

1507
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,400
Really?

1508
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:36,560
I don't need this
but see how I'm going to reduce my code.

1509
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:40,600
Now those lending functions become red.

1510
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:43,520
Lending functions become a function
of just two or three or four lines.

1511
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,280
It includes a solution also in this three

1512
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,800
or four lines, it can use a solution also

1513
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:51,560
restored

1514
01:26:56,040 --> 01:27:01,760
it. Now
again here, here, let me change it.

1515
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,640
Click on login page dart log in.

1516
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:10,200
But then

1517
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,720
here also

1518
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,360
certain text guys I'm changing
only the things made

1519
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,920
which we have to change

1520
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,960
password.

1521
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,200
Great.

1522
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:56,040
So now see earlier
it was a function of one two, 345 lines

1523
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,320
right now
it converted into just two line thanks

1524
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,480
what was coming out the previous lines
that is helpful for comparison.

1525
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,280
Yes he is correct
I'm not going to delete anything.

1526
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:10,000
Nobody gets totally
I'm not going to do anything.

1527
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:10,800
Fine.

1528
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,280
Now going to this employs search systems.

1529
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,120
See this time also what I can do.

1530
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:20,080
So please see click, bash dart

1531
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,480
in more simple

1532
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:30,360
way here. Also

1533
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,520
click bash dart

1534
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,000
employed is to work on

1535
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,960
rate case

1536
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,200
here to see this

1537
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:47,440
data rate the data which we are passing
so here I can rate

1538
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,120
send text for my employee list page

1539
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:54,360
dart ID employee search karma.

1540
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,160
And then this is simply

1541
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,520
even this value.

1542
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,760
Also we get bars from where they sent me

1543
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,360
this value.

1544
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,040
Also we can pass from where

1545
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,720
students

1546
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,840
we can pass from configured properties

1547
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,320
like we can pass it from examples
to when we get buzzing from data table.

1548
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,840
We can possible
extend its invite rate multiple places.

1549
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:30,600
You got it.

1550
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,040
Is this correct or not?

1551
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,120
Students

1552
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:37,680
BMC And what a single example
Example statements

1553
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:41,720
with scenario outline We have seen
data table with key without keys.

1554
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:44,680
We have seen directly passing
in the future files.

1555
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:48,240
The steps we have seen passing the data
from configured

1556
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:51,480
properties, separate
config properties, target property value

1557
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,600
we have seen,
and then passing the data from Excel by.

1558
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,960
You have five ways
anywhere read multiple vicious

1559
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:58,920
to crime

1560
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:01,800
final.

1561
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,560
Now here the next important point to click

1562
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:07,640
again here search button

1563
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,760
are right

1564
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,680
so for that you'll be having separate
rating stations for that

1565
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:28,680
I will take those stations
just one session, 3 hours.

1566
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,520
Every single question will be answered.

1567
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:31,560
Of course

1568
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,320
I would remember the dates, right.

1569
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:37,640
So that is a series of steps
which we should remember.

1570
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:42,120
Like I said, you don't need to remember
every single line of code

1571
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:44,880
right?

1572
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,240
You don't need to remember
every single line of code.

1573
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:48,480
For example.

1574
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:53,160
For example, if you know what this page
object model is, right, what you want

1575
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,760
would be a first approach for page
object model is to

1576
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:01,320
what?

1577
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,160
I'm just giving you one example.

1578
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:06,440
If you are aware of page
object model designed by then.

1579
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,560
So what would be your approach
to implement page object murder design?

1580
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:13,560
But what is the first thing
you would release?

1581
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,200
You will create pages package, right?

1582
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,280
You will create a package.

1583
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,960
Then what
you will do, you will make the pages.

1584
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,320
Then what you will do
and organizing package with the locators

1585
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,680
right then

1586
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,320
you will find the elements
and put them there.

1587
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:36,000
After that.

1588
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,400
Plus no constructors right after that

1589
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:45,240
constructor, Correct.

1590
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,440
Simply this is the page object model.

1591
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:48,520
Right.

1592
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,560
So now tell me to expand this.

1593
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:52,280
You are

1594
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:02,280
in the

1595
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:06,360
we'll extend this you want explaining
with that See you know this already

1596
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,040
it's all about having a belief that
yes I can remember

1597
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:12,200
and I will remember for sure.

1598
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,120
What is this framework?

1599
01:32:14,120 --> 01:32:18,120
Just 2530 classes, five six packages,
one application.

1600
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,320
That's it.

1601
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:21,320
That's it.

1602
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:23,880
We need to remember how difficult

1603
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:27,400
even on fingers
it is configured for of a below 60.

1604
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,080
Things that you need to remember next in

1605
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,320
your brain is an ocean, right?

1606
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:41,400
It is just a drop in an ocean,
not the money you don't need

1607
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,320
the moment you allow negativity,

1608
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:48,480
but we entered stemmed into your mind,
right?

1609
01:32:48,720 --> 01:32:51,200
Your downfall starts normally

1610
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,320
again, as we know.

1611
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,800
Not even this My trade in classes
with me on many classes.

1612
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,120
You guys think eight plus 311.

1613
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:07,160
That's right, guys.

1614
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:20,520
Just 11 classes.

1615
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:28,520
All right, next

1616
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:31,640
one employee list page

1617
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:41,680
or MP, Common value

1618
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:47,760
X, Y, Z to find.

1619
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,640
We have changed dysfunction, right?

1620
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,800
We have JS dysfunctions in those steps.

1621
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,840
Now, let's talk about the third one.

1622
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,320
Third one.

1623
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:02,400
There is nothing to change here.

1624
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,920
Fine. There is nothing to change.

1625
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:04,840
An employee steps.

1626
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,760
Might be a lot of things to change.

1627
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:07,960
Yes, correct.

1628
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,520
So let's do it.

1629
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,120
Click.

1630
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:16,400
We are changing this thought emotion.

1631
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:27,200
I hope everyone is understanding
what I'm doing right.

1632
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:29,760
Rich and music class. It's okay. My

1633
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:34,040
same things to

1634
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:37,280
an employee page fours to me, comma,

1635
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,480
whatever the value we're passing.

1636
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,160
So it it would be

1637
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,360
whose name is this?

1638
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:50,360
No one in a among right?

1639
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:51,960
I wouldn't know the combinations.

1640
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,080
What I mean

1641
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:59,360
So dig straight
so employ a dark last name.

1642
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:02,760
Gamma ray, M s

1643
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:07,320
this is first name

1644
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,600
and then

1645
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,080
click

1646
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:15,240
start save button

1647
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,720
comes looking for this.

1648
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:30,280
Maybe that to

1649
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:32,240
Silvana

1650
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,760
M was the only

1651
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,000
the right Correct or not,
I was going to miss a blessing.

1652
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:40,840
It was going is gone

1653
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:51,960
So now

1654
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,720
sent text or it employed or first name.

1655
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,440
This is the locator and.

1656
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:39,280
This is the key we are calling Find.

1657
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,040
Got it.

1658
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:46,080
One of the most amazing

1659
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:49,840
thing Brain could get has ever 20

1660
01:36:51,160 --> 01:37:11,440
Amazing guy. Yep.

1661
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:52,280
Great human being.

1662
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,920
And now here you see
simple click operation

1663
01:37:56,680 --> 01:38:00,800
great with eg new employee beach dart dart

1664
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,240
Silverton

1665
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,080
cool.

1666
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,200
Then click on

1667
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,880
this dog and employment it again.

1668
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,800
Come in this part.

1669
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,400
I hope this would be the last function
for this.

1670
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,880
Just this last function.

1671
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:23,000
So click

1672
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:24,360
fish.

1673
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,120
Know why I'm doing this?

1674
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,400
Because I know if I don't do this
and if I ask you get a change

1675
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:32,760
of second parameters in line
number 80 and 83 is a sure

1676
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:37,080
line number 1883 80

1677
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:38,920
line number.

1678
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,840
It is already collected.

1679
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:41,760
Oh, here.

1680
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,200
You mean my last name?

1681
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:48,160
And he finds her

1682
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:51,000
copy.

1683
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,240
That's why I'm doing this.

1684
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:58,240
Because I know if I tell you to do it
right after something,

1685
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:00,840
I will get some responses
in this index of order.

1686
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,600
My code is not working. What happened?

1687
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,480
That's why I'm not letting you do this.

1688
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:06,240
I'm doing this

1689
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:12,880
password.

1690
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:17,520
I got one message right.

1691
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,800
Why are you always?

1692
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,480
My code is not.

1693
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:27,720
And I was answering this.

1694
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:31,440
I mean, I had no clue
what the ones that were to responsible.

1695
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,920
And then finally I had a blank.

1696
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:36,240
I'm sorry.

1697
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:41,560
And make sure it will not work next time.

1698
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,080
What else?

1699
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,280
I can see

1700
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:03,720
employed list for the right word.

1701
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:04,920
Deshmukh.

1702
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:07,320
What is the easiest way to find

1703
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:11,600
a mistake?

1704
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:11,960
Good.

1705
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:14,400
We did the best one there.

1706
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,600
Even worse yet, some things about this

1707
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:18,960
typing

1708
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:23,160
are easiest way

1709
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:26,480
to find a mistake
is to read the console properly.

1710
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,240
Whatever console. Since

1711
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,920
late whatever console is.

1712
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:36,640
Once you had that kind of observation,
remember guys sharp sharper observation

1713
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,120
being a due engineer, right?

1714
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:42,280
I'm telling you, from my experience,
it is one from best. When

1715
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:45,120
who is

1716
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:55,640
this legend?

1717
01:41:55,640 --> 01:42:18,800
It must be the instructor.

1718
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,600
Remember this?

1719
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,840
What I'm saying basically is
observation is very important.

1720
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:28,520
We need to engineer.

1721
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:30,000
Very important.

1722
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,080
If you know how to identify, observe

1723
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:36,400
the tiny details, minor details
of the application rate.

1724
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,920
Believe me.

1725
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,760
Believe me,
the bug free software is getting deep.

1726
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:44,280
The delivery of this type of software
is guaranteed.

1727
01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:48,360
If there is an engineer
who is working on testing department.

1728
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:48,960
Right.

1729
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,160
He's a keen observer.

1730
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:53,720
It was predicted.

1731
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:57,440
I'm telling you this from my experience

1732
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,560
finally

1733
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,720
finding nano milk.

1734
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:36,120
Finally, because I have a fever
the next way optimality.

1735
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:41,000
I'm taking this.

1736
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,560
We never had a class on trading
console already.

1737
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:48,720
Find everything I will be needing,
but I will.

1738
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:51,080
What is console basically. No, no, no.

1739
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:54,360
With just a blue because of early morning.

1740
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:55,000
Right.

1741
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:59,080
And you shot it
like 330 of all in this window.

1742
01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:02,680
Obviously Golden glove is very normal
if you it is very normal

1743
01:44:02,680 --> 01:44:06,360
in this case.

1744
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:06,720
All right.

1745
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:11,680
So now every single step is fixed
for same text and for completion rate

1746
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:16,400
here.

1747
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,960
I mean, I would trade for medicinal.

1748
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,040
The next one

1749
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:34,840
if condition nine.

1750
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,280
Which one?

1751
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,240
You mean?

1752
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,320
So the one

1753
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:46,360
if nine when I have condition

1754
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,920
scroll up. Sure.

1755
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,600
Screw this one

1756
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:59,640
for clicking on checkbox.

1757
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:00,840
Okay, fine.

1758
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:21,720
Take it.

1759
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:22,120
Water.

1760
01:45:22,120 --> 01:45:24,440
I mean you want excellent work.

1761
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,080
Amazing.

1762
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:29,280
Pay attention back then
and copy code from the native.

1763
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,960
Well,
it's some poetry going on little bit.

1764
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,760
Plants.

1765
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,480
Nice, Nice.

1766
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:42,480
Competition begins.

1767
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:45,280
So now with reality,
we have one Shakespeare also in the bench.

1768
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:53,920
Once I see

1769
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,960
a lot of good lines in
there can be generated nothingness.

1770
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,080
Yes. Yes we can.

1771
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,040
We will. We will.

1772
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,720
We will now
see Write majority of your code.

1773
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:07,840
If you see majority of your code is now
commended, it means we are not using it.

1774
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,400
Only a few lines of code we're using.

1775
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:15,760
Can you see, guys, I left this code
so that you can compare somehow, right?

1776
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,600
You can compare this code somehow.

1777
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:20,400
And if there is anything
which I missed rate

1778
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:24,200
in converting it from normal methods
to our universal methods.

1779
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:24,600
Right.

1780
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:27,480
You can do it.

1781
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:27,800
Don't

1782
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:32,000
please don't send me message that, hey,
you forgot to convert those two methods.

1783
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,920
I'm still saying again.

1784
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:34,800
I mean in advance.

1785
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:36,000
I'm sorry for that.

1786
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,080
Okay.

1787
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,720
Not even heaven, but do not even know.

1788
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,680
That's
what I'm telling you. Not even language.

1789
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:47,200
20. Fine

1790
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,960
so far against these two functions.

1791
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:55,680
So for these two functions,
keep this for functions actually

1792
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,040
are this functions clear to everyone

1793
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:04,160
I really needed.

1794
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,720
And this you started yesterday.
I wasn't needed.

1795
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,760
I thought of you

1796
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:11,040
all for hard.

1797
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,960
Not even required.

1798
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:13,840
Not even for it.

1799
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:16,080
Not even you're required after you run up.

1800
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:19,640
You made your code
and you committed to the repository.

1801
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:24,760
Not even a person declared the script
will execute itself automatically.

1802
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:30,400
That kind of a that kind of setup
we are going to teach you, right?

1803
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,760
We will teach you that sort of right.

1804
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:36,760
All you will get is when you wake up
in the morning, you will get one email

1805
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:42,000
in your mailbox, right in your mailbox,
and in that box, one email will be there.

1806
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,920
That email will say, Hey,

1807
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:47,880
you're doing this
because it's executed nine plus one print.

1808
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,840
This is that is an option.

1809
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,640
You'll go ahead and check.

1810
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:52,840
So by the time you come to the office,
right,

1811
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:55,960
you already have a plan in your mind
having a plan in your mind that,

1812
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:58,600
okay, I need to work on that part
because that is fitting.

1813
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:08,080
Now, that's

1814
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:10,480
great.

1815
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,200
On the

1816
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:14,040
exactly

1817
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,560
note, trust a lot of trust issues

1818
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,160
will be executing from going from. Yes.

1819
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:28,520
Yes, sir.

1820
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:29,800
Latest last word.

1821
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:32,880
One step from command
to rinse without intelligent.

1822
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:35,520
Right. And then the primary step? Right.

1823
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,400
The main step would be not even command

1824
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:39,520
prompt required,
not even computer required.

1825
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:42,840
So like that, by the end of the course.

1826
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,120
Right.
You will learn that. But also nobody.

1827
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:49,000
So we would like I said, right,
there is a series of steps

1828
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,960
and we are taking you
through all of those steps one by one

1829
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:00,200
by now.

1830
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:04,200
Now, let's talk
about another important point.

1831
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,040
Okay, Let's talk about another one.

1832
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,040
What is that?

1833
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:10,920
See some times you perform, click

1834
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,280
operation, write in your application.

1835
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:16,160
Sometimes you'll click opposition works.

1836
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:19,280
See, as a Q engineer,
you have to think for all

1837
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:21,880
the possible combinations
that you can face.

1838
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:25,680
Not all the companies
use very different playbooks.

1839
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:28,160
Not all the companies use the company.

1840
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,360
No. Martin is rate
framework depends on the project,

1841
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:37,440
the requirement of one particular
application, but the concept is seen,

1842
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:41,800
for example, nowadays, majority
of the organizations prefer to work on it.

1843
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:45,600
You can put a framework right?

1844
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,080
Vanessa What 90% of organizations
prefer to work on it,

1845
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:50,960
but it

1846
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:54,600
now might
be possible that the name of this basis

1847
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,920
object model would be different,
such as convert pages,

1848
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:02,800
control trainers, write or conduct
execution classes, something like this.

1849
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:08,360
But seem okay.

1850
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:10,640
Java code will always be written in Java

1851
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:12,760
memory will always produce
but not examined.

1852
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:16,680
It's not like it will produce more
not dissimilar instead of contradicts, but

1853
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:19,200
it's not going to happen.

1854
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:20,040
Correct.

1855
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:23,120
So you need to understand the concept.

1856
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:25,120
Business is also famous.

1857
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,280
Can we do all interesting?
You do? Yes, sir.

1858
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,240
I will tell you to do this.

1859
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:30,520
I will show you how we can do it.

1860
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:33,120
Distinct is the one

1861
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,520
that we take you to that part.

1862
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:37,120
Okay? Just

1863
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:41,840
fine. Now,

1864
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,640
sometimes people like Operation Great

1865
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:48,280
and it happens. It works.

1866
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:52,080
But sometimes we come across
an issue in the application.

1867
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:53,440
Remember the history?

1868
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,960
Listen to me carefully. No.

1869
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,440
Now I'm coming to the point.

1870
01:50:57,680 --> 01:50:59,960
Sometimes when you perform click operation

1871
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:03,840
in your application, what happens is
basically it doesn't click.

1872
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:06,600
But when you perform manually click

1873
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:09,480
rate,

1874
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,720
you're able to click
when you perform it manually.

1875
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:14,800
But when you send this click operation

1876
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,120
using dot click
method, it's not able to click on it.

1877
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:24,000
Why is it so?

1878
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I asked why you logs do I select

1879
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,320
sometimes?

1880
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,880
Have you ever have you always studied?

1881
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:42,400
This is still a limited exception.

1882
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,200
A couple of more exceptions.

1883
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,520
Right? Element
not applicable. An exception.

1884
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:47,760
So many things.

1885
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,520
When element is not applicable
at this particular point.

1886
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,680
Some other point would take the click

1887
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,720
like this
and then it provides the coordinates.

1888
01:51:54,720 --> 01:51:59,880
Something like this.

1889
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:04,840
Right now
no element not applicable exception.

1890
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:06,720
So many exceptions are.

1891
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:10,320
I don't want to go
into digital, but my point is

1892
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:13,320
what is the alternative?

1893
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,600
You have to click on that element.

1894
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:25,320
If click method is not working, you're

1895
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:28,640
getting

1896
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,720
kind of excellent data.

1897
01:52:32,360 --> 01:52:35,120
We have JavaScript executed,

1898
01:52:35,120 --> 01:52:37,880
perform, click completion.

1899
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:42,680
Do we have it or not?

1900
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:45,840
In there is not a function
we are talking about function

1901
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:52,880
that is remember in there is a commander
and that is a function.

1902
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:58,840
There is an exact command.

1903
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:02,280
When you talk about JavaScript,
JavaScript, this particular function,

1904
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:06,360
we have to write a function
for JavaScript, but we have any function.

1905
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:07,000
Let's See

1906
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,200
if we get stuck in the application
right where my click operation

1907
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,200
is not working, what is the alternative
I have in my project?

1908
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:15,400
Do we have an alternative

1909
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:19,280
right now?

1910
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,200
Right now with the existing setup,
I'm talking about Mohammad

1911
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:24,840
and for the Einstein.

1912
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:26,880
Albert my mother, the Einstein.

1913
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:28,160
Do we have any sort of break?

1914
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,800
No, no, not yet.

1915
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:35,520
So what I have to do as a Q engineer,
as an automation architect,

1916
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:40,360
as a senior member of the testing team
order, complete project team or something.

1917
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:44,480
It's your responsibility
to think of all the possible scenarios

1918
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,640
and implement them in your framework.

1919
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:49,200
So let's set the model.
If you get an opportunity,

1920
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:52,280
where do you have to build the framework
from scratch?

1921
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:56,000
This all or the options read
this all are condition

1922
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:59,240
you should keep in your mind
when making the framework

1923
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:01,400
understood,

1924
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:05,720
because when you go for the review,
definitely senior technical guy

1925
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:08,160
or senior architect
was going to ask this question, Hey,

1926
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:10,720
what is the alternative
you have in your framework to complete

1927
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,280
Method is not going to work
at that point of time.

1928
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:16,200
You should be able to explain
that we have this alternative

1929
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:24,240
understood, right.

1930
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,760
That's that's the most important point.

1931
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:29,760
See, now from the explanation
point of view, I'm extending,

1932
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:35,000
what is the reason why I showed you the
positive data from five different sources

1933
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:39,720
so that when you go in the job
and when someone ask me

1934
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:43,400
you should not stuck to one point decay,
I can bother to to function feature.

1935
01:54:43,480 --> 01:54:46,280
I know
now you have so many things to explain.

1936
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:49,360
So many things that I can easily do
from example

1937
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:53,280
Quantic properties from feature file,
from Excel file, from here and from there.

1938
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,200
So many places,

1939
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:56,880
great viewing.

1940
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:00,120
It shows
that you have a diversified experience.

1941
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:03,720
You work on multiple projects
and this type of experience come

1942
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:06,840
when you generally work on two, three,
four projects.

1943
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:09,480
In one project.
You cannot do all of these things right.

1944
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:13,440
You'll always get stuck to one particular
functionality, one particular agenda,

1945
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:16,720
one particular decorum that you said
in the beginning of the project.

1946
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:21,080
Right then throughout the project, just in
a five things, you change a lot of ways.

1947
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,760
90% things are seen
that you don't really follow.

1948
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:27,400
But if you have this much of diversity
in your learning,

1949
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:30,760
if you have this much of a method
to implement right,

1950
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:33,000
and you know how to implement
all of these things

1951
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:36,000
and you know
the way you guys have been told Java

1952
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:41,560
rate the way if you are able to explain
Java like this, believe me, believe me,

1953
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:46,280
this is what even many professionals,
they don't know Java like this.

1954
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:47,160
The way you know

1955
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,040
what certainly is a perfect experience,
right?

1956
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:56,520
I told you that they also don't get to
restrict yourself free to one application.

1957
01:55:56,680 --> 01:56:00,040
Go take any application
and write your organization script.

1958
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:01,520
No, you have a but great.

1959
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,600
So just consider Amazon is your project.

1960
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,360
Make one framework.
Try to automate Amazon.

1961
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:11,160
Make one framework right to a Gmail, make
one framework right or something else.

1962
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:14,880
The more framework you already designed,
the more experience you will get right,

1963
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,280
and you will definitely learn
in one framework.

1964
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,320
Something else in another framework,
something else.

1965
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:21,400
You will learn so many things. Right?

1966
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,640
Right now we are going to read
a couple of more functions.

1967
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:27,440
If you come across Amazon, there
you see a lot of just one

1968
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,520
exercise I'm giving you, right?

1969
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,160
Just one exercise.

1970
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:34,560
Then you see Amazon,
how many dominos you see

1971
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,520
every year and every now and then year.

1972
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:40,640
And that is a drag down
values, a lot of problems, right?

1973
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:42,720
So everything you should read this link,

1974
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:44,760
plus what you should write
just one function for positive

1975
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:46,280
what would it the best thing

1976
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:52,080
just one functionality with some function.

1977
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:52,440
Right.

1978
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:56,960
So try to create one single from scratch
for any e-commerce application trade

1979
01:56:57,160 --> 01:56:59,920
and try to write this data
gives universal functions.

1980
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:00,440
Right?

1981
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:03,120
One more function select function right.

1982
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:06,640
And then use that particular function
across multiple web elements

1983
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:10,680
and then try to get the values straight
to perform this type of operations.

1984
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:15,000
And believe me, once you're done, once
you're done with this type of practice,

1985
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,880
great,
you will be able to explain from your own.

1986
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,280
Then you don't need video recordings again
and again.

1987
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:24,600
You don't need conceptual understanding
because you already implemented

1988
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:25,800
the concept on your own.

1989
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:29,760
So now that is no one will can explain
this concept better than you

1990
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,680
for the things you have been

1991
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:39,360
getting.

1992
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:46,080
My point based.

1993
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,480
So once this. I hope so

1994
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:57,480
great and great.

1995
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:58,200
Yeah, you'll be that.

1996
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:01,360
So if not the argument
because of security issues.

1997
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:03,480
Something else maybe.

1998
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:04,520
Right.

1999
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:07,200
Let me give you one really good
application.

2000
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:16,640
This application is there.

2001
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:18,240
I hope we are done.

2002
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:21,120
We have worked on this particular
application rate

2003
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:23,520
in this application. It's a simple one.

2004
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,480
This one

2005
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:32,840
right.

2006
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:35,880
Take this application or any
other application you can take No issues.

2007
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:38,640
So many applications you have, right?

2008
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:43,080
If you are open to work, you will take
a lot of things to work upon.

2009
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:44,880
Fine.

2010
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:47,360
So now let's talk about the alternative.

2011
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:50,480
What is the alternative of the click
JavaScript executable?

2012
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:53,480
So first the jardiance is the best rate.

2013
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:57,480
It has so many so many functionalities
to implement page so many functionalities.

2014
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:00,120
Okay, so let's consider it as a task.

2015
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:03,680
They create a function, create a function

2016
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:05,360
rate.

2017
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:08,560
Again, I'm repeating, let's take it
as a task for tomorrow's class.

2018
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:12,400
Create a function
which will be universal function.

2019
01:59:12,600 --> 01:59:16,640
And in that function
you have to write for select class.

2020
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,600
For select class, right?

2021
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:22,360
So based on maybe visible text
based on maybe index or whatever.

2022
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:22,760
Right.

2023
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:26,120
Implement the functionality
and basic across multiple drag.

2024
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:29,080
Don't save function write,
just override that element.

2025
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,400
Trying to find the data.

2026
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,640
Try to find the element
of selected performing.

2027
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:34,720
Can you do it for me

2028
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:39,080
guys?

2029
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:44,520
Can you do it?

2030
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:47,520
Image elements
Obviously initially ingenuous.

2031
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:50,120
Second task.

2032
01:59:50,120 --> 02:00:00,120
Second task.

2033
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:25,360
Well now the second task

2034
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:30,440
is going to the employee list.

2035
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:33,960
Select any employee.

2036
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:37,560
Right now
here you have to modify the details.

2037
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:39,200
What do you have to do?

2038
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,280
You have to modify the details.

2039
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,280
Now you'll see this standard is one.

2040
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:44,080
Now can you see

2041
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:48,520
guys, can you see nationality? Yes.

2042
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,440
This is the dropdown

2043
02:00:51,600 --> 02:00:53,600
and you see marital status.

2044
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:56,120
This is also a dropdown,

2045
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:56,840
right?

2046
02:00:57,120 --> 02:00:59,280
You should be able to click
on this checkbox.

2047
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:00,640
Right.

2048
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:05,480
Provide This name grade,
provide this data, change it, select

2049
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:07,760
the menu from here,

2050
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:10,920
read license expiry date selected

2051
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:13,040
date of birth selected from here.

2052
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:15,200
Now here.

2053
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:20,160
See the the universal function
for selecting the data from the dropdown.

2054
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:24,120
You will be that function
you can use only in one scenario names

2055
02:01:24,720 --> 02:01:26,440
can you see the scope

2056
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:32,720
students.

2057
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:38,160
Can you see there's a scope?

2058
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:38,880
Great.

2059
02:01:39,120 --> 02:01:39,840
Okay.

2060
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,200
So now I want you.

2061
02:01:41,200 --> 02:01:42,840
I want you to do this one.

2062
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:49,520
Okay.

2063
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:49,880
For me.

2064
02:01:49,880 --> 02:01:52,560
Shenanigan marital status for see post.

2065
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:55,360
You should be able to modify
all the details of. This employee

2066
02:01:58,760 --> 02:01:59,600
yes or not?

2067
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:02,280
Yes, I would be

2068
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:09,800
going after the class.

2069
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:11,880
Maybe after the class I will get

2070
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:16,320
after the class.

2071
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:19,560
I think you might date right now. Right?

2072
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:30,240
It will be lost somewhere.

2073
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:31,280
Fine. Great.

2074
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:35,480
So now let's write
the alternative function of click.

2075
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:40,600
So first, what I'm going to do, I'm
going to simply read one function

2076
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:44,680
that will return me,
my JavaScript executor object.

2077
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:49,120
So public
when I see this function is returning me

2078
02:02:49,120 --> 02:02:51,720
JavaScript executor then do
I need to write

2079
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:56,920
void here?

2080
02:02:56,920 --> 02:02:58,880
Do I need to write waiting days?

2081
02:02:58,880 --> 02:02:59,720
Then me

2082
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:03,120
I'm ready to get get genius

2083
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,960
exec to to execute

2084
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:09,680
so it will return JavaScript execute
an object

2085
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:14,640
no return

2086
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:29,240
element point element technologies

2087
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:33,320
on read your JavaScript execute.

2088
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:35,280
So here it returns

2089
02:03:38,760 --> 02:03:40,840
JavaScript execute fine.

2090
02:03:41,880 --> 02:03:45,040
And now,
now I'm going to repeat my function.

2091
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:47,840
So what I'm writing see

2092
02:03:48,440 --> 02:03:51,160
JavaScript execute is

2093
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:54,120
is equals to

2094
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:11,760
is this correct?

2095
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:15,480
Order was executed
because this function is going to return

2096
02:04:15,480 --> 02:04:17,840
my JavaScript execute object

2097
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:31,640
right?

2098
02:04:31,640 --> 02:04:33,840
Fine.

2099
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:36,160
Is it like unboxing

2100
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:40,880
kind of. Now?

2101
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,920
Now the main operation
which we are going to perform,

2102
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:49,800
what is that what we want to do
with the JavaScript case?

2103
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:58,640
What we want to do is with the JavaScript.

2104
02:04:58,640 --> 02:05:00,680
It is an alternative,
complete method. Great.

2105
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:03,240
So we have to click, find.

2106
02:05:03,240 --> 02:05:06,120
So I'm going to write public static void

2107
02:05:07,120 --> 02:05:09,720
is click JavaScript, execute that link.

2108
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:10,920
All right.

2109
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:16,120
So now I, I don't know, rate on which
particular element I need to perform this.

2110
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:16,960
Just click.

2111
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:21,720
So let me provide again
my web element, which is identity one.

2112
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,160
There exempt any element. Click

2113
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:27,800
click.

2114
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:34,200
Guys understood
why I provided web element.

2115
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:34,480
Fine.

2116
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:41,080
So I'm typing here, get double script,
execute the dart execute script and he had

2117
02:05:41,080 --> 02:05:45,880
what generally rate are your names of zero

2118
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:50,040
or click arguments of zero dot click.

2119
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:59,000
Is this correct correct?

2120
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:02,280
So we take the disguised dummy.

2121
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:03,880
It's indexed, Correct.

2122
02:06:03,880 --> 02:06:25,320
Is this index correct or not?

2123
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:29,720
No. It's going to.

2124
02:06:29,720 --> 02:06:33,000
Okay, fine.

2125
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,720
So far, so good.

2126
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:38,280
Everyone.

2127
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:40,040
Everyone So far so

2128
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:41,360
fine.

2129
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:43,520
Now let's come here.

2130
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:47,400
What I'm going to do is again, I'm going
to take this scenario picture, right?

2131
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:50,920
And in this scenario,
I'm going to take just one condition.

2132
02:06:50,920 --> 02:06:53,200
This one is right.

2133
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:55,520
So search employed by i.t.

2134
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,080
I'm talking about one
hypothetical situation.

2135
02:06:58,080 --> 02:07:01,080
What is the argument of zero represents?

2136
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:03,800
Oh, we go talking about

2137
02:07:04,760 --> 02:07:06,640
where there's no common methods

2138
02:07:06,640 --> 02:07:09,960
that you this one you mean

2139
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:12,000
arguments of zero. Right.

2140
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,240
But this is a basics index of JavaScript

2141
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:19,000
the basics and takes great arguments.

2142
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,720
So zero. No,

2143
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:26,160
let me consider this in any rate.

2144
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,920
So guys, I'm going to use
just one scenario.

2145
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:31,840
Let's make a hypothetical.

2146
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,800
So here I'm using this particular one.

2147
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:38,480
Now, what I'm trying to show you
is basically

2148
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:43,040
when I try to log in
to this particular application rate,

2149
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,920
let's say here after entering

2150
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:50,120
the username and password
onto this particular screen

2151
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:54,360
and click on log in button, let's
see if my application is not working.

2152
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:56,760
They're not taking click on Pim option.

2153
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:59,160
Just consider for a moment. Great.

2154
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:03,480
The button is not able to perform action
on Pim option.

2155
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:04,560
Right?

2156
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,920
I'm talking about one condition here
guys again.

2157
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:10,880
So now now this what I'm going to do

2158
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,120
is see, I'm

2159
02:08:14,120 --> 02:08:17,480
going to change
here in this particular step.

2160
02:08:18,720 --> 02:08:19,400
I'm going to

2161
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:23,360
change this click operation for Pim option
instead of this, I'm

2162
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:26,160
but I think just click bash. So

2163
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:32,120
and you see this

2164
02:08:32,120 --> 02:08:34,440
instead of performing normal click, I'm

2165
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:37,560
going to perform JavaScript click,

2166
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:39,480
let's this type

2167
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:06,120
it to click again.

2168
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:09,960
Nice.

2169
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:16,240
Raise the click or not perform click
operation using JavaScript also, right.

2170
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:21,360
So in case you're not quite ready
when your normal click is not working,

2171
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:24,800
you can use can we leave both and add
something like switch case?

2172
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:28,720
Oh, it's not preferable trade data.

2173
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:31,200
It's not preferable.

2174
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:36,720
So one egg, one thing, rate switch.

2175
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:38,760
And guess what is that gives you employed.

2176
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:46,360
If it is working, you produce not working.

2177
02:09:46,360 --> 02:09:49,000
Ah no.

2178
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:51,200
How would you know?

2179
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:53,280
How would you know? Sometime next click.

2180
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:54,800
Sometimes it doesn't

2181
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:58,680
rate if it is intermittent behavior
of the application that appears.

2182
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:00,840
Sometimes it doesn't appear something that

2183
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:04,680
you you never know.

2184
02:10:04,680 --> 02:10:08,760
See, right now
we're executing right on local product

2185
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:12,160
and here we're executing
just one just because we're good.

2186
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:15,480
This gives the member, when we execute it
in parallel, using this to

2187
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:23,400
how JavaScript works,

2188
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:26,040
That's what you didn't understand.

2189
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:29,520
Like every is JavaScript,
execute JavaScript,

2190
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:35,040
execute to interact with.

2191
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:36,720
We can use but we have rate.

2192
02:10:36,720 --> 02:10:39,800
We generally use this Berkeley
JavaScript executed.

2193
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:44,280
We know normal selenium methods
what they is JavaScript execute

2194
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:51,000
to interact with good UI element to work.

2195
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,000
It's not interact with algorithmic,
but when talk about selenium, it interacts

2196
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:06,120
with a,

2197
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:09,320
you know, basically document object
more than break

2198
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:14,360
java script execute it.

2199
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:17,840
My question is
what is there difference between normal

2200
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:21,080
blink and JavaScript executed

2201
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:25,920
come on days?

2202
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:28,800
What is the difference in between
JavaScript executing normal thing?

2203
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:29,320
They mean

2204
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:35,600
based on

2205
02:11:40,040 --> 02:11:41,640
whether one is or two clicks.

2206
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:45,000
Only one thing is an element error

2207
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:47,880
double digit.

2208
02:11:47,880 --> 02:12:02,080
Anyway, if we want.

2209
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:04,920
Sometimes I believe know nothing,
start like that.

2210
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:08,240
You're starting to see

2211
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:10,440
what it's all about.

2212
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:13,520
Interaction Video click is interesting

2213
02:12:13,520 --> 02:12:15,640
and video JavaScript is directly

2214
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:37,560
see when you talk about web
element, right?

2215
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:40,640
When you talk about click matter,
new selenium, right,

2216
02:12:40,840 --> 02:12:42,560
it interacts with your DOM.

2217
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:45,720
So you click on a web element,
maybe different from other browsers.

2218
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:48,560
So still enable private text to condition
force.

2219
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:51,320
This element is visible
so element is visible.

2220
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:54,600
We are from do what is don't videos
the original code

2221
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:56,640
guys remember what you doing.

2222
02:12:56,640 --> 02:13:00,480
Let me show you.

2223
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:01,800
This is your law.

2224
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:06,320
This is your Dom right now
when I'm hovering my mouse here right

2225
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:09,360
you'll see things are highlighting here
in they're correct.

2226
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:11,160
That's what it is saying.

2227
02:13:11,160 --> 02:13:12,280
That's what it is doing here.

2228
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:16,840
The element must be visible and is must
have a height and width greater than zero.

2229
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:21,480
This coordinate should be
greater than zero right looks appear you

2230
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:22,320
UI interaction.

2231
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:26,880
That's why we called
you like distinct user interface.

2232
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:30,360
Distinct because you are interacting
the user interface.

2233
02:13:30,360 --> 02:13:32,880
The things you see on
the screen is the UI.

2234
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,520
This is also what we think, right?

2235
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:37,920
There's one
that Indian is printing this thing.

2236
02:13:38,120 --> 02:13:40,120
It is viewing thing, right?

2237
02:13:40,120 --> 02:13:43,680
So now here you see what it says,
but in JavaScript

2238
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:47,560
clicks does not check
this preconditions before clicking

2239
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:49,720
right.

2240
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:52,440
Whether it is available,
it is visible to the screen.

2241
02:13:52,440 --> 02:13:54,800
What is no coordinates? No, it's a mouse.

2242
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:58,840
Click on an element symbol and then click
Whether it is used, such is input.

2243
02:13:58,840 --> 02:14:02,160
It fires the elements click even simple.

2244
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:04,480
So it means it interacts with code.

2245
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:08,600
It imprints directly with code.

2246
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:11,240
It's not looking for the element
which is available in there.

2247
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:15,000
Don't understanding my point,
it's all about interaction.

2248
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:16,880
Variable click method is language.

2249
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:19,080
Your JavaScript model is going.

2250
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:21,600
This is one of the most important
interview questions

2251
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:25,080
that understood the difference
in between JavaScript.

2252
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:27,000
Why JavaScript execute and works?

2253
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,240
Because JavaScript executed the

2254
02:14:31,080 --> 02:14:41,760
with the code, not with the UI element.

2255
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:42,840
What happens next?

2256
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:45,880
Understood what I'm trying to you

2257
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:48,280
now. Now let me show you another point
here.

2258
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:55,880
See, when you see
any normal click method right

2259
02:14:56,920 --> 02:14:58,920
there, just going to this click method

2260
02:14:59,080 --> 02:15:02,320
declaration,
it came here, opened this one.

2261
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:07,360
Now their definition, which was here,
the rate which we read the definition

2262
02:15:07,880 --> 02:15:10,160
you will find here
for this particular function

2263
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:15,760
they come on

2264
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:17,720
the element class directly.

2265
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:20,160
Well we've been automates this
I believe for this particular one

2266
02:15:20,600 --> 02:15:22,080
great wide click method.

2267
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:25,480
So here inside this,
if we open this click method

2268
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:32,280
that must be written. Yes.

2269
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:33,120
Yes. Correct.

2270
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:37,240
So one is interacting with the core,
one is letting the UI element break.

2271
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:38,720
What a simple explanation.

2272
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:42,440
Just think like this.

2273
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:43,200
Okay.

2274
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,480
For a simple explanation,

2275
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:50,200
one is interacting with the code,
one is interacting with the UI elements.

2276
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:51,960
Understood.

2277
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:55,080
Click is interacting with the UI element
JavaScript execute that is

2278
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:55,880
interacting with

2279
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:01,120
interacting with your code

2280
02:16:01,120 --> 02:16:02,560
and gets to know

2281
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:09,680
by playing

2282
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:15,400
Now your browser for the

2283
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:24,280
now see guys

2284
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:27,040
So far what I'm doing so far more time.

2285
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:31,880
The first First of all, everyone,
at least in this point,

2286
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:35,000
whatever the things we have created,
everyone reached this point

2287
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:44,320
like let me commit the code to this point

2288
02:16:44,320 --> 02:17:05,240
so that no one can ask any question
question.

2289
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:08,120
It's done. Code is dead in the right now.

2290
02:17:08,840 --> 02:17:12,000
So far, object
code is available in the repository.

2291
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:24,040
All right.

2292
02:17:24,040 --> 02:17:26,800
For now,
see what I'm going to do right here,

2293
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:29,600
right now. Right now.

2294
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:32,560
You'll see in this application
what is the problem here?

2295
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:37,040
Because is
we are still executing our script

2296
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,680
from multiple places.

2297
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:42,320
We are still executing on a script from

2298
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:44,040
place, from

2299
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:48,000
multiple places, for example,
and another class.

2300
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:49,320
So in general.

2301
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:52,920
So I have two regression and smoke right?

2302
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:56,320
If I want to run a smoke or regression
from just one place,

2303
02:17:57,160 --> 02:18:05,480
do I have any option here for that?

2304
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:06,160
No option.

2305
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:09,000
Great notion.

2306
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Fine.

2307
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:15,480
But now, now you'll see
the beauty of MAVEN project,

2308
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:18,920
which we are going to start
change there next.

2309
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:21,240
No need to change script now.

2310
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:25,000
We are actually looking
into the framework part from here.

2311
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:28,920
When Morgan is starting,

2312
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:32,960
open your open

2313
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:35,920
your Google browser and great maven.

2314
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:39,600
Sure, fire is

2315
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:40,840
flagging

2316
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:43,320
what you need to type.

2317
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:45,240
Maven Sure.

2318
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:48,480
Fire like you.

2319
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:52,040
Okay.

2320
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:52,320
Okay.

2321
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:55,320
This moment you're battling it

2322
02:18:57,760 --> 02:18:58,720
as everyone open

2323
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:05,360
this maven show for plugin, click on it,

2324
02:19:06,600 --> 02:19:08,840
click on it, it open this page.

2325
02:19:08,840 --> 02:19:11,040
Apache Maven project

2326
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:12,840
It's open

2327
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:17,560
it, open this particular page.

2328
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:20,520
No, no, no I open Maven.

2329
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:22,760
Sure Fire plugin. Right.

2330
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:25,760
I open this thing and I am
this pretty get it.

2331
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:30,240
Is everyone with me

2332
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:35,400
at this point?

2333
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:37,480
No. Because look,

2334
02:19:37,640 --> 02:19:40,160
even if someone was about to ask David

2335
02:19:40,200 --> 02:19:48,720
not ask.

2336
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:51,160
Nice go blue. Go,

2337
02:19:52,320 --> 02:19:54,320
go, go down

2338
02:19:54,360 --> 02:19:57,880
go down and see you're using best in

2339
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:01,840
can you see using testing to get everyone
see this

2340
02:20:03,120 --> 02:20:05,160
using the stingy

2341
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:08,760
go down this go down

2342
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:18,040
using this energy. Okay

2343
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:21,640
burst into.

2344
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:28,920
Click on it, click on it,

2345
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:40,520
click on it, click on it.

2346
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:43,000
Can you see it is saying using suit.

2347
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:45,440
It finds

2348
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:56,280
anybody.

2349
02:20:56,280 --> 02:21:04,720
Once it is using suit, examine,
find everyone,

2350
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:09,600
copy this part, copy this part

2351
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:20,000
is everyone copied this.

2352
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,600
Come to your project.

2353
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:28,280
I'm going very slowly
so that everyone can see what I'm doing.

2354
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:31,200
Come to your project open.

2355
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:32,400
Right. Examine, find

2356
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,920
open one Getting simplified.

2357
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,480
Go all the way down

2358
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:43,760
to their dependencies tag
and then pass it basic.

2359
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:46,560
We don't need to do anything
under dependencies.

2360
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,120
We don't need to do anything.

2361
02:21:48,120 --> 02:21:50,160
This and the dependencies.

2362
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:52,200
All right.

2363
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:55,160
And now here based

2364
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:57,040
don't rush.

2365
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:00,800
Don't send 1 million messages
of having error rate.

2366
02:22:01,120 --> 02:22:06,480
Okay everyone,

2367
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:12,920
until this point.

2368
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:15,760
No, no, no.

2369
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:19,200
Remove this three doors from here first

2370
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:22,480
and remove this three doors from you.

2371
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:26,960
Remove this three Laughlin,

2372
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:29,880
remove these lanes of three dot

2373
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:35,520
remote that we want guys

2374
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:41,320
nice now here now here

2375
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:45,920
before plugins
because plugins is a part of build

2376
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:51,120
so my plugins should come under the bed.

2377
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:54,920
It should come and that would be the tag.

2378
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:55,840
Right.

2379
02:22:55,840 --> 02:23:00,360
So before my plugins and after my plugins

2380
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:04,760
after my plugins,
I have to write this really back

2381
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,480
and you see what I did

2382
02:23:07,480 --> 02:23:10,720
before my plugins and after my plugins.

2383
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,200
I would wait change the way they use here
and under build.

2384
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:16,600
I have plugins.

2385
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:18,680
Under plugins, I have one plugin.

2386
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:19,840
Great. See.

2387
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:23,240
So from this plugin to plugin,
I have one plugin

2388
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:25,560
in plugins.

2389
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:28,280
I can have multiple plugin in big.

2390
02:23:28,520 --> 02:23:30,680
I can have multiple plugins module.

2391
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:31,760
Correct.

2392
02:23:32,440 --> 02:23:36,000
You know this had a great one
but in one best I can.

2393
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,840
Multiple packages in one big attack
in a multiple classes in one class.

2394
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:42,640
Like in a way people functions
from extended or similar.

2395
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:47,160
Similarly here, in one way
I can have multiple plugins in one plugins

2396
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:50,280
I can have multiple plugin detail
and this tool.

2397
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:54,320
So far everyone, everyone understood.

2398
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:58,080
No, no, no.

2399
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:01,360
Simply remove this three lines.

2400
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:06,040
So examples, files, suit, excrement files

2401
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:09,960
and so big simplifying
these three lines, these three things.

2402
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:12,080
Wait, wait, wait.

2403
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,800
Like I said, login is great.

2404
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:18,080
Nobody's noticing
it isn't going to make it chameleon.

2405
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:20,800
It will change its color, so don't

2406
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:25,960
wait.

2407
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:29,400
Remove these three lines.

2408
02:24:29,400 --> 02:24:30,520
Remove these three lines.

2409
02:24:30,520 --> 02:24:37,080
Everyone remove these three lines.

2410
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:38,720
No, no. Normally no one exists.

2411
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:41,400
And because we didn't completely.
That's what I'm saying.

2412
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:43,560
We didn't completely create this.

2413
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:47,160
What I'm saying
Hold your horses guides Now

2414
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:52,040
here simply right are code includes

2415
02:24:53,200 --> 02:24:56,560
includes blade includes Take

2416
02:24:58,040 --> 02:24:58,680
Everyone road.

2417
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:01,240
This includes open and close includes

2418
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:05,480
inside.

2419
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:07,760
This includes inside.

2420
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:09,240
This includes.

2421
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:09,680
Right.

2422
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:14,480
Another big goal include.

2423
02:25:14,480 --> 02:25:15,080
What is that?

2424
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:18,400
They code include again, open and close.

2425
02:25:18,400 --> 02:25:20,480
This tape include

2426
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:23,480
Can you see gains

2427
02:25:23,480 --> 02:25:27,400
include and include here?

2428
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:28,600
No, no.

2429
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:31,800
What are you what do you have to write
in between this to include?

2430
02:25:32,360 --> 02:25:34,480
You have to write double stuff.

2431
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:38,160
You have to read the will Star.

2432
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:41,560
Double star means your project repository.

2433
02:25:41,560 --> 02:25:42,120
Understood.

2434
02:25:43,560 --> 02:25:44,880
Double star means

2435
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:48,120
your this particular project
being assigned to see

2436
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:52,200
then slash stop.

2437
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:55,200
It means under is RC

2438
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:58,120
you will be having particular
part in Java.

2439
02:25:58,240 --> 02:26:00,600
You'll be having this particular mark.

2440
02:26:00,600 --> 02:26:02,920
Right When you provide this star,

2441
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:06,800
then you have to provide
the name of your runner class.

2442
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:08,520
So which level class I want to run?

2443
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:11,880
I want to smoke dark java

2444
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:14,640
with file extension.

2445
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:15,960
With file extension.

2446
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:18,960
I have to provide
so smoke as my java class or not.

2447
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:19,800
Tell me

2448
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:24,000
guys, is this my

2449
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:28,080
Java class or not?

2450
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:30,920
So now, now if you see right now.

2451
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:34,120
If you see if I want to run my smoke

2452
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:37,400
right, I can simply run it from here.

2453
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:39,760
Can you see a

2454
02:26:42,400 --> 02:26:45,080
lot of you already provided not see

2455
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:48,640
this particular day sort of one great

2456
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,360
this double stop rate
it means they had an acute build

2457
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:57,880
this point till this point your Java board

2458
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:01,520
then this is thought is under this
there is one package

2459
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:05,520
fine whatever
the bigger general in that big get find

2460
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:09,240
a smoked door java
and then configuration file restraints

2461
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:13,840
include this for execution how things work
I tell you, don't worry.

2462
02:27:14,280 --> 02:27:16,000
So this is what I'm talking about.

2463
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,960
Your Apache raid Maven.

2464
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:20,160
Sure. Fire plugin.

2465
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:21,960
What it does basically

2466
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:26,240
like for sure for plugin
this build tool in tomorrow's class.

2467
02:27:26,240 --> 02:27:28,800
Right. I will give you
a brief introduction about it.

2468
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:31,240
I Will give you the brief detail
about it. Right.

2469
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:34,480
First I'm just showing you as of now,

2470
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:36,840
if I have multiple execution points,

2471
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,680
this is not good practice.

2472
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:43,240
If I have a single execution point,

2473
02:27:44,480 --> 02:27:48,960
if I have a single execution point,
that's what I need in my project.

2474
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:49,680
Right?

2475
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:54,440
So now, from now onwards,
we will not change anything, right?

2476
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:58,000
We will not execute some time regulation
sometimes no.

2477
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,960
If I want to run a smoke. Right,
I can change here.

2478
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:04,800
Smoke If I want good indication,
I can change integration if I want to run.

2479
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:14,920
What that see?

2480
02:28:16,760 --> 02:28:17,760
That's it.

2481
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:23,080
I can look understood.

2482
02:28:23,080 --> 02:28:23,560
Understood.

2483
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:29,400
Based.

2484
02:28:29,400 --> 02:28:30,240
Fine.

2485
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:34,560
Now. Now, can someone please
copy this particular part?

2486
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:37,080
Someone copy this particular part?

2487
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:40,720
Yes. Get sensitive obviously,
and be straight in the group.

2488
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:45,400
So then if anyone has any edit
they can solve and they can use it.

2489
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:47,880
Just one. This one. Dun dun dun dun dun.

2490
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:49,680
That's it. That's it.

2491
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:53,400
Like all the all exciting guys.

2492
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:54,360

02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:16,600
Once everyone once
everyone had this party.

2501
02:29:16,680 --> 02:29:17,240

Fine.

2505
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:26,400
Now see.

2506
02:29:26,400 --> 02:29:28,760
Now see, I'm going to.

2507
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:31,640
I'm going first load my project.

2508
02:29:32,360 --> 02:29:35,000
If there is still an error,

2509
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:39,440
even after loading the page,
even after loading the Mavin project.

2510
02:29:39,440 --> 02:29:41,120
What do you have to do?

2511
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:47,720
Guys, at least let me explain.

2512
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:48,360
Rate.

2513
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:52,920
Even if EDM exist,
even after loading the moment project,

2514
02:29:52,920 --> 02:29:56,160
if it exist,
what do you have to do guys is

2515
02:29:56,640 --> 02:29:59,640
change this M5 to for

2516
02:30:01,080 --> 02:30:04,680
change this M5 to enforce windows two

2517
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:10,640
guys 3.0.0 hyphen m5

2518
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:15,560
we have this virgin M5
if even after loading the project,

2519
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:19,040
if someone is having
the error changes to M4.

2520
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:19,440
Right.

2521
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:32,800
So let me reload my project now.

2522
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:34,200
It says can not reconnect.

2523
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:47,640
Fine.

2524
02:30:47,640 --> 02:30:50,320
Now it's working fine.

2525
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:52,320
It's working fine for me right.

2526
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:55,680
It's done.

2527
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:57,000
Maryam, what is the status?

02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:10,520
played. It's good now.

2530
02:31:10,520 --> 02:31:11,800
See, I told you.

2531
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:21,240
Give me some time.

2532
02:31:21,240 --> 02:31:24,040
Include Maryam, please remove the space.

2533
02:31:24,040 --> 02:31:26,400
Do you see any space here from my side?

2534
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:28,320
No Space raid.

2535
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:32,160
Please remove the space
if you change it to import raid.

2536
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:35,560
If you change it to import

2537
02:31:35,560 --> 02:31:37,360
raid Mine is a still great.

2538
02:31:37,360 --> 02:31:39,160
Did you update the project?

2539
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:40,440
Did you reload the project? Will you

2540
02:31:43,480 --> 02:31:45,240
not you Maryam?

2541
02:31:45,240 --> 02:31:55,320
I mean the yours is done already.

2542
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:55,840
Great.

2543
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:59,840
Then change it to him for you Forget.

2544
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:01,800
And it takes time to refresh.

2545
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:03,760
It takes time to refresh. Great.

2546
02:32:03,760 --> 02:32:05,800
So whoever is having is still room for it.

2547
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:09,840
Fine guys
I asset name for only for those for whom,

2548
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:14,080
after reloading the project is still in
place is giving the error.

2549
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:16,880
They can put it as an alternative raid.

2550
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:20,120
But couple of others always you know
start from info only

2551
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:24,360
they're too good on first priority but
invite was the compatible one I give you.

2552
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:28,320
Is it as a workaround alternative for them
for not the military

2553
02:32:28,360 --> 02:32:36,520
one understood.

2554
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:42,600
Yes. Maryam, first raid your debut in five
Denote your project.

2555
02:32:43,200 --> 02:32:47,760
Give it some time Exit your IED invasion
raid closing echo one

2556
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:52,240
It will be gone.

2557
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:55,400
Alright guys.

2558
02:32:55,400 --> 02:32:56,520
So far so good, everyone.

2559
02:32:57,480 --> 02:32:58,280
No, that's fine.

2560
02:32:58,280 --> 02:33:02,640
That's completely fine, Warwick.

2561
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:06,440
So now see the GRC,
the main point rate. Why?

2562
02:33:06,440 --> 02:33:08,560
Why we implemented this particular part?

2563
02:33:09,240 --> 02:33:10,120
Because.

2564
02:33:10,120 --> 02:33:13,280
Because this particular part,
if you see RAID,

2565
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:17,320
we have single execution point
and from today onwards

2566
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:22,040
we will not execute smoke remnant class
regression class. No.

2567
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:25,160
If you want to execute them,
we can execute this from here

2568
02:33:25,160 --> 02:33:27,680
on this tour

2569
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:33,000
and this tool.

2570
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:36,560
How we can execute here. See

2571
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:39,960
here, you see?

2572
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:42,120
Can you see this one option?

2573
02:33:42,120 --> 02:33:43,080
Everyone

2574
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:48,120
in is it is never an option.

2575
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:50,520
In the top right, top right corner.

2576
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,640
Click on it.

2577
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:58,280
Click on it.

2578
02:33:58,280 --> 02:33:59,840
This is your project name, right?

2579
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:02,840
Everyone can see the project. Me

2580
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:08,840
expanded,

2581
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,240
expanded.

2582
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:12,360
It gives you life cycle here.

2583
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:14,400
Can you see they've taken everyone

2584
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:19,320
open this lifecycle

2585
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:23,920
Now see in this lifecycle
you have so many phases clean, readily

2586
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:27,160
combined based baggage, verify, install,

2587
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:30,520
side deploy lot of things for now.

2588
02:34:30,720 --> 02:34:36,000
For now, just focus on clean
and this focus on clean

2589
02:34:36,120 --> 02:34:41,080
and best understood two things
focus on clean and test.

2590
02:34:41,360 --> 02:34:44,160
So first, let's run clean.

2591
02:34:44,640 --> 02:34:50,360
So how different clean double click on it.

2592
02:34:50,360 --> 02:34:52,760
Simple, just double click on it.

2593
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:56,160
Now see what happens.

2594
02:34:56,160 --> 02:34:57,760
It it is giving me one thing.

2595
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:00,040
It says Build a success.

2596
02:35:00,040 --> 02:35:06,480
Can you see it says build a success.

2597
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:07,360
A Katrina.

2598
02:35:07,360 --> 02:35:20,040
What happened?

2599
02:35:20,040 --> 02:35:24,040
Yeah, sure.

2600
02:35:24,040 --> 02:35:29,760
See here, here.

2601
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:30,480
Can you see?

2602
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:32,720
It is never an optional

2603
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:35,760
on this.

2604
02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:37,520
Click on it.

2605
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:43,920
You will see a screen like this right?

2606
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:46,240
And then it says process terminated.

2607
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:47,640
Remember why it's terminated?

2608
02:35:47,640 --> 02:35:51,360
Why you terminated the process.

2609
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:55,120
Did you close and open your dirty,
close your ID and open it again.

2610
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:57,080
Please

2611
02:35:57,080 --> 02:36:00,240
close your intelligent and open it again
and then reload the project.

2612
02:36:00,280 --> 02:36:02,520
I still see this option. Reload trade.

2613
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:06,440
There is click on it, reload option
and then it will be working

2614
02:36:06,440 --> 02:36:07,040
point

2615
02:36:13,400 --> 02:36:16,840
like now open it under lifecycle.

2616
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:18,360
Today you see

2617
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:22,240
there's way nature.

2618
02:36:22,240 --> 02:36:23,680
It means it is working fine.

2619
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:27,680
And here just double click on clean,
double click on clean.

2620
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:31,840
If you are working on clean
and it says build success,

2621
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:36,520
it says Wilson says
it means every single dependency,

2622
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:42,360
every single plugin, every single dot,
everything is perfect.

2623
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:44,000
Everything is perfect.

2624
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:44,920
In your project,

2625
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:53,040
there's web Windows Access, the student,
that's where it says Big success.

2626
02:36:53,560 --> 02:36:54,280
Fine.

2627
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:59,520
Remember one thing, even
even if you're good, even if your code,

2628
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:04,800
for example, if you're executing Benson,
it is out of this team nine is free raid.

2629
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:07,640
So when it comes to development
and employment paid

2630
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:12,640
in the time you get build success message,
you cannot deploy your project

2631
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:16,400
based on the deep despite
this is a development boom moment

2632
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:20,000
you can deploy it on to the production
server cutting

2633
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:24,000
so Maven doesn't allow you to deploy.

2634
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:28,200
It will open the production on film
unless it is 100% correct.

2635
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:30,960
Hundred percent correct means all there.

2636
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:34,080
Just because this should be executed,
it should be fast.

2637
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:35,640
Understood.

2638
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:38,760
So even if nine is positive,
one is still it will give you

2639
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:42,000
a you're not will success rate.

2640
02:37:42,240 --> 02:37:44,760
No, I think that you be doing eight.

2641
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:48,400
What is the meaning of this
big message and why we didn't really use.

2642
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:49,720
Yeah.

2643
02:37:49,720 --> 02:37:51,080
Wait, wait, wait.

2644
02:37:51,080 --> 02:37:53,280
There's what I believe is
the one way we use clean.

2645
02:37:53,680 --> 02:37:56,080
I will tell you that nobody

2646
02:37:57,800 --> 02:38:00,360
I also had these rate of Totally.

2647
02:38:01,800 --> 02:38:03,840
I know, I know why Why we have this

2648
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,160
I'm here. Exactly.

2649
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:09,600
See, now,

2650
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:12,720
when we actually execute this test rate,

2651
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:15,800
it would be best if I double click here.

2652
02:38:15,800 --> 02:38:18,240
Then it will execute this this move. Plus,

2653
02:38:19,440 --> 02:38:22,680
in this smoke,
whatever the things we have right,

2654
02:38:22,760 --> 02:38:25,760
it will execute based on the XY.

2655
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:28,240
I'm double clicking on test

2656
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:39,040
now see what is happening.

2657
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:40,160
It is taking running run.

2658
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:44,080
Nurses smoke,

2659
02:38:44,080 --> 02:39:07,840
it is taking on or tell me this.

2660
02:39:07,840 --> 02:39:09,280
Everyone is executing.

2661
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:11,080
Everyone is executing.

2662
02:39:11,080 --> 02:39:14,520
I'm damn sure they can see the response
of application

2663
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:31,720
here.

2664
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:34,080
Fine. Now see guys here

2665
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:36,160
it says

2666
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:40,200
best run one failure zero and a zero
skill zero.

2667
02:39:40,560 --> 02:39:41,480
The desert is best.

2668
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:41,960
Run one.

2669
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:44,280
No failure, no error, no escape.

2670
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:46,080
Big success.

2671
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:48,960
Can you see?

2672
02:39:48,960 --> 02:39:51,360
Can you see this? Will success?

2673
02:39:51,360 --> 02:39:52,560
No, no.

2674
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:54,760
Let me show you something.

2675
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:58,160
Can you see it
for literally here in this target folder,

2676
02:39:58,160 --> 02:39:59,480
you see all these things kick in.

2677
02:39:59,480 --> 02:40:03,840
Bullish team on the board
generated resources MAVEN status.

2678
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,520
Sure. Fire reports.

2679
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:10,320
Best guesses Can everyone see this?

2680
02:40:10,320 --> 02:40:12,280
Can everyone see this

2681
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:18,000
now? See,

2682
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:20,840
just double click on this clean
option again.

2683
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:23,600
Double click on the screen option.

2684
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:25,560
Run this clean again.

2685
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:29,200
And when you run this clean again,
this time if you go,

2686
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:35,800
that is no target folder in your project.

2687
02:40:35,800 --> 02:40:38,320
On the rewards for the execution.

2688
02:40:38,320 --> 02:40:41,040
All the reports
for the execution is gone. Now

2689
02:40:56,680 --> 02:40:58,120
is and you see

2690
02:40:58,120 --> 02:41:02,240
all the target reports read files under
their target report is gone.

2691
02:41:03,360 --> 02:41:07,640
Why is the reason behind
this memory tool is the intelligent one.

2692
02:41:08,320 --> 02:41:12,160
You have a lot of ways
created every time, a lot of friends

2693
02:41:12,160 --> 02:41:15,840
you create every day, making target
like your reports

2694
02:41:16,680 --> 02:41:19,960
make other logs
and everything and unnecessarily.

2695
02:41:19,960 --> 02:41:23,200
It is increasing the size of your project.

2696
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:27,000
So even if your actual code
is not that bulky,

2697
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:29,880
if your actual code is not that bulky,

2698
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:35,040
these files are meeting your code
in actual bulkier than ever before.

2699
02:41:35,640 --> 02:41:36,520
And this tool

2700
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:40,480
and according to the standards,
they should not be having a bulky code

2701
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:44,000
right in the framework
attribute should be really laid to it.

2702
02:41:44,320 --> 02:41:47,160
Now you'll see
if you get in this framework rate

2703
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:51,840
is that any driver will find having five,
six, seven in the door.

2704
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:56,000
The x if I look over driver folks driver
I know if I have to

2705
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:00,240
execute my script across five browser,
you know if it5

2706
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:04,840
but I will not find such a screwdriver
not to exceed g driver, not to exceed

2707
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:09,120
eight driver or d exceeds the funny
or proper driver or to exceed

2708
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:12,520
it will increase
the size of my project a lot.

2709
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:15,440
To me

2710
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:17,280
it will increase the size.

2711
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:19,320
It makes my code bulkier.

2712
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:21,360
So while putting this quarter to the cloud

2713
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:24,640
and if someone is trying to download
this good, it will take a lot of time.

2714
02:42:25,160 --> 02:42:27,880
Right. That's why we nucleated with code.

2715
02:42:27,880 --> 02:42:30,240
Now you see that is no bulky
journal plate.

2716
02:42:30,960 --> 02:42:33,000
There is no mention of Java
you need to provide.

2717
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:34,080
You just provide one thing.

2718
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:36,200
What is that dependency?

2719
02:42:36,200 --> 02:42:38,880
And when you provide dependency,
it works automatically for you.

2720
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:45,560
Correct?

2721
02:42:45,560 --> 02:42:48,440
Correct. Fine.

2722
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:54,640
So so far, this clean and dust part clear
clean

2723
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:58,800
is to clean your target folder to remove
all the unnecessary logs and everything.

2724
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:02,360
And best is to execute your project
from one particular location

2725
02:43:03,120 --> 02:43:10,920
and the stored.

2726
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:13,680
It says build success.
It wins. It is working fine.

2727
02:43:15,040 --> 02:43:15,640
You it

2728
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:28,440
says will success.

2729
02:43:28,440 --> 02:43:29,760
Yet the one that we can do it

2730
02:43:29,760 --> 02:43:32,800
when we are actually working
on the execution of scripts.

2731
02:43:32,800 --> 02:43:33,280
Right.

2732
02:43:33,280 --> 02:43:36,960
And when we are writing new automation
script then definitely we can use

2733
02:43:38,040 --> 02:43:40,280
definitely we can use no how, no break.

2734
02:43:40,320 --> 02:43:42,440
I don't I'm not in a brick as of now.

2735
02:43:42,760 --> 02:43:44,880
No brick. I already give you 25 next rate.

2736
02:43:45,600 --> 02:43:47,880
We are in a flooring now
we are in a flow right now.

2737
02:43:47,880 --> 02:43:49,880
Let's complete couple of more points.

2738
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:51,600
What if this feels weird?

2739
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:52,360
A failure message.

2740
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:53,640
Let me show you.

2741
02:43:53,640 --> 02:43:57,000
Let me show you See if I go this time.

2742
02:43:57,320 --> 02:43:59,960
If I go
this time, there can be intentionally

2743
02:44:00,040 --> 02:44:04,200
if we intentionally feel this, okay,

2744
02:44:04,200 --> 02:44:13,080
here, here already.

2745
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:14,520
What I'm going to do is see

2746
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:20,920
I'm going
to call this logging function fine

2747
02:44:22,680 --> 02:44:24,640
instead of this username intentionally.

2748
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:28,400
I provide wrong of this navigational
pointer exception in this case.

2749
02:44:28,640 --> 02:44:29,080
Right?

2750
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:30,000
Intentionally.

2751
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:31,400
I'm doing it

2752
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:34,680
and we will do it in different days.

2753
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:36,640
We still have to go to class.

2754
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:40,160
You know we don't have to go,
I will tell you that.

2755
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:42,400
So we continued.

2756
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:43,960
Anywhere else, we can change it.

2757
02:44:43,960 --> 02:44:46,840
We don't need to change in class now.

2758
02:44:46,840 --> 02:45:02,000
See what was going to happen this time,
even without putting a lot less.

2759
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:04,440
We can override. This takes in the class.

2760
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:13,920
Okay. How

2761
02:45:17,800 --> 02:45:18,960
how is it possible?

2762
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:23,400
Miracle, maybe.

2763
02:45:23,680 --> 02:45:26,320
Or the scenario

2764
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:28,560
can be worked without working? Yes.

2765
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:32,400
If you outsource your project, it.

2766
02:45:32,400 --> 02:45:34,480
If you outsource your project, then you to

2767
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:37,560
then are just failures.

2768
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:39,240
No, no worries.

2769
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:46,920
Let me check.

2770
02:45:46,920 --> 02:45:49,440
Very rudimentary, dangerous point.

2771
02:45:50,440 --> 02:45:51,760
So this should be this one.

2772
02:45:51,760 --> 02:46:11,240
Great.

2773
02:46:11,240 --> 02:46:14,000
Now I want to pass hardcoded data
for a moment

2774
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:15,480
in here.

2775
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:21,680
Let me check with scenario with security
this 2.0 or do we go here and check smoke?

2776
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:24,360
Funny not it makes it look this time

2777
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:43,520
what is going on

2778
02:46:44,120 --> 02:46:44,840
with scenario?

2779
02:46:44,840 --> 02:46:46,200
It is taking

2780
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:50,200
maybe maybe a couple of scenarios
we have with destiny,

2781
02:46:50,320 --> 02:46:51,480
maybe a couple of scenarios.

2782
02:46:51,480 --> 02:46:54,920
We have a need.

2783
02:46:54,920 --> 02:46:57,880
I want to make a train
which is not failing in this in any

2784
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:06,120
let me do it for this one

2785
02:47:06,120 --> 02:47:08,280
that we change this name for the scenario.

2786
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:12,240
Just give me a moment and it says hello.

2787
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:15,680
Okay, give me any condition.

2788
02:47:15,680 --> 02:47:17,920
Give me any condition
which I can put here, which is,

2789
02:47:18,240 --> 02:47:40,080
which is a wrong any condition.

2790
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:42,320
I'm giving just random error.

2791
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:45,840
One from here and from here.

2792
02:47:46,920 --> 02:47:47,280
Right.

2793
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:49,840
And then the

2794
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:53,600
executed from here flows administration.

2795
02:47:53,600 --> 02:48:05,800
The project loaded.

2796
02:48:05,800 --> 02:48:08,320
See that

2797
02:48:20,800 --> 02:48:24,520
finally.

2798
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:26,280
Finally. See,

2799
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:30,480
it says here, build the failure.

2800
02:48:30,480 --> 02:48:34,680
Can you see this test run
one failure zero.

2801
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:37,440
And there's one skillset right?

2802
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:41,480
So when your best case rate
when your best case three

2803
02:48:41,640 --> 02:48:44,960
is actually feeling
it gives you will failure it wins.

2804
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:46,320
Build is not success.

2805
02:48:46,320 --> 02:48:51,080
And if it is not success you cannot deploy
your go to for the environment.

2806
02:48:51,480 --> 02:48:53,160
Understood this

2807
02:48:56,880 --> 02:48:58,560
understood this

2808
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:12,160
deep fine.

2809
02:49:12,160 --> 02:49:22,160
So now first
let me change before I forget this.

2810
02:49:22,160 --> 02:49:25,200
We we are going
we are going to heart with end point.

2811
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:28,080
We are going to find now you see

2812
02:49:28,520 --> 02:49:31,120
now you see here in my smoke.

2813
02:49:31,400 --> 02:49:33,840
Right in my smoke. If you see. Great.

2814
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:37,400
Tell me how many

2815
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:40,080
a how many reports we are generating
is of not

2816
02:49:42,440 --> 02:49:45,000
how many reports we are generating

2817
02:49:50,480 --> 02:49:53,920
is just one HDMI output.

2818
02:49:53,920 --> 02:49:56,240
Basic rate.

2819
02:49:56,240 --> 02:49:58,600
But but there is

2820
02:49:58,600 --> 02:50:03,160
another report that is another report
which we can generate

2821
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:07,320
when we actually execute our gives
graph on dot.

2822
02:50:07,320 --> 02:50:09,360
Excellent point.

2823
02:50:09,400 --> 02:50:11,400
Excellent input. Now let's see.

2824
02:50:11,400 --> 02:50:13,280
Let's see this report. Right, Let's see.

2825
02:50:13,280 --> 02:50:16,920
This would be the best part of this class
pretty see

2826
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,040
here we have to write this report

2827
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:24,080
would be my decent report.

2828
02:50:24,080 --> 02:50:26,920
This report would be my days,
decent report.

2829
02:50:27,240 --> 02:50:30,160
And I am awaiting this report under my

2830
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:34,560
under my target folder
with the name key component.

2831
02:50:34,560 --> 02:50:35,400
Jason

2832
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:39,520
understood.

2833
02:50:39,520 --> 02:50:43,080
Understood.

2834
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:45,520
One point I missed

2835
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:48,600
it is taking care of your report
that you're generating.

2836
02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:51,760
It will also take care of the report,
generating this pretty

2837
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:56,760
is also a report part where it takes
care of the report in your console.

2838
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:59,720
You see all these steps
which are printing when we execute,

2839
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:03,480
you know, all the steps
printing in the console. This

2840
02:51:07,800 --> 02:51:08,800
in this console, when

2841
02:51:08,800 --> 02:51:11,880
you see all the steps of printing
it is because of this pretty

2842
02:51:12,040 --> 02:51:14,880
so it generates the reported
it will get it takes care of that

2843
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:18,480
their reported console or read
this one is issued

2844
02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:22,000
and this one this one is good report

2845
02:51:22,440 --> 02:51:23,320
all read

2846
02:51:26,480 --> 02:51:30,400
now now we are going to follow one guy

2847
02:51:31,440 --> 02:51:33,520

2848
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:35,480
We are going to follow this guy.

02:51:35,480 --> 02:51:37,560
This guy did a very good job for us.

2850
02:51:39,040 --> 02:51:40,200
Is it second report?

2851
02:51:40,200 --> 02:51:43,280
Yes, it is our second beginning.

02:51:43,280 --> 02:51:46,800
So today we are going
follow one very intelligent, very good guy

2853

02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:52,800
Okay, now see, who is this guy?

2878
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:39,520
to see, isn't it?

2879
02:53:39,520 --> 02:53:45,800
Isn't it?

2880
02:53:45,800 --> 02:53:48,560
All right, Bye bye. Bye.

Now. You'll see here.

2882
02:53:49,840 --> 02:53:55,400
Now you'll see here it says Melbourne

02:53:55,400 --> 02:53:56,160
Great.

2884
02:53:56,240 --> 02:54:00,000
Prepare for next to development edition
right now.

2885
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,360
See these guys still active.

2886
02:54:01,360 --> 02:54:04,320
Last updated on November 13th 2021.

2887
02:54:04,320 --> 02:54:05,520
Can you see?

2888
02:54:05,880 --> 02:54:08,000
Okay now you see here

2889
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:11,880
we have to use his
plugin this is his plugin.

2890
02:54:12,960 --> 02:54:14,200
This is his plugin.

2891
02:54:14,200 --> 02:54:17,600
We have been used by before
using this bulky plugins.

2892
02:54:17,800 --> 02:54:20,760
What he created for us right.

2893
02:54:20,760 --> 02:54:22,360
We have to do just one thing.

2894
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:27,280
See here it says
Melbourne model for the converted body.

2895
02:54:27,800 --> 02:54:32,760
Put this into your next image
see how do you know JenWagner

2896
02:54:32,760 --> 02:54:37,760
why is this guy is this guy is explaining
because he knows better.

2897
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:41,160
Elwin has all the Einstein books why he's
giving this instruction, what he sees.

2898
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:44,840
He says Maven model for the cucumber
reporting.

2899
02:54:45,480 --> 02:54:50,800
Put this in to your bomb dot
assembly and run in re and verify.

2900
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:54,640
So Consumer Reports will be generated
in target

2901
02:54:54,880 --> 02:54:57,240
Katoomba HDR will report

2902
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:00,560
it is explaining you this thing

2903
02:55:02,360 --> 02:55:03,480
in you case.

2904
02:55:03,480 --> 02:55:08,520
So what we have to do we have to use
this could do more reporting in our medium

2905
02:55:08,520 --> 02:55:13,560
to right then we have to run MBM verify
so this report will be generated.

2906
02:55:13,560 --> 02:55:16,680
I met my target folder, my main target.

2907
02:55:16,680 --> 02:55:20,000
There will be Uber HD will report on read

2908
02:55:21,800 --> 02:55:22,400
on. Right.

2909
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:26,000
Can you see?

2910
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:29,760
No, not look it closely Now
look at this closely.

2911
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:33,680
See here you see Braille maven

2912
02:55:33,680 --> 02:55:36,800
central reader 5.6.2 Right.

2913
02:55:37,560 --> 02:55:39,680
Going to see this is the Virgin Red.

2914
02:55:39,720 --> 02:55:41,880
This is the Virgin. This is the big find.

2915
02:55:42,680 --> 02:55:44,640
Don't do anything
read not. Don't do anything.

2916
02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:47,560
What I'm seeing now, see here,

2917
02:55:48,640 --> 02:55:51,120
you'll see from this plugin to this plugin

2918
02:55:53,280 --> 02:55:54,800
in, someone sent me the link

2919
02:55:54,800 --> 02:56:08,040
and I can share the link with him.

2920
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:08,360
Which

2921
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:11,280
one minced

2922
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:19,520
or any one.

2923
02:56:19,520 --> 02:56:24,160
And by the way, there is no competition
there to whoever is sending the first will

2924
02:56:24,360 --> 02:56:27,520
the prize so take is not going to give you

2925
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:30,600
any of any prize for sending the link.

2926
02:56:30,600 --> 02:56:38,880
But it's going to happen.

2927
02:56:38,880 --> 02:56:44,920
Disappointments every work.

2928
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:51,080
Nice.

2929
02:56:51,080 --> 02:56:55,120
I still remember 14 minutes
soil read in this photograph.

2930
02:56:55,120 --> 02:56:59,320
In his photograph
I saw first I thought to 1 billion

2931
02:56:59,320 --> 02:57:04,320
It is attending my class, getting a black
three piece tuxedo kind of thing

2932
02:57:06,480 --> 02:57:08,400
like this
also and it's the first impression

2933
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:11,080
rate is the last impression
and I was willingness to know

2934
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:14,080
that we generated something like this
just an upper the sports upper

2935
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:24,360
features linear right

2936
02:57:24,360 --> 02:57:26,640
because you want to hide
your millennial status

2937
02:57:26,640 --> 02:57:28,800
that's what you're showing yourself
as a millennial.

2938
02:57:29,200 --> 02:57:30,720
Great claim here.

2939
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:38,880
Excellent Like it.

2940
02:57:38,880 --> 02:57:39,480
Fine.

2941
02:57:39,480 --> 02:57:44,040
So now we see this particular part,
this black part.

2942
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:47,720
They see. So

2943
02:57:49,720 --> 02:57:52,560
this part
we already have a budget maven plugin

2944
02:57:52,560 --> 02:58:00,880
maven should display in part
we already have or not any.

2945
02:58:00,880 --> 02:58:05,760
The only thing the only thing
we don't have is this line is to failure.

2946
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:07,920
Ignored. What does it mean?

2947
02:58:07,920 --> 02:58:11,080
It means that if I'm executing my way
deep like this because this

2948
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:14,400
any one of my best is free rate is still

2949
02:58:14,520 --> 02:58:18,120
it will allow me
to execute my for test cases.

2950
02:58:18,560 --> 02:58:20,960
It will allow me
to execute my further discourses.

2951
02:58:21,160 --> 02:58:25,440
So best failure
ignore do I do keep this particular

2952
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:27,000
I need to

2953
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:30,320
keep this particular line in my bottom
right

2954
02:58:30,360 --> 02:58:34,440
exit will find the right after
my includes take

2955
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:40,240
include state means the last include
not the forced include otherwise

2956
02:58:40,240 --> 02:58:45,560
you will eventually end up inside
include I would say to my included here

2957
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:49,280
pasted here understood

2958
02:58:49,320 --> 02:58:52,680
all the geniuses understood
but I will have to read this test failure

2959
02:58:52,680 --> 02:58:55,040
ignore outside clause take

2960
02:58:56,880 --> 02:59:02,760
do it, do it

2961
02:59:08,920 --> 02:59:09,720
as everyone

2962
02:59:09,720 --> 02:59:20,000
it makes obvious

2963
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,800
they're going to know

2964
02:59:23,120 --> 02:59:26,560
now after they see this plugin
you already have here.

2965
02:59:26,920 --> 02:59:29,480
Great. This plugin you already have here.

2966
02:59:29,480 --> 02:59:32,520
It means this part
you already have getting

2967
02:59:37,080 --> 02:59:38,640
correct case.

2968
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:40,840
This building already have this plugins.

2969
02:59:40,840 --> 02:59:44,280
You already have this plugin,
you already read.

2970
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:48,360
Now copy this plugin concrete.

2971
02:59:48,360 --> 02:59:51,440
This plugin builders plugin not plugins

2972
02:59:51,800 --> 02:59:55,440
copy plugin to plugging,
copy this plugin to plugin

2973
02:59:55,840 --> 03:00:01,200
and then and then paste to this plugin
right after this particular.

2974
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:02,280
Like you'll see

2975
03:00:03,560 --> 03:00:05,640
I'm just giving you this piece to read.

2976
03:00:05,640 --> 03:00:06,840
You know, you can identify it.

See this plugin that we have?

2978
03:00:08,880 --> 03:00:13,000
I'm going to make another plugin
take from here, so this is my another bit.

2979
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:15,640
You'll see this is my under.

2980
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:19,160
Can you see everyone

2981
03:00:21,400 --> 03:00:21,840

2984
03:00:32,400 --> 03:00:35,560
by Shall we start now?

2985
03:00:35,640 --> 03:00:42,360
Shall we start?

2986
03:00:42,360 --> 03:00:45,120
Can you show from which part
you copied the one.

2987
03:00:45,120 --> 03:00:47,920
Not on the second plugin.
Read this plugin.

2988
03:00:47,920 --> 03:00:51,480
See from this plugin to particular.

2989
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:54,720
This plugin
read from this plugin to this plugin.

2990
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:58,160
Just copy it and then listed.

2991
03:00:58,160 --> 03:01:00,720
So the first plugin that we entered.

2992
03:01:01,520 --> 03:01:08,480
Okay, this is black.

2993
03:01:08,480 --> 03:01:11,520
I'm not able to see your comments
because a lot of code in front of me

2994
03:01:11,800 --> 03:01:16,040
in the chain.

2995
03:01:16,040 --> 03:01:16,600
Nice,

2996
03:01:17,680 --> 03:01:19,240
nasty, nasty.

2997
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:19,920
Here.

2998
03:01:19,960 --> 03:01:23,560
It says group ied make dark monster part.

2999
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:25,920
Can you see Ghobadi here?

3000
03:01:26,640 --> 03:01:29,040
Needless to talk

3001
03:01:30,960 --> 03:01:31,720
right

3002
03:01:33,560 --> 03:01:36,240
Melvin Cucumber reporting
This is the artifact.

3003
03:01:36,240 --> 03:01:39,440
Maybe we don't need to change group
in activity or read

3004
03:01:40,520 --> 03:01:42,200
group obedient or directly.

3005
03:01:42,200 --> 03:01:45,320
We don't need to change it is virgin

3006
03:01:45,840 --> 03:01:49,480
check virgin above for all the geniuses.

3007
03:01:49,480 --> 03:01:51,840
This is not the virgin name Chick.
What it about?

3008
03:01:51,840 --> 03:01:53,920
It means are to check virgin above.

3009
03:01:54,120 --> 03:01:58,880
Okay, let me go in the Chrome browser See?

3010
03:01:59,520 --> 03:02:01,680
Because he provided this in the link.

3011
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:04,000
That's he says check virgin above.

3012
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:05,640
So above means here.

3013
03:02:05,640 --> 03:02:07,760
Which virgin is this

3014
03:02:09,320 --> 03:02:11,640
right now it is 5.6.2

3015
03:02:12,800 --> 03:02:13,600
race.

3016
03:02:13,600 --> 03:02:14,680
Can you see

3017
03:02:16,240 --> 03:02:21,960
5.16562216 56.2

3018
03:02:22,760 --> 03:02:25,680
16v 56.2.

3019
03:02:25,680 --> 03:02:28,760
Everyone is using their ordinary click

3020
03:02:28,800 --> 03:02:33,360
with a actual word.

3021
03:02:33,360 --> 03:02:34,800
So here he is.

3022
03:02:34,800 --> 03:02:42,960
We have to rate 5.6.295.6 to understood

3023
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:49,280
understood everyone.

3024
03:02:49,280 --> 03:02:51,680
Now this feeds this phase.

3025
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:56,520
We are not going to verify why
because here he will see.

3026
03:02:57,120 --> 03:02:58,120
Here he was seeing.

3027
03:02:58,120 --> 03:03:00,880
If you see played

3028
03:03:00,960 --> 03:03:03,520
yet it sees run and then verify.

3029
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:06,720
Are we running ambient verify
we are running clean.

3030
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:10,080
And second thing what we are running

3031
03:03:10,120 --> 03:03:13,080
we are verifying of your testing

3032
03:03:13,080 --> 03:03:14,280
first right.

3033
03:03:14,280 --> 03:03:16,960
So the phase should be is

3034
03:03:17,640 --> 03:03:20,680
the phase should be test All right

3035
03:03:21,080 --> 03:03:24,440
The phase should be test

3036
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:25,320
so far.

3037
03:03:25,320 --> 03:03:26,720
So what everyone

3038
03:03:31,680 --> 03:03:34,920
know it says project name.

3039
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:40,880
What is the project name?

3040
03:03:40,880 --> 03:03:43,800
It is simply

3041
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,960
my project name is a
Jared was for let's see,

3042
03:03:46,960 --> 03:03:50,960
whatever the project number 11
find it would take the same name.

3043
03:03:50,960 --> 03:03:52,400
What behavior

3044
03:03:56,280 --> 03:03:59,680
in chat in his bachelor carrying

3045
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:01,600
it says This is optional.

3046
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:05,640
This is optional is skip so remove
because this is option.

3047
03:04:06,120 --> 03:04:06,840
This is optional.

3048
03:04:06,840 --> 03:04:10,800
So removed
that is again I'm saying this is optional.

3049
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:12,800
So remove name number. My bin.

3050
03:04:12,800 --> 03:04:13,920
My in my code.

3051
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:16,560
This is line number 99. I'm removing my

3052
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,240
look.

3053
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:24,440
I'll read.

3054
03:04:24,440 --> 03:04:28,760
All right, guys.

3055
03:04:28,760 --> 03:04:33,240
Now this input directly
this input that it receives.

3056
03:04:33,280 --> 03:04:39,160
This is my project directly under under
project that it it is just some reports.

3057
03:04:39,160 --> 03:04:42,000
I do not have any decent reports.

3058
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:42,600
Silva.

3059
03:04:42,600 --> 03:04:46,800
Silva, please give me just 15 minutes
and then we all will be on break again.

3060
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:48,240
I'll give you a big break.

3061
03:04:48,240 --> 03:04:51,840
Not even for minute, just 9 minutes,
because we we're something

3062
03:04:51,840 --> 03:04:54,560
very in between of something
very important already.

3063
03:04:54,560 --> 03:04:56,880
There's one just 8 minutes.

3064
03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:58,320
Just 8 minutes.

3065
03:04:58,320 --> 03:04:59,000
So, guys,

3066
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:03,440
we do not have any decent reports, images,
some reports in our plugin date.

3067
03:05:03,720 --> 03:05:06,280
So let's remove this part. Also

3068
03:05:07,840 --> 03:05:10,760
line number 102 after slash

3069
03:05:10,760 --> 03:05:14,040
that is adjacent to post
I had removed from Slash.

3070
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:17,080
So now you see
I have just these two points.

3071
03:05:17,080 --> 03:05:19,280
Can you see these
have just these two points.

3072
03:05:20,240 --> 03:05:23,280
Can everyone see this?

3073
03:05:23,280 --> 03:05:25,840
And then my decent file
would be my report by trade.

3074
03:05:26,040 --> 03:05:28,240
So support
wildcard spaten would be gorgeous.

3075
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:30,840
And so I will keep it as it is.

3076
03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:32,520
And after this.

3077
03:05:32,520 --> 03:05:33,760
After this.

3078
03:05:33,760 --> 03:05:34,920
This part is optional.

3079
03:05:34,920 --> 03:05:37,320
So from here to this point,

3080
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:41,560
before configuration, from classification
that it be

3081
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:45,960
built the line above configuration,
everything is optional.

3082
03:05:45,960 --> 03:05:49,080
Simply building

3083
03:05:49,080 --> 03:05:50,880
again, I am doing it

3084
03:05:50,880 --> 03:05:54,320
from classification line number 108 in my

3085
03:05:54,840 --> 03:05:59,560
my screen 108 line number
in one dwindling number my screen

3086
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:03,560
above configuration
line build line, remove

3087
03:06:03,560 --> 03:06:06,200
everything understood

3088
03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:10,760
and this everyone what I did

3089
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:21,160
find now

3090
03:06:21,160 --> 03:06:24,480
still sees 5.6.2 and read made

3091
03:06:25,200 --> 03:06:27,360
Let's reload project

3092
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:33,680
Let's reload

3093
03:06:33,680 --> 03:06:40,960
the project.

3094
03:06:40,960 --> 03:06:47,160
Once you reload blade Once you reload
let me first run it to immediately.

3095
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:51,960
So when we run in being clean, this should
give me the build success message.

3096
03:06:52,280 --> 03:06:54,160
Build success will success.

3097
03:06:54,160 --> 03:06:56,320
It means it is working fine.

3098
03:06:56,320 --> 03:06:59,840
See for me also read
but actually it is working fine.

3099
03:06:59,960 --> 03:07:00,320
Okay.

3100
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:03,640
But actually it is working fine.

3101
03:07:03,640 --> 03:07:05,640
So now let me go back here.

3102
03:07:05,640 --> 03:07:08,920
If we make it through test
because I want to show you something.

3103
03:07:09,680 --> 03:07:11,840
Let me go here.

3104
03:07:11,840 --> 03:07:14,160
I want to use this particular synergy.

3105
03:07:14,160 --> 03:07:16,800
Great. So it would be this print.

3106
03:07:17,320 --> 03:07:21,640
Let's see, scenario would be like batch

3107
03:07:22,160 --> 03:07:24,760
11 point.

3108
03:07:24,760 --> 03:07:27,560
Let's take this scenario
into consideration

3109
03:07:29,520 --> 03:07:31,560
or point

3110
03:07:32,120 --> 03:07:35,680
this part I'm providing in my grade,

3111
03:07:36,120 --> 03:07:39,600
and this time I'm going to run this part.

3112
03:07:39,600 --> 03:08:07,640
See, now you'll see after execution

3113
03:08:07,640 --> 03:08:12,040
completed, it was still rotating
and it gave me one message.

3114
03:08:12,040 --> 03:08:16,720
Code maven Kumba reporting
generate execution for the project.

3115
03:08:16,720 --> 03:08:22,320
Each item is delivered, prayed about
to generate the report and you'll see

3116
03:08:22,320 --> 03:08:27,360
January 23 Team name The master talked
to my reporter Pastor prayed.

3117
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:32,680
It generates one report and the target
to produce and contains one features.

3118
03:08:33,120 --> 03:08:35,200
Now let me show you this.

3119
03:08:35,200 --> 03:08:37,440
Let me show you this beautiful report. See

3120
03:08:38,560 --> 03:08:40,240
if I here

3121
03:08:40,240 --> 03:08:44,680
can you see to commit a team of reports,
guys, see how many reports?

3122
03:08:44,760 --> 03:08:47,160
We have generated a lot of reports. Right.

3123
03:08:47,520 --> 03:08:50,080
Let's dig this one report
what have you features.

3124
03:08:50,480 --> 03:08:53,000
You see what begged for
the steps for failure.

3125
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:54,240
We have a lot of reports.

3126
03:08:54,240 --> 03:09:00,480
Okay, but. But.

3127
03:09:00,480 --> 03:09:05,680
But see, see?

3128
03:09:06,120 --> 03:09:07,560
Right click here.

3129
03:09:07,560 --> 03:09:08,920
Right click here.

3130
03:09:08,920 --> 03:09:11,400
Open in browser called Chrome.

3131
03:09:12,080 --> 03:09:17,240
Now see, there you go.

3132
03:09:17,240 --> 03:09:20,760
There you go.

3133
03:09:20,760 --> 03:09:25,400
Based.

3134
03:09:25,400 --> 03:09:26,400
Can you see the report?

3135
03:09:26,400 --> 03:09:27,480
Everyone

3136
03:09:33,280 --> 03:09:34,000
Great

3137
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:37,200
if you want to check is features here
features.

3138
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:41,880
It says one feature positive
reporting rate is tips.

3139
03:09:41,880 --> 03:09:42,680
Scenario one.

3140
03:09:42,680 --> 03:09:45,920
Scenario positive hundred percent

3141
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:49,200
is steps three, steps 100% correct.

3142
03:09:49,960 --> 03:09:53,760
Now click on this log in feature,
click on this log in feature.

3143
03:09:54,560 --> 03:09:55,920
This is your background.

3144
03:09:57,200 --> 03:09:58,080
In this background.

3145
03:09:58,080 --> 03:09:59,840
This is the step.

3146
03:10:00,080 --> 03:10:02,280
This is your scenario.

3147
03:10:02,280 --> 03:10:04,320
This is your hook.

3148
03:10:04,320 --> 03:10:06,360
This is your step.

3149
03:10:06,360 --> 03:10:08,600
This is again, your hook

3150
03:10:08,600 --> 03:10:12,080
scenario name is bench 11 rate
validate to me

3151
03:10:12,600 --> 03:10:17,960
before hooks three, then it steps,
then after hooks it, execute

3152
03:10:17,960 --> 03:10:22,680
and you see three bust for log in feature
scenario one month to three time

3153
03:10:22,680 --> 03:10:25,960
duration
is this No way, no skip, no pending,

3154
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:27,720
no undefined

3155
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:29,440
date.

3156
03:10:29,440 --> 03:10:32,520
Very easy to understand
what time you executed

3157
03:10:32,960 --> 03:10:35,840
did with time it job in this project.

3158
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:40,520
How many discussions just one chrome
features click here it says

3159
03:10:40,520 --> 03:10:44,120
feature from peg see big statistics

3160
03:10:44,320 --> 03:10:47,640
and you see is smoke executed

3161
03:10:48,960 --> 03:10:51,880
match executed.

3162
03:10:51,880 --> 03:10:55,440
It is based the statistics here
100% execution

3163
03:10:55,440 --> 03:10:58,440
you see bars 200% of 100%.

3164
03:10:58,440 --> 03:10:59,680
Graphical reports

3165
03:11:01,040 --> 03:11:05,440
rate raise, graphical steps.

3166
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:08,320
Fine, click on steps.

3167
03:11:08,320 --> 03:11:11,880
You'll see this show for every step 100%.

3168
03:11:11,880 --> 03:11:15,760
It means how every step executed 100%.

3169
03:11:15,760 --> 03:11:19,000
Execution of every average duration

3170
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:21,480
is 2.07 3 milliseconds.

3171
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:25,320
Maximum duration was 5.937.

3172
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:28,320
To start, the application indicates

3173
03:11:29,080 --> 03:11:33,240
total duration
is this one played failures?

3174
03:11:33,240 --> 03:11:36,480
You see, because there is no failure

3175
03:11:36,480 --> 03:11:41,000
rate students.

3176
03:11:41,840 --> 03:11:44,560
So for any question in this part,
what I've explained

3177
03:11:44,560 --> 03:11:56,400
just now,

3178
03:11:56,400 --> 03:11:59,080
even I have read
when I have a rating policy,

3179
03:12:00,560 --> 03:12:01,960
I'm on saving grade.

3180
03:12:01,960 --> 03:12:06,200
Let's find the big time to update the

3181
03:12:12,360 --> 03:12:15,120
No, I don't have this much operation.

3182
03:12:15,120 --> 03:12:16,360
No, no, no.

3183
03:12:16,800 --> 03:12:18,040
See, that's the problem.

3184
03:12:18,040 --> 03:12:22,400
I told you in my trade under plugins,
we have to add plugin

3185
03:12:24,240 --> 03:12:26,680
under plugins we have to add plugin.

3186
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:32,400
You see my build and plugins is there
and then plugin is under plugins.

3187
03:12:32,640 --> 03:12:35,040
Your plugin is the plugins.

3188
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:35,920
There's the problem

3189
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:39,480
I get.

3190
03:12:39,480 --> 03:12:40,640
I showed you. Right.

3191
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:43,320
This is the gap
I gave you there after plugin.

3192
03:12:43,640 --> 03:12:46,280
You have to add another blending.

3193
03:12:46,280 --> 03:12:46,560
Yeah.

3194
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:47,480
Great.

3195
03:12:47,480 --> 03:12:50,080
Great.

3196
03:12:50,080 --> 03:12:58,200
Great.

3197
03:12:58,200 --> 03:12:59,560
All right, guys, any question?

3198
03:12:59,560 --> 03:13:01,440
Could you show your report, please?
Yes, sir.

3199
03:13:01,440 --> 03:13:02,640
Why not? There you go.

3200
03:13:02,640 --> 03:13:08,080
This is my report.

3201
03:13:08,080 --> 03:13:14,440
This is my report.

3202
03:13:14,440 --> 03:13:17,520
Is there anyone who has any question
about this particular part

3203
03:13:17,520 --> 03:13:18,240
of this

3204
03:13:22,920 --> 03:13:23,880
that you see here?

3205
03:13:23,880 --> 03:13:28,800
This features bags and steps and veneers,
all four on the top right

3206
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:36,840
corner, top
right corner and just click on tags.

3207
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:48,280
Then you will see this data statistics.

3208
03:13:48,280 --> 03:13:51,000
I'm assuming my report
might be a little different than other.

3209
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:55,200
Does this answer
then you have to become a Damien.

3210
03:13:55,200 --> 03:13:59,640
So I think in that case,
if you were to make your report unique,

3211
03:13:59,640 --> 03:14:00,720
you have to become a Damien

3212
03:14:02,160 --> 03:14:03,160
made master.

3213
03:14:03,160 --> 03:14:05,600
No or report was added

3214
03:14:06,840 --> 03:14:10,120
only one in your error rate.

3215
03:14:10,440 --> 03:14:11,440
I can see that.

3216
03:14:11,440 --> 03:14:13,400
But what is the entity in the console?

3217
03:14:13,400 --> 03:14:16,640
First, instead of taking this matter
in the report for us

3218
03:14:16,640 --> 03:14:19,920
to edit in the console,
reading the console why it is that it is,

3219
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:23,880
you will see that caused in the console

3220
03:14:27,760 --> 03:14:29,040
or right

3221
03:14:45,760 --> 03:14:49,360
for us to commit this code

3222
03:14:49,360 --> 03:15:02,000
before anyone ask about it.

3223
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:22,040
But code is committed.

3224
03:15:22,040 --> 03:15:26,920
All right, guys, do we just abbreviated
naming that a class or gender dependency?

3225
03:15:27,160 --> 03:15:29,960
No. We will update a big name in the donor
class.

3226
03:15:29,960 --> 03:15:32,680
We will update our dependency as well.
Don't worry.

3227
03:15:32,680 --> 03:15:35,600
I will tell you this tomorrow
I will delete the story

3228
03:15:38,880 --> 03:15:39,880
of any commitment.

3229
03:15:39,880 --> 03:15:44,640
Project means I'm committing every single
to every single plus segment.

3230
03:15:45,480 --> 03:15:59,840
Okay.

3231
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:06,400
All right, fine.

3232
03:16:06,400 --> 03:16:07,720
Okay, next.

3233
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:10,680
Now let's I think

3234
03:16:12,840 --> 03:16:14,240
please continue to study.

3235
03:16:14,240 --> 03:16:14,600
Right.

3236
03:16:14,600 --> 03:16:16,640
And tomorrow, hopefully, we'll be

3237
03:16:17,880 --> 03:16:21,560
completing our class and only moderately
because we have just two or three topics

3238
03:16:21,560 --> 03:16:25,000
to meaning we will cover those
3 to 4 topics and then we will be back.

3239
03:16:25,320 --> 03:16:28,560
All right. Find it.

3240
03:16:28,600 --> 03:16:32,280
Get everyone.

3241
03:16:32,280 --> 03:16:33,200
Thank you. Thank you.

3242
03:16:33,200 --> 03:16:33,680
Thank you.

3243
03:16:33,680 --> 03:16:37,160
I do not. My throat is completely damaged.
