4
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,560
I think you tried drinking some some coke.

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,880
It does. It does a trick. Trust me,

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:27,720

Abdul Kazeem.

71
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,440
MAHA It's funny
cause I'm reading a lot of names,

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,840
and I didn't see a lot of names
for the homework submissions, so

73
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,440
there's obviously some folks that

74
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,560
that care a little bit
more than the others.

75
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,320
Right?

76
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,560
Which is, which is fine.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,080
And here, welcome.

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,440

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,720

86
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,080
That Was everyone off yesterday?

87
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,240
Did you guys have to work?

88
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:35,840
So let's see.

89
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,440
So much better learning.

90
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,120
I am not positive for COVID.

91
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,280

92
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:44,880

93
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,560

94
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,600
Omran says.

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,680
Good.

96
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,440
Let's see.

97
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,960
Alan says, Tired.

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,360
Someone who was off.

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Mohammed says, Wonderful work, work,

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,920
work on man.

101
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,480
Anna says working as always

102
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,520
or work, the morale is careful.

103
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,680
This would be my second
you didn't get vaccinated, the mayor

104
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,280
Oh man, that's kind of scary.

105
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm hurting too much. Computer time.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Try blinking.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,080
It helps.

108
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,200
Sometimes we look at the screen
too much and

109
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,640
forget to blink.

110
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,840

135
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:48,120
And are you guys getting the hang of it?

136
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,240
Very fun.

137
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,800
Yeah. Job was fun.

138
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,080
Yeah, we'll see about that
a couple of months.

139
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,920
It's good. Good.

140
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,120
Very interesting.

141
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
Nice closeness.

142
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,200
Keep up the energy, guys.

143
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,640
Keep up the energy.

144
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,520

Okay, That's good.

146
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,760
It's good, good, good.

147
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
All right, so let's start off today.

148
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
Let's go over real quick
what we learned last class.

149
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,920
Okay? Last week.

150
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,360
Just just throw some some pointers on
what did

151
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,880
what did we learn, what the recover.

152
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,840
Okay.

153
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,320
Manual testing.

154
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,840
Testing.

155
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,920
Right.

156
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,400
What do you mean by goal?

157
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,840
We did talk about SDLC.

158
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,440
What else do we talk about as the LC
and what SDLC?

159
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,520
Okay, we talked about test cases.

160
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,520
Okay, so can someone answer

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,960
this question?

162
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,120
Yeah, what is this question

163
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,120
with someone ask

164
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,440
answer this question.

165
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,280
Software developer lifecycle.

166
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,080
That's what SDLC is

167
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,760
the software testing lifecycle.

168
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,040
Very good.

169
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,800
But can someone talk more
about the software testing lifecycle?

170
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,480
Like is it a cycle that is just at random
times of the project?

171
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,240
Like can someone

172
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,480
add color to this question?

173
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,960
It's okay.

174
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,880
So that the testing phase of this deal.

175
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,520
So you're saying that SDLC is a cycle
that's inside the testing phase of SDLC?

176
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,040
That's correct.

177
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,280
Okay, very good.

178
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,720
Very good.

179
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,400
Very good. Very good.

180
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,680
I saw some other comments out there.

181
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,800
Someone said we also talked about

182
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,080
the importance of communication.

183
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,720
Right.

184
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,400
Vacation.

185
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,440
What else did we talk about?

186
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,680
We covered what?

187
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,000
We talked about the testing phase.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,440
Okay, that's fine.

189
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
Okay. Never to assume

190
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,360
or to never assume.

191
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,080
Right.

192
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,960
As your documentation.

193
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:24,440
What what do we say about this?

194
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,920
There you go. Good.

195
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,360
Very good.

196
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Very good.

197
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,120
Three, four.

198
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Yes, that's right.

199
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,200
That is right. Exactly.

200
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,040
Documents. Right.

201
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,360
Ceremonies is the fancy word for meetings.

202
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,240
Right.

203
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,600
Give me an example of an artifact.

204
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,920
Yes, Very good.

205
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,440
Exactly.

206
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,720
So someone said notes.

207
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,640
What contact?

208
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,400
Sure.

209
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,280
But a backlog burning burn down chart,
Not burning chart and burn down chart.

210
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,880
Right?

211
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,560
That's true.

212
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:05,800
Yeah.

213
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,160
Requirements very good.

214
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,360
Someone said string

215
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,120
when we're not talking about
Java here, but

216
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,320
the materials you have, you work close.

217
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,480
That's right.

218
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,440
Sprints are not artifacts.

219
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,560
Sprints are not artifacts.

220
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,720
Sprints are iterations, right.

221
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,560
In which we

222
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,560
in which, you know, we have to
and we'll talk more about that.

223
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,520
Okay. We will talk more about that.

224
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,960
But what else do we cover?

225
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,760
We covered something
like very big last time.

226
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,080
What what did we talk about?

227
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Test case development. Okay.

228
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
We have test cases up here.

229
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,320
What what do we talk about?

230
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,600
So what is we spent like a long time,

231
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,160
We talked about user stories, okay?

232
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,520
We just we discuss user stories.

233
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,960
Okay, What else, guys?

234
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,280
What else?

235
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,720
We spent a good amount of time
talking about this

236
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,320
in the beginning of class, Right?

237
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
What do we say?

238
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,880
Okay,
we talked about acceptance criteria right?

239
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Criteria.

240
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,040
Spreadsheet.

241
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,120
Why we test? Yes, very good.

242
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,160
What else, guys? Come on, what else?

243
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
What is going to be
the heart of all of this?

244
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,200
What is going to be good?

245
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
We talked about this.

246
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,640
I even give you examples of it, right?

247
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,320
I, I Nope, not smart criteria.

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,560
We did learn about three types
of applications.

249
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,320
Right.

250
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,280
Okay. There you go.

251
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,000
Finally, someone said it.

252
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,240
Bugs, right?

253
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,800
Bugs, bugs, bugs.

254
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,040
Right now if if I were to ask you,

255
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,400
what is your question?

256
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,680
What is your answer to this question
right here?

257
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,960
An error defect or fault? Okay,

258
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,640
very good.

259
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Can you give me an example of a bug

260
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,440
log in issue?

261
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,440
The glitchy app?

262
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,400
Okay.

263
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,280
Very good.

264
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,080
Unexpected results.

265
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,160
I like that answer a lot.

266
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,520
That's really good. Mismatch requirement.

267
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,840
Actual work.

268
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,040
Yes, I show very good from Fairfax.

269
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,920
And yes, I show from Florida.

270
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah.

271
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,760
Okay. Very good.

272
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,160
So we talked about the
what is a bug, right.

273
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,440
This is a bug necessarily
something that is broken.

274
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Does it does

275
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,520
it mean that the application has to like,
completely stop or something?

276
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,840
Is that right?

277
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
It's not right.

278
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,840
It's not. A bug can be different. Right.

279
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,200
We give an example of the customer

280
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,800
not getting what they want right.

281
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,200
And when we talked about the menu,

282
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,800
how it has three lines, but what happens
if we develop it with four lines?

283
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,480
That's not
that's not what they wanted right.

284
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,120
So very good.

285
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,120
So we kind of got our feet
wet the last class.

286
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,480
Okay, we're going to brush up on this.

287
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,120
We're going to to to talk more about this.

288
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,120
So all this information
is going to be second nature to you guys.

289
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,880
Everything okay?

290
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,920
We just had to kind of
throw you in the water at first.

291
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,080
So we're
going to cover a lot of these topics.

292
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,400
Again, it's going to be very good.

293
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,800
But today we're going to go deeper into
our our our concepts and all that stuff.

294
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,160
Okay. So

295
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,120
okay, So

296
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,000
there are some topics last week,
and I want to start off

297
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,280
with creating test cases because you guys
will create more test cases.

298
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,760
Okay.

299
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,240
And we will talk about different types
of test cases.

300
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,040
So a lot of you

301
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,040
sent me some decent test cases, right?

302
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,880
I could tell that some of you guys
were paying attention in class

303
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,040
and I could tell some
you guys were some of you guys.

304
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,240
I don't know where you guys were,
where you guys were doing,

305
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,520
but it's okay.

306
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,800
And a lot of you guys submitted
your assignments, but a lot of you didn't.

307
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
A lot of you did not. Right?

308
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,800
So, you know,

309
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,920
clearly some folks care
more about the class than others.

310
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,200
But that sounds like that's more like a
that's that's more of a personal problem.

311
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,560
I can't really help you in that aspect.

312
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,320
Okay.

313
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,520
But so we're going to talk about

314
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,760
some of these test cases
and I have one pulled up.

315
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,240
Okay.

316
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,760
I've got this test case.

317
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,280
Okay.

318
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,160
And I'm going to start off with this.

319
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,520
This is an example test case.

320
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,240
And what we're going to do
is we're going to we're going to fix this,

321
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,560
but we are going to to fix this.

322
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
Let me explain this.

323
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,960
You guys can see it. Okay.

324
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,640
There you go.

325
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,160
Can you guys see that?

326
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,520
Okay, great.

327
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,440
Good sermon.

328
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,040
I chose this because this was almost
a good test, good test case.

329
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,480
But I also chose this test case because
it's going to be easier to work with.

330
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,880
And and a lot of you made the same
the same errors and stuff.

331
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,200
All right. So

332
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,240
let's let's first
look at the test case side.

333
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,080
Do you guys remember the test case,
the acceptance, the the user story ID?

334
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
You guys remember what it was?

335
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,840
Let me see.

336
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,960
From last class, a

337
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,480
user story idea

338
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,520
was what you guys number one
four, five, six, eight.

339
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,400
Okay, That's what it was.

340
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,720
Yeah, that is what it was.

341
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,040
So one four, five, six, eight.

342
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,520
So what is 405883.

343
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,040
Right. So that's thing number one.
We don't know.

344
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,280
We wouldn't
know what this test case belongs to.

345
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,120
Right.

346
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,320
So again the test case ended.

347
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,080
Let's fix it. Okay.

348
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,440
And it was 145683814568.

349
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,600
Test case one right.

350
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,920
And the test description is here.

351
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,600
Says this desk is verifies
that a user's able to log in with valid

352
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,400
Kyrgyz valid credentials from the home
page of the widow Edo edo Netflix dot com.

353
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,800
All right.

354
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,200
Just right there.

355
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,480
Okay.

356
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,120
I saw a lot of test cases where you guys

357
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,160
were trying

358
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,840
to log in with invalid credentials.

359
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,800
Does the acceptance criteria
say anything about invalid credentials?

360
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,280
Like doesn't say anything about

361
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,400
about testing
with within valid credentials.

362
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,160
It doesn't.

363
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,440
So some of you guys were writing steps.

364
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay.

365
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,560
It's some of you guys were writing steps

366
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,160
with credentials
and then you guys were writing.

367
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,320
Expect some results
that were not supposed to be here.

368
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,000
Okay.

369
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,800
So let's look at the first
and the first step.

370
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,280
Okay? And guys, pay
very close attention, okay?

371
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,960
Because this is going to help you out
a lot.

372
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,520
This is going to help you out a lot.

373
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,440
And it's going to address
a lot of the questions that you guys had.

374
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,320
Okay.

375
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,640
So step number one

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,240
user navigates to the reader.

377
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,760
We don't read that Netflix dot com. Okay.

378
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,520
Does this sound like an action?

379
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,440
It does, right?

380
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,960
It does sound like an action.

381
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,720
Right. All the data was not provided.

382
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,440
So I kind of

383
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,160
told you to use your own credentials
if you didn't have a Netflix account.

384
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,840
I just told you to make something up
and pretended that it worked.

385
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,680
Okay, so user navigates to the reader.

386
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,920
We know that Netflix icon.

387
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,680
That is an action that's going to expect
the data Netflix home page displays.

388
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:09,960
Right?

389
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,080
And let's let's all do this together.

390
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,720
I want you to open

391
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,920
and let's go to that.

392
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,320
Okay. Bam, we're here.

393
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,200
It's kind of

394
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,600
a natural result says Netflix home
page displays this.

395
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,640
Well done. This is good pass yes or no?

396
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,480
Yes. Scope.

397
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,840
Okay.

398
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,360
Step number two user clicks on the button.

399
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,600
Sign in on the top right corner.

400
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,200
Okay. Right here.

401
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,040
Perfect. Did we understand that?

402
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,440
Is that an action?

403
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,480
Right. That that makes sense. Right.

404
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,280
So we're going to click on it.

405
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,920
Okay. Bam, we're done. Okay.

406
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,520
Okay.

407
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,600
So let's go back, sign and paste
this place.

408
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Beautiful.

409
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,880
Well, look, we're crushing it here, right?

410
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,160
This is good. This is the sign in page.

411
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,800
That is what happens when we click on the
sign in button on the top right corner.

412
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,520
Right.

413
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,360
That's perfect.

414
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,920
The actual results sign in basis place.

415
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Yes. Pass.

416
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,120
User navigate to sign in form.

417
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,960
You can and click on email or phone

418
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,280
number of field in order to add log in.

419
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,600
And so user navigates

420
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,280
to sign in form which is there okay

421
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,880
and clicks on email or phone number

422
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,800
field in order to add log in.

423
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,040
Okay, this is okay,

424
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,320
but what are we adding here?

425
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,200
What are we out of here

426
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,800
in order to add

427
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,600
right email or phone number.

428
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,640
Right.

429
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,760
That's what we're adding. Correct.

430
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,840
Because we don't know what log in is.

431
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,960
Right. Does that make sense?

432
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,680
We don't know what log in is.

433
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,520
Do you guys see one one with this?
We don't know.

434
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,680
Like before it said to add log in. Right.

435
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,320
And my question is, this is what it said.

436
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,120
My question is, what is log in?

437
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,920
You know,
and obviously it's kind of common sense.

438
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,960
You know, it says email or phone number.

439
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,520
But in test cases, guys,
we need to be specific.

440
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,760
Does that make sense?

441
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,200
We need to we need to be specific.

442
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,440
So, okay, I navigated to the sign in form

443
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,080
and I clicked on email or a phone number.

444
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,960
FIELD okay.

445
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
And secondly, right.

446
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,120
What we can do to kind of make
this better is we don't need to say that.

447
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,520
We don't need to say that
we're going to click on that field, okay?

448
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,720
We can make it a little
more like high level, right?

449
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,800
We can say

450
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,520
sign user navigate to sign in form and add

451
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,280
let's see and

452
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,000
inters, we can say,

453
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,560
we can say let's reword this and interest

454
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,240
email or phone number.

455
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,040
Okay then

456
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,040
right there. Right.

457
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,320
Look, look at this.

458
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,200
How much more clear is that? Right.

459
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,880
It makes sense, right?

460
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,200
User navigates to sign in form and enters
email or phone

461
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,680
number it an email or phone number
or field. Right.

462
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,000
And actually

463
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,120
that's fine
that that that kind of makes sense.

464
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,880
Does that make sense?

465
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,560
You could say field
You can even say text box, right?

466
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,960
But we don't need to really like
click on it.

467
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,280
Does that make sense, guys?

468
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,440
We don't need to click on it,

469
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,800
but we don't need to do that. But

470
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,680
okay, so you navigate to sign in
for an interest email

471
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,440
or phone number.

472
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,880
Okay, so what now?

473
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,000
The next critique that I have,
you can just

474
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,440
you can follow me, That's fine,
but I want you to pay attention here.

475
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,360
I don't do anything.

476
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,720
I just want unfollowed like
the Netflix dot com open it and stuff,

477
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,720
but I want you to
just focus on this test case.

478
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,280
User navigates to sign in form

479
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,560
and enters email or phone number.

480
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,440
So you know what the problem
with this step is?

481
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:39,240
That's what is the problem with this step?

482
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,240
You know, what is a problem with this that

483
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,760
No, no, no, no, no,

484
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,320
no, no.

485
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,520
That's fine.

486
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,400
It's too wordy. That's okay.
There are two steps.

487
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,160
Exactly what two steps are there

488
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:04,480
Here, right?

489
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,440
User navigates to sign in form.

490
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,360
Right.

491
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,680
And look and right.

492
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,360
This right here is one action, Right?

493
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,840
And then and

494
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,000
right here is the second action.

495
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,440
Right?

496
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,520
Does this does this make sense?

497
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
Does this everyone see that?

498
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,440
It's two different steps, right?

499
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,160
So user navigates to sign in form.

500
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,880
Okay. Got it.

501
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,560
And at this moment, this is not
this is it.

502
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,080
This is automatically
two steps in one step.

503
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,560
Okay. So

504
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,840
what we can do
and automatically you can see that is that

505
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,000
this little change is going to domino

506
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,320
with to the to the next of the steps.

507
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,600
Okay.

508
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,920
So user navigate to sign in form, right.

509
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,960
Let me copy this.

510
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,600
Okay. Let me copy this step.

511
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,160
Okay.

512
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,960
And I'm going to paste it here. Okay.

513
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,680
You're going to place it
here. Forget Watson's four.

514
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,840
Let's focus on three.
We got to finish this up.

515
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,040
Get so navigate to sign in form now.

516
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,600
Okay, let's delete this. So.

517
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,520
So what happens when the user navigates
to sign in form

518
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,840
that we can say what?

519
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,000
What are these fields called?

520
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,280
Okay, what are we going to say?

521
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,320
Because he he decided to add this.

522
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,600
He decided to add this,
which is good right now.

523
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,000
We're not logging
in. We're just navigating.

524
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,960
Literally,
all we're doing is we're navigating here.

525
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:48,840
That's it.

526
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,760
We're here. Like, all we're doing is here.

527
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,520
We're navigating here. That's it.

528
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,160
Okay, that makes sense.

529
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,240
Like one. What?

530
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,520
We didn't say we're logging in.

531
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,480
We didn't say anything.

532
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,600
We're navigating to this little form
right here.

533
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,960
That's what his step is saying. Okay.

534
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,640
Does that make sense?

535
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,520
Okay. Okay.

536
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,840
So and this is going to ask your question,
right?

537
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,160
So what happens when we navigate there?

538
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,120
We can say email or phone number, right?

539
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,960
And when we're indicating
the name of a field or a text box

540
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,920
or a button,
now that is not an expected result.

541
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,600
Should be able, should it?

542
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,720
I'm going to talk about that as well.
Okay.

543
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,680
We don't use
the word should in test cases.

544
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Okay.

545
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,000
Because sure, it's kind of giving like

546
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,040
like the idea that it's okay
if it doesn't happen.

547
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,280
Right.

548
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,120
So we're going to say either you do it
or you don't.

549
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,560
But that's how you have to write the test
cases. Again.

550
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,440
So what we can say for this step,
whenever you're specifying

551
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,120
a name of a text box,
a name of a field, the name of a button.

552
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,920
Okay, we can you see how the name of the

553
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,960
the text box is email or phone number?

554
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,800
Okay.

555
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,200
You see, I'm
going to say email or phone number.

556
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,400
Okay.

557
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,160
And password.

558
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,960
Password fields

559
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,800
displaced or you can say are displayed.

560
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,400
Okay, let's keep this fields

561
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,920
display cool.

562
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,800
All right.

563
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,400
Does this make sense? Right.

564
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,840
That is what happens.
That's it, guys. That's.

565
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,520
That's all that happens.
We navigated here. What happens?

566
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,120
Okay.

567
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,320
Email or phone number and password
fields display.

568
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
That's it.

569
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,640
Does that make sense?

570
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,680
It seems the same as the previous step.

571
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,680
What is the previous step doing?

572
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,880
The previous step is clicking on the sign

573
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,720
in button on the top right
corner from the previous page.

574
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,520
Right.

575
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,840
And the sign in page displays.

576
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,600
Right. This is that's what happened.

577
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,080
That said that step how this is result
is that they are similar.

578
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,840
They are similar, but they are different.

579
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,520
Right?

580
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,000
Because they are similar.

581
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,040
But they are different.

582
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,120
So what happens is we can copy this.

583
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,040
Expect the result. Okay.

584
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,760
And we can paste it here because that's
what happened to the past. Yes.

585
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,760
Okay. Now

586
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,880
we need to fix the the wording here.

587
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,000
We can say user interface,
email or phone number.

588
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,160
Okay. Right.

589
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,600
User enters email or phone number
in email or phone number it text box.

590
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,720
We can say text box,
we can say field, right.

591
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,280
That's fine. Right?

592
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,880
So what we're doing
is we're going to enter.

593
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,200
I'm just going to enter that email, okay?

594
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm just making up this date.

595
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,800
Okay, that's it. I'm
just entering something.

596
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,520
Okay.

597
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,520
And here. Right.

598
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,040
What is the expected results?

599
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,320
So the password is shown as the asterisk
character on the password field.

600
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,880
Right?

601
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,640
So what we can say
to make this a little better, we can say

602
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,920
in terms of data

603
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,440
displays, displays in respective right
perspective text box,

604
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,800
you can say displays and field displays
and text box display whatever you sell.

605
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,800
Does this make sense

606
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,560
if you see different the example
we were given and last class?

607
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,080
Yes. User navigates.

608
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,240
Yes, those are two sections,

609
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,880
but last class was your first introduction
to two test cases, right?

610
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,680
So that's what we did.

611
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,440
But now we're going over this.

612
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,080
And the reason we're going over
this is I didn't really expect you to

613
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,680
get a perfect score on this assignment,

614
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,000
but this is going to work
as an introduction

615
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,720
for what we're going to do today,
tomorrow, and the next class is okay,

616
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,560
Does that make sense?

617
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,520
Cool.

618
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,760
So but the whole idea
that I want you to understand

619
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,280
is one thing with test cases,
we have to be detailed.

620
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,720
We have to be detailed. Okay?

621
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,960
And we need to kind of
make sure there were

622
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,600
some test cases
that some of you guys turned in

623
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:35,160
where you guys had an action
in the expected results.

624
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,840
You guys had actions
in the expected result.

625
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,520
For example,

626
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,920
in this field, right?

627
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,120
Like user enters email or phone
number and email or phone number, password

628
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,000
instead of saying what happens
when you do this, you were saying

629
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,160
something like user
should be able to do something right.

630
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,320
That is not correct.

631
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,760
But is this making sense so far, guys?

632
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,600
Literally the expected result, right?

633
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,840
Is what happens when you take this action
not what should the user do,

634
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,080
not what should use
should the user do next.

635
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,400
It's literally what happens

636
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,280
when this action is is taken. Go.

637
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,520
So this is what we're going to do, right?

638
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,760
In order for this test to be robust,
we do also manually test with the invalid.

639
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,360
We're not did the acceptance criteria
doesn't say anything.

640
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,720
What does the acceptance criteria
say? Right.

641
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,760
It says that we need to make sure that the
user can log in with valid credentials.

642
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,080
Right. If the client wants to.

643
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,840
If the client wants to, you know,
come up with the requirement that says

644
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,240
something, users should not be able
to log in with invalid credentials.

645
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,640
Then we test that acceptance criteria.

646
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Does that make sense? Right.

647
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,120
It needs to be a requirement first, right?

648
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,600
Because the truth is,

649
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,520
if we don't focus on the acceptance
criteria, we can get so distracted.

650
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,800
We can come up with so many scenarios.

651
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,160
Right?

652
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:13,800
Right.

653
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,680
That's it.

654
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,080
This is what they want.

655
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,480
This is what they get.
Plain and simple. Right?

656
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,640
That that's it.

657
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Plain and simple.

658
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,480
But you are right.

659
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,440
And in most places, of course,
they're going to have a requirement

660
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,040
that says user shouldn't be able to
to log in with invalid credentials.

661
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,480
Right. So does that make sense?

662
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,160
Does that make sense?

663
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,000
Okay, cool.

664
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,080
And to talk about that,
if that is a requirement, right,

665
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,200
then it'll probably say something like
users should not be able to enter

666
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,800
or should not be able to log in
with invalid credentials.

667
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,520
And then there's rules, right?

668
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,400
Have you ever seen when you register
for a form, there's password rules

669
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,880
like passwords should contain at least one
capitalized letter, one number,

670
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,920
one special character,
Or sometimes they give you

671
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,760
a list of special characters
like it'll say something like

672
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,480
It needs to contain one of the following
special characters, right?

673
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,240
So if there is no question mark

674
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,760
in that lit or those options,

675
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,320
then to negative test that scenario,

676
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,720
you would just out of question
mark to the password and see if it works.

677
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,560
Does that make sense?

678
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,920
You would you would try to see
if you can break the system or something.

679
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,040
Kind of

680
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,800
you would try to see
if if the password requirement

681
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,200
is to have at least one
capitalized letter.

682
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Well, see if you can create a password
with what?

683
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,200
With all lowercase

684
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,520
characters.

685
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Cool.

686
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,480
So they don't ask for user cannot get.

687
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,680
So if they don't ask for user

688
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,920
cannot get in with them,
that means they are missing something.

689
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,840
I don't understand the quote.

690
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,080
Can you clarify the question
a little more, please?

691
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,160
As a tester, do I have any input
or suggestions what I should test

692
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,240
or do I just follow orders
at the best of the work environment?

693
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,640
You know, sometimes when you see something
that's obvious, you can kind of

694
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,520
say like, Hey, I think this would confuse
the user a little bit.

695
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,720
You know, you can make that suggestion.

696
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,000
You can

697
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,280
feel feel free to make that suggestion
worthless.

698
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,680
Okay, cool.

699
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,760
So so we'll

700
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,160
we're going to copy this
because this is what happens, Right?

701
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,720
Right.

702
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,800
And then look, you see, sometimes

703
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,480
the task is become simple, right?

704
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,920
Because now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to copy this step Good.

705
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,680
And what should I reward?

706
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,760
This?

707
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,800
What should I what should I reward? This

708
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,720
user enters

709
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,640
password

710
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,960
and password and password field.

711
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Right, right.

712
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,560
Password field.

713
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,000
That's it. Right.

714
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,560
And then what you can do is
you can just copy this

715
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,760
last expected result

716
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,920
and just base it here.

717
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,760
That's it.

718
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,560
Keep it.

719
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,000
Keep it nice and simple.

720
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,800
You know, you don't need to reach over.

721
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,040
You need to add so many, like say,
like all the password shows up

722
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,400
with all these characters
and stuff like that unless.

723
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,960
Right. Unless that was a requirement.

724
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,320
So for example, what he had here before
he was saying that the expected result

725
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,560
is that the password displays what
the asterisk read that you guys see that

726
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,920
that's what his expect the result was

727
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,400
if we had an acceptance criteria

728
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,640
that said the password should display

729
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,760
an asterisk after entering it,

730
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,360
then we go ahead and write
a expected result like that.

731
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,440
Okay.

732
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,200
But all this acceptance
criteria is doing us is just logging

733
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,480
in with valid credentials.

734
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,840
Does that make sense to everyone?

735
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,760
So keep it simple.

736
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,400
You have to keep it simple.

737
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,880
Okay, so what is next?

738
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,280
What is the next step?

739
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,920
It says user navigate to sign in.

740
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,280
Okay, we got rid of this.

741
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,560
The next step was user
navigates and clicks on sign in.

742
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,920
But you see how there was multiple steps
here, guys, right?

743
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,120
User navigates to sign in form A
and clicks on

744
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,640
hi button
on the right side of the password field.

745
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,360
So I'm going into a password.

746
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,640
Okay. Password. Right.

747
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,240
I don't see as of right now
his test case says

748
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,040
that I need to click on a high button.

749
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,280
I don't see a hide button.

750
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,480
And also, does the acceptance criteria
say anything about a hide button?

751
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,040
It doesn't, right.

752
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,680
So we don't test it because it doesn't say
it doesn't say anything about it.

753
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,240
Right. So what are we going to do?

754
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,880
We're going to delete the step.

755
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,960
Okay.

756
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,520
Because it should not be here.

757
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,400
We're not testing this.

758
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,120
The password is shown as an asterisk.

759
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,760
Character on the password field and right
how one chooses to show one.

760
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:21,960
Right.

761
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,760
So two things

762
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,160
that we are now responsible
for testing with this acceptance criteria.

763
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,160
Right?

764
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,800
So and that's okay.

765
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,000
I can tell that he was thinking
outside the box, which is good

766
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,360
but we only need to
test Will read the test.

767
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,720
Okay. All right.

768
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,080
So let's see if his next step was going to
user navigate to sign in form and click.

769
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:49,200
So I see a lot of user navigates to sign
in form, but we are already there, right?

770
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,800
We already there.

771
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,600
So there's no point of having like that
step again, a user navigate to sign in

772
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
form and does not. Right? So

773
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,920
what we can do is I'm going to copy this
step,

774
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm going to paste it here

775
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,360
and I'm going to say

776
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:16,200
we can just say, see

777
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,120
what is the name of the button,

778
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,760
Sign it right.

779
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,880
There you go. I like that.

780
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,320
He put it in quotations. Okay.

781
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,640
I like that he put sign in quotations.

782
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,520
Right.

783
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,600
What do we say if you're indicating
a button or a field or something,

784
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,360
we put it in quotations.

785
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,120
When you say
and you're introducing another step.

786
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,520
Dennis does that make sense?

787
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
You separate the test.

788
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,720
Two separate two steps.

789
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,840
Separate the steps.

790
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,680
Well, do
we have to mention the colors of buttons?

791
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,920
No, we don't.

792
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,320
Does the acceptance criteria say
anything about the colors of the buttons

793
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,760
that we have to test?

794
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,840
Does it say that the signing button
needs to be green or blue or orange?

795
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,640
It doesn't, right?

796
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,600
So we don't need to indicate
that that user clicks on sign in button.

797
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,680
Now, obviously I enter dummy credentials.

798
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,280
I'm assuming
that the Netflix than the Netflix video

799
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,480
basis plays right?

800
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,880
So that's what I want to put here.

801
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,360
And then I'm going to copy this, paste it.

802
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,560
Let's assume that that happens
or user account.

803
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,680
Is that what is called user accounts?

804
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,920
Okay. So I'm going to say

805
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,360
user account page displays, Okay,

806
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,120
whatever it's called, I'm not going to

807
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,840
you know, I'm not going to get upset
if you got it wrong.

808
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,000
But here what we can do is we can

809
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,040
delete

810
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,920
and we can delete.

811
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,520
We can delete, we can delete

812
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,480
account and

813
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,040
okay.

814
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,880
And this is step seven.

815
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,240
You can see and of course,

816
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,880
read them right there.

817
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
That was that guys.

818
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,320
That was your own Mark.

819
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,800
Okay, That was it. Does that make sense?

820
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,440
Okay.

821
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,920
So a lot of you guys were adding
more than what we needed.

822
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,320
You guys were a lot of
you guys were testing other things

823
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,160
that we didn't have the test right.

824
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,840
Does that make sense?

825
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,920
But what I the reason I chose
this was because Sorbonne

826
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,320
and everyone get a run, a robust system,

827
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,440
one he did a very good job at thinking
outside the box He did.

828
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,600
And that is very good

829
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,000
because that is what's going to help us
with what's coming next.

830
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,240
But these are there are just some rules,
right, that we need to follow.

831
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,320
Okay. That that we need to follow.

832
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,160
And this is, first of all, split
the steps, right?

833
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,880
We have to follow the task as other.

834
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,160
Seems. Yeah.

835
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,480
I mean, if you don't follow the test case
or you don't follow and either

836
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,480
you want to follow
the acceptance criteria,

837
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,160
obviously
we can come up with many scenarios, right

838
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,920
When we're logging in, we can like come up
with like 100 if we wanted to like

839
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,400
all possible scenarios that you only want
to test the acceptance criteria.

840
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,720
Okay, that's it.

841
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,280
Right?

842
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,680
How about test data that we need it for?

843
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,920
The test data would have been the username
and password last class.

844
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,880
I want you to use your own credentials
or to just make something up

845
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,040
like I did right here.
Okay. Like right here.

846
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
I just made something up.

847
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,560
I just wanted you guys to practice
writing a test case.

848
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,360
Okay, You can.

849
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,000
You should. You can if you want to.

850
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,720
You can just create a new column,
say, test data, spread test data.

851
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,760
You can say password.

852
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,360
Okay?

853
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,840
We can say test data.

854
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,320
We can say password or username.

855
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,680
You know, username, whatever you want.

856
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,040
Password.

857
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,160
I actually had one of you guys
give me your actual real credentials.

858
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,560
I don't understand why you would do that,

859
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:37,080
but thank you so much.

860
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,120
Yeah. So.

861
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,320
Okay.

862
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,960
Does this make sense, guys?

863
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,520
Does this make sense
or does it make sense?

864
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,440
So let's cover what we just talked about.
Okay, Let's go.

865
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,280
What we just talked about one,

866
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,880
we made it nice and it's still detailed,
but it's also high level, right?

867
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,760
Men, Nice and easy to the point where

868
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,720
I was able to copy
and paste and reword things.

869
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,400
I was efficient with this.

870
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,760
It didn't take me that long, you know,
It took me a while

871
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,320
because I'm showing it to you.

872
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:13,480
But at work I could have finished this
like in like 5 minutes.

873
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,440
Is it a simple a web application?

874
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,760
I don't understand the question for

875
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,480
how can you So test data
and credentials are needed to sign in?

876
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,440
Yes, right.

877
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,720
What does the acceptance criteria say?

878
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,240
The user's able to log in
with valid credentials.

879
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,280
Right. So we need valid credentials.

880
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,360
Go preconditions.

881
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,080
And we're going to talk more about that
in a bit.

882
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,240
Okay. Preconditions.

883
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,240
What we're going to do,
because I want you guys to use it

884
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,040
wisely in a different and a different test
case.

885
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,560
Okay.

886
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,800
So go ahead and take a screenshot of this
right now.

887
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,080
Okay.

888
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,960
Go ahead and take a screenshot of this
right now.

889
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,160
Okay.

890
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,920
And let's talk about some rules.

891
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,160
Tell me some rules. And you know what?

892
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,680
I was actually interviewing
some candidates

893
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,280
today.

894
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,640
And one of the questions I asked them,
I asked them,

895
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,120
I said, hey, if you were my lead right.

896
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,440
And I gave you this,

897
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,000
I gave you a test case, I asked him,
what would you look up for?

898
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,120
Like what is a good test case for you?

899
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,560
And what is a bad test case to you?

900
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,960
That's an interview question.

901
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,440
You guys know the answers.

902
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,360
I just told you the answers.

903
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,040
If you guys would
have said something like,

904
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,680
you know, just verify that

905
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,480
the steps are clear
that they expect the results are only what

906
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,120
what descriptions of what happens after
an action is taken and no steps.

907
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,160
There are no actions.

908
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,360
And the expected results. That's perfect.

909
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,960
Okay.

910
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,400
That the test case should satisfy
the acceptance criteria.

911
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,320
Right.

912
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,240
Does this make sense to everyone?

913
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:56,840
Right.

914
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,320
That's actually interview question.

915
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,920
Okay,

916
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,200
So very simple, very easy.

917
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,080
But this is all it is, guys, right?

918
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,400
Simple rules.

919
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,000
You don't need to test other things
that you don't have to test.

920
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,600
You don't.

921
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,480
They expect the results?

922
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,080
Don't you will
We will create a lot of tests.

923
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,600
This is not the only one
that we're going to create.

924
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,080
We're going to have a lot of fun
with this stuff.

925
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,440
Okay.

926
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,360
We're going to have a lot of fun.

927
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,720
I promise you that.

928
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,480
I won't allow any of you guys
to feel uncomfortable with this.

929
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,080
You guys are going to be,
like, crushing it, okay?

930
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,880
You guys are going to be crushing it.

931
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,800
That is a promise.

932
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,600
All right?

933
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,840
This was just, you know, first time,
you know, obviously first time and,

934
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:44,760
you know, obviously, some of you guys care
more than others, which is clear, Right?

935
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,920
We already clarified that,
which is why some of you guys did

936
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,440
some of the assignments.

937
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,440
Okay.

938
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,440
Can really help you there. Right. So

939
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,320
take a screenshot, please save it,
Sorbonne.

940
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,840
Good stuff, man.

941
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Good stuff.

942
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:04,560
Okay, Can we do Nicholls
Did we do your test case?

943
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,920
I actually it's just

944
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,640
just take the screenshot
and learn from it, you know, and let's.

945
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,640
Let's carry on. All right?

946
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,360
So, okay,

947
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,840
so any questions so far before we move on?

948
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,840
Any questions?

949
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,760
No. All right, great.

950
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,480
So let's carry on.

951
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,960
And I want to say something
a lot of you guys,

952
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,840
a lot of you guys were almost like
very close.

953
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,440
Like a lot of
you guys were almost very close.

954
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,760
And that was very, very, very good.

955
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,520
I could see in your in your test case
that you guys were like, second

956
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,960
doubting yourself. I could tell. Right.

957
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:50,440
You know,
and that's something that's really good,

958
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,400
you know, for for most of you.

959
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,600
So keep up the good work, okay?

960
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:56,880
Okay.

961
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,040
So anyway,
we cover that and we will create more.

962
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,200
Okay? We will create more.

963
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:03,960
All right.

964
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,120
So the next thing we need to talk about
is a test plan.

965
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,280
And a test plan is
now that we know about bugs.

966
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,400
I know I messed up by putting some actions
into the scripts, and that's okay.

967
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,440
That's fine. That's.

968
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,920
This is.

969
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,720
We're here to learn, guys. That
that's that's fine.

970
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,520
The way I see more use of that
in your homework assignment

971
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,440
is that what you're doing?

972
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,320
Is that

973
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,440
what you're doing
or you're sharing a screenshot?

974
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,360
Oh, and by the way,

975
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,280
one more thing. Okay.

976
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,520
And take this however you like.

977
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,720
I don't mean to be disrespectful

978
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,800
any kind, but

979
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,400
are you guys listening?

980
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,560
If there were a lot of you guys.

981
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,720
Okay, so when you guys start working
right, you guys will probably be working

982
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,560
from home or wherever
you're going to go to the office

983
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,800
and they say, Hey, send me your assignment
or send me something like this.

984
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,040
Right.

985
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,080
A lot of you

986
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,520
guys were taking pictures with your phones

987
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:13,320
and sending me the pictures
that you took with your phones.

988
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,240
Right.

989
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,640
So my question to you is, at work,
are you going to take a picture

990
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,640
of your assignment
or your task and send it to your manager

991
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,200
or you're going to take a screenshot,
right,

992
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,720
using Windows or Mac or whatever
you using and send it that way, Right.

993
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,640
So which one are you going to do?

994
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,520
A lot of you guys were sending me
pictures, you know,

995
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,440
and I was looking at it
and I was like, you know,

996
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,800
and some of you guys are
are probably going to say,

997
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,040
Oh, I don't know how to take a screenshot
with with the windows or a mac.

998
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,800
What do you do
when you don't know how to do something

999
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:58,840
too minor?

1000
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,040
That's right.

1001
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:00,680
That's right.

1002
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,520
Allen You Google it.

1003
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,680
You want to see how easy it is.

1004
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,680
I'll show you.

1005
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,600
Look Watch this.

1006
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,040
Ready?

1007
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,320
How to take screenshot.

1008
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,920
Right with windows.

1009
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,320
Look, this right here

1010
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,320
and right there.

1011
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,680
Look. Look at that. See?

1012
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,160
That's nice.

1013
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,120
Right? Right.

1014
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,040
Guys, answers right there.

1015
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,080
The other Mac can just changes
how to take screenshots with Mac.

1016
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,040
Bam. Right there.

1017
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,200
Right. If you don't want to read,

1018
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,560
I am pretty sure that there are
YouTube videos on this.

1019
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,000
Okay. If you want to watch a video

1020
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,840
that makes sense, are you good?

1021
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,200
Right?

1022
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,080
So from now on, what are you going to do
whenever you send assignment or something,

1023
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,320
or whenever you have issues with your code
and you have to contact

1024
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,280
support team,
you're going to send them a screenshot.

1025
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,880
Okay, cool.

1026
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,960
I'll be all right or go with that.

1027
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,440
All right.

1028
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,520
So a test plan.

1029
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,240
What is a test plan? Okay,
so now we know what's a bug.

1030
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,080
We know what test uses are. We know what
we'll have to do. What testers.

1031
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,200
We have a good understanding

1032
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,280
of acceptance criteria
as we know what user stories are.

1033
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,280
User stories are artifacts, right,
that have the acceptance

1034
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,080
criteria written inside them. Right?

1035
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,080
We already talked about that.

1036
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,920
Acceptance or criteria comes from come
from what acceptance

1037
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,440
criteria has come from what

1038
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,160
acceptance criteria is come from what?

1039
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
Yes. Farhad Exactly.

1040
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,880
Business requirements, Right, Exactly.

1041
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,720
And who's the one that kind of writes
the acceptance criteria?

1042
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,120
Who's the one that the VA Exactly.

1043
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,200
Not the place to be. A

1044
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,800
Okay, cool.

1045
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,320
So a test plan.

1046
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:54,040
A test plan is just another document.

1047
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,760
Okay, What is the word
for document and agile environment?

1048
00:50:59,280 --> 00:50:59,960
Right?

1049
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,400
It's an artifact.

1050
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,520
So it's just another artifact

1051
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,960
that has the following information.

1052
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,480
Okay. What? The tests.

1053
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,600
So, for example,
they'll say the functional testing team

1054
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,840
will test anything related to the UI.

1055
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,600
Right?

1056
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:22,120
Are our developers will do performance
testing or are this testers will you know

1057
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,520
that it is this organized document
that basically says what the test.

1058
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,000
How do we tested?

1059
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,120
Why do we tested?

1060
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,280
Who will perform the testing?

1061
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,600
Where will testing be performed
and when does testing take place?

1062
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,440
Okay.

1063
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,200
So I'm going to address
all of these questions

1064
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,480
like who will perform the testing?

1065
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,320
You can say the two way team,

1066
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,480
where will testing be performed?

1067
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,040
I will also show you
that when will testing take place?

1068
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,200
I will show you that as well.

1069
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,120
Okay, so in the center, but
it's this document that has all of this

1070
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,120
information that the test might contain,
has it can have.

1071
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,560
And I'll show you what a test
run looks like.

1072
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,400
We actually have one here.

1073
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,680
It'll be like a test plan overview

1074
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,880
list of futures, environmental needs,
and we're going to talk

1075
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,640
and learn about environment.
So they all guys, this is so exciting.

1076
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,880
We have so much to learn. Okay.

1077
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,720
Now, I personally and I'll show you
some of these test questions, Okay?

1078
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,360
But we're going to get back to this
after we start creating more test cases,

1079
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,600
after we start working with JIRA
and everything like that.

1080
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,680
Does that make sense?

1081
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,320
So I want is that
is that cool with everyone?

1082
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,680
Because right now
that you don't understand

1083
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,240
a lot of terminology, which is fine,
but I want you guys to kind of,

1084
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,160
you know, hear the word test plan,
kind of test Blanca,

1085
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,200
because I know you have the slides test
case development.

1086
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,160
We already talked about test case
development.

1087
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,560
Okay.

1088
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,760
We already talked about test kits.

1089
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,360
The moment test cases. Okay.

1090
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,480
We already talked that in a test
case is often

1091
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,720
the reason we use the word often
is because it changes in every project.

1092
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,720
Not every project will have
all these fields, but most projects.

1093
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:07,920
Well, some.

1094
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,440
And then I show you an example of to test
It is right.

1095
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,480
Here's a test case right?

1096
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,280
And then here's another test case.

1097
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:18,200
For example, this test case right here
doesn't have a reviewed by field, right?

1098
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,160
This one does. Okay.

1099
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,120
This test
case doesn't have a created by field.

1100
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,880
Right. This one does.

1101
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,640
Maybe that was project
specific. It's okay.

1102
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,120
That's fine.

1103
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,440
So it is documentation which is time
consuming, not the actual testing.

1104
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,760
Yes. For a hard
and there's a lot of documentation

1105
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,200
that goes on behind the scenes.

1106
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,040
You know, that is part of your job
and stuff.

1107
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,200
That's going to take some time.

1108
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,120
All right. So

1109
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,120
so what we're going to do

1110
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,000
now is we're going to practice
some more on on

1111
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,880
on creating test cases.

1112
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,600
Okay.

1113
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,440
But before that,
I want to talk about environments.

1114
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,920
What are environments? Okay.

1115
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,920
And this is a very, very, very good one
because you guys know what is SDLC.

1116
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,480
Okay, you guys know what is a software
development lifecycle.

1117
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:20,000
What is the last cycle of SDLC?

1118
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,960
When is the last cycle of SDLC?

1119
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,120
That's not the last cycle of SDLC.

1120
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,960
It's called
the deployment or maintenance, right?

1121
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,600
But I'm pretty sure 150%

1122
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,520
you guys don't understand
why it's called that or what it is.

1123
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I'm going to show you what it is.

1124
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,760
So we use the word like live, right?

1125
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,040
Like live application, like deployment.

1126
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,960
What does this mean?

1127
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,040
What Are we doing
there's different environments now.

1128
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,440
What are environments?
All these questions.

1129
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,480
So if we go to Amazon.com

1130
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,520
today,

1131
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:01,240
Amazon.com, this is the live application.

1132
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,000
Okay?

1133
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,360
This right here is the live application.

1134
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,000
This is what the user sees.

1135
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,240
This is what the user can use.

1136
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,640
This is where they buy things.

1137
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,800
This is what we call production. Okay.

1138
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,240
This is what's called prod production,

1139
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,840
Amazon.com, what the users use.

1140
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,240
And we're going to write this down
and we're going to write this down.

1141
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,880
This makes sense,
right? So we're going to talk

1142
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,440
about environments and

1143
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,840
environments, right?

1144
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,200
And I'm going to say productions,
production

1145
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,880
production is I found a bug with Amazon.

1146
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,440
Oh, really?

1147
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,200
That's cool.

1148
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,200
Yeah, pretty well.

1149
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,360
We'll talk more about that in a bit.

1150
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,520
Olivier So good job

1151
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,600
production.

1152
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,600
Okay, Now I want you to
I want you to understand something because

1153
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,920
we're going to be using look right
here, I'm going to get this URL right here

1154
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,280
and I'm going to pasted right here, there.

1155
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,400
This is Amazon's, this is Amazon's

1156
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,440
production world production.

1157
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,920
You are got

1158
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,080
ETPs, WDW, Dot, Amazon.com.

1159
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,280
Cool.

1160
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,560
Does this make sense? Now

1161
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,320
you probably start to question
or ask yourself,

1162
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,560
So where did developers
develop their code?

1163
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,360
Where do testers test?

1164
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:35,360
You know,
did they all go to Amazon.com and test?

1165
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,880
They're like,
Is that where everything happens?

1166
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,240
How does this work now?

1167
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,280
So what's called

1168
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,400
is there's a concept of environments
that we're going to talk about,

1169
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,040
and the environment
is there's a hierarchy, okay?

1170
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,160
And what happens is

1171
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,640
that in most workplaces is okay,

1172
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,640
there's a development environments,

1173
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,160
development environment
and it's going to be short for that.

1174
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,400
In most places
they call it the environment of

1175
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,360
and then comes the next one.

1176
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,080
It's called the Q Way.

1177
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,480
Sometimes they call it
we're going to stick to cube environments.

1178
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:19,280
Go Q8
And this is we're going to call it QED.

1179
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,360
Okay.

1180
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,040
And then the next one is called Stage

1181
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,640
Stage Camp Stage Environments.

1182
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,800
We're going to say stage
we're going to set up

1183
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,920
because we're going to talk
about different types of testing today.

1184
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,400
Okay.

1185
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,240
And then lastly, what happens is

1186
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,360
we have the production

1187
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,360
environment and it's short for product.

1188
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,200
Okay, cool.

1189
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,160
So this is how the workflow goes in

1190
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,280
most of the projects.

1191
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,640
And if you have a good understanding of
this, you will be very, very good to go.

1192
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,720
So what does this mean? Okay,

1193
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,920
so yup, the build.

1194
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,520
Very good.

1195
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,800
See, you know your stuff, but sandbox
would be like lower than death.

1196
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,760
Right.
But we're going to talk about that later.

1197
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,280
The Bill sandbox
would usually be like zero in this list

1198
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,920
and we're going to talk about and
then sandbox and then dev and so forth.

1199
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,280
So very good job.

1200
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,720
So how does this work?

1201
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,080
Okay.

1202
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,640
And what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you

1203
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,320
a real application that we use

1204
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,720
in one of my projects I work.

1205
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,280
Does that sound cool?

1206
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,880
Does that sound cool or what?

1207
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:46,080
I'm going to show you one.

1208
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,360
Let's see.

1209
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:51,920
All right.

1210
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:58,560
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go here.

1211
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,760
This is an application
that we are working with

1212
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,640
with one of my projects right here.

1213
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,280
Okay.

1214
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,600
This is what

1215
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,920
what what it's called
Now, guys, just look at look at the page.

1216
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,120
Right.
And I want you to look at everything.

1217
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,520
What environment are we in?

1218
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:28,040
Do you think?

1219
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:34,240
Oh, no, not production.

1220
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,520
Not development.

1221
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,040
Sebastian, why do you say test?

1222
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:44,960
What do you say test?

1223
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,760
Some will say Dev,
some people are saying live.

1224
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,440
Some say 80.

1225
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,480
So we will say stage remain white U8 test.

1226
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,760
Okay, look at the URL

1227
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,760
whether it's a

1228
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,240
the test environment.

1229
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:05,760
Right.

1230
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,360
Right.

1231
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,000
The U.S. has this service
slash test. Right?

1232
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,080
This right here is I'm using this
an excellent example

1233
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,200
is going to be the Kuwait
Environment code.

1234
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,360
This is the URL.

1235
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:24,360
This is not what the real user uses.

1236
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,160
This environment is what we use.

1237
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:27,720
And you know what?

1238
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,440
To clarify this,
I'll say this can be known as Q A test.

1239
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:33,120
Q A test environment.

1240
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,880
You see, this service
does everything right.

1241
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,120
So now let me ask you this.

1242
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,960
Let's go back here, which is two zero

1243
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,960
to test.

1244
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,480
Okay, double isn't working,
so I'm going to change it to Dev two.

1245
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:53,160
So what should be working? Go.

1246
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,520
And I want you guys to look at this.

1247
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,960
Let it load. Okay.

1248
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,200
It's the same thing, right?

1249
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:04,200
But what environment are we in?

1250
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,480
The dev environment. Right.

1251
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,120
So we're going to copy this
and ignore the number two on the URL.

1252
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,440
But we know that it has that right.

1253
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,240
Okay,

1254
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:18,800
Now let's go to the staging environment.

1255
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,560
Okay, Let's go to the staging environment.

1256
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,480
So what I'm going to do here
is I'm going to come here

1257
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,800
just to stage right, look

1258
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,240
ready.

1259
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,600
And it's the same thing, Right?

1260
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,120
But what environment are in?

1261
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,400
We are in stage environments, right?

1262
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,680
Stage environment
we are in and we're going to come here.

1263
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,800
We're going to come here. Okay.

1264
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,200
Now, the production URL

1265
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,840
and see, I got canceled

1266
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:57,240
August NCI.

1267
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,280
Let me see if this is
if this is going to work.

1268
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,280
I don't remember the production
world and see, I don't talk.

1269
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,520
That's my right

1270
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,400
now, let's

1271
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:20,880
see, we find this year.

1272
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,320
No, let's see the rule in the study.

1273
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:25,800
Let's see.

1274
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,800
Let's see. I'm looking.

1275
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,000
Oh, there you go. Right.

1276
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,000
This is the production.

1277
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,360
You are out.

1278
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,520
Okay, There it is.

1279
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,240
And I found that. By what?

1280
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,400
By Googling it, Right?

1281
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,640
Because that's what's in production.

1282
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,200
I cannot Google this.

1283
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,840
I cannot Google this.
I cannot Google this.

1284
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,640
I literally Googled,

1285
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,920
you know, the name of the application
because I know what it is.

1286
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,080
Right. And this is the producer.

1287
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,640
So let's talk about this for a second.

1288
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,240
And notice
I label a number them one, two, four.

1289
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,440
So what happens is, okay, developers
pick up their tickets, right,

1290
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,000
to pick up the user stories
so they're going to work with. Right.

1291
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,480
And what they do
is they start their development, okay,

1292
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,880
they start their development
and and they do what they have to do.

1293
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:15,760
Okay?

1294
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,680
Whenever they're done developing
whatever they have to do,

1295
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,440
they're going to deploy that code.

1296
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,360
Okay. I'm

1297
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,760
no, it's accessible to to to you.

1298
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,760
It's going to be accessible to
you guys at work.

1299
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,800
You guys are going to have
your own environments. Okay?

1300
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,760
You guys are going to be able
to access these environments.

1301
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,720
Sometimes they only let you access them

1302
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,960
because you're connected to a VPN
or something like that.

1303
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,440
So something like that.

1304
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,560
So in this case, developers
will do what they have to do

1305
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,080
in the development environments.

1306
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:47,800
Okay.

1307
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,640
And and

1308
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:52,920
boom, they're done right?

1309
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,720
They develop what they have to develop.

1310
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,880
What is

1311
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,440
sorry,
can you assure me what they're going to do

1312
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,840
is they're going to move that code right?

1313
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:18,000
And they're going to move it to the Q
a environment.

1314
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,600
What is an environment?

1315
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,440
An environment?

1316
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,360
Think of it as a copy. Okay.

1317
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,000
Of production.

1318
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,000
Does that make sense?

1319
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,600
A copy of production.

1320
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,320
Okay.

1321
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,680
So developers are going to work
in the dev environment.

1322
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,440
They get to do whatever they have to do.

1323
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,240
They'll develop
whatever they have to develop.

1324
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,240
Once that's ready,
they're going to move that code

1325
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,520
to the Q White test environment

1326
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,080
and the Q way environment
should have the exact same code.

1327
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,000
The development environment has. Okay.

1328
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,120
So you guys will do this testing here.

1329
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,920
Again, you guys will do the testing
and the Q8 environment indicators,

1330
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,520
and this is where you guys are going to do
your heavy testing, the logging in with

1331
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,800
whatever and valid credentials,
your test automation, everything.

1332
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,680
Okay, Once you guys are done,
then that's you

1333
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,120
then you're going to give the thumbs up
and then that same code

1334
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:20,360
is going to get deployed
to what we called the stage environment.

1335
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:21,720
And the

1336
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:26,440
stage environment is where we have
where we're

1337
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,120
what's where we have what's called

1338
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,040
user acceptance testing began

1339
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,760
in some workplaces.

1340
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,680
You may help to test here,
but the people who test here are

1341
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,360
who do you guys know

1342
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,720
core who are the know
not to be the client?

1343
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,560
Exactly. The customer. Right.

1344
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,720
This is their environ ment
and what they are testing.

1345
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,920
Okay.

1346
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,680
What they are testing is to make sure

1347
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,560
that whatever you said passes, passes.

1348
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,040
Okay.

1349
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,600
So if you're going to do your test,

1350
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,280
you want to say, hey, we're good to go,
everything is good.

1351
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:16,080
They're going to do their testing
and they're going to make sure

1352
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,120
that everything works right.

1353
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:22,480
At the end of the day, the client is the
one who's paying for the project, right?

1354
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,040
And they are the ones that want this
for their users.

1355
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,280
Okay. Does that make sense?

1356
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,360
They're the ones that are going to be

1357
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:34,320
going to be heavily
impacted if there's a showstopper bug

1358
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,400
in production.

1359
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,320
Okay, I'm

1360
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,120
so they're going to do this
testing to re verify everything.

1361
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:46,560
They are the ones that know exactly
how they want their application to work.

1362
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,520
Everything like this.

1363
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,720
So this is where their testing
will take place.

1364
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:50,680
Okay.

1365
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,440
Now once they they test
and once they pass their testing,

1366
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,000
then they're going to say,
all right, thumbs up, we're good to go.

1367
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,240
Then they're going to deploy
that same code to production,

1368
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,840
which is the live application
that the users use.

1369
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,760
Okay. Does that make sense?

1370
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,200
So, for example,
in this in this scenario here,

1371
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,760
I gave you the production
URL for HTTPS Amazon.com.

1372
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,960
This is what the user uses.

1373
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,920
I don't know what their staged environment
URL is.

1374
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:25,160
I don't know what their Q8
or test environment URL is.

1375
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,760
I don't know what their development
environment URL is.

1376
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:29,040
I don't know. We don't know that.

1377
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,880
And even if we did, we probably couldn't
access it for internal security reasons

1378
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,400
or something like that.

1379
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,840
Does that make sense to everyone right.

1380
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,600
Well, for all we know,
it could probably say like Amazon dot

1381
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,360
dev Amazon
that you Wacom maybe just examples, right?

1382
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,560
That's what you have.

1383
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,320
So that's the way that this testing
hierarchy goes.

1384
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,280
Okay.

1385
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,600
First code gets developed
in development environment, right?

1386
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,640
And this is where developers test or code
and we're going to talk about that

1387
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,800
then you guys test in the Q
a test environment, right?

1388
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,280
And then once you guys give

1389
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,840
the thumbs up, it's
not going to go straight to production.

1390
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:13,360
The client is going to test
and the stage environment, that's

1391
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:16,640
where they're going to stay and that's
where they're going to test everything.

1392
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,360
They're going to make sure that whatever
you said passes, actually passes.

1393
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,760
Okay, Now how

1394
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,080
like, how do you think it would look

1395
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,920
if they do their testing

1396
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:36,440
and they find some bugs?

1397
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,400
How do you think it would look?

1398
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,600
Not good, right?

1399
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,280
I mean, think about it.

1400
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,680
You gave the thumbs up and you said.

1401
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,480
We're good to go, right?

1402
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,920
You gave the thumbs up.

1403
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,120
Your team gives a thumbs
up. We're testing. Right.

1404
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,800
And then they find some bugs, right?

1405
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,000
So what's going to happen there?

1406
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,840
It's going to make you look it's
going to be bad.

1407
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,840
It's actually it's actually really bad.

1408
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,240
It's a really bad.

1409
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,600
Like it's not a good thing at work.

1410
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,000
Okay. It's not a good thing.

1411
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:15,000
What happens is that the client starts
to lose trust in the team, okay?

1412
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,120
They start to lose
trust in the team. Okay.

1413
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,120
And and then that reflects on on negative,

1414
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,560
you know, on negative feedback

1415
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:29,560
and negative feedback isn't always,
you know, it's not going to be good.

1416
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,360
So that makes sense.

1417
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,160
So that that that trust, they're like,

1418
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,560
let's say Michaele is the client, right?

1419
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,840
And I'm say I'm a the curator.

1420
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,520
So I'm saying, Michaele,
everything's good to go

1421
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,560
and then Michaele test it
and he's like, Hey, I found some bugs

1422
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,480
and he's not going to trust me
much anymore, right?

1423
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,560
He's going to be like, like
and we're there to help with the testing.

1424
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,400
So that's not going to look so, so great.

1425
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,440
Okay, cool.

1426
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,320
Does that make sense to everyone?

1427
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:01,920
Cool.

1428
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:02,960
All right.

1429
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,160
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Very, very,
very good.

1430
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:11,000
Does anyone have questions
on environments?

1431
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,200
The testers get fired
because of negative feedback?

1432
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,760
It depends.

1433
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,240
Okay.

1434
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:20,360
Right now, sometimes they could find a bug

1435
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,600
that no one knew about,
and that's completely okay.

1436
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,400
Right.

1437
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,520
But what if they're testing
and they're testing what you tested

1438
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,000
and they say and you said it passes
and then it fails on them.

1439
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:33,720
You know,

1440
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,120
it's not
going to it's not going to look good.

1441
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,160
There's not it's not going to look good.

1442
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,520
At the end of the day,
the main goal is to be able to deliver

1443
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:49,680
a very working product to the
the customers,

1444
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,160
the live customers, the people
that are going to be using the website.

1445
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,200
Okay.

1446
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,080
Why did you write reverse instead?

1447
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,480
Because this is the hierarchy that I want
you guys to.

1448
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:06,120
This is exactly how I want you guys
to remember this.

1449
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:07,400
In the workplace,

1450
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,760
when they tell you about environments,

1451
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,920
everything, they're not going to start
with number one first.

1452
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,920
They're always start from the bottom
as number one, and they go up,

1453
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,320
okay, that makes sense.

1454
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,680
But that's just how it is

1455
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,520
because production
is the highest environment

1456
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,920
and here what we're talking about
is testing hierarchy.

1457
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,800
You guys know what testing
hierarchy is like a pyramid, right?

1458
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,640
Whatever is on
top has to be on top. Right?

1459
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,720
Go. Yeah, and that's true.

1460
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,120
And that's true. Privacy.

1461
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,240
Does that make sense to everyone?

1462
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:49,680
So now going back to this slide, right,
Going back to this slide right here.

1463
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,560
Now, you understand this diagram right?

1464
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,480
Right now
you understand what this diagram is.

1465
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,520
It's telling you how everything works,
how the code is more right.

1466
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,520
Developers do their development,
then it gets deployed to the test

1467
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,040
environment, secure environment,
where you will do your testing.

1468
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:10,360
Then it gets deployed
to the stage environment.

1469
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,880
That's where the client test, right?

1470
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,840
If everything's got to go, goes
to production and bam.

1471
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,360
Okay, cool.

1472
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,200
Now you understand what this is, okay?

1473
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,680
And here's some more notes for you.

1474
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,720
Okay, cool.

1475
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,400
All right.

1476
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,320
Questions on this.

1477
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,160
Oh, and here's a question.

1478
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:35,440
Why don't we test in production? Why?

1479
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:42,600
Why don't we test in production?

1480
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,640
No, that's not a

1481
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,600
it's already live.

1482
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,680
No, Why don't we test in production?

1483
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,360
Mohammed brings up a good point.

1484
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,280
It could cause errors.

1485
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,680
The customers are using it.

1486
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,720
We might crush the system. That is good.

1487
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,360
Okay, so check this out.

1488
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:07,200
You remember when we talked about how much
money does Amazon make in one hour?

1489
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,680
You guys remember that from US class?

1490
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,480
Okay, what happens if you go in production

1491
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,280
and you start running your test
and then you break something?

1492
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,280
Okay, You break something.

1493
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,920
Amazon is going to lose a lot of money,
right?

1494
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,200
We don't test in production
because it is very risky.

1495
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:26,960
Okay?

1496
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,680
It could you could break the system.

1497
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,240
You never know
if any other test could break the system

1498
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,600
or break the application code.

1499
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,680
Does does that make sense? Third one,

1500
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,240
is it

1501
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,360
the production environment
is there for the users to use?

1502
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,320
Now, if the users obviously
if they run into some bugs

1503
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:52,560
or something like that,
obviously those have to be addressed.

1504
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:57,480
But the types of testing
that you guys are going to be doing

1505
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,640
that we're going to be doing that
developers are going to be doing.

1506
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,720
That's not for production. Okay.

1507
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,640
Is that clear to everyone

1508
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,120
now, Mohammed?

1509
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,240
That's a good question.
They're not in production.

1510
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,000
What may happen, Mohammed,

1511
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,480
is that they've already done
all the testing

1512
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,800
and now they're going
to deploy to production.

1513
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,840
So they need that time
and that's why they call it maintenance.

1514
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,440
Okay.

1515
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,360
Is that what happened?

1516
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,880
I mean, the reason they gave

1517
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,320
the Facebook thing was some network issue,
and that was, you know,

1518
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,880
that that obviously

1519
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,000
who knows where may have happened.

1520
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,080
And we're going to talk
about different types of testing as well.

1521
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:40,600
Okay.

1522
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,320
So but is this clear for everyone

1523
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:47,160
right now and everything got everything
we're going to do from here until the end?

1524
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,120
I promise you, it's going to start
making more and more and more sense.

1525
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,720
It'll be a clear picture
at the end of test execution.

1526
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:56,600
We started with the testing test
cycle closure.

1527
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:57,880
Okay.

1528
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:02,080
Test cycle closure is basically

1529
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,720
in the software testing lifecycle, right?

1530
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,080
Whenever code gets deployed
to the test environment

1531
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,440
and you run your test and everything
passes,

1532
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,040
that's where you can end your tests, okay?

1533
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,000
That's what that's what it means.

1534
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,680
Cool.

1535
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,040
In some workplaces that varies

1536
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,080
because you may be responsible

1537
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,120
for helping the team
test in the stage environment.

1538
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,520
So if you're ever in that situation,

1539
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,000
that means that the UAE team really,
really trust your testing.

1540
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,520
Okay, So here we're going to learn about

1541
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,800
we're in class two and.

1542
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,640
Okay, So before we get to Joe,
we're going to touch with you.

1543
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,160
We're going to start with JIRA tomorrow.

1544
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,120
We talked about test case development.

1545
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,840
So very good job right?

1546
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,800
Credit test.

1547
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,960
Okay, So let's see.

1548
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,520
Oh, geez,
I forgot the credentials for this.

1549
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,280
Okay, So.

1550
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:13,560
All right, you guys are doing very good.

1551
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,960
So now we're going to come up
with the task. Okay?

1552
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,320
And this shouldn't take you that that.

1553
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,320
Okay, So

1554
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,120
give me a second.

1555
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:27,400
I want to see if this works.

1556
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,440
Okay, Perfect.

1557
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,920
This is an application that we're going
to be working with in class.

1558
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,600
This is where you're going to do
all your testing,

1559
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,480
all your test automation,
everything like that.

1560
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:35,960
Okay.

1561
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:40,200
What I want you to do
and I don't know the credentials,

1562
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:45,960
so just make them up and pretend
that you know what happens.

1563
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:48,000
So this is a test case.

1564
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,080
I want you to create a test case.

1565
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,560
Okay? This is a user story

1566
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,800
and the acceptance

1567
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,800
criteria to this, the A-C.

1568
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:01,640
So this is this.

1569
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,880
Okay, The acceptance criteria.

1570
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:08,360
As an admin,
I should be able to log into syntax h.r.

1571
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,480
Mess, say

1572
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:16,040
with valid credentials can go.

1573
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,280
All right.

1574
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,160
This is the environment url
i'm going to share with you.

1575
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,880
I don't know the credentials just yet.

1576
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,600
Okay, but i want you guys
to create this test case.

1577
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,200
I'm going to share it right here. Right.

1578
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,680
There you go.

1579
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,200
And I really expect this
to be submitted by.

1580
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:37,560
Okay, It's not that hard.

1581
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,880
You can use the existing templates
that you have.

1582
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,080
You already know how to create test cases.

1583
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:46,720
Okay. And so forth.

1584
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,360
Right now, do it right now.

1585
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,440
We're on the clock, right?

1586
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,360
Pretend you're working.

1587
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:52,360
It's 8:16 p.m. my time.

1588
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,680
You should be finished.
I'm going to give you

1589
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,720
until 827, 10 minutes.

1590
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,200
That's more than enough time to do this.

1591
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,400
Okay.

1592
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,080
In the meantime,

1593
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,040
let me see if I can come up with
let me see if I can get the credentials,

1594
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:33,000
see, and any questions ask me.

1595
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,720
Okay, I'm here.

1596
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,360
I'm here to help you out.

1597
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:37,920
Don't be shy.

1598
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,720
What did I say about the credentials?

1599
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:50,000
When I say anything about the credentials,
I said make make the credentials up

1600
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,360
and pretend

1601
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,400
and pretend,

1602
01:18:58,720 --> 01:18:59,400
you know.

1603
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:05,640
Let's see.

1604
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:16,320
See? They come together.

1605
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,160
Just make up the credentials, pretend
you know it, and you know

1606
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:22,360
the last step, the less expect
the result is okay.

1607
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,880
Like don't stress it out.

1608
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,320
I just want you to wear it. Right.
That's it.

1609
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,720
Okay. Just make.

1610
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,400
I want you to water. Right.

1611
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,400
I'm looking for consistency.

1612
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,200
Oh, time out, everyone.

1613
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,400
That's a really good point.

1614
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,760
I can look time.

1615
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,200
I can I get everyone's
attention right here. Okay.

1616
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,480
Okay.

1617
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,840
So is everyone.

1618
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,960
Does everyone have eyes here?

1619
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:46,280
Okay,

1620
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,240
One big error that I saw in your test
cases, and this was for a lot of you.

1621
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,840
Okay, I want you guys look at the
the expected results

1622
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,000
or the actual results.

1623
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,920
Look, they expect the results.

1624
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,040
We're saying Netflix home page

1625
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,440
displays sign in page
display fields display.

1626
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,480
Okay. Displays, displays, displays. Right.

1627
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,880
We're using present tense.

1628
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,400
Right. Do you guys know what that means?

1629
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,440
Present tense.

1630
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,000
Right.

1631
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,000
So, for example,
some of you guys were writing

1632
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,320
like this signing page

1633
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:26,640
is displayed right now.

1634
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,560
We have inconsistency in this test case.

1635
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,800
Do you guys see that

1636
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,600
you have a present tense here
and then you have a past tense here.

1637
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,960
Okay Don't do this.

1638
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,120
If you're going to choose one

1639
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,400
or the other, that's fine,
but stick to it and be consistent.

1640
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:41,880
Okay?

1641
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,720
Go. Cool.

1642
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,000
All right, cool.

1643
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,280
But I that was something
I really want to talk to you guys about.

1644
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:52,840
Done.

1645
01:20:53,400 --> 01:21:28,240
So go ahead, Melanie.

1646
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:31,000
What did I say about the credentials?

1647
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,760
Like, I don't know them.

1648
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:35,080
So you're not going to be able to log
in, right?

1649
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,720
I just said
make make the credentials up and pretend.

1650
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,040
Pretend that you know what happens
after you

1651
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,720
enter valid credentials.

1652
01:21:49,720 --> 01:22:13,800
Cool.

1653
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,400
Is everyone able to open the URL,
by the way?

1654
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,080
It's working for me.

1655
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,280
I think if you copy it right,

1656
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,840
it's working. Yep.

1657
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,440
LNT is not opening.

1658
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,760
Can you edit again, Olivier?

1659
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,880
Just, you know, we'll get there.

1660
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:37,680
We'll get there.

1661
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:43,440
Alexis, What are you having trouble with?

1662
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,120
Well, what's.

1663
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,200
What's wrong with the URL

1664
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,960
not working?

1665
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:48,960
Did you copyright?

1666
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,920
Can you see if you copy right.

1667
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:57,680
Let me say that again.

1668
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,840
There it is. Here's the URL again.

1669
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,200
You can click on

1670
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:05,240
it, see if

1671
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,480
it works.

1672
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,000
See if it works.

1673
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:17,800
Let me know if it doesn't, it doesn't.

1674
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,840
Okay.

1675
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,280
Well, we're excited.

1676
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:25,480
We're going to be writing
lots of test cases

1677
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,240
right?

1678
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:32,720
Can you click on the link that I just sent
there?

1679
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,480
Eleni is working for Alexis.

1680
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:36,240
Okay.

1681
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,080
What do you see?

1682
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,880
Can you send us a screenshot
of what what you're seeing?

1683
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:45,280
Please? Yes.

1684
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,440
And it's done as a screenshot.

1685
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:48,840
Yeah, sure, guys.

1686
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,240
And now guys, look, here's the thing.

1687
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,640
Here's the way I run these classes.

1688
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,080
We're all a team here, right?

1689
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,160
So any issues you have,
you send them right here.

1690
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:00,120
A lot of questions
and we're all going to help you out

1691
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,600
to code.

1692
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:07,360
All right,

1693
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,120
Alan,
you could just send your assignment here.

1694
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,440
Take A screenshot, please.

1695
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,800
Not not a you know,

1696
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,400
not a picture.

1697
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,640
Take a screenshot and we'll see.

1698
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,440
We'll see what Alan Let's see
what Alan has here

1699
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,320
and let's take a moment
to, to see Alan's test case.

1700
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:43,280
Yes, very good.

1701
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,560
Okay, so

1702
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,080
this is a very good test case, Alan,
But you know what I would say.

1703
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:50,200
Yeah, that's it.

1704
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,840
That's the application.

1705
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:59,560
What's the problem, Melanie?

1706
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,080
Yeah, I told you. It's.

1707
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,440
I told you
you're not going to be able to log in.

1708
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:06,640
I said that like, three times.

1709
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:10,600
I just said, Pretend that you just come up
with fake credentials

1710
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:15,000
and pretend that it,
you know, that, like, pretend.

1711
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,160
Just pretend that you know
what's going to happen. Okay?

1712
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:20,160
I will send you the valid
credentials once I have them.

1713
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,360
So does everyone

1714
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,840
look at Alan's task
is because this is a nine out of ten.

1715
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,120
Okay. Alan, are you there?

1716
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,640
I'm going to give you a feedback
right now.

1717
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:34,400
And of course, so, Alan,
this is a very good test case.

1718
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:38,240
But why would you add more to the expect

1719
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:43,440
the result of step number three
when step number two was row,

1720
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:46,560
you said username field properties
with input data, perfect

1721
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,440
password field a populous with input data.

1722
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:50,880
That's it.

1723
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,040
You don't need to say that it's censored
or that it was inputted by the user.

1724
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,080
Yeah. Go.

1725
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:01,920
Let's see what Catalina says.

1726
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:03,560
It's kind of blurry.

1727
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,000
This.

1728
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,560
I don't know when I want to see.

1729
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:12,480
I can't see.

1730
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:17,600
Can everyone see this?

1731
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,360
I cannot really see it.

1732
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,000
Can you send it again, Catalina?

1733
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:23,880
I can't.

1734
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,040
I really read.

1735
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,120
It's kind of blurry for.

1736
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:45,160
For me.

1737
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:49,440
So let's see.

1738
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,360
There you go. Much better.

1739
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:51,000
Still a little blurred,

1740
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,920
but I'm going to make okay,
so user navigate to this syntax. h.R.

1741
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:57,720
Page displays.

1742
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:01,800
Okay, user clicks in the username box.

1743
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,640
What is the point of clicking
the username textbox?

1744
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,560
You just skip that step.

1745
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,720
There's
no need to say user click to the user name

1746
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:24,840
in the user name textbox. It's

1747
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,000
let's see.

1748
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:33,600
Format says yes syntax.

1749
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,600
Okay.

1750
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,760
So very good.

1751
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,720
This is a great example
of what I don't want you to do.

1752
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,400
So everyone look at format, screenshot,
format.

1753
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,440
I'm just picking on you
because this is a good example.

1754
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,120
Okay. What is wrong with formats?

1755
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,320
Test case.

1756
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,800
Come on guys, just look at it and tell me.

1757
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:56,160
Let's let's all do it. Test case review.

1758
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,360
You guys know what to look out for now.

1759
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,800
So what is
what is wrong with formats? Test case

1760
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,920
What what is wrong with formats?

1761
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:13,520
Test case.

1762
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,720
Yes, exactly.

1763
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,880
The result does an action right?

1764
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:21,400
What do we say about expect
the results are expected

1765
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,280
results action

1766
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,000
right

1767
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,840
or month you hit
you have as expected result.

1768
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,320
The first one is good.

1769
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,040
The second one you have user enters
username.

1770
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:40,000
User enters username is
an action is not an expected result.

1771
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:44,040
What you have a step
number is user enters username.

1772
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:44,960
Okay.

1773
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,800
What happens when the user enters
the username?

1774
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,960
Okay.

1775
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,160
Exactly.

1776
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:58,880
Let's see a here.

1777
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,800
It should log in panel This place

1778
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:05,440
user enters enter data displays. Yes.

1779
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,880
Yes. Very good.

1780
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:09,920
Very good.

1781
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,560
Yeah very good.

1782
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,600
That the mirror. Right on then.

1783
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,160
Very good stuff.

1784
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,240
What should you put instead.

1785
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,280
So what happens when the user enters

1786
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:26,080
a username and username textbox.

1787
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,040
Right.

1788
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:31,200
The username displays in the
in the textbox.

1789
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:31,560
Right.

1790
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,400
That's what happens.

1791
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,960
Look at the previous
is is that people are sending.

1792
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,120
Right. So

1793
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,480
Merriam Edge says

1794
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,720
user navigates to okay syntax

1795
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:53,760
panel page opens

1796
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,840
user enters valid credentials

1797
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,840
credentials can be entered

1798
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,920
user clicks on log in button

1799
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,560
user is logged in.

1800
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:08,960
Interesting.

1801
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,400
So Marianne from I think this was Mary.

1802
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,520
Mary, Mary there. Can I give you feedback?

1803
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,440
Are you ready?

1804
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:22,760
I got you.

1805
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:23,720
Welcome.

1806
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:30,160
So, Miriam, so we need to be a little bit
more descriptive, right?

1807
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,880
So user interest, valid credentials where

1808
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:38,160
go and user clicks on log

1809
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:42,120
in one guys,
whenever we are indicating a field

1810
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:46,000
or a name of a button,
it should be in what?

1811
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,280
Where should it be in?

1812
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,520
What should it be?

1813
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,000
Yes, exactly.

1814
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,800
Very good quotations.

1815
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,200
Let's see.

1816
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,080
And everyone, let's just look at this.

1817
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:03,960
Those cases in the bill
Sunset user navigates this. Yes.

1818
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,960
User inputs username. Yes

1819
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:15,040
Yes. So

1820
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:19,000
now build from your actual result for step
three.

1821
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:21,800
Right? Is not consistent with you.

1822
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,120
Expect
the results from your previous steps.

1823
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:28,040
So you either stick to as expected

1824
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,480
for all of them or you continue just

1825
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,120
an actual.

1826
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,840
Your actual results are also incorrect.

1827
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,720
Like for step two.

1828
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,640
Okay. And

1829
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:45,840
yeah.

1830
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,920
And I was right and I don't see

1831
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,240
I don't see a test description,

1832
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:55,200
a test case I'd be
and everything else is very good.

1833
01:31:55,480 --> 01:31:57,280
I just don't see.

1834
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,040
And are you there. I don't see.

1835
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:05,360
The task is description or.

1836
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:06,000
Yeah,

1837
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:07,800
let's see

1838
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:13,200
your guida.

1839
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,160
Let's see.

1840
01:32:14,160 --> 01:32:15,520
You'll get a

1841
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,520
user should navigate to below.

1842
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,840
You are

1843
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,440
okay.

1844
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:24,120
You mean it?

1845
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:27,960
You kind of uploaded a screenshot with

1846
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,880
like a message of someone

1847
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:51,640
got your guitar.

1848
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,720
Not back yet.

1849
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,000
I will understand.

1850
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,320
Oh, and one more thing, guys.

1851
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:03,840
Look, one thing I wanted to say.

1852
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,320
Yes, of course.

1853
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:07,560
Miriam, do you want to show your employer,

1854
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,640
Miriam,
that you are worth $100,000 a year?

1855
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,920
Or do you want to show them that you're
just like

1856
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,480
like a high school student
going to college, right?

1857
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,920
So you can easily fix these little errors,
right?

1858
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,120
And bam, you're right on right.

1859
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,400
Your test case was good.

1860
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,280
Your test case was good.

1861
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:28,960
Okay.

1862
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:34,920
I had a student and I'm not going
to, you know, you know Exactly.

1863
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:37,840
I had a student messaged me and

1864
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:40,000
and was like, hey,

1865
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,560
you know, Diego,
English is not my first language.

1866
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:44,680
Okay?

1867
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:50,200
So the wording may not look good,
make sense and stuff like that.

1868
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,440
That is completely okay.

1869
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,320
Okay, that is completely okay.

1870
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,600
So don't be shy about that. Okay?

1871
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,000
I'm not going to call you out
if you don't know how to,

1872
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:02,280
you know, write proper English sentence.

1873
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:04,480
Okay?

1874
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,280
So just don't be shy.

1875
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,960
We're all here to make mistakes and stuff,
you know?

1876
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:15,960
So the whole point of learning.

1877
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:16,840
So let's see.

1878
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:21,160
After your Rita Simon seminar,

1879
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:25,960
are you there?

1880
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:31,440
Simon, are you there?

1881
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,080
Simon There

1882
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,400
of Simon.

1883
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:34,760
Simon.

1884
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:37,680
So your test case, right, is almost good,

1885
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,040
but You're you're using past tense

1886
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:45,400
with some of your what?

1887
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:48,360
Some of your your expected results.

1888
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,400
Look into that.

1889
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:55,160
You'll see anything that ends with me
this past tense right.

1890
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:57,720
So reworded
so that it sounds like present tense

1891
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:01,040
unless you want to make everything else
past tense.

1892
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,840
Come for hard.

1893
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,280
Let's see.

1894
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,360
That was

1895
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,880
Simon. Sorry.

1896
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:12,680
Sorry.

1897
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:19,680
Lauren, are you there?

1898
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,680
Okay. So sorry.

1899
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,680
This is what's going to be.

1900
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,320
Call it on the tortoise case.

1901
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,440
So your step user navigates to syntax.

1902
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:30,520
HRN log and you say Page appears
What page?

1903
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,360
Okay, User enters an invalid credentials.

1904
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:37,040
Credentials are accepted by system,
not error shows.

1905
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:40,920
You don't need to say that no error shows
you can say credentials are entered

1906
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:41,520
and field

1907
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:45,360
user clicks on logging button.

1908
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,760
Okay, that's good.

1909
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,720
But you see what I'm
where I'm coming with this.

1910
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,000
You also entered test data.

1911
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,480
Everything else looks good.

1912
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,720
Sorry. It's just what page appears.

1913
01:35:55,720 --> 01:36:01,000
You know, you have to you have to let us
you have to let us know.

1914
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,320
Sorry.

1915
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,920
Just seal for two JCR are you there?

1916
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,200
Just seal or tomb?

1917
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:12,440
So if I said that wrong,

1918
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,520
since I take it screen displays

1919
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,960
user inputs username enter username field

1920
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:24,840
username input displays.

1921
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:25,320
Okay.

1922
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:30,880
And so just so your expect
the result for step number three.

1923
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:32,920
You're saying

1924
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:37,320
make it so that it's like
the expected result for step number two,

1925
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,680
you don't need to say that it's
that in this place censored

1926
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:46,440
in password just say know
password input this place right

1927
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,240
and everything else is good.

1928
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,640
The test case idea is there

1929
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,840
the test case description.

1930
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:59,400
You basically copy
the acceptance criteria, maybe

1931
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:03,000
reworded a little bit so that you describe
what the test is actually is.

1932
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:07,640
But overall, just so not that.

1933
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,560

01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,440
Alana, are you there

1968
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,760

01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:40,320
But as a lot of there are.

1970
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:40,800
That's fine.

1971
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,240
We can discuss after

1972
01:39:56,840 --> 01:40:00,600

1973
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,560
What do you have, Jimmy?

Yes. Where we are on break until 850.

1975
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:19,960
We are on break until 850.

1976
01:40:19,960 --> 01:40:45,640
Was that mean you have a mac
but not a mac keyboard?

1977
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:49,120
Christine, go ahead on break
and we'll talk after when you come back

1978
01:40:49,120 --> 01:41:46,120
from break.

1979
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:48,000
You had to read those already. Come on,

1980
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,000
let's look at them.

1981
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:53,880
Let's see.

1982
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:59,400
I have a mac.

1983
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,680
Nope, you can skip.

1984
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:05,200
I'm sure you can skip
10 minutes or something when you rewatch

1985
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,000
a class

1986
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:14,840
C to Mona.

1987
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,160
Let's see tomorrow. Let's see.

1988
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:24,640
What did you do to my non.

1989
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,240
So you say display.

1990
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:31,080
You may want to say displays.

1991
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,160
And for step number two.

1992
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:33,720
Thelma Tom.

1993
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:36,240
Mona, you say user entries.

1994
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,960
User name, user entries.

1995
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,560
Username.

1996
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:45,000
You want to say user entries
username in username field, right?

1997
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,160
And then you want to say enter username

1998
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:52,760
displays, right?

1999
01:42:52,760 --> 01:42:56,800
You got to change these steps For step
number three, user

2000
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,400
enters password in password field

2001
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,840
and enter password

2002
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:06,040
displace write in password field.

2003
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:08,840
You can say that's fine,
but you got to change

2004
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,480
that change listings.

2005
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,160
Why can

2006
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:23,640
you send a screenshot?

2007
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,840
Jimmy, take a screenshot. What?

2008
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:26,960
What are you using?

2009
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,240
Jimmy I can't.

2010
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:43,560
So the way to take a screenshot with
that is see?

2011
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,880
Okay jimmy it's going to be the

2012
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,640
the windows button.

2013
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:51,280
You have a windows button
so it's going to be windows

2014
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:54,680
shift and three.

2015
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:55,360
Okay.

2016
01:43:55,360 --> 01:44:01,360
Or you can do Windows shift four
and then you can select where you want,

2017
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:17,880
what kind of screenshot you want to take.

2018
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:22,000
So Solana,
why are you sending screenshots?

2019
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:33,560
We're not sending pictures anymore.

2020
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:50,880
Are you using a Windows or Mac?

2021
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,560
Why can't you do your screenshot?

2022
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:55,920
What what what operating system are using

2023
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:12,960
the monarchy.

2024
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,480
The monarchy writing test cases like that.
You're going to have to drink more.

2025
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:24,120
Red Bulls.

2026
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:26,520
Let's see what Let's see what Hannah the

2027
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:38,800
So Hanukkah you

2028
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:46,600
and I've got you there.

2029
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:51,200
I mean not Ana Hanoch Hanukkah
or h e an okay

2030
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:58,160
if he's not, we'll talk after.

2031
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:00,200
So, Lorna,

2032
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:03,640
do you know how to take screenshots
with Windows?

2033
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:06,040
Yes. Aisha, I can check your.

2034
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:06,400
Okay,

2035
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:10,920
so then take this user snippet too,
and take a screenshot like that.

2036
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,520
Let's see

2037
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,880
for Farhad user Navigates to this.

2038
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:18,920
Okay. Syntax.

2039
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:20,760
Good. User clicks inside.

2040
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,480
Why are you clicking inside the feel?

2041
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,680
Don't skip small steps like that.

2042
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:27,320
That's not necessary.

2043
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,320
You want to delete step.

2044
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,800
Step three You don't even have a step to

2045
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:33,480
delete.

2046
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:34,640
Step three

2047
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,160
you don't.

2048
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:39,680
You don't need them.

2049
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:41,880
Let's see what all has

2050
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:47,520
user admin
into username and username field.

2051
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:52,320
Yes. So this task is less good
now all are you there?

2052
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:53,520
No. Is that.

2053
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:58,640
Are you saying that? No.

2054
01:46:58,680 --> 01:46:59,080
Are you there?

2055
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:02,520
So no, everything is good.

2056
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:06,720
But you need to put the numbers
in a different like cell.

2057
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:23,760
Not in the same cell, if that makes sense.

2058
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:30,280
Okay, let's see.

2059
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:31,920
Yeah, There you go, Jimmy.

2060
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,320
That's right.

2061
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:36,360
Let's see.

2062
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:41,280
I'll look at the keys
and then a lot of questions.

2063
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,080
What numbers? Sorry, All the numbers.
Look, all the numbers are.

2064
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,680
The numbers are in the same cell
as a step.

2065
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:48,000
They need to be in a different cell.

2066
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,440
See what a Katarina.

2067
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,480
Katarina.

2068
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:54,080
I hope I said that right.

2069
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,960
The title of the moment

2070
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:01,240
one does lead.

2071
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:07,920
Why would you click on log in panel?

2072
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:11,840
So, Ekaterina, for step two,
why would you click on log in panel?

2073
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,680
You can just say that user username,

2074
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,200
you know
the next step, user interest password

2075
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:31,440
has same see

2076
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,480
her same.

2077
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,280
You want to change the expected

2078
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:40,160
result of step
two and three to say it's good,

2079
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:43,160
but just add an s after the word display

2080
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:46,160
like displays.

2081
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:48,640
All good has good stuff.

2082
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,440
Very good.

2083
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,400
Very good job Cassie.

2084
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,920
That's good to see my you there.

2085
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,480
Hope you heard that feedback

2086
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:04,680
is probably not there

2087
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,800
in Malaysia and Malaysia.

2088
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,120
Can you send yours please.

2089
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:11,640
Let's see. Dominant was it dominant?

2090
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:14,440
We have dominate.

2091
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,320
Expect the result for step three.

2092
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:20,760
You don't need to say
that the sensor password displays.

2093
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:25,440
You can say like a user entered username
displays, right?

2094
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,960
Insert password place

2095
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:32,160
right.

2096
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:36,320
I see augment. Yes,

2097
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:39,200
that's right.

2098
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:43,360
Ahmed from Istanbul hosted Turkey event.

2099
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,040
That is very good stuff

2100
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:49,200
in the league and Malaysia.

2101
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,400
Let's see if we got

2102
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:52,920
username.

2103
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,000
Okay.

2104
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,800
Yes. Yes.

2105
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:03,120
Oh a malaysia one error.

2106
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:06,800
This test case is almost perfect.

2107
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:10,560
One error is that your actual results
are not consistent with each other.

2108
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:11,080
Right?

2109
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:15,000
Remember when I said either
you stick to as expected for all of them

2110
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:19,720
or you copy and paste the expected result
in the actual result box.

2111
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:23,880

So Angelica there.

I was looking at different channels
I show from Fairfax.

2166
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:31,520
Let's see, I saw automatically.

2167
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,200
We already talked about this. What is.

2168
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,640
Can someone help my show

2169
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:36,360

01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,640
Oh, by the way, let me just.

2174
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,760
NASIR We're not sending pictures
anymore, right?

2175
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:56,160
We're sending screenshots

2176
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:57,480
to you guys.

2177
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:59,240
Will be I.T.

2178
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,400
professionals, right?

2179
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:02,880
Do you know what that means?

2180
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:08,520
That means that you should know
how to take a screenshot, right?

2181
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:09,960
That makes sense.

2182
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,840
I pros.

2183
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:15,480
I i tip.

2184
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:18,960
I means
you will know how to use google that

2185
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:22,040
I imagine.

2186
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:25,200
Like imagine
now they're calling you like your friends.

2187
01:54:25,200 --> 01:54:27,760
You're like, Whoa, Anna's a professional.

2188
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:31,040
She knows how to take screenshots.

2189
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,280
I'm just joking.

2190
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:34,680
No, it's it's

2191
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:37,120
using three different computers.

2192
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:37,920
Okay?

2193
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,120
I mean, it's up to you.

2194
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:41,320
I'm pretty sure you could take
a screenshot with all of those.

2195
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:43,120
If you're an I.T.

2196
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:46,880
professional, you should know how to take
screenshots with all those computers.

2197
01:54:47,920 --> 01:54:51,120
The Google.

2198
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:57,000
So. Ron All right, so very good, guys.

2199
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:01,360
So first of all, I want to say that
I am incredibly proud of all of you guys.

2200
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:04,360
Your test cases are very

2201
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:07,920
and a lot better than the ones that we did

2202
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,120
for the assignment
and the ones that we did very, very good.

2203
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:14,560
And you know what happens from here
on in only gets better.

2204
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,760
We only keep getting better
and better and better.

2205
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,400
And then once you guys get a job,
you start making money.

2206
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:23,440
And the beautiful thing about money
is that you just start

2207
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:26,600
making more money
and more money and more money.

2208
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,640
And to those people that say
money isn't everything, I want you to say

2209
01:55:30,640 --> 01:55:34,320
that once you're making $120,000 a year
and they offer you another job

2210
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:40,480
for $150,000 a year, I want you to tell me
that that money doesn't really matter.

2211
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:41,000
Okay? I'm

2212
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:43,240
going.

2213
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:44,720
Does that make sense?

2214
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:46,720
Right. Cool.

2215
01:55:47,240 --> 01:55:49,920
Very good. All right. So very good job.

2216
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,280
Give yourselves a running applause.

2217
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:55,240
Give yourselves a run.

2218
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:57,720
APPLAUSE You guys are doing very good.

2219
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:00,000
I know. Is like Jimmy.

2220
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,400
Before last week,
he was like, Oh, man, I got my homework.

2221
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,560
He just did a very good test case, right?

2222
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:09,240
It just didn't take him that long,
you know?

2223
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:11,320
Let's see.

2224
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,000
You guys are doing very, very good.

2225
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,040
Oh, by the way, I have the valid
credentials, so just message me.

2226
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:18,960
But thanks so much.

2227
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:23,640
So I will

2228
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,960
I will give you guys the credentials later

2229
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:30,000
because I don't want you guys
to get confused.

2230
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,320
All right. So are we good?

2231
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:32,600
Are we good?

2232
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:35,160
Are we good or are we good?

2233
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:37,200
Okay,

2234
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:38,520
cool.

2235
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:41,880
Are you ready for the next challenge
or are you ready?

2236
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:45,440
Right.

2237
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:48,480
All right, let's do it. Very good.

2238
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:49,120
You guys are.

2239
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:51,840
You guys are crushing it so far.

2240
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:57,880
You guys are.

2241
01:56:57,880 --> 01:56:59,800
Sebastian, I read your comment. This.

2242
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:00,840
That's funny.

2243
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:08,520
Gerald Hicks.

2244
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:09,120
That's fine.

2245
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:09,680
Gerald Hicks.

2246
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:13,080
What?

2247
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:14,800
Okay, I see. I see Gerald Hicks.

2248
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,160
Not that camp.

2249
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:17,840
Are you ready?

2250
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:19,080
So guess what?

2251
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,520
Compared to the class from last.

2252
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:26,880
Last class to this class, we know how
to one, We know how to use Google.

2253
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:29,240
We know how to take screenshots.

2254
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:29,400
Guys.

2255
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:31,000
That's a big thing.

2256
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,200
But you guys are I.T. professionals.

2257
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,760
You guys know how to take screenshots and

2258
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:39,400
so, so smart.

2259
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:43,920
Smartest batch we've ever had
here is the smartest badge we ever had.

2260
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:50,360
Okay, you guys know how to write good test
cases, and now it's going to get even.

2261
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:51,680
It's going to get intense.

2262
01:57:51,680 --> 01:57:53,920
All right, All right, we're ready.

2263
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:58,080
You guys are proving that this is too easy
for you guys, so let's take it

2264
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,360
a couple levels more code.

2265
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:00,720
All right?

2266
01:58:00,720 --> 01:58:06,680
So what we did right is we created
these manual classic test cases.

2267
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:07,440
Okay?

2268
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,080
Now, if you ask me, okay,

2269
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:15,680
my toddler knows how to take.

2270
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:17,360
That's funny, Alan. That's true.

2271
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,400
I wish Joel was that easy.

2272
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,440
We'll talk about Java later, okay.

2273
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:25,880
Java is actually easy, right? It's.

2274
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,200
You have to put time and effort,
and that's all it is.

2275
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,280
Just time and effort. All right?

2276
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:31,800
And you'll be okay.

2277
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:33,880
It's like you don't naturally.

2278
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:36,240
You like when like, let's say

2279
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:41,520
tomato or,
you know, whoever know all this stuff.

2280
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:43,680
Whenever someone comes to you

2281
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:45,800
and they speak a completely different
language.

2282
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:48,960
Right? We we always back up, right?

2283
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:50,840
Because we don't know
how to speak their language.

2284
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:54,880
And when someone asks us
like, learn to speak this language,

2285
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:57,600
we automatically like say no, right?

2286
01:58:57,600 --> 01:58:59,920
We sometimes we back up and say,
Oh, no, it's okay.

2287
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:01,800
It's too hard. Right?

2288
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,440
But what happens if you practice it and?

2289
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,320
You practice and you practice it.

2290
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:07,560
Eventually you learn it, you know?

2291
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:10,760
And that's the same thing with Java.

2292
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:13,840
You know, it's
you're going to you're going to learn it.

2293
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:17,680
You're going to
you're going to be using it a lot.

2294
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:20,960
Okay. And so forth.

2295
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:21,680
Okay.

2296
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:26,560
Now, if I were you, some advice
I would give you is I wouldn't get upset

2297
01:59:27,080 --> 01:59:29,280
if you don't know
how to do the assignments.

2298
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:31,720
Okay. I wouldn't get upset.

2299
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:35,280
You don't know how to at all the numbers
in the world and divide them by all

2300
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,440
the numbers in the world,
that kind of stuff.

2301
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,160
Okay.

2302
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:42,960
I want you guys when you guys are
when you guys are doing your Java,

2303
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,680
I want you to understand the concepts,
okay?

2304
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:48,920
Understand the concepts.

2305
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:50,280
And you will be very good. Okay?

2306
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:54,720
The concepts are so like,
very simple once you start learning it.

2307
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:54,960
Okay,

2308
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,120
cool.

2309
01:59:57,120 --> 01:59:57,480
All right.

2310
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:02,760
So what we did
was we created a classic manual task.

2311
02:00:02,760 --> 02:00:04,840
It's right
like the one I have in the screen.

2312
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:05,880
You guys ordered that.

2313
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,920
Now you guys create it too. Okay?

2314
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:10,240
And you guys get the gist of it, right?

2315
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:12,960
And we'll practice more and stuff
and everything.

2316
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:16,200
But if you ask me, these test cases

2317
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,600
are so annoying to create, right?

2318
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:23,720
I mean, it's honestly, it's
this just the honest truth, right?

2319
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,000
It's annoying, right? It's

2320
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,520
you know, like,
you know, you've got to go step by step.

2321
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:30,120
Okay. I get it.

2322
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:32,040
You know, first things first.

2323
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:34,560
A lot shows from your work, right?

2324
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:39,400
One, when someone management reads
this right,

2325
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,400
they're going to look at a few things.
Okay.

2326
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:43,360
This person is actually organized.

2327
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:44,440
One, two.

2328
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:44,840
Okay.

2329
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:47,160
This person is actually detail oriented.

2330
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,640
Testers are detail oriented. Right?

2331
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:51,440
That's nice thing. How do we tell?

2332
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:55,200
Oh, look, he puts the fields
and the buttons names in quotations,

2333
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:57,880
you know, like that.
It looks nice and organized.

2334
02:00:58,120 --> 02:00:58,800
You know,

2335
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:01,560
this thing makes sense,

2336
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:04,920
he review to make sure that that

2337
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:08,240
that the
that the words make sense of the words.

2338
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:11,160
Some of you guys were sending screenshots
like this right

2339
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,200
look at the expected result
for this stuff.

2340
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,360
Some of you guys were sending
screenshots this

2341
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,480
like this like displays or something
like that.

2342
02:01:18,480 --> 02:01:21,080
Like, like this, this stuff. Right.

2343
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:24,120
When someone sees this, right,
they're going to think like, okay,

2344
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:25,880
this person's lazy, right?

2345
02:01:25,880 --> 02:01:26,600
They can't even

2346
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:30,240
they don't even take the time
to spell out this place correctly.

2347
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:30,800
Right.

2348
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:33,120
That's the first impression
that comes to mind.

2349
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:33,960
Right.

2350
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:39,120
And this can be fixed by you just
reviewing your work before you turn it in.

2351
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:40,200
Right.

2352
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,840
So there you go, man, that said.

2353
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:44,640
Right, it shows a lot, right?

2354
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:48,760
It shows a lot when when you're doing this
this kind of this kind of work,

2355
02:01:48,760 --> 02:01:51,520
they can clearly tell
what kind of worker you are.

2356
02:01:51,720 --> 02:01:52,040
Right.

2357
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:56,040
It's not there's a reason why we focus

2358
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:59,280
so much
on creating test cases that make sense.

2359
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:01,200
The reason for

2360
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:04,960
this is
because when you write these test cases,

2361
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:08,120
they are for your team
and not just for you.

2362
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:09,440
Okay. I want to repeat that.

2363
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:12,480
They're going to be for your team
and not just for you.

2364
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:14,400
So that means

2365
02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:17,760
tomorrow, if Mikel is working at team

2366
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:20,880
with Tamanna and Paul and Mariam
and Fatma,

2367
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:26,280
let's say they're all working on the team
and Fatma wrote this test case tomorrow.

2368
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:29,680
If Mariam is going to use it,
she should understand

2369
02:02:29,680 --> 02:02:32,520
that it should make sense to her as well.

2370
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:33,640
Okay.

2371
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:37,800
If I wrote this test case, it needs
to make sense to the rest of the team.

2372
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:39,760
Does that make sense, guys?

2373
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:44,200
So these test cases
are not going to be for you, right?

2374
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:47,360
There's a reason why
we put names like created by

2375
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:53,640
so that if it's a bad test case
so we know who to go after right.

2376
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:56,240
Does that
does that make sense to everyone?

2377
02:02:56,600 --> 02:02:57,120
Right.

2378
02:02:57,120 --> 02:03:00,120
Let's say Lubo is in
the team was born, right?

2379
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:02,600
If tomorrow Lubo needs to use this test
case.

2380
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:04,720
This test case
needs to make sense to Lubo.

2381
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:07,680
Okay, is that clear?

2382
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:09,760
And it works
the same thing with your team, right?

2383
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:13,640
Everyone needs to to understand it
or be clear with this.

2384
02:03:13,640 --> 02:03:18,160
This is why we're focusing
so much on on, on

2385
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:20,800
creating stamps.com

2386
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:31,560
who will look.

2387
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:32,040
All right.

2388
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:35,880
Now, this is what we call
a classic manual test case.

2389
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:36,320
All right?

2390
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,520
This is what we call
a classic manual test case.

2391
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:41,280
Congratulations You know how to read it.

2392
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:44,280
We wrote it in Excel or Google
Sheets or something like that.

2393
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:45,360
Okay.

2394
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:48,160
However, there is another type

2395
02:03:48,160 --> 02:03:51,800
of test case we are going to be writing

2396
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:55,800
and that you're going to be using
for the majority of this class.

2397
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:57,200
Okay.

2398
02:03:57,360 --> 02:04:01,880
So if this wasn't like if this wasn't
like your like if you weren't

2399
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:06,520
so good at this, then let's hope
that you could be good at the next one.

2400
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:10,160
Okay,
So let's let's look at let's look at this.

2401
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:10,480
Okay.

2402
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:11,680
This is a test case.

2403
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:13,720
It has everything, right? It's this is

2404
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:16,720
this test verifies that a user's able

2405
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:20,160
to log in with other credentials
from the home page of Netflix dot com.

2406
02:04:20,160 --> 02:04:21,200
Okay, cool.

2407
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:24,240
We have stubs,
we have the expected results,

2408
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:26,520
and then here we have actual results.

2409
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:30,480
Oh, and by the way,

2410
02:04:30,480 --> 02:04:33,160
this test case, let's say the first step

2411
02:04:33,160 --> 02:04:37,000
passes, the second step passes,
the third step passes.

2412
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:41,160
But the fourth step and the fifth
but the fourth step fails

2413
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:44,160
at the fifth step passes
and then the sixth that passes.

2414
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:46,760
Does that
is that considered a failed test?

2415
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:50,560
Is yes,

2416
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:54,000
Every single step needs to pass, right?

2417
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:59,640
Every single step needs to pass to the
to pass.

2418
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:01,880
A single step will fail
the whole test case.

2419
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:02,920
Okay.

2420
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:05,880
You report it to your team first. Okay.

2421
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:07,920
All right.

2422
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:10,360
Now there is a different type of

2423
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,480
there's a different type

2424
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:16,840
of test test cases
that we're going to write

2425
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:20,160
and we're going to use the same example
here.

2426
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:20,760
Okay.

2427
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:23,160
So these test cases

2428
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,440
and I'm going to give you a pop quiz
right now.

2429
02:05:26,440 --> 02:05:26,840
Okay.

2430
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:32,040
Can you name me
the four environments in order, please?

2431
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:34,520
Read the four environments
in order like one, two, four.

2432
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:36,240
One, two, four.

2433
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:38,520
One, two, four,
not four, two, one, one, two, four.

2434
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:41,240
Scripts Copy.

2435
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:43,320
Muhammad is like, on point.

2436
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:43,840
You know what?

2437
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:47,000
I'm not going to be upset because
that means he's writing notes down,

2438
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:50,440
right? So works.

2439
02:05:50,440 --> 02:05:52,560
Yes Exactly. Very good.

2440
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:55,080
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful stuff.

2441
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:59,400
If I could, I would hire
all of you in my current project.

2442
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:01,000
Every single one of you.

2443
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,120
Okay, so the next type of test case,
right, is what we call.

2444
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,200
Are you ready? Are you ready?

2445
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:10,720
Cucumber scenarios kind.

2446
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:12,880
All right.

2447
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:15,480
What are cucumber scenarios?

2448
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:16,560
Game.

2449
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:20,480
Cucumber
scenarios are a type of test case.

2450
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,560
Think of it of cucumber test case.

2451
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:25,200
The word scenario is a test case.

2452
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:28,440
And what this follows

2453
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:30,720
is what we call a behavior,

2454
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,040
behavior driven,

2455
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:38,680
driven development

2456
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:39,960
approach.

2457
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:43,520
And I'll explain what this is, the way
you guys will understand all of this.

2458
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:48,800
And it's going to be called BDD.

2459
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:51,160
Okay, BDD approach.

2460
02:06:51,160 --> 02:06:53,320
What does this mean?

2461
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:55,840
This means that we're going to write
test cases

2462
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:59,160
based on how the user

2463
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:01,240
uses the application. Okay.

2464
02:07:01,240 --> 02:07:07,200
We're going to describe the behavior
that the user will take on an application.

2465
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:07,840
Okay.

2466
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:10,880
We're going to describe the behavior

2467
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:14,720
that a user

2468
02:07:14,720 --> 02:07:19,040
will take on an application of.

2469
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:22,800
So with this being said, right is one

2470
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:25,160
cucumber.

2471
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:29,800
We read our steps, we write our test
cases, certain keywords, okay,

2472
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:33,480
the keywords are given, okay one,

2473
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:38,520
and then we can given meaning

2474
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:43,480
this will be like a precondition
or the first step that needs to happen.

2475
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,080
Okay, so first step,

2476
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:48,120
first step. And it's going to make sense.

2477
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:51,840
One is the action, okay,

2478
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:56,360
the action
and then is the expected results.

2479
02:07:56,600 --> 02:07:59,880
Okay,
I'm going to write this scenario for you.

2480
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:03,200
Okay. I'm going to say, given

2481
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:06,080
user, given

2482
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:08,080
a public obviously given a

2483
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:10,680
user is on the Netflix.

2484
02:08:11,160 --> 02:08:11,880
Right.

2485
02:08:12,400 --> 02:08:14,600
Netflix home page. Okay.

2486
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:19,160
When the user logs in.

2487
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:20,360
Okay.

2488
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:24,680
Then the user should see

2489
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,200
what we can change.

2490
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:32,520
Then the user is directed
or you can say then the home page.

2491
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:34,760
What's a page called the home page.

2492
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:40,120
Then the Netflix,
then the Netflix account page displays?

2493
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:42,640
Or is that what it is this displays?

2494
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:43,720
Let's just keep it like this. Okay.

2495
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:45,520
Okay.

2496
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:49,320
So given a user is on the Netflix home
page, right.

2497
02:08:49,640 --> 02:08:50,880
This is

2498
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:53,120
this is

2499
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:58,760
this is the precondition right.

2500
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:01,800
This is the action when the user logs in.

2501
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:05,120
Okay. When this is the action.

2502
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:08,320
Right
then the Netflix account page displays.

2503
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:09,000
Okay.

2504
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:13,200
This is the expected result.

2505
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:17,640
Yes. Well, guys, guess what, right.

2506
02:09:17,640 --> 02:09:20,120
All this task is now we wrote everything.

2507
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,320
This is it.

2508
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:26,160
This is all we had to read.

2509
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:27,120
That's it.

2510
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,520
Plain and simple.

2511
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:30,320
Right?

2512
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:31,720
Does this make sense?

2513
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:36,120
And don't worry, you're going to be using
this for the rest of the class, okay?

2514
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:40,920
Because you guys are going
to be automating cucumber scenarios.

2515
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:43,880
Okay, Now, these are the rules.

2516
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:44,960
Okay?

2517
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:48,400
But the cool thing about cucumber
is that once you know the rules,

2518
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:50,240
then the rules can be broken.

2519
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:52,840
You can break the rules. Okay.

2520
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:55,640
So given is what a precondition

2521
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:58,560
one is, the action
then is the expected result.

2522
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:01,960
Now, this is a syntax, right?

2523
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:06,800
A syntax that's called gherkin gherkin.

2524
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:07,160
Okay.

2525
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:09,720
This is

2526
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:12,840
basically a syntax.

2527
02:10:12,840 --> 02:10:15,800
You guys know what syntax means.

2528
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:20,800
You guys know what syntax means.

2529
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:27,720
What does it mean?

2530
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:28,760
What does it mean?

2531
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:30,920
Oh, look at what I'm doing.

2532
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:33,960
Look, Look what I'm doing, guys.

2533
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:35,280
Googling, right?

2534
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:38,520
Wow, Look at that. Right?

2535
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:39,360
See that

2536
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:43,920
kind of the word syntax in it?

2537
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:47,520
We can refer to it as formula.

2538
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:51,560
We can refer to it
as like a way that we write the problem

2539
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:54,560
or, you know, the vocabulary in a way.

2540
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:55,640
Okay, I'm

2541
02:10:57,120 --> 02:11:00,480
so in this case we say a syntax

2542
02:11:01,240 --> 02:11:06,120
that is basically that I'm saying
that that is plain English text.

2543
02:11:06,120 --> 02:11:07,680
Okay, okay.

2544
02:11:07,680 --> 02:11:09,680
The words given is English.

2545
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:12,040
When is English then is English.

2546
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:15,760
But this language is called gherkin.

2547
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:18,480
Okay, so and what language do you write?

2548
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:19,840
Your cucumber scenarios

2549
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:26,840
in Gherkin.

2550
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:28,760
Exactly. That's the name of that.

2551
02:11:28,760 --> 02:11:30,160
That's just what it is.

2552
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:31,320
Okay, cool.

2553
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:33,920
So what we're going to do with this is

2554
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:38,160
we're actually going to

2555
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:41,560
create more test cases
using version, Right.

2556
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:44,000
Which is, you know,

2557
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,600
plain English text.

2558
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:48,480
But the cool thing about this
is that we can add other

2559
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:52,800
English keywords like an and but Right.

2560
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:55,400
So let's get this test case right here.

2561
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:58,360
Okay?

2562
02:11:58,360 --> 02:12:01,480
And let's mess around with it
just so I can show you an example given

2563
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:04,440
a user is on the Netflix home page.

2564
02:12:05,600 --> 02:12:08,680
Okay. And

2565
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:14,480
navigates

2566
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:18,880
navigate to the sign in panel.

2567
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:21,000
Right. Sign in.

2568
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,160
Oh I'm sorry. And clicks on the sign
in blue.

2569
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:23,400
Right.

2570
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:28,080
And clicks right and clicks on sign in.

2571
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:29,560
Okay.

2572
02:12:29,640 --> 02:12:32,320
And we're going to specify one

2573
02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:36,520
on Simon

2574
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,160
when the user logs in,

2575
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,680
then the Netflix account page displays

2576
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:48,600
and and

2577
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:53,520
user accounts are

2578
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,560
are displayed.

2579
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:59,440
Right. Are things different? It depends.

2580
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:00,840
I'm just making stuff up at this point.

2581
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:04,040
I want you guys to understand. Right.

2582
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:06,680
And so forth but does this make sense

2583
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:12,680
now the whole point the whole point

2584
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:16,400
of writing cucumber scenarios,

2585
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:20,280
like writing cucumber scenarios,

2586
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:25,960
is to make it make sense

2587
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:28,760
for everyone on the team.

2588
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:32,480
Okay, does that make sense?

2589
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:35,400
So using these keywords like given

2590
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:40,120
when then and but use them as you desire

2591
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:44,800
as long as the test case makes sense,
as long as the cucumber

2592
02:13:44,800 --> 02:13:47,520
scenario makes sense,
then we're good to go.

2593
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:48,560
Okay.

2594
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:52,600
Does that make sense to everyone?

2595
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:53,120
Yeah.

2596
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,800
So we read a test case for documentation,
but the Cucumber Center is there

2597
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:58,960
to summarize things for the team.

2598
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:00,840
No, this is your test case.

2599
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:04,800
So if you're writing your cucumber
scenarios, you won't be writing

2600
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,040
the classic manual test cases like this.

2601
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:11,520
Instead,
you will be writing cucumber scenarios.

2602
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:14,040
This. Does that make sense?

2603
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:17,280
So you would copy this, right?

2604
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,760
You would copy this
and you would give it a scenario name.

2605
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:23,720
So it'll be like this scenario.

2606
02:14:23,720 --> 02:14:25,120
What is this scenario?

2607
02:14:25,120 --> 02:14:29,120
We're going to say user log in
with valid credentials.

2608
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:31,880
Good.

2609
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:34,280
User login with valid credentials. Bam.

2610
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:36,560
You know the scenario name right here.

2611
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:38,720
That's all you have to do, right?

2612
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:41,320
We use that on every step.

2613
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:45,000
Expect the result are the last of only
a sorry, that's a good question.

2614
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:49,320
It's usually towards the last steps,
but you can make it make sense.

2615
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:52,360
Whatever you want.
Just make it make sense.

2616
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:53,760
Does that make sense?

2617
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:55,200
Yeah. I didn't use but.

2618
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:57,440
But I could if I wanted to.

2619
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:58,720
You can use it.

2620
02:14:58,720 --> 02:14:59,280
Okay.

2621
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:01,800
The rules are
is that with these key words?

2622
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:04,840
Right, guys,
the first letter is capitalized.

2623
02:15:05,240 --> 02:15:07,920
Okay, that is rule number one. Cool.

2624
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:09,600
The first letter is capitalized.

2625
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:13,680
So if I have this and step right here
and it's like this.

2626
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:18,120
Is this incorrect?

2627
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:19,560
Yes, it's incorrect.

2628
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:22,080
Has to be capitalized right now.

2629
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:23,640
You will have so much experience

2630
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:26,760
with this that you'll start to like
really, really get get to you.

2631
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:29,280
But that's it.
That's all you have to create, right?

2632
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:31,080
And you don't have to go
through the hassle

2633
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:33,320
of writing all of these step numbers.

2634
02:15:33,320 --> 02:15:34,960
This devs expect the result.

2635
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,080
The actual result to pass.
Yes. No, no, no.

2636
02:15:38,120 --> 02:15:40,200
That's it right here. Done right.

2637
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:42,560
And go onto the next right

2638
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:45,200
now. How do you know

2639
02:15:45,200 --> 02:15:47,560
if this test scenario would fail?

2640
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:52,080
So let's say given this given the given
a users on the Netflix home page.

2641
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:54,880
Okay bump and clicks on sign in right

2642
02:15:55,800 --> 02:15:57,840
when you click on the users
clicking on sign in.

2643
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,200
Okay sign in.

2644
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:03,400
But doesn't work,

2645
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:06,600
then the whole scenario fails, right?

2646
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:07,920
And that's it.

2647
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:10,520
But that's the whole scenario.

2648
02:16:10,520 --> 02:16:12,840
First, suppose this fell in the
in the first place.

2649
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:15,280
Yes, of course we will give more examples.

2650
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:16,920
Does that make sense?

2651
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:18,320
That's not so.

2652
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:20,520
That's how they they they do this right.

2653
02:16:20,520 --> 02:16:23,280
So now let's come up with more.

2654
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:25,200
Give me an acceptance criteria, guys.

2655
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:27,360
Give me an acceptance criteria.

2656
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:30,480
Now that you guys know what acceptance
criteria are, give me the acceptance

2657
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:34,440
criteria, any of them, and I will write
a cucumber scenario for them.

2658
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:37,000
Okay, Go ahead.

2659
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:42,120
Give me an acceptance. Go.

2660
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:43,120
Go ahead.

2661
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:45,360
You guys already know
how acceptance factors look like.

2662
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:46,920
Go ahead

2663
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:49,720
and give me an acceptance

2664
02:16:49,720 --> 02:16:55,160
criteria.

2665
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:58,360
Oh, and

2666
02:16:58,680 --> 02:16:59,720
one more thing.

2667
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:02,000
What you guys are doing that's got

2668
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:06,800
in what point of view

2669
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:09,920
that I write these scenarios

2670
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:12,240
and what point of view

2671
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:20,640
that I write these scenarios?

2672
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:22,760
What point of view? First person. Second.

2673
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:23,920
Yes. Third person.

2674
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:24,880
That's right, Anthony.

2675
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:28,560
Third Person. Point of view. Right.

2676
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:30,920
Because what is BDD?

2677
02:17:30,920 --> 02:17:33,560
BDD is this right?

2678
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:37,960
If we go back to what we said,
the behavior that a user

2679
02:17:38,480 --> 02:17:40,920
will take on an application, right?

2680
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:43,640
When we're writing scenarios,
we are basically in

2681
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:47,480
and I'll write this down and I'm going to
give you more definitions on this, okay?

2682
02:17:47,600 --> 02:17:49,640
Are you guys going to come up
with the acceptance criteria?

2683
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:55,960
Would you like to come up
with the acceptance criteria?

2684
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:56,280
Okay.

2685
02:17:56,280 --> 02:18:00,120
As a bank account holder,
I want to be able to finish it

2686
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:03,240
as 18.

2687
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:06,480
I should be able to click on auto payment
for a flat list.

2688
02:18:06,560 --> 02:18:07,240
Let's do it.

2689
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:07,960
Let's take it.

2690
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:10,200
You'll get. I'm gonna take it. All right.

2691
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:12,600
Take it.

2692
02:18:12,600 --> 02:18:12,920
Use it.

2693
02:18:12,920 --> 02:18:18,400
Should be able to block anyone
I want and WhatsApp.

2694
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:20,040
It's nice to know,

2695
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:23,440
Mustafa
what problems you run into sometimes.

2696
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:26,000
So this is the acceptance criteria.

2697
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,240
But before that, let's talk about about

2698
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,440
BDD is behavior.

2699
02:18:31,440 --> 02:18:32,280
What is it

2700
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:34,760
behavior? What

2701
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:38,320
driven development of

2702
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:40,480
good.

2703
02:18:40,480 --> 02:18:46,520
And we use it
we use BDD to describe business rules.

2704
02:18:46,640 --> 02:18:49,200
Guys, what are business rules?

2705
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:52,920
Business or the same thing
as business requirements?

2706
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:56,120
Okay, That's all it is. Right?

2707
02:18:56,520 --> 02:19:00,240
And when we write our scenarios,
when when we write

2708
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:03,800
our cucumber scenarios

2709
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:09,320
and we write them in third person
point of view

2710
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:13,880
and third person point of view,
I'm going to say this is recommended.

2711
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:17,920
Okay, Recommended.

2712
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:19,720
We write them
in third person point of view

2713
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:23,320
and we focus

2714
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:25,920
on describing

2715
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:29,720
the behavior,

2716
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:31,240
right?

2717
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:34,360
That behavior

2718
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:38,240
that a user will take on

2719
02:19:39,640 --> 02:19:43,120
an application or the application
of the application or application.

2720
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:43,680
Right.

2721
02:19:43,720 --> 02:19:46,960
So when we say describe business rules,
for example, this right here, this

2722
02:19:46,960 --> 02:19:51,520
except as a AT&T user, I should be able
to click auto payment for my plan.

2723
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:52,760
Okay. Now check this out.

2724
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:56,880
And this is the really cool thing
about behavior driven development, right?

2725
02:19:56,880 --> 02:20:00,120
So maybe to a click on auto payment,
right.

2726
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:04,840
For a plan,
maybe I had to go to the website,

2727
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:09,320
log in, go to my account,
go to payment plans

2728
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:12,640
or something like that,
then click on auto payment for my plan.

2729
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:13,200
Right.

2730
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:18,120
It sounds like there's a lot of steps
that I have to take to get there.

2731
02:20:18,360 --> 02:20:22,200
So imagine writing a test case
with all these steps, right?

2732
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:26,360
With Cucumber, The cool thing is that it
says, for example,

2733
02:20:26,360 --> 02:20:30,840
give As an AT&T user, I should be able
to click auto payment for my plant.

2734
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:34,440
Okay, So what I'll do is I'll say,

2735
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:36,520
let's say give me the of the page

2736
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:41,600
where this auto payment for
my plan is like, you'll get it.

2737
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,480
You gave me this, right?

2738
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:44,560
So what is the name of the page

2739
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,560
And I'm going to say in the payment

2740
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:55,680
payment options page because I call

2741
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:59,080
payment options.

2742
02:20:59,080 --> 02:21:00,800
Okay pages Now cool.

2743
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:03,040
Let's just stick to that. Right.
Okay, cool.

2744
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:04,800
So check this. Right.

2745
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:06,200
Given

2746
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:12,600
and AT&T

2747
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:18,000
TNT user is on the

2748
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:20,560
payment

2749
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:24,120
options page

2750
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:27,960
when the user

2751
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:31,400
clicks on

2752
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,720
what is there
a name of a button or something?

2753
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:39,360
You see, I'm asking questions
on this acceptance criteria.

2754
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:42,720
So I would be going to the bar
and asking for a clarification.

2755
02:21:42,720 --> 02:21:45,000
Right? But just for

2756
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:48,080
several
purposes, we're going to finish this.

2757
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:50,800
So and clicks on

2758
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:54,440
automatic auto payment bar, right?

2759
02:21:54,600 --> 02:21:57,000
So we're going to say auto

2760
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,600
payment button, right.

2761
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:04,720
And auto pay,

2762
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:09,360
then auto pay, let's say then auto pay

2763
02:22:11,360 --> 02:22:12,840
should be successfully.

2764
02:22:12,840 --> 02:22:16,920
And the cool thing about this is you can
use should you can use should

2765
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:20,560
for to cover scenario scan then auto page

2766
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:24,120
should be successfully

2767
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:25,200
enabled.

2768
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:26,400
Okay, ma'am.

2769
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:28,360
There you go. Three simple steps.

2770
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:31,520
That's all you had to write. Go.

2771
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:41,400
Does that make sense to everyone?

2772
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:43,760
Why is it called Cucumber?

2773
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:44,920
I don't know.

2774
02:22:45,360 --> 02:22:47,360
I have no idea that I wish. I could.

2775
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:48,040
I could.

2776
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:51,480
I bet I don't have the answer to that.

2777
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:55,840
Why is Apple called Apple?

2778
02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:57,960
You will see that.

2779
02:22:57,960 --> 02:22:59,840
But does this make sense?

2780
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,080
Does this make sense?

2781
02:23:02,120 --> 02:23:02,680
Okay.

2782
02:23:02,680 --> 02:23:03,920
Very simple. Right?

2783
02:23:03,920 --> 02:23:05,400
Very nice. And

2784
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:09,960
and this is what you're going to be
working with for the rest of the class.

2785
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:12,680
Okay, cool.

2786
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:17,240
Now I'm going to show you
my test automation framework

2787
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:20,520
to show you
how long these scenarios can be.

2788
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:24,520
Can so ignore what you're seeing here.

2789
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:25,280
Okay.

2790
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:29,960
I'm going to go to what
one of the files where we write these and

2791
02:23:31,760 --> 02:23:33,320
look at this.

2792
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:34,600
You see that

2793
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:37,360
this is a test case.

2794
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:38,560
Okay. Right.

2795
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:39,920
This is the scenario right here.

2796
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:42,280
This is the test case. Okay.

2797
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:44,680
And look
how many steps we have here, right?

2798
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:46,960
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2799
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:48,360
It's a lot of steps.

2800
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:50,480
It's a very big test case, guys.

2801
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:52,520
It's a robust automated test case.

2802
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:55,720
And notice for this test case,

2803
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:59,520
guys, we skipped
when we skipped the one statement

2804
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:02,600
we just said given and and and and

2805
02:24:02,600 --> 02:24:05,840
and and and and and and and so forth.

2806
02:24:05,960 --> 02:24:06,720
Right.

2807
02:24:07,120 --> 02:24:10,160
And then what is the expected result?

2808
02:24:10,160 --> 02:24:13,960
Then the eligibility questionnaire
is successfully submitted.

2809
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:16,640
Can we skip that. Yes.

2810
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:18,400
They're all Gerken. Right.

2811
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:22,520
One of the rules the rules is that it's
the first letter is capitalized.

2812
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:23,880
Right. Okay.

2813
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:28,920
And like I said, now you know how to use
given now you know how to use

2814
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:33,000
when you know when to use,
then the truth is that once

2815
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,320
you know how to use these terms,
you can break the rules where you see fit.

2816
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:40,080
You just have to make it sense.

2817
02:24:40,760 --> 02:24:42,960
Okay, Does that make sense? So everyone

2818
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:46,600
you can say something like

2819
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:49,280
given the user is on this page,

2820
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:52,720
but is using Firefox browser,

2821
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:56,600
you know, or something that it's you just,
you know,

2822
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:58,400
that's fine.

2823
02:24:58,400 --> 02:24:59,920
Just just make it make sense.

2824
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:02,160
The whole point is that you can use it.

2825
02:25:02,160 --> 02:25:02,600
Okay?

2826
02:25:02,600 --> 02:25:06,880
It's not really used that often,
but if you want to use it, go for it.

2827
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:11,400
Okay, cool.

2828
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:14,040
Does that, does that make sense?

2829
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:16,600
That's and to show you an example

2830
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:19,600
of what an automated test looks like,
it looks like this.

2831
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:23,520
Okay There is this application

2832
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:25,600
that I showed you,
the one that I was demoing to you.

2833
02:25:26,200 --> 02:25:26,600
Okay.

2834
02:25:26,600 --> 02:25:30,080
And the form is very,
very, very long to show.

2835
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:33,040
It's huge. It's humongous.

2836
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:34,320
Okay.

2837
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:38,920
And let's see if it let's see if it works.

2838
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:40,880
I don't know if it's going to work,
but we'll see.

2839
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:42,240
Let's give it a shot. What do you say?

2840
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:43,760
Give it a shot.

2841
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,320
Don't worry. Don't, don't, don't.

2842
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:46,560
Don't be focused on what I'm doing.

2843
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:49,600
I just want you to see what automation is.

2844
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:50,840
Okay?

2845
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:55,920
So let's see.

2846
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:59,280
There you go. And

2847
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:02,360
that's the can you see?

2848
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:06,000
You can automate things to work
however you see fit to watch.

2849
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,280
Watch this. Right.

2850
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:08,800
I'm going to run this test.

2851
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:09,800
Okay.

2852
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:14,880
And it's going to open right?

2853
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:17,800
It's going to open.
What's happening? It's opening Chrome.

2854
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:19,600
I'm not doing anything right.

2855
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:22,120
It's going to a URL.
I'm not doing anything.

2856
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:23,280
It's logging in.

2857
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:25,400
I'm not doing anything right.

2858
02:26:25,400 --> 02:26:27,720
I'm not doing absolutely anything.

2859
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:30,040
But it's it's doing what it has to do.

2860
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:31,360
Okay?

2861
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:33,480
It's loading. It's doing stuff.

2862
02:26:33,480 --> 02:26:35,520
It's me not anything.

2863
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:37,640
Right? Anything,
anything, anything. Right.

2864
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:40,000
And to show you even more right.

2865
02:26:40,400 --> 02:26:41,600
Is this okay?

2866
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,400
I know that what's happened so fast,
but you see how fast I was.

2867
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:45,600
You see how fast I was?

2868
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:48,360
That was, like, right blazing fast right.

2869
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:49,520
Now, watch this.

2870
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:51,680
If I run, this whole desk is right.

2871
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:53,480
It's going to be like this.

2872
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:55,600
I'm going to run this test.
Watch this. Right.

2873
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:59,040
So it's going to it's going to open up
and let's see if it works.

2874
02:26:59,240 --> 02:27:01,480
Okay. So it's going to go.

2875
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:05,760
And this is the website that I showed you
in test environment, not prod.

2876
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:06,120
Right.

2877
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:08,760
Because we don't doesn't
provide some logging in.

2878
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:09,960
Right.

2879
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:11,400
Passing this information.

2880
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:13,640
And it's not working right now
because we've got to do some other stuff.

2881
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,720
But the whole point is that

2882
02:27:17,520 --> 02:27:20,360
now you see how everything is is working.

2883
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:21,040
Okay.

2884
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:24,040
Does that make sense, guys?

2885
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:26,240
Okay. Yeah.

2886
02:27:26,880 --> 02:27:29,680
Someone said, Where's the code?

2887
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:30,080
Yikes.

2888
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:32,120
I Don't want to show you
the code. You're going to get scared.

2889
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:34,520
But the code is all of this
to do all of that?

2890
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:36,000
It's all this code that we wrote.

2891
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,560
Everything Java, right? Everything.

2892
02:27:37,560 --> 02:27:38,440
Everything, everything.

2893
02:27:38,440 --> 02:27:41,320
Java, everything, everything. Java.

2894
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:45,360
And you guys will know how to write
and learn how to write beautiful programs

2895
02:27:45,360 --> 02:27:47,520
like this. Okay, cool.

2896
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:49,000
All right.

2897
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:51,560
So point is, that is cucumber.

2898
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:54,360
Now we are going to

2899
02:27:56,600 --> 02:27:59,160
write our own cucumber scenarios.

2900
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:02,280
Okay, So the cool thing is

2901
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:06,720
we actually have a task.

2902
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:09,000
Another task. Okay.

2903
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,360
And you guys are going to write
a cucumber scenario

2904
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:17,920
for this,
except The criteria right here can

2905
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:21,760
the same
one, the same task is that you wrote,

2906
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:25,320
but this is that
this is what you're going to

2907
02:28:27,720 --> 02:28:28,240
to do.

2908
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:31,560
So second, this is the acceptance

2909
02:28:31,560 --> 02:28:34,880
criteria.

2910
02:28:34,880 --> 02:28:40,280
Acceptance criteria.

2911
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:46,240
I've seen them and I should be able to log
in to a syntax.

2912
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:50,560
HMS Oh, give me a second
I think I know why that didn't work.

2913
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:55,240
That's when I see something.

2914
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:58,040
Oh, now it's going to work.
So not automated testing.

2915
02:28:58,040 --> 02:28:59,480
I was running, so check it out. Right.

2916
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:01,600
So if I do this

2917
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:06,280
and if I run this, this is essentially
the power of automation, right?

2918
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:09,720
A form that would take us like
about 30 minutes to fill.

2919
02:29:09,720 --> 02:29:11,720
That's 30 minutes, Right.

2920
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:13,600
30, 30, 30 minutes.

2921
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:16,560
So what happens
is it can look at the screen.

2922
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:17,720
Right?

2923
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:20,920
And again,
the whole point of this is to show you

2924
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:23,880
like the importance of cucumbers and those
that's all you're going to be doing.

2925
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:25,320
Okay.

2926
02:29:25,440 --> 02:29:27,760
You see what's this long form test.

2927
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:29,720
So this is a very long form.

2928
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:31,680
It's completing very, very fast.

2929
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:36,880
We're filling out right, selecting
like data bars, everything, entering data,

2930
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:41,040
verifying information, selecting
checkboxes, dropdowns, everything.

2931
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:42,000
Right.

2932
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,080
All of this you see how fast is going.

2933
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:48,360
You see like it's entering
this information, this data.

2934
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:49,400
Right?

2935
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,840
This is exactly.

2936
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:54,240
Look at that. Right?

2937
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:56,160
Bam, That's it.

2938
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:57,600
And then done.

2939
02:29:58,080 --> 02:29:58,920
That's it.

2940
02:29:59,080 --> 02:29:59,800
Okay.

2941
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:02,800
So that is automation, right?

2942
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:04,320
And every single time

2943
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:08,080
we would run that test case,
it would take us about 20 to 25 minutes.

2944
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:09,880
And how long did that take?

2945
02:30:09,880 --> 02:30:13,120
It says right here, 48 seconds,

2946
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:15,920
48.80 2 seconds.

2947
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:16,960
Okay.

2948
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:20,000
Okay. So

2949
02:30:20,200 --> 02:30:21,360
that is what you'll be doing.

2950
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:22,920
But again, cucumber scenarios.

2951
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:26,720
Now, this is the acceptance criterion
that I want you to read.

2952
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:27,800
I want you to write.

2953
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:29,960
Oh, and by the way,
the credentials are here.

2954
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:31,800
Okay?

2955
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:37,400
The credentials are here.

2956
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:40,800
Okay. Hold on.

2957
02:30:40,800 --> 02:30:42,360
This is the username.

2958
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:47,640
Actually, a lot on

2959
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:51,560
this is the username

2960
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:55,280
and this is the password.

2961
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,160
So let's see.

2962
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:59,040
So cucumber scenarios

2963
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:02,800
ran along or before writing code
before you write your code

2964
02:31:02,880 --> 02:31:06,960
because they can work with
they can work as your manual test cases

2965
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:10,440
and whenever it's ready to be automated,
all you do is basically

2966
02:31:10,440 --> 02:31:11,880
plug it in your framework and that's it.

2967
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:14,240
And that all you will learn
about Don't worry

2968
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:16,560
about how long it takes
to read your stuff.

2969
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:19,640
It could take a while
sometimes, depending. So

2970
02:31:20,680 --> 02:31:22,920
the task for you guys is this

2971
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:24,920
okay?

2972
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:27,960
The task is to write a cucumber scenario.

2973
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:31,320
Okay. That's right.

2974
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:33,360
A cucumber

2975
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:37,200
scenario or the acceptance criteria

2976
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:40,160
for the acceptance criteria of

2977
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:45,680
criteria pool.

2978
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:47,040
Okay. Yes.

2979
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:49,840
We're going to do it right now. Okay.

2980
02:31:49,840 --> 02:31:50,520
So ready?

2981
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:52,680
It should take you. I'm going
to give you like 10 minutes.

2982
02:31:52,680 --> 02:31:53,920
This is very simple one.

2983
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:58,080
So 940, we should be done.

2984
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:00,960
So go ahead and get started

2985
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:04,680
on. Go ahead and get started.

2986
02:32:04,680 --> 02:32:21,520
And you guys. No,

2987
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:23,400
no, no, no.

2988
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:26,240
Just in words. Anywhere is fine.

2989
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:29,320
Like you could just notepad at the end.

2990
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:31,400
Just going to need to see a screenshot.

2991
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:40,560
Okay, You can write it in Microsoft Word.

2992
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:43,320
You can write this on Notepad.

2993
02:32:43,320 --> 02:32:46,000
Does anyone have questions

2994
02:32:53,160 --> 02:32:54,560
or steps?

2995
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:58,360
No, they're not.

2996
02:32:58,360 --> 02:33:17,400
They're not.

2997
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:18,840
Can you please open the sample?

2998
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:22,200
What sample?

2999
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:23,880
The one that I wrote. It's right here.

3000
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:26,880
It's above here.

3001
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:27,800
You said

3002
02:33:28,400 --> 02:33:31,320
this is the example.

3003
02:33:31,320 --> 02:33:32,200
Keep in mind.

3004
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:35,240
And I want to see and there's basically
I just want to see how you write them.

3005
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:39,600
You can write them how you want to you can
use given when, then you can throw some.

3006
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:41,200
And in there, that's fine.

3007
02:33:41,200 --> 02:33:47,160
I want to see I want to see how creative
you can be with this.

3008
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:49,160
This is an example.

3009
02:33:49,160 --> 02:33:51,640
What what other scenario are you
are you writing?

3010
02:33:52,400 --> 02:33:54,680
What do you what are you referring to?

3011
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:56,320
I sure

3012
02:33:58,440 --> 02:33:59,640
there's a lot there's a lot of stuff

3013
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:06,320
that I wrote here.

3014
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:13,560
Take a screenshot, please,
so I can scroll down.

3015
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:16,800
Okay, let's see.

3016
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:19,080
Let's see how many of you guys are

3017
02:34:19,120 --> 02:34:21,280
and it's fine now
and you're going to have the same thing.

3018
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:22,080
Well, let's see.

3019
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:25,000
The mirror says given a user is on. Okay.

3020
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:27,840
And username and interest password.

3021
02:34:28,920 --> 02:34:29,880
Beautiful.

3022
02:34:30,960 --> 02:34:31,520
Beautiful.

3023
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:32,480
Well done.

3024
02:34:33,240 --> 02:34:35,280
Marion from Maryland says

3025
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:39,720
given the admin is on the. Yes.

3026
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:40,920
Oh hold on.

3027
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:44,240
When the user enters
the valid username and password,

3028
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:48,520
then in that statement
you don't need to say

3029
02:34:48,520 --> 02:34:52,800
the next two statements where you say
an interest admin for username and enter.

3030
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:55,120
Is that for password?

3031
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:59,160
You can delete step number two
and keep the other two steps if you want.

3032
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:01,200
Marianne Yeah, it's redundant.

3033
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:02,240
Beautiful man.

3034
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:06,560
Man, you are like on fire today,
you know that.

3035
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:08,280
This is amazing stuff.

3036
02:35:08,280 --> 02:35:10,760
I think really going to market thing.

3037
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:14,080
You ready?

3038
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:16,800
So Allen says

3039
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:19,200
given a user's at the website

3040
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:23,640
and the user and then so just name Yes

3041
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:30,040
change that last

3042
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:32,000
the second to last that

3043
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:35,280
Allen changed it to when the user clicks

3044
02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:37,400
the log in but

3045
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:40,120
then the dashboard page
should be displayed

3046
02:35:41,360 --> 02:35:43,320
Allen says given

3047
02:35:43,320 --> 02:35:47,160
welcome Daniels given very good
that's a user of the first step

3048
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:50,760
doesn't make sense Alina I mean given

3049
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:53,920
valid credentials user is on the

3050
02:35:57,880 --> 02:36:00,360
you can use a given user's on this

3051
02:36:00,360 --> 02:36:03,000
and that's when the user logs in
with my credentials. Yeah

3052
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:07,080
Emilia says

3053
02:36:07,080 --> 02:36:09,120
given a user's in the syntax when the

3054
02:36:09,440 --> 02:36:12,320
when the user logs in

3055
02:36:12,320 --> 02:36:14,760
with provided username and password

3056
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:16,080
wonderful

3057
02:36:18,360 --> 02:36:21,840
lazy user
like given your and clicks username.

3058
02:36:22,040 --> 02:36:22,320
Okay.

3059
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:24,120
So right,

3060
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:26,240
let's have a discussion right now
because I've been seeing this

3061
02:36:26,520 --> 02:36:30,080
and this is the first batch
I see this happening but you got someone

3062
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:33,720
you guys are saying
and clicks on the textbox feel.

3063
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:37,640
Why are you clicking there?

3064
02:36:37,640 --> 02:36:39,400
You don't you don't need to say that.

3065
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:42,960
You don't need to see that.

3066
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:46,000
So if you if you have anywhere
in your scenario that you click

3067
02:36:46,280 --> 02:36:47,600
using the where you click on password,

3068
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:50,600
then delete that
because you don't need to click on it.

3069
02:36:50,600 --> 02:36:53,480
You either says given user

3070
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:56,800
have syntax and goes to log logging page

3071
02:36:57,960 --> 02:36:59,880
when user clicks. Okay.

3072
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:01,640
User Yes. Clear.

3073
02:37:01,640 --> 02:37:05,840
You know, not that at all.

3074
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:09,120
Doing admin logged into CentOS
when the user is

3075
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:13,360
when the admin.

3076
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:15,760
Oh, so Ahmed from Istanbul.

3077
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:19,560
So here's the thing with this
this is almost very good.

3078
02:37:19,800 --> 02:37:24,240
But you're saying when that admin enters
valid credentials on the login page

3079
02:37:24,880 --> 02:37:28,280
but you're not saying that
they're logging in,

3080
02:37:29,120 --> 02:37:29,960
you know,

3081
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:32,800
does that make sense?

3082
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:34,880
You kind of need to specify that somewhere

3083
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:37,040
remain.

3084
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:41,120
Amani from one version is given user
navigates log in page

3085
02:37:41,640 --> 02:37:44,560
when the user selects forgot
password option.

3086
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,760
So why are you forgetting password

3087
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:48,920
remain?

3088
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:49,800
Are you there?

3089
02:37:50,880 --> 02:37:52,760
Does the acceptance criteria remain?

3090
02:37:52,760 --> 02:38:08,680
Say anything about forgot password
or anything like that?

3091
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:12,840
Abdul says As an admin,
I should be able to log into syntax h.r.

3092
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:15,720
Mess with valid credentials as

3093
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:25,240
so Abdul Shinwari from Gainesville.

3094
02:38:25,960 --> 02:38:29,040
Your first step given thus
the acceptance criteria does

3095
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:32,240
not what you're stuff should be

3096
02:38:33,360 --> 02:38:34,680
format

3097
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:45,320
format.

3098
02:38:45,320 --> 02:38:49,440
Your first step doesn't make sense,
but the rest everything is good

3099
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:53,880
in the build
says given and the admin into its user

3100
02:38:53,880 --> 02:38:56,280
and the admin just passwords us

3101
02:38:56,280 --> 02:38:59,320
so on the build
right after your third step when you say

3102
02:38:59,320 --> 02:39:02,880
and the admin enters the password,
then you're saying

3103
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:04,520
then the admin should be logged in.

3104
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:06,280
I'm pretty sure
they have to click on log in.

3105
02:39:06,280 --> 02:39:07,320
But right.

3106
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:09,440
So you have to, you have to specify that

3107
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:11,120
just SEAL

3108
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:15,120
says given a user and enters
the username. Yes.

3109
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:16,080
Very good.

3110
02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:16,960
Just seal.

3111
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:19,040
Are you there just support two for two.

3112
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:22,440
You. Very good stuff

3113
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:27,040
given user is on the syntax h.r.

3114
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:27,520
As well.

3115
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:30,200
Conventions and enters the username admin

3116
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,360
given users with valid credentials.

3117
02:39:35,360 --> 02:39:36,720
The user. Very good.

3118
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:37,440
Not bad.

3119
02:39:37,440 --> 02:39:41,640
Arwa arwa out for the of monthly

3120
02:39:41,640 --> 02:39:43,280
from the inside of

3121
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:48,440
not says

3122
02:39:56,600 --> 02:39:57,440
hand up there.

3123
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:59,520
Your scenario doesn't really make sense.

3124
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:02,960
Same when the admin logs in

3125
02:40:03,480 --> 02:40:07,120
with valid credentials
and asks the username and password.

3126
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:09,760
That doesn't really make sense.

3127
02:40:11,360 --> 02:40:13,560
Joseph from Maryland says

3128
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:17,280
giving users when the enters in the user
interest password.

3129
02:40:17,320 --> 02:40:19,560
Yes, very good.

3130
02:40:20,080 --> 02:40:21,240
Very good.

3131
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:24,120
Ramon.

3132
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:27,120
Ramon.

3133
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:29,160
Given a user

3134
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:33,840
when the user puts the data insecure
respectfully.

3135
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:35,120
Okay Ramon.

3136
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:38,000
That information, that data
that you have there for username

3137
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:41,560
and password, that's more information
that should go with your second step.

3138
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:42,840
Okay.

3139
02:40:43,080 --> 02:40:46,200
Rather than your first one.

3140
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:51,280
Lubo says given the user's senses
and then it just password.

3141
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:53,240
Password.
The user clicks on. Yes. Very good.

3142
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:56,040
Good job.

3143
02:40:56,040 --> 02:40:58,920
Lubo Denis from Brooklyn

3144
02:41:00,280 --> 02:41:10,720
says Given.

3145
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:11,520
Okay,

3146
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:21,920
interesting.

3147
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:22,440
Simon.

3148
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:28,000
Good,

3149
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:39,240
Good. Yes.

3150
02:41:39,240 --> 02:41:40,680
Mohammed from games.

3151
02:41:40,680 --> 02:41:43,560
Mohamed al-Fadhli Very good. Much better.

3152
02:41:44,240 --> 02:41:46,120
You make it easier for yourself that way.

3153
02:41:46,120 --> 02:41:51,840
You need to be saying
like and clicks on this God and stop.

3154
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:59,000
Sorry, He says, Sorry, you shouldn't have.

3155
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:03,120
You're giving us your acceptance criteria.

3156
02:42:03,160 --> 02:42:07,800
Zemo from talks in Arizona says
Given the admin, when the user answers

3157
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:11,840
and answers and then when the user enters
the valid credentials, okay? Zuma

3158
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:14,720
from and are you there?

3159
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:18,720
So Zuma, if you are there,

3160
02:42:19,760 --> 02:42:21,120
look at your scenario.

3161
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:24,360
You're saying when the user enters
the valid credentials,

3162
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:28,080
but then you're repeating it again
and the next two steps.

3163
02:42:28,520 --> 02:42:32,080
So decide what you want to keep.

3164
02:42:32,080 --> 02:42:33,520
Nikolai did

3165
02:42:34,040 --> 02:42:36,000
given user lender

3166
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:39,160
when user enters
no credentials and presses enter

3167
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:43,680
okay so that's that's okay I'll take it.

3168
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:46,560
But we're clicking right Nikolai We're not

3169
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:49,320
we're not clicking we're not pressing.

3170
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:53,920
Enter on the keyboard.

3171
02:42:53,920 --> 02:42:56,280
Very good. Mustafa from Gainesville.

3172
02:42:56,280 --> 02:42:59,280
Very good to see tomorrow

3173
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:06,960
you can say to Mona

3174
02:43:06,960 --> 02:43:11,600
for your second step
when user enters username and password

3175
02:43:12,120 --> 02:43:15,320
and clicks on login button,
then users should be logged.

3176
02:43:15,320 --> 02:43:15,840
Right?

3177
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:19,240
Make it make sense

3178
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:24,960
that nyah nyah says Now are you there now?

3179
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:29,760
I says given
and then then the user enters.

3180
02:43:30,040 --> 02:43:33,000
So you want to change your
then statements, right?

3181
02:43:33,360 --> 02:43:36,200
You want to say given an should

3182
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:38,160
given an admin

3183
02:43:39,480 --> 02:43:41,040
is on the syntax h.r.

3184
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:41,920
As page.

3185
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:46,240
When the user enters
this and the user and enters

3186
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:50,960
this password for this,
then the user right on logging button. So

3187
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:56,640
go given the given

3188
02:43:57,600 --> 02:44:00,520
a syntax h.r.

3189
02:44:00,680 --> 02:44:04,560
This admin is on the syntax

3190
02:44:05,240 --> 02:44:06,920
h on the

3191
02:44:09,320 --> 02:44:11,160
login page

3192
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:16,920
and enters

3193
02:44:16,920 --> 02:44:20,160
the username and username textbox.

3194
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:23,960
You textbox

3195
02:44:23,960 --> 02:44:27,040
and enter password

3196
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:31,800
and password textbox.

3197
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:33,000
Right.

3198
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:36,600
TextBox and clicks.

3199
02:44:38,280 --> 02:44:40,320
Clicks on the log in.

3200
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:40,960
Right.

3201
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:44,120
Log in and

3202
02:44:46,360 --> 02:44:47,200
home page

3203
02:44:47,200 --> 02:44:52,560
then syntax hms syntax page on this page,
this place.

3204
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:56,640
That's me writing this scenario,
which is a little too detailed.

3205
02:44:56,880 --> 02:44:57,400
Right?

3206
02:44:57,400 --> 02:45:00,280
Because you can literally rewrite
this in there to look like this.

3207
02:45:00,760 --> 02:45:03,440
Look, given a syntax determines

3208
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:06,720
admin is on
the syntax from is log in page right.

3209
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:10,160
And the user name
I'm going to say example one.

3210
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:13,160
Example one.

3211
02:45:13,160 --> 02:45:13,680
Okay.

3212
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:16,080
I'm going to say this. Okay.

3213
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:17,600
Okay.

3214
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:21,600
An example to go to would be here.

3215
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:24,320
So I'm going to reuse this step.

3216
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:26,600
I'm going to say given a syntax h.r.

3217
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:28,120
As admin is on the syntax

3218
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:31,440
h1 result information on a copy
this i'm going to pasted here.

3219
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:32,560
Okay.

3220
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:35,200
And the username look, check this out.

3221
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:35,480
Right.

3222
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:37,360
You guys watching.

3223
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:41,200
So check this out
and insert username and username textbox

3224
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:44,280
and enter password
password textbox and clicks on log.

3225
02:45:44,280 --> 02:45:44,920
Right.

3226
02:45:45,040 --> 02:45:49,120
I'm just going to store this all into a
when a

3227
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:54,840
when the admin logs in right.

3228
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:57,200
That's all I have to do, right.

3229
02:45:57,200 --> 02:46:00,880
When the admin logs in
and I'll just copy this last step.

3230
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:02,200
Look, you see this.

3231
02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:04,440
So basically this right here,

3232
02:46:05,160 --> 02:46:08,640
this example right here is me
being a little bit more detailed.

3233
02:46:09,160 --> 02:46:13,640
And this scenario down here
is the exact same thing

3234
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:17,120
as this up here, but just shorter.

3235
02:46:17,120 --> 02:46:18,960
And it also makes sense.

3236
02:46:18,960 --> 02:46:20,800
Does that make sense, guys?

3237
02:46:21,080 --> 02:46:23,880
Does that make sense,

3238
02:46:23,880 --> 02:46:26,160
for example, to I'm going to say

3239
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:30,480
much better, but

3240
02:46:31,640 --> 02:46:35,000
would it be correct to use
and instead of one at the pass?

3241
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:36,080
It depends.

3242
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:37,080
It really depends.

3243
02:46:37,080 --> 02:46:39,120
It just has to make sense.

3244
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:44,880
Let's see Gerald Hicks sent this.

3245
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:46,160
Where's your given statement,

3246
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:47,480
Gerald?

3247
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:51,360
I don't see it.

3248
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:59,760
I don't see the given set statement.

3249
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:03,960
I don't see the given statement.

3250
02:47:03,960 --> 02:47:06,160
So does this make sense, guys?

3251
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:10,360
Does this make sense?

3252
02:47:10,360 --> 02:47:14,560
All right, Very,
very good, Gerald, Just send me that.

3253
02:47:14,760 --> 02:47:17,000
You don't have a given statement there,
okay?

3254
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,640
You need it, guys.

3255
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:24,160
First of all, random applause
because you guys actually

3256
02:47:24,160 --> 02:47:28,200
wrote your first cucumber scenarios,
your first of many.

3257
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:31,040
So give yourselves a round of applause.

3258
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:33,720
Okay? Yes.

3259
02:47:33,960 --> 02:47:34,480
Method.

3260
02:47:34,480 --> 02:47:36,840
It's good practice
to do so all the time. Right.

3261
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:39,160
So give yourselves that.

3262
02:47:39,160 --> 02:47:40,720
We have to put thoughts at the end of it.

3263
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,760
No, you don't. Why you don't to

3264
02:47:44,040 --> 02:47:44,520
Okay.

3265
02:47:44,520 --> 02:47:46,560
Simple and effective, right?

3266
02:47:46,680 --> 02:47:49,320
That's it. Plain and simple.

3267
02:47:49,320 --> 02:47:49,920
Okay.

3268
02:47:49,920 --> 02:47:52,880
That's all we have to do.

3269
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:55,560
So congratulations.

3270
02:47:55,680 --> 02:47:57,280
That was the first of many, again,

3271
02:47:57,280 --> 02:48:00,160
that you're getting new to this
you're using as your first time.

3272
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:03,000
But you guys are going to be masters
at this.

3273
02:48:03,360 --> 02:48:05,800
Okay. Very, very, very soon.

3274
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:06,800
Okay.

3275
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:09,240
Especially when it comes to automation.

3276
02:48:09,240 --> 02:48:10,680
This is all you're going to be doing.

3277
02:48:10,680 --> 02:48:13,480
Everything is going to be nature. Got

3278
02:48:14,520 --> 02:48:15,200
cool.

3279
02:48:15,960 --> 02:48:16,440
All right, guys.

3280
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:18,240
So do we have any questions?

3281
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:21,000
You guys did a very good job today.

3282
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,680
I think I, I,

3283
02:48:23,680 --> 02:48:24,840
I did.

3284
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:29,400
I threw a lot of information to you today,
so I'm going to end class right now.

3285
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:31,960
You guys deserve to.

3286
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:35,120
And early go.

3287
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:37,320
And do you guys have any questions?

3288
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:39,480
Very good job.

3289
02:48:39,480 --> 02:48:41,640
You guys are doing great.

3290
02:48:42,200 --> 02:48:42,560
Okay.

3291
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:45,840
And if you don't any questions,
then prepare for tomorrow

3292
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:48,320
because tomorrow
is going to be a very heavy class.

3293
02:48:48,960 --> 02:48:52,840
So cool, cool.

3294
02:48:53,560 --> 02:48:57,400
So yup.

3295
02:48:57,560 --> 02:48:59,840
Thanks. So don't worry about homework.

3296
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:01,080
I'm not assigning homework.

3297
02:49:01,080 --> 02:49:04,720
I just want to go to sleep and just forget
about class for a little bit.

3298
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,160
And tomorrow we're going hit classes hard.

3299
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:10,760
And then tomorrow I will also assign
I will also assign homework.

3300
02:49:11,280 --> 02:49:12,000
Cool.

3301
02:49:12,280 --> 02:49:15,320
As of right now,
just go play with your kids or something.

3302
02:49:15,360 --> 02:49:21,400
You know,
I think everybody here has kids, so.

3303
02:49:21,400 --> 02:49:25,400
So user giving users directive.

3304
02:49:26,640 --> 02:49:27,320
General, we need to

3305
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:30,520
work on our on our statements
a little more, but I'll help with that.

3306
02:49:30,520 --> 02:49:31,080
Okay.

3307
02:49:31,800 --> 02:49:33,800
Drop the words.

3308
02:49:34,680 --> 02:49:40,920
Yes, I will upload the notes.

3309
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:43,520
All right, guys. So

3310
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:47,560
yup, yup, yup.

3311
02:49:47,560 --> 02:49:48,120
Sure.

3312
02:49:48,120 --> 02:49:48,520
All right.

3313
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:52,240
Well, I hope congratulations now for that.

3314
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:55,920
So have a good night, guys,
and let me know if you have any questions.

3315
02:49:55,920 --> 02:50:02,200
Go see.
