1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,520
I could not find Willard.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,120
Yes, it is possible.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,960
It is possible.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,600
Two types of functions
in this field, right?

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,200
What are these two types?

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:29,520
Guys?

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,520
Relational

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,080
and non relational.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,400
Great answer, but.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,560
Great. Great.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,160
You guys.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,040
You guys are great.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,120
You see, you guys just start following.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,520
Without thinking, then wonder why
you said relational and orderliness.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,880
And you.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,720
They are single door and multi-role.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,560
These are the types of databases
that you guys are telling.

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,920
Relational are non relational.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,000
Guys, it's almost fine.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,200
Please, please, please

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,440
control your emotions

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,360
and think before you speak because

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,520
you guys will be playing a very,

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,560
very important role on your jobs.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,280
Your your whatever you say, it will matter
a lot.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,880
Companies will be taking decisions
based on what you see.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,480
So you guys will be taking you guys
will be part of many important decisions.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,640
So please think about it

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:46,920
then before you speak.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
One wrong decision

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,200
can affect your company very,
very negatively.

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,320
Believe me.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,880
So there are two types of functions.

34
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,640
I was picking my classmates. Yes.

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,120
After class when available,
please share the recording.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,720
What do you do?

37
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
I mean, you are in the class as well.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,760
Still,
you need the recording before anyone

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
for who I am recording

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,000
so desperately.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,320
I mean, usually the weaker classes,
the instructors, they also because

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,720
we are also following the same

43
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,240
same schedule as a few.

44
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,920
So we also go to sleep
right after the class on weekdays

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,040
and we try to share the recordings
next week.

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,040
But if someone is awake,
some of the instructors,

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,440
then they can definitely share
the recordings.

48
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,320
Otherwise
every every employee of the syntax, then

49
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,240
they follow the same schedule
to follow the Eastern Time.

50
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,400
So what time it
is really right now for you?

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
I think it must be like

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,000
three four in

53
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,520
midnight, Three more.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,200
What are you doing with 9 p.m.?

55
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,280
Go to sleep, man.

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,480
I would share the recording.

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,920
Please go to sleep.

58
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,320
You have some lights.

59
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,960
So there are two types of functions

60
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,280
in, you know, for Alexa year 2:10 a.m..

61
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,120
That's great.

62
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,400
I hope all of your efforts did bear
fruit very, very soon.

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,800
We wanted to make sure you would not be

64
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,880
so two types of functions
multi role and single role.

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,160
But what are single role functions?

66
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:55,640
Days.

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,280
Alexa Just make sure my calls.

68
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,960
They have food and water
and they look good

69
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,160
and then you can go to sleep.

70
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,800
Return one result.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,000
Patrol one.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Deserted patrol.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,800
They take one role as input

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,640
and return one role as output.

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,920
Pride.

76
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,240
So for each role
they will be returning a result.

77
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,920
And what about the multiple functions base

78
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,800
multi role functions take

79
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,120
multiple roles as input

80
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,760
and give a single role as output.

81
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,520
Right?

82
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,920
Can you guys give me some examples
of single role

83
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:05,400
functions, salary, salary,
the single role function?

84
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,560
Or are you feeling okay today?

85
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,000
Case case

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,320
uppercase right
count is count a single role

87
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,800
function guys

88
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,320
know it's a multi role function.

89
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,280
Right?

90
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,960
And can you guys
also give me some examples

91
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,200
for multiple functions

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
some I think you left

93
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,400
I shall now picking upon me

94
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,080
and yes guys

95
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,560
see if you guys here that I was

96
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,400
I some day
suddenly I disappear from syntax

97
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,480
and the police tell the police that

98
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,200
uh, do check with Aisha.

99
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,480
Maybe she has kidnaped me or paid me

100
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,600
for having those jokes right.

101
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,600
So these are single role functions.

102
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,280
They take

103
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,360
a single role

104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,720
as input and produce
a single role as output.

105
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,720
The multi role functions,
they take multiple roles

106
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:49,120
as input and produce
a single output value.

107
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
So these are some of the examples
of single role functions

108
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,280
like converting the

109
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:05,760
candidate to uppercase or lowercase. Yes.

110
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,880
And are these functions they universalize

111
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,760
like Alexa, for example,
if I using a function on my school

112
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,080
database,
let's say may be this init function, will

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,000
I see the same function
on all the databases?

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,960
Or it is possible
that the function names can differ

115
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,040
or some of the functions can be missing on

116
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,280
some of the databases.

117
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,040
They can differ, right?

118
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,240
So totally depends on the company

119
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,960
who has developed
the ADD specific database.

120
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,120
If they are using the same names
for the functions,

121
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,560
there are high chances
that the function will be available.

122
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,600
It might just have a different name

123
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,280
or it to functions might be combined

124
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,680
in to a single function
that will perform the things for you.

125
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,120
So you can always Google

126
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,960
for those
functionality inside those databases.

127
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:22,240
On Google
or you can read the documentation.

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,440
Then we discussed the group by clause.

129
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,360
Right? Very, very important.

130
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,480
So what is this group by cloud guys?

131
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,800
What does this group class to

132
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,320
a collection of that.

133
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,120
Okay.

134
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,960
A collection of data

135
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,640
grouping
that it's kind of groups the guilty

136
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,000
by column

137
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:13,880
or were there

138
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,800
some homework questions
related to class there?

139
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,760
They share some questions
related to good or bad class.

140
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,680
I think one yes.

141
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,360
Groups the data, according to the column
we pass to interact in groups

142
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,000
that are why column name.

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,400
So let's see.

144
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,360
We have a table in which we have employers

145
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,840
only columns,

146
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:27,680
not the rows.

147
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,680
So Silva is saying
does it only group that are based on

148
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,720
columns, not paroles.

149
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,160
Then you guys

150
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,160
answer our question.

151
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:58,560
So let's say guys.

152
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,080
So I have this job title

153
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:11,040
pulled in here right?

154
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:19,600
Is it readable now, guys?

155
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,480
I think it groups the rows
that have the same values.

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,520
Yes. I one other.

157
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,680
So let's say, guys, these job titles,
they are actually IDs that

158
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,320
that represent a job in another table.

159
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,200
Right.

160
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,120
So if I want to count

161
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,480
how many employees have job I did 23.

162
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,320
Can you guys quickly
write like you do for that.

163
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,000
I want to count
how many employees have job title board?

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,720
23. How many of them have job title one.

165
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,480
How many of them have job 208 25
and things like that.

166
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,320
Google

167
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,640
copycat.

168
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,680
Can you guys quickly
articulate you for that

169
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,400
or. I'm not.

170
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,280
I mean, for all of the job titles,
I want to know they count

171
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:58,760
for all of the job titles.

172
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,880
I am seeing a different table.

173
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,560
I think

174
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,760
this one moment this

175
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,400
as such are employed
and you see a different paper.

176
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,400
You mean different data in at this table

177
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,760
you to see

178
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,240
And do you guys also see different data

179
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,560
where it seems okay,

180
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,200
great.

181
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,840
So if I want to count,

182
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,320
I can see.

183
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,600
So first I need to specify the column

184
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,360
based on which I want to count

185
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,960
the number of employees.

186
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,240
Right?

187
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,920
So I want to count
based on the job title code.

188
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,120
So after specifying the column

189
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,960
based
on which I want to create the groups,

190
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,560
then I specify what kind of operation,
what kind of aggregate function,

191
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,560
what kind of multi-tier function
I want to apply to those values.

192
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,920
Right?

193
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,800
So so

194
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,920
in here I am simply I simply want to count

195
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,080
the number of employees

196
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,280
in that have same job title

197
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,480
Core five.

198
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,240
Then the table name

199
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,000
and that's it.

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,480
Right?

201
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,640
And my writing,
the correct duty guys, we like to

202
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,160
correct results

203
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,400
grew by it.

204
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,920
I am missing group by
and some of the databases

205
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,600
they will throw an error

206
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,160
if we are trying to use
a multi row function

207
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,040
without material function
with a column name or with a single real

208
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,800
function because multiple functions
they produce a single output

209
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,720
while the single row function
they produce many, many different outputs.

210
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,640
They can produce a for each row
they can produce an output.

211
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,680
So that's why there will be a conflict
and some of their databases,

212
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,560
they will throw an error while
the other databases, they might simply

213
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,040
give you incorrect answers.

214
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,440
Is there a shortcut to execute
without selecting?

215
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,280
Yes, it's control and of.

216
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,600
So now it shows me that there are 97

217
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,960
employers who have died title to

218
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,920
34 employers that have job title ID,

219
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,160
36 employers that have job title.

220
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,920
And here like this.

221
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,240
So let me remove the column

222
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,360
based on which I want to go to by

223
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,480
and let me try to execute
the security again.

224
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,920
So sometimes you guys might want
to perform this type of grouping as well,

225
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,800
although it does not make much sense
because you only see the count

226
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,640
and you don't know
for which group discount,

227
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,920
which group this count is representing.

228
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,720
But today we will be discussing

229
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,120
disabilities in which we might need
to do these kind of things.

230
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,400
So it is also possible
that without specifying the column

231
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,520
based on which we are creating the groups,
we can still get

232
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,280
the results in here, right?

233
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,200
We can still go to buy things
without specifying it

234
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,880
inside the select clause.

235
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,800
And what if I let's say

236
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,560
I only want to see

237
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,120
those groups for which

238
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,000
there are at least

239
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,560
ten employees in that group.

240
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,200
Like, for example,
I only want to see those job titles

241
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,560
and their count,
for which there are at least

242
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,120
ten employees.

243
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,880
So for example,
I don't want to see this 8 to 7, this one,

244
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,360
this 511.

245
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,280
How can I remove these roles
from my results?

246
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
I don't want this 8718.

247
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:10,280
I only want from that count,
which is greater than ten.

248
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:10,560
Okay.

249
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:17,520
Can I use the we are plotting here.

250
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:32,600
Can I use the word clause in here?

251
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,920
No, we cannot use the
we have a clause in here for this purpose.

252
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,280
We have a special clause that is called

253
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,360
having clubs of eight

254
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
that operates on

255
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,200
multi role
functions of aggregate functions.

256
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,640
So having count

257
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,320
greater than

258
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:00,760
ten right.

259
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,680
So now I only see those

260
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,160
for which there are at least ten employees

261
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,360
in that group right.

262
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,040
Oh okay.

263
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,520
Yes. Yes.

264
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,680
Having

265
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,760
so I think you guys are now comfortable
with the group by clause.

266
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,240
Right.

267
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:45,160
Is there anyone who's confused about group
by clause.

268
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,520
Yeah.

269
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,080
I mean if any other than you,
it's fine for you.

270
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,680
Is it better to die?

271
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,280
The name for

272
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,120
it is better
to write the name of the table

273
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,600
and the columns in the upper case. Two.

274
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,880
Yes. Okay.

275
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,600
No. Elena is one of the in
all, almost all the matches

276
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,160
we have the most innocent student
in all the video.

277
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,520
So this batch has Elena as the most
innocent student group by clause.

278
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,720
Mercy verses having clause

279
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
where for single row having for multiple.

280
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,120
Yes you are right

281
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,680
group by clause versus having clause.

282
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,480
So you are asking
if there is any relationship

283
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,800
between group by clause and having clause.

284
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,040
So having clause is always used
whenever you have group by clause

285
00:20:47,040 --> 00:21:03,960
in your queries.

286
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,080
So it's one of the most
most popular interview questions.

287
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,600
What is the difference between very close
and having blood?

288
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,520
When I see the results for having

289
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,720
this one
dedicated that I have just executed

290
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,040
this one? Yes.

291
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:46,040
Did. So

292
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,200
let me check

293
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,160
with this same as mine.

294
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:20,280
Okay. Why?

295
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,720
I have a red line

296
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,320
because you are having a semicolon on line
number three.

297
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:40,480
Remove that semicolon.

298
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,600
So I you know,

299
00:22:42,240 --> 00:24:41,920
we have this table in here.

300
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,400
Are we following you for Excel?

301
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,920
Are. If you guys want to,
you can follow me.

302
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,480
Otherwise it is not required.

303
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,480
I am just using this scale to

304
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,760
teach you the concept of drawings.

305
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,280
If you guys want to follow me.

306
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:27,160
Yes, you can. Huh?

307
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,640
All right, guys.

308
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,200
And so before that.

309
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,560
So we were last last time we didn't
discuss the sub duties in detail.

310
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,680
So here is a question for you.

311
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,000
Not this one.

312
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,240
Can you guys write a query

313
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,000
to give me all those employers

314
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,800
which are having an age?

315
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,080
So first
I want you to calculate the average age,

316
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,080
and then I want you to only bring

317
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,200
those employers who have

318
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,000
age greater than the average age
inside this table,

319
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,600
average of the age.

320
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,120
So all those employees who have age
greater than the average age

321
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:40,240
that is present inside of the start table.

322
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,880
And you guys think of the query, the

323
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:59,480
Yep, yep.

324
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,200
One more time, please.

325
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,040
So I want all those employees

326
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,920
who have age

327
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,960
greater than the average age
that is present inside of this table.

328
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,360
No, no.

329
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,400
On just not not just the average age

330
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,720
still processing.

331
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,600
We are the core i7 of this class,

332
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,920
core I9 and core i7
processors of this class.

333
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:06,480
You guys cannot write a query like this.

334
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,200
Select a discount to thrombus.

335
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,440
I'm going to buy it.

336
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,960
Okay.

337
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,320
Select last name.

338
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,400
Count from person group by last name.

339
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,280
Having count.

340
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,960
Oh, why?

341
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,600
Why are you guys are using the count
function?

342
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,760
I want to be employs all the details

343
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,800
like first name, last name, gender, age.

344
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,600
Every year
everything is different than count place.

345
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,120
Okay, let me tell you.

346
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,400
Okay.

347
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,240
Just write a query to find out
the average age of the employees

348
00:28:52,240 --> 00:29:15,000
in this table, all grade,

349
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:26,880
all all those queries, they are wrong.

350
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,640
You just write this.

351
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,720
Just write a query to find the average age

352
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:41,960
of the employees.

353
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,480
Okay.

354
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,840
That's why we have the sub queries.

355
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,160
Okay.

356
00:29:47,160 --> 00:30:05,200
Now you guys will understand
why we need the sub duties.

357
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Okay,
so if I execute this query, yes or not,

358
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,800
I am asking something that you guys
have not learned

359
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,320
yet. It's

360
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,600
not working.

361
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,560
Yes, it will not
because you guys don't know the concept

362
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,160
for that yet.

363
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,240
So I have a query that gives me

364
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:44,200
the average age of the employee's
in this table right up until this point.

365
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:51,200
I not understand what is going on
right now using the sub queries.

366
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,400
What we can do.

367
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,760
I can use the results of this query.

368
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,640
I can use the results of this query inside

369
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,680
and other query
I can see select all from person

370
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,320
where age is greater than

371
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,480
and I inside of that.

372
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,720
Inside these parentheses
I can actually put this query.

373
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,200
So now what will happen

374
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,680
first, the average age of the employees
will be calculated

375
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,480
with the help of discovery
and the results.

376
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,720
This 23.6.

377
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,680
It will be used inside this query.

378
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,360
This part is called B Inner beauty.

379
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,480
In this in this query
where we are using this ability concept

380
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:54,440
and this part is called the output acuity.

381
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,800
So some good is
what do we do with disabilities?

382
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,440
We use the

383
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,320
resource URLs of

384
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,840
one query inside and other acuity,

385
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,440
and that we what we can do,
we can calculate

386
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,720
so many intermediate results

387
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,160
that are not possible
to calculate directly

388
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,080
or are very hard to calculate to directly

389
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,240
or another benefit of this sub duty
is that

390
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,440
I can divide my logic into different box

391
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,720
instead of writing a very big duty
in which I put all the conditions,

392
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,160
I can divide my query in multiple parts
in multiple steps.

393
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,920
First, I calculate one result.

394
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,120
I use that result in another query.

395
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,920
I calculate another result,
and then I use the results of that query

396
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,680
in another query.

397
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,840
So I can divide my logic into steps
and I can write queries

398
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,400
which are not possible to write directly

399
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,840
or are very hard to write directly.

400
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,600
Do you guys get the idea of subquery? Why?

401
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,480
Why? Why?

402
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,160
We should use the sub goodies
So you will see this time

403
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,640
we have all those employees for which

404
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,040
the age is greater than the average age.

405
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,120
Okay, so first what do we do?

406
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,840
And we can do it
with any type of securities, right?

407
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,200
Inner coded result
will be used as input for output.

408
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,640
Yes, Maria? Yes.

409
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,000
So this is the concept of subcu.

410
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,760
This.

411
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,720
So subcu is a query within a query

412
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,360
subcu.

413
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,600
This has two part outer
query and inner query.

414
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,800
The result output of inner
query will be used

415
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,560
as input for the for the output query.

416
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,600
So you see in here we are using select
column name from table name

417
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,680
and then we can put any comparison
Operator

418
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,120
now and ask your skill rep

419
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,920
where we use the other guru
now, for example,

420
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,920
you can, you guys can also use the inner
curious like this.

421
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,840
So we have so in this case
we are using the same table

422
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,120
to bring to calculate returns
for inner and outer beauty.

423
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,400
But you guys can also use multiple tables,
other tables as well.

424
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,880
So let's say for example,
I have this employed table

425
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,120
and in this

426
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,400
implied
table I have the departments in here

427
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,520
and for all those

428
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,920
departments we have these employ ideas
or we have this Saturday column.

429
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,200
Now let's say we want to count.

430
00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:00,000
We want to find out all those employees
who are earning.

431
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,560
Let's say, maybe more than 100.

432
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,880
Okay,
So what I can do, I can first write acuity

433
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,760
to get to B e amp ideas off

434
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,560
those employees who are earning greater
than 100 K by writing a query like this.

435
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,160
So e MP ready

436
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,560
from employed table

437
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,880
to where

438
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,120
salary is greater than

439
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,280
100. Right.

440
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,560
So this part of the query give me those

441
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,840
MPI IDs right.

442
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,520
So I now have those employed ideas
and now I can use the results

443
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,480
from this query inside the other viewer

444
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,800
to find out the details of those persons

445
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
which are earning more than 100,
I guess I can say select all from person.

446
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,240
We're MPI ready

447
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,000
in because

448
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,360
I have multiple roles
I am using in in here

449
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:19,920
and I can use this query in here.

450
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,960
So if you want to combine the logic
from multiple tables.

451
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,000
So these are the employees
who are earning more than 100.

452
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,440
Okay.

453
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,160
So if you have
you have that in multiple tables

454
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,080
and let's say some piece of information
is presented in a in a different table,

455
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,200
you can calculate the intermediate results
from that table

456
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,280
and you can use those results to calculate
the things from another table.

457
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,560
So in this case, we are calculating the
we are calculating the empty ideas

458
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,600
from employed table,
and then we are using those employ ideas

459
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,800
inside of the person table to find out the
details of those employees.

460
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,520
Is clear.

461
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:13,440
Guys.

462
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,280
So that's the concept of sub duties.

463
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,680
And now it will make more sense when.

464
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,720
So once you guys are learning
the relationship between two tables.

465
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,560
So first thing, let me tell you.

466
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,640
So you guys might ask this question

467
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,760
that has to go to why you have created
so many tables, right?

468
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,800
Why you have created so many tables,
Why not create a single table

469
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,560
and put all the info inside that table?

470
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,000
Can you guys think of the reason why?

471
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,920
Why create so many different tables?

472
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,040
Why not use a single table to store

473
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,600
all the information

474
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,680
collected that

475
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,880
because it will be messy?

476
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,160
Yes. Alone?

477
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,960
Yes. To make us work on so many tables

478
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,680
all that complexity
is security managed system, huh?

479
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,800
Manage sister,

480
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,960
assume

481
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,600
by creating a single table

482
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,560
searching will be hard
for different reports

483
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,640
or simply simply more organized.

484
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,920
A speed? Yes.

485
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,080
All of your answers are correct.

486
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,160
If we use a single table

487
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,200
first of all,

488
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,800
it can compromise
the security of the data.

489
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,240
Because

490
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,640
if we have multiple tables,
we can maybe restrict

491
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,440
the access of those tables
for some of the employees.

492
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,320
Let's say you are designing a banking
application.

493
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,800
One table contains the username
and passwords

494
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,520
of the of the employees.

495
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,520
One table
might contain the personal information.

496
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,000
One table might contain the information
about the funds.

497
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,440
One table might contain the information
about some other

498
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,160
types of accounts or something like that.

499
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,880
So what can happen?

500
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,040
You will not give access to the tables
like username and password and funds

501
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,280
to all all the employees
that are working in your company,

502
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,880
in your I.T department,
and you might only want to give the access

503
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,560
for a specific time
if there are any problems

504
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,960
you give the access
once that issue is resolved to you,

505
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,040
I take back of that access.

506
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,160
And the second reason is that

507
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,160
when we a single table

508
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,760
to store all that data,

509
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,400
your queries will get super, super slow.

510
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,320
Like, for example, if someone
accidentally executes this select all.

511
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,200
So if you combine
all the results inside a single table,

512
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,560
there might be 2000 columns or maybe 1500
or 200 columns for big databases.

513
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,080
So it will get super,
super messy and super slow

514
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,200
and it will be very,
very hard to understand those table. So

515
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,240
and there are other

516
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,720
technical reasons as well, inserting data,

517
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,240
deleting data and manipulating data inside
a single

518
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,160
table is not the most efficient way
of storing data.

519
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,400
There is actually a complete course
in which we learn

520
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,600
how to design the tables.

521
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,080
They are.

522
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
They are called the normalization.

523
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,640
So those who want to learn

524
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,920
the technical reasons why we should have
multiple columns instead of single column,

525
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,880
you guys can search on the internet
about normalization in databases.

526
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,960
So there is a technical reason as well.

527
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:17,800
Sometimes if we use a single column,
it is not possible to perform

528
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,680
the deletion.

529
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,560
We might lose all the data
if we delete a single row.

530
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,920
And there are other reasons AS but

531
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,040
so for those reasons
we create multiple tables. Now

532
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,520
if I have to create multiple tables,

533
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,120
that means I need to split my information
in different tables.

534
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,680
Let's say for example, in this database,

535
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,680
the information related to country
is stored inside the country table.

536
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,440
The information related to the employee
skills has been stored inside this table.

537
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,440
The personal information has been stored
in tired display bubble,

538
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,960
and we have divided the information
in different tables.

539
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,760
Now, what do you guys think should not be
there some kind of connection?

540
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,600
So let's say, for example,

541
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,120
if I have

542
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,440
the information of an employee

543
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,800
inside this employee stable

544
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,200
and I want to find out how many years

545
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,280
of experience that employee has
so that information related to

546
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,480
the experience is stored inside
this empty work experience table.

547
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,440
While the personal information
is stored in here.

548
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,320
So what do you guys think?

549
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,600
How can I find out the experience

550
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,920
of this specific employee
from this table to this table?

551
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,880
So if I execute,
I hope there is some kind that is

552
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,960
by six has left some data.

553
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,120
They should have something common
like employee I.D..

554
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,160
Yes. Yes.

555
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:15,440
You guys are right.

556
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,840
Thank you.

557
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,120
Let me tell you from this.

558
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:27,720
So now you guys will understand
the main purpose of employer,

559
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,960
the main purpose of foreign keys
and primary keys.

560
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:40,440
So if let's say

561
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,920
I let's say if I want to find

562
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,120
the Department of John.

563
00:43:49,440 --> 00:44:09,400
Yes, let me make it.

564
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,160
Is it good now?

565
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:21,080
Is it treatable?

566
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,400
So question number nine of our homework
laws, this kind of subquery?

567
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,000
You know, to be honest,
I don't remember that question.

568
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,640
I have to check.

569
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,440
But yes, you should have at least

570
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,120
one or two questions related to sub puris

571
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,200
from the homework that I shared yesterday.

572
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,960
You guys don't need to follow me in here.

573
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,000
You guys run into fun. So

574
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,640
let's say guys,

575
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,520
I have stored the information related

576
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,040
to employment inside this table

577
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,800
and I have stored the information,
personal information inside this table.

578
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,080
So I have created two tables
in my database.

579
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,760
I can have many, many more tables.

580
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,920
But now,
because I have divided the information

581
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,760
in to do two or three or four tables,

582
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,040
I also must find out a mechanism

583
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,040
to link the back of this information.

584
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:27,400
For example, if I want to find out
B Department of John,

585
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,000
because I have stored that information
inside this table in here,

586
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,720
I must come up with the mechanism
to link this information back.

587
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,400
So if I want to find out
the Department of John,

588
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,640
I must have something

589
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,280
that can tell me the Department of John.

590
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,040
So what do you guys think?

591
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,800
Is there anything inside of this table
that can tell me

592
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:58,920
this information? Yes.

593
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,400
The employer ID right.

594
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,840
So if I want to find out
the Department of John

595
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:15,600
what I will do, I will check the employer
I did that is associated with John

596
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,880
and then I will go inside this table

597
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,240
and I will match this employee I.D.

598
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,440
in here.

599
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,880
And once I have found the match,
I can find out this salary of John.

600
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,240
I can find out his grade.

601
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,520
I can find out his department.

602
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,680
Can you guys tell me what is this employed

603
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:46,080
in here?

604
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:53,280
It's the primary key, right?

605
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,720
And for short quality, speak it.

606
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,560
So let me right

607
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,160
here.

608
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,320
But I also have this empty already
inside of this table.

609
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,880
Can you guys check if this MPI did that?

610
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,640
I have inside the person table?

611
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,040
Does it qualify for the primary key
Jack and the data that is present in here

612
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,440
and tell me if it qualifies
for the primary key or not.

613
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,440
Remember,
primary keys can not have duplicate

614
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,200
values right?

615
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,880
They should be unique.

616
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,280
Are they unique? Not.

617
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,040
We have multiple
one contact is in here. Right?

618
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,880
So when ever a primary key.

619
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
Yeah. Listen carefully guys.

620
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,840
Whenever a primary e is present

621
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,240
inside and other table

622
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,680
whenever a primary key is present inside
and other table

623
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,880
it is called foreign key.

624
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,200
And why we have these foreign keys
and these foreign keys.

625
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,080
They help us create the relationship
between two tables

626
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,480
and using the relationship of this primary
and the foreign key,

627
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,320
I can link to the information
inputs to different tables.

628
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,320
Yes. Foreign key.

629
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,920
Then if this.

630
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:28,520
So whenever a primary key
is present inside a different table.

631
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,600
Yes. For f k for short.

632
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,360
It is called a foreign key
and the foreign keys.

633
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,520
They can have

634
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,040
duplicate values.

635
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,920
They can have null values

636
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,280
because in one department
there could be multiple of implied. Yes.

637
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,360
So you are right.

638
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,720
So primary gives they can not have

639
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,880
duplicate values.

640
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,440
They can not have a null values,
but the foreign keys,

641
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,280
they can have null values

642
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,720
and they can have duplicate values
as well. Why?

643
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,320
Because it is possible

644
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,480
that multiple employers
might be working in the same department

645
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,280
or multiple employers
might be running the same amount of money.

646
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,000
Right?

647
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,320
Or there might be an employers
who are who have just joined the company

648
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,120
and they have not assigned any department
or salary yet.

649
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,000
So for these kind of scenarios.

650
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,280
It is possible

651
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,440
for a foreign gate to have

652
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,280
null values and to have duplicate values,

653
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,480
but primary is
they don't have duplicate values.

654
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,520
They don't have null values.

655
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,600
Is it clear, guys, what do you

656
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,800
So on the left, the table empty

657
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,560
ID is the foreign key and on the right
probably empty the parameter.

658
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,240
Yes. Muhammad Yes, you are right.

659
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,200
And to why
we need these AMP employer I.D.,

660
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,720
why we need these primary keys
and foreign keys.

661
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,960
We need them because we are learning
the relational databases.

662
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,840
Relational databases
have a relation between tables.

663
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,760
And this is how
these relations are created

664
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,200
in non relational databases.

665
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,440
There are no primary key or foreign keys

666
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,680
they can have, but it is not mandatory.

667
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,040
But in relational databases,

668
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:47,120
if through tables they contain something
that should be linked to other tables,

669
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,160
they will have a foreign key

670
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:57,440
and a primary.

671
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,280
All right.

672
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,480
So now to

673
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,960
so till now,

674
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,400
you guys have been writing duties

675
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,480
that were only fetching the data
a single table.

676
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,080
Right?

677
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,160
So two tables
going to have two primary keys

678
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,360
and two foreign
keys are not two primary keys.

679
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,760
One or two tables.

680
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,640
Yes, almost in real life.

681
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,000
And you will see each table

682
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,040
will be having a primary key

683
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,520
and a table can have multiple
foreign keys.

684
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,960
For example, if you guys focus carefully

685
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,320
on this table

686
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,800
in left table primary key is i.t.

687
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,120
Yes, I agree.

688
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,640
So can you guys tell me

689
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,240
how many

690
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,600
foreign keys are present inside this?

691
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,120
Such a chart implies

692
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,920
maybe you guys will be able to do

693
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,120
that.

694
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:22,560
You guys will be in a better position
to tell me if i show you.

695
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,440
Can you guys open this
this slide on your computers?

696
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,760
And can you guys tell me how many foreign
keys are present in such a chart?

697
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,120
Employs

698
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:52,720
from this picture?

699
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,160
And by the way,
the text that is written in here

700
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,680
that says foreign key foreign key.

701
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,200
It is not labeled for all of the tables.

702
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,640
If you want to actually find out
all the foreign gives you,

703
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,800
you should look for these relationships
that you have

704
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,160
with other tables of this asset
that are in place.

705
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,520
Have relationship with this table,
this table, this table, this table.

706
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,880
So you should actually get out
of these relationships, but

707
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,160
it is hardly a readable model.

708
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,840
You have this slide on your computer.

709
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,080
The and it is still hard

710
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:42,960
to read on your computer.

711
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,680
It is not that.

712
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,840
Oh my God, I used to watch all the movies

713
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:54,120
and everything in one $0.44
and then to 40 B and 363.

714
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,320
I am from that that age

715
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,320
now everyone looks for

716
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:08,160
HD right?

717
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,200
So yes.

718
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,960
And 13 is the correct answer.

719
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,560
13 is the correct answer.

720
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,400
So for every relationship
that a table has,

721
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,640
the relationship is created
using the foreign key.

722
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,240
And that's why
there are 13 of the relations and 13

723
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,160
following this, for example,
I can show you from here

724
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,960
you see it to make a race

725
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,840
or it is a foreign key.

726
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,080
Can you guys

727
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:44,720
thank you saw one

728
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,320
this nation code it is also a foreign
in this implied gender

729
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:54,960
it is also a foreign you see it is in here
instead of actual gender male female.

730
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,680
You see these codes right?

731
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,440
So they are all foreign keys.

732
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,080
And if you want to find out
the actual information,

733
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:22,000
let's say, for example,

734
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:42,600
let me give you an example.

735
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,360
So yesterday you guys wrote Acuity

736
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,800
to, find the job

737
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:57,720
title code, right?

738
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:01,200
So it is also a primary key
and foreign relationship.

739
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,200
And what was the name of the table as such

740
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,040
a job

741
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,800
and job title?

742
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,400
Then you guys tell me
the name of that table that contains

743
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,200
the names of the

744
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,880
Yes job or item

745
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:39,120
job title.

746
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,160
So you see we have this 2323 in here,
23 to 0 eight quantity.

747
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,160
But if we go inside this table

748
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,560
or item job

749
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,360
title, they are actually the primary keys.

750
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,200
You see they are actually the primary gate
inside this table

751
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,120
and this is where
the actual information is stored

752
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,720
like this.

753
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,680
So these are the
what are these guys are the primary

754
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,840
keys are foreign. He's

755
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,760
prime the keys.

756
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,680
And if we check the

757
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,960
at just a job employs

758
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
inside of this table we have this

759
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,520
job title code

760
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,760
and it contained null values
it contained duplicate values.

761
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,080
What are they
are the primary key or foreign key.

762
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,760
They are the foreign keys. Right.

763
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,400
And also observe this guys
they can have these columns,

764
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,480
although they represent
the same information.

765
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,720
They can have different names in here
we have saying it,

766
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:06,600
we are calling it job title code,
but if we go inside the table

767
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:11,040
that actually contains the titles,
we are calling it ID.

768
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,320
So by convention, most of the time
the primary key is they will be called

769
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,440
ideas and in the other tables
they might be called

770
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:26,640
something different.

771
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:35,280
All right.

772
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,360
Now these joins they actually help us

773
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,040
bring
the information from multiple tables.

774
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,320
So up till now,
you guys have been writing queries

775
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,600
that were bringing the data
from a single table.

776
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,040
But what if I have the information

777
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,360
stored in multiple tables

778
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,280
and I want to, let's say, bring

779
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,760
some columns from one table and columns

780
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,360
from the other table,
How can I combine this information?

781
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,520
How can I try to query that?

782
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:22,080
Let's say bring the results
from two columns from one table

783
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:29,040
and two columns from another table,
so we can do that with the help of joins.

784
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:36,000
So first we have to tell you all about
the primary is and different give

785
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,720
so that you can create those relationships

786
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,600
and then we can tell the columns
that we need from both the tables.

787
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:51,720
For example,
let's say I want to write a query

788
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,440
in which I want to see the first name

789
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,400
and the salary of the employee

790
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:05,400
right?

791
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,800
So if I execute this duty,

792
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,160
I have first names are stored in here.

793
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,480
While the salary that these employees

794
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,840
are earning, this information is stored

795
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,960
inside the employer table.

796
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,120
And now I want both of these columns

797
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,760
in my results set.

798
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,680
So how can I combine the information

799
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,680
from two different tables

800
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,240
inside a single desk?

801
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,400
I'll start using a single query.

802
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,880
So it's very, very simple.

803
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,600
If you guys have understood the concept
of from primary, it can be foreign key.

804
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,960
So this time we will say a select

805
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,680
and then we will say a first name

806
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,320
and a salary.

807
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,480
Remember,
this first name is coming from percent,

808
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,280
the salary is coming from employee.

809
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:12,000
So you guys know that after
they select the

810
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,600
we specify the column names
from which we want information.

811
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,640
Right. And what do I specify?

812
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:24,000
What do we specify
after the front clause gave,

813
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,200
we specify the table names
and how many tables.

814
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,600
I will be needing
to bring this information again.

815
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,160
I will be needing to,
so I need to specify this time.

816
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,120
Two tables employ

817
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,600
and person.

818
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,040
But to how do ask You will know

819
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,960
which columns are primary keys
and which columns are foreign

820
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,600
Key is how do school
Law order does not matter.

821
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,880
You'll get the you can write in first
person later person first thing by later.

822
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,040
So we have to tell those columns as well

823
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,800
based on which school
can figure out the relationship.

824
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:11,680
So we will say we're

825
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,080
we're the

826
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,880
we are in employ dot

827
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,080
so name of the table dot

828
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,600
MP ID is equal to

829
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,320
person dog

830
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,520
MP ID

831
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,760
so we are telling the skill
that here skill you know what,

832
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,600
you can go and check the MP

833
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:45,600
d column from the employed table

834
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,000
and MP I d from the person table.

835
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,520
These are the two columns

836
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,440
that will tell you which salary

837
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,840
belong to which employ.

838
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,440
So school is smart enough

839
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,640
to find to perform this match.

840
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:12,600
So I will check the employ I do
from employed table and it will check.

841
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,760
It will find out the same.

842
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,520
So this is what skill will do

843
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,280
a skill will pick this john from here

844
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,440
and to find out
a salary scale will say, okay,

845
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,160
the linkage information

846
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,480
is presented inside this table
so it will go inside this table

847
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,560
or it will say,
okay, 100 is present in here.

848
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:39,720
That means this salary belong to John.

849
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,040
Then school will pick the second row.

850
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:48,960
Mary It will check this employ ID
and it will go inside this table.

851
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:54,120
And it was 100 known or here we have 120.

852
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,480
That means this hundred and ten.

853
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,960
Okay. Is the salary of Mary.

854
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,120
Then it will take the next row.

855
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,880
Ali with a jack. Okay.

856
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,080
What is the employer?

857
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,400
It is 110.

858
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,840
That means one
third B is the salary of Ali.

859
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,800
Does it make sense, guys,
how a skill can figure out

860
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:24,360
which salary belong
to which first name? Yes.

861
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,760
Skill is using these foreign keys
and primary gives relationship

862
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:34,320
to find out this information.

863
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:39,480
How about for idea 120
This is one quality that means 100 k

864
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,600
So all those employers

865
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,800
which have I be 121 to get,

866
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:51,480
they will all be having a salary of 100.

867
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,880
Let me actually execute this.

868
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,880
Yes. Same salary
because it is possible right.

869
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,120
Many multiple employers
going to be earning the same salary

870
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,120
if that makes sense.

871
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:18,520
But they should start putting extra column
with their salary into one table.

872
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:24,360
It may maybe you can create a very,
very big table in which you would

873
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,080
you will put all the information
inside this name.

874
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,440
But believe me,
it will be very, very hard.

875
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,240
I will one day

876
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:34,480
and then you will realize that is

877
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,920
that was the worst idea that you
you have ever thought of.

878
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,800
And then you will make
separate tables again and you will

879
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,720
information again.

880
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,800
So this is the concept of joins advice.

881
01:05:53,800 --> 01:06:00,040
We have joined two tables, person table
and employed table

882
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:05,640
and we are bringing some information
from the employer table

883
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,640
and some information
in from the person table.

884
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,680
Same way.

885
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:14,520
Now with the help of joins,
you guys will be able to join

886
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,640
any of the tables
that are present inside the start up. Yes.

887
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,840
Okay. Yes, we will do more examples.

888
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,760
Someone that nobody

889
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,680
gets.

890
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,600
So let's say, guys,

891
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,360
because you guys are already familiar
with this example.

892
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:38,000
So let me use the same example again.

893
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,560
So this table guys or at JVM job

894
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,160
title table, it contains the job titles.

895
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:51,000
And now I have this requirement
that I want to bring

896
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,680
the instead of the job
because I want to bring

897
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,680
just a or

898
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,160
employed.

899
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,200
So let's say I have this requirement that

900
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,480
I want to display the

901
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,880
employee's first name

902
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,200
and I want to display the employee I.D.

903
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,560
and their job title.

904
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,760
But the job title information is present

905
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,920
inside a different table.

906
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,200
So what do I need to do?

907
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,240
I need to have
and do I need to perform a join

908
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:42,200
if I want this information
in using a single query in a single.

909
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,480
Well said. Yes.

910
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:49,160
So to perform that join
what should be my first step.

911
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:54,760
My first step should be to find out
the relationship.

912
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,040
Those two columns which can create

913
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,000
that relationship
a primary key and a foreign key.

914
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:06,040
So my first step will be to go
inside this or adjacent table

915
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,680
and I will check, okay, I have an ID,

916
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,520
I have a title,
I have the so I will check if this I.D.

917
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,880
is present inside this table or not.

918
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:20,960
If this I.D.

919
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,360
is not present inside the such
a starting place, can I still create the

920
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,440
relationship based? No.

921
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,680
And then I will not be able to do that
right.

922
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:38,640
I will not be able to link the information
from multiple tables.

923
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,320
So I go and check all the columns.

924
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,240
All the columns.

925
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,480
That's where your schema will be helpful.

926
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,800
So all the companies will be sharing
that schema with you

927
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,080
and it will have that visual information.

928
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,520
Which table is connected to each other,
table based on which columns.

929
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,080
So you guys don't have to do this
manually like I am doing in here.

930
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,160
You will be provided with the schema.

931
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,720
Hopefully.

932
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:18,040
So. Okay,

933
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,240
so we check from here

934
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:27,400
and we see we have these ideas.

935
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,520
Yes. The schema, it can easily tell you

936
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,880
the relationship between two tables.

937
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:42,360
Is it possible to connect to two tables
by two primary keys?

938
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,080
For one, you want to have

939
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,080
two primary gives,

940
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,800
you know, two primary keys.

941
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,680
If both of the tables

942
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,640
they have their own primary gives
how you can connect to them.

943
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,560
The information should be same right?

944
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,480
Otherwise,
how do I still know which role belongs

945
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:11,160
to which role?

946
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:15,680
Because one table will be having its own
primary, its own values.

947
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,720
The other table will be having
its own primary, its own values.

948
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,480
How you will be able to join them.

949
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,560
The information should be common
between two tables.

950
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:30,320
To join two tables.

951
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:43,400
Does it make sense? Yes.

952
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,440
It's like the we look up

953
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,280
in Excel.

954
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,200
Those who have worked with the SQL.

955
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,160
Yes, it is.

956
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:53,640
It is same as the lookups.

957
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,720
Finally,
full value of knowledge is benefiting.

958
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,200
You find at least some of it.

959
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,600
So idea and job
title code will be used in in condition.

960
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,800
Yes. Yes.

961
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:10,840
Aisha.

962
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:16,680
So I have I have found the column based
on which I can link these two tables.

963
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,600
Right. So now I can write a query.

964
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:25,440
I can say a select.

965
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,840
So I can say select.

966
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,520
I can say

967
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,680
employee ID

968
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,160
can say

969
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,520
employee

970
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,560
first name

971
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,040
and I can see

972
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,360
what was the name of the job

973
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:59,800
title,

974
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,040
actually, other than those dollars
and definitely

975
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,640
the dollars will be coming, but because

976
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,040
now their profession will be same,
they will be able to help out each other.

977
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,880
I think that's the best team.

978
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:19,080
When two persons are in the same industry
or on the same job.

979
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,880
So, for example,
I know for sure before these guys

980
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,840
get the job,
I know more than 50% of their tasks.

981
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,800
They will be done by Zima.

982
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,640
Silva I will simply say here
the modern things are not making sense.

983
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,720
Can you please help me out?

984
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:39,360
In the next
will be doing those that supports Silva

985
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:43,640
and the

986
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,240
salaries that they will only go to Silva
right?

987
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:54,680
That's my yes.

988
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:58,920
If Zimmer does not help,
I will not be getting the food

989
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,480
for that day.

990
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,800
And so it is called the job title.

991
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:12,000
So I will say job.

992
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,920
I mean, if an employee's if we take it

993
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,080
and then sell the table, take be employed,

994
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,280
be these two that are unique,
can we connect them

995
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:29,760
to each other?

996
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,560
I mean, in employees, if we take I.D.

997
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,360
and salary table, take employer I.D.

998
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,000
sort of on

999
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,720
the salary table
is actually called the employee's ID.

1000
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,960
So do you mean the person table?

1001
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,560
Can you please use this

1002
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,880
proper names for the tables
so that I can get the idea?

1003
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,560
The table
in which the salary information is present

1004
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,600
is called Employee's table,
and the other table is

1005
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,600
called Person's table in Person Table.

1006
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,880
We have an ID and employee I.D.

1007
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,840
ID is the primary key of that table.

1008
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,120
And employee ID is the foreign key,
which is coming from the employer's table.

1009
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,120
Now, if you want to
connect these two tables based on the ID,

1010
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,520
it is not possible
because it represents something

1011
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:36,840
totally different.

1012
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,200
So then after the from clause,

1013
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:44,520
I need to specify the table names.

1014
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:48,240
So this time I need the information
from just

1015
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,680
at the employers and

1016
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,600
the all at m job title.

1017
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,040
And now I need to specify the condition.

1018
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,800
What should be my condition This

1019
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,320
what should be my condition
to join these two tables

1020
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,520
to tell a skill how it can find out

1021
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,880
the job title of a person.

1022
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,080
How can I? How can a skill do that?

1023
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:24,200
How can it link to the information
from two tables?

1024
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,400
Likes it i d

1025
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,280
yes, the i d from the

1026
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,640
time table. So I will say

1027
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,000
all at m

1028
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,440
dot i d.

1029
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,360
So I am telling the skill that has skill.

1030
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:46,680
This is how you can create
the relationship or two oh item job

1031
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,920
title ID from this table to

1032
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,600
and for the employers.

1033
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:58,840
I need the name of the column
that contains the same information is

1034
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:07,600
will.

1035
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,080
It is called

1036
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,440
job title for right.

1037
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,440
So as such a job employee or not

1038
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,640
job title or right.

1039
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,520
So now a skill knows how to link
the information from these two tables.

1040
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,680
And now if we execute this query,

1041
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,640
we will be getting the information
from both of these tables.

1042
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,960
So you see more. Zoom is cloud architect.

1043
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:44,520
Apple is also cloud architect.

1044
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:49,320
Madia is IP analyst
updated is our discord.

1045
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:54,800
So now I see the employer these names and
their designations in a single activity

1046
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,800
the moment does it make sense now

1047
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,080
even bugs even bugs are cloud architect

1048
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:13,640
without bugs.

1049
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:17,040
Hey, we buggy the cloud architect.

1050
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,080
Okay, so this is how willing

1051
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,920
the information and guys,
we can also. Yes.

1052
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,160
Let's have a break in 6 minutes. Yes.

1053
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:32,320
We can also perform all the other things
that you guys have learned till now.

1054
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,440
The group by clause, the where

1055
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,800
condition,
the having clause, the count function,

1056
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,280
all that you guys have learned till now

1057
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,280
can be performed

1058
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,040
when you are joining the information
from two different tables.

1059
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,800
So, for example, I can write So

1060
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:58,120
we are condition in here and this time
because two tables are joined.

1061
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,000
For me it is already taken
because two tables already joined.

1062
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,720
Now I can write the word condition

1063
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:12,560
using the columns
which are in job title or table or.

1064
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:18,120
And I can also read the word condition
using the asset at the employer's table.

1065
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,640
So for example, let's say

1066
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,840
if I go to a search party, employs tables

1067
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:32,480
and let's say I want to maybe

1068
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,160
let's say
I want to find out, the employers

1069
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:47,280
who have a date of birth

1070
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,920
may be greater than 1945. Right?

1071
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:54,720
So I can say we are E and B

1072
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,520
birthday is greater than

1073
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,280
or to 1990

1074
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:19,320
and so I can now write their conditions

1075
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,320
using any of the columns

1076
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:30,320
present in both the papers.

1077
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:33,640
Let me display the birthday as well.

1078
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:34,960
And here

1079
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,680
so that you guys

1080
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,120
can check out this information

1081
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,040
so all of them use
you guys will see all of them.

1082
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,440
They will be having
a birthday greater than 99 equals

1083
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:55,080
zero for.

1084
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:55,800
Okay.

1085
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:01,480
So we can write a we are condition now
using any of the columns in there

1086
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:06,480
from asset employees or from or time.

1087
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:12,400
I can write glue by group by clause I
using any of the and have you guys noticed

1088
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,480
sometimes I'm using the name of the table

1089
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:18,520
and then dot and then the column name.

1090
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,360
Sometimes I'm simply using the column
names.

1091
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:30,720
You guys notice this.

1092
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,160
So sometimes
when I am specifying the column names,

1093
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:37,200
I use the table name
before that column name.

1094
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,160
But sometimes I simply write
the column name.

1095
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:42,960
Did you guys notice this

1096
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:47,560
or not?

1097
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,520
The reason is that let's see if there are

1098
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:55,560
if in both the

1099
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,160
if the column names are same,

1100
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:02,120
for example, an implied table

1101
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:05,480
we were calling the column as implied

1102
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,080
and in person table
also we were calling it implied.

1103
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,080
And now in here, if we don't specify

1104
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,320
the table names as well, will be confused

1105
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:21,280
because it can not figure out
which empty I.D.

1106
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,280
we are trying to refer. Right.

1107
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,240
Because they are same.

1108
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:30,960
So some of the databases might throw you
an error when you try to do this.

1109
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,880
If you are using the same column names
as you will might be confused

1110
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,440
and it might throw you an error

1111
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,000
saying that has the I am confused

1112
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,480
you see column
implied in where clause is ambiguous.

1113
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:55,760
So as Google is unable to find out if the
if this implied,

1114
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,720
I am trying to refer from the person table
or implied table.

1115
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:04,520
So if the column names are same in
both the tables,

1116
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,960
then we need to specify the table names
as well.

1117
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,920
Again, then we need to specify
table names as well.

1118
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:16,280
And if the column, the names they have,
then they have different names.

1119
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,960
Then we don't need to specify the table
names.

1120
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,200
Okay.

1121
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:23,600
Does it make sense, guys?

1122
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,520
So that skill is not confused.

1123
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,440
Let's say if you are writing, create a
if you are joining three tables,

1124
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:33,520
four tables, five tables
and all of the column

1125
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,400
names in all of those tables,
they have the same name

1126
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:40,520
as How do I still know which column
we are trying to refer?

1127
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:41,280
Right?

1128
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,680
If three tables this all have is
same column name how to ask a law.

1129
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:50,760
So we need to specify the table
name as well before the column name.

1130
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,480
So that school can easily
link to the information.

1131
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,200
And there is one more thing.

1132
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:05,320
Let's say if the table names are very big,
instead of typing

1133
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:10,440
the complete table names,
you guys can also create aliases.

1134
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:15,240
Aliases are shorter
names for your table names.

1135
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:19,640
So instead of writing a complete person
and employee,

1136
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:23,280
I have created these short names B
and E for tables.

1137
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:27,240
And instead of writing the complete
table name, I can simply write E

1138
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,200
and I can simply write me.

1139
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,160
So when you guys will be writing
big queries, it will be very,

1140
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,680
very helpful

1141
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:39,960
because some of the tables,
they might have very long names.

1142
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,800
So you see in here
this table name is o item job

1143
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,600
underscore,
we can see and also underscore attachment.

1144
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:51,840
So if you are joining multiple tables,
if you are designing multiple tables

1145
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,320
and the table names are very, very long,
instead of writing the complete long

1146
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,200
table name, you guys can simply create
an alias like this

1147
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:04,680
with a space
and you guys can use those spaces in here

1148
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:12,640
that it makes

1149
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:20,280
sense to date.

1150
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,920
And if the column names they are the same.

1151
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,640
It does not work with using

1152
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:29,800
a You guys can also specify these in here.

1153
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,840
So for example, this first name is coming
from the person table.

1154
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:36,760
I can say paid
first name and I can say ID or Saturday

1155
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:40,480
just to write my query

1156
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:44,280
so that it is more readable.

1157
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,640
Okay, so I can use these aliases.

1158
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:48,160
Okay, let's have a break, guys.

1159
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:52,160
And after the break,
I will tell you about the types of domains

1160
01:24:52,160 --> 01:25:08,000
that we can create.

1161
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,160
I'm on it.

1162
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:16,040
Please be back by 847

1163
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:35,720
and remind me about anybody.

1164
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,360
All right.

1165
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,600
So let's go over some Kerry

1166
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:48,720
related to joins.

1167
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:54,120
By the way,
the syntax that I have shown you in here,

1168
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:56,600
It is important.

1169
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:02,120
Let me actually copy the security.

1170
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,920
There is an alternate

1171
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:09,760
syntax
also to do the same thing using the joins.

1172
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,760
But that syntax might not work
on all the databases.

1173
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:20,080
This one, it will work on each
and every database that if you want to do

1174
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:59,560
the same thing with the help of joins
this is how would I do same duty.

1175
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:04,080
So in here what we are saying
we are saying here school

1176
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,720
give the first name from person table,

1177
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,520
give me the salary from employer table

1178
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,800
and I am saying

1179
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:19,760
from person in to join in a join means

1180
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,960
if the information is present

1181
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,920
in both the tables

1182
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,840
for example in in here.

1183
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:34,920
Do you guys see that for Sara
there is no MPI ID present in here,

1184
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,400
so skill
will not be able to find this salary

1185
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:47,440
for Sara.

1186
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,320
So there are two salaries.

1187
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:53,040
For one, we have the employer already 124.

1188
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,920
The second one there is no

1189
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,080
MPI ID in the result set.

1190
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:02,880
We only see one Sara with one salary.

1191
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:06,200
We don't see the second Sara
with another salary. Why?

1192
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:10,880
Because I still can not create
that relationship

1193
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:16,120
because the value of PMP
ID is null in here.

1194
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:18,480
So this inner join. This is how it works.

1195
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:22,920
It only gives us the data

1196
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,560
for those roles for which
the value is present in both the tables.

1197
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,880
If any of the table
does not contain the value,

1198
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,640
we will not be getting the results
for that table.

1199
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,840
So in their design
we are saying you're not doing enough.

1200
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,280
Doing means if the information
presenting both the tables

1201
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,800
and we are saying here school this is how

1202
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:49,040
this is how you should join

1203
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,480
these two tables based on these columns.

1204
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,240
So results will be same.

1205
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,560
But this is that the difference
in text in here

1206
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,560
and I always prefer this one

1207
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,240
because it will work everywhere

1208
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,120
but this one it might a little different

1209
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:11,240
differently on a different database
or it might not work at all.

1210
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:16,280
So all the databases might not support
this table order important here?

1211
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:25,360
No, table order is not important.

1212
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:31,200
So we will discuss four types of domains.

1213
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,520
Mine did not work.

1214
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:39,360
No, no, it should work.

1215
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,680
It should work.

1216
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,840
Well, let me show it again.

1217
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,040
Make sure you are guys.

1218
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:50,840
You guys are typing the same thing.

1219
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:58,920
But yes,

1220
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,560
let me share this

1221
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,560
on, on on my skin.

1222
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,920
It works on my skin.

1223
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:28,000
It works.

1224
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,440
Mine does not work.

1225
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,560
What error you got is it should work
what are you

1226
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,600
are getting

1227
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:39,920
or because you are using

1228
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,440
a different username,
you might not have access to the table.

1229
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:44,480
Wait, wait, wait, wait

1230
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,640
I'm using a different username
and password

1231
01:30:52,640 --> 01:31:13,440
that have full privileges privileges.

1232
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:13,800
Mine.

1233
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,440
Mine is also not working.

1234
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,640
I am also getting this out of idea.

1235
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:18,800
I notice

1236
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,800
because I did not create

1237
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,960
the aliases
and I tried to use the alias using like.

1238
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,160
That's why it was not working.

1239
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,560
Let me share the query again.

1240
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:34,720
Try it now.

1241
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:44,760
Recording privileges.

1242
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,600
Does it work now?

1243
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,920
Well, I didn't create the aliases in here,

1244
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,480
and I was trying
to use the aliases in here.

1245
01:31:52,480 --> 01:32:02,240
That's why it was not working. Yes.

1246
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:04,920
All right, perfect.

1247
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:09,120
So let's let's learn the types of joins.

1248
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,360
There are four types of joins in there.

1249
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:19,120
Join, right, join and left and for enjoy

1250
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,480
I think it will be more

1251
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,480
clear in here so all in that a adjoin

1252
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:30,440
will only show you that information

1253
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:34,680
that is common in both the tables

1254
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:38,680
that information
should be present in both the tables.

1255
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:45,200
So in the last example you saw,

1256
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:49,080
if I show you, let me

1257
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:34,160
I used a syntax yesterday

1258
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:37,200
to certain that flag

1259
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:38,880
dominant.

1260
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,880
And you also wrote that

1261
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,240
written so

1262
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,160
so I have certainly imported

1263
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,320
for Sara to null

1264
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:34,680
so now if I query this again

1265
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:46,200
you guys will see far more to do.

1266
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,720
Sara as the MPI ID is null.

1267
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:53,600
So what do you guys think
if now I execute this query,

1268
01:34:53,600 --> 01:35:07,360
will I see a salary for Sara?

1269
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:11,040
So now I don't see Sara in here

1270
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:16,800
because the information for this Sara
for MP I.D.

1271
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,160
is missing in the person table

1272
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:24,280
and we are using an inner join in here
for inner join.

1273
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:27,840
The information should be available
in both the tables,

1274
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:30,960
otherwise we will not be getting
any of those condition.

1275
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:31,800
Did not name.

1276
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,160
Yep. No, you guys don't have to write it.

1277
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:40,760
Even if you guys write
it will not work from your user.

1278
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:43,360
So that's how the inner join works.

1279
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:48,400
Inner join looks for that information
in more to the tables.

1280
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:53,960
If that specific role value
the specific MP ID in

1281
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:59,440
this case is present in employer table
and in person table.

1282
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:03,480
In the case of and then only
we will be getting the results for Sara.

1283
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:08,400
Otherwise if let's say that be implied
that we we have written in

1284
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,440
person table if that is not present.

1285
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:17,520
So let's say even if I do this
instead of setting is it to null,

1286
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,280
let's say maybe I go for 55

1287
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,720
now does this for 55 MP present

1288
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:32,640
inside the employer table.

1289
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,320
Let me bring all the API.

1290
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:40,920
This is this present inside
this table guys.

1291
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:46,080
So will I get the results for Sara again
if I execute this query

1292
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:50,280
using the inner join?

1293
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:52,320
No. Again. Why?

1294
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,800
Because the 455 is present

1295
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:01,040
inside the person table, but
it is not present in the employee table.

1296
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:01,480
Right.

1297
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:04,680
So again, as you all will not know,
which row

1298
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:09,960
from the employee table belong to the SA

1299
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:13,040
because the MPI that Sara is

1300
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,520
using is not present in the implied table.

1301
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:20,320
So information should be pressed in
both the tables

1302
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:23,320
and it should match also.

1303
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,280
Okay, that is how school know

1304
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:29,720
which salary which person is earning.

1305
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:31,720
There's how to create the link.

1306
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,160
Does it make sense guys?

1307
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:35,640
How in this interview I working

1308
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,080
so same

1309
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,200
information should be present
in both of the tables.

1310
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,080
Otherwise the school will not be able
to create that link

1311
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,360
only for Aisha.

1312
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:58,400
It only makes sense for Aisha.

1313
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:03,280
So the impiety that is in here.

1314
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,720
So for example,
if I ask you this question,

1315
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,200
this 160 is present

1316
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,600
inside the employee ID

1317
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:17,360
and this salary associated
with the employer.

1318
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,760
It is one 140 taking.

1319
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,880
Will any of employees

1320
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:27,560
if I right there, if I execute that duty,

1321
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,480
will I see 140 picture
for any of these employees?

1322
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:32,680
No. Why?

1323
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:37,440
Because 160 the employ 8160

1324
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:42,000
None of the employees are using employee.

1325
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,320
I live on 60. Right.

1326
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,440
And same is the case with 150.

1327
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:50,640
This MPI 150 is present

1328
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,120
in tired depressed person table,

1329
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,120
but it is not present inside the employer
table again.

1330
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,720
So all of these employees again,

1331
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:04,560
they will not be included in the results
and we will not see.

1332
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:07,680
Ali Now are these
the observed in the results are

1333
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:11,320
and no salaries will be displayed
for these employees.

1334
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:15,880
And you guys can also verify
this from here.

1335
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:18,440
You see you don't see those employees.

1336
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:22,240
Why? Because skill is unable
to create the relationship, right?

1337
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:27,120
The values were not present
in both decides.

1338
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:31,480
Okay, so do you guys understand
why why we have like

1339
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,600
almost

1340
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,840
22 employees,
but the results in our results,

1341
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:46,440
that is only four of the persons, right?

1342
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:51,080
So total employees,
we are 22, but in results two Why?

1343
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,920
I only see 12 employees.

1344
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:58,080
Guys Because,
for only these two employees,

1345
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,560
there is a perfect match
in both the tables.

1346
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,320
This is how the inner join rows.

1347
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:06,560
Yes. No salary for me as a

1348
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:10,520
okay.

1349
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,600
So this is how the inner join works.

1350
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:16,080
So inner join only bring the doors rules

1351
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,320
for which the information

1352
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:21,960
is present in both the tables.

1353
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:25,080
Is it clear guys
the inner during the working often

1354
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:25,960
not doing

1355
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,520
and there should be a separate section

1356
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:39,720
with numbers in cause.

1357
01:40:39,720 --> 01:40:41,600
Okay.

1358
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:46,960
Now if you guys have understood the inner
join, it's very very easy to understand.

1359
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,680
Be right
during left line and fully join. Yes

1360
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,160
they are actually sets.

1361
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:57,000
They are actually sat
behind the scenes under the hood.

1362
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,960
All of these functions,
they are implemented using sales

1363
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,880
charts from met, if you guys remember.

1364
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,760
Yes, you are right.

1365
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:10,320
So what is the difference between dry join

1366
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:23,760
so right to do and sales.

1367
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:31,200
So this is how right you are works.

1368
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,000
But if I asked you guys

1369
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,560
I have written this right join in here

1370
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:41,880
and there is this table person
and this table employee.

1371
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:46,000
Which table is towards
the right of this right.

1372
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:50,880
Join keyword.

1373
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:55,360
This table is towards the right side
of the joint.

1374
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,800
Right
and person table is store to the left.

1375
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:03,840
Now Check of this image,
check this image and tell me in this image

1376
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:08,560
I am getting all the
information from circle B,

1377
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:11,040
while only that

1378
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,920
information which is common between A
and B.

1379
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,720
So if I ask you

1380
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:22,400
if I ask you if I execute the security.

1381
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,960
So even if there is no match

1382
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:28,880
from the employer table,
let me show you the results first.

1383
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:42,040
First.

1384
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:47,880
So this time we have got
14 rows for the inner join.

1385
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:49,360
We were getting 12 rows.

1386
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,400
We got water.

1387
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,200
These two extra rows in here

1388
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,800
for the salary,
one for ticket and the salary nine ticket.

1389
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:03,240
There are no employees
who are earning these salaries.

1390
01:43:03,240 --> 01:43:07,200
But still we have
got these two results. Why?

1391
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,320
We have got these two results,

1392
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:12,680
this 98 and this 40 again,

1393
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:16,960
because this time
we are using the right to join

1394
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,720
this table was towards the right
and this table was towards the left.

1395
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,440
Right to join says

1396
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:25,600
right to do and says hey, school

1397
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:29,680
even if there is no match for the table,

1398
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:35,520
that is towards
the right of the right to join keyword.

1399
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:36,240
You know what?

1400
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:41,440
I still want to see that information
even if there is no match,

1401
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:45,440
even if there is no employee
who has the empty already,

1402
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:49,920
140 or 160, it is fine.

1403
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,800
You can you can just print out of values.

1404
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,400
But I want to see these values.

1405
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:59,800
So right to do and say is
even if there is no match

1406
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,560
from the table,
which is towards the right,

1407
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:07,800
I still want all of these employees.

1408
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:12,600
If you find a match displayed
the name of that employee's,

1409
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,320
if you don't find a match
display and null value.

1410
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:20,800
But I want all of the rows
to be displayed in the result set.

1411
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,560
Yes, it shows the

1412
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:29,400
null values because there are no employees
who are earning 148

1413
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:33,760
or nine ticket or there are no employees
who have employed 8140 okay.

1414
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,360
Or 160. Okay.

1415
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:39,600
But because we are using
the right to join in here,

1416
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:43,760
that means even if there is no match

1417
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:48,640
from the employed table,
we will still get the values in here.

1418
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:52,320
But for from the left side,
because there is no match,

1419
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:55,480
there is no person in the persons table
who is on

1420
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:58,200
94, we will be getting a null values.

1421
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:01,320
But right you can say is

1422
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,560
it is fine.

1423
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,440
I will display all values from the table.

1424
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:09,640
Two words
which is towards the right of this duty.

1425
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:18,560
And let me show you actually,
I am switching the positions of the table,

1426
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,720
so I am putting
this person towards the right

1427
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,480
and I am putting this employee now

1428
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,840
towards the left.

1429
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,120
Now, these are these two tables.

1430
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:34,880
So this person is towards the right now.

1431
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:40,320
And if you guys look closely,

1432
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:44,880
we have this empty already, 154

1433
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:47,320
which there is no match now.

1434
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:50,760
So will I see this them

1435
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:55,040
not as easy
after all this time in my dataset,

1436
01:45:55,880 --> 01:45:59,040
even though there is no match

1437
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:02,680
because I have switched the positions.

1438
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,000
Right.

1439
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,040
So if I execute this queries
so you guys will understand it

1440
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:09,920
now more more properly.

1441
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,400
So this time as there is here, although us

1442
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,600
there did not have any salary right

1443
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:20,560
of the leaves here,
this is early NASIR Zombies here.

1444
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:24,440
Why? Because this time the person table

1445
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:27,840
is towards
the right and the right domain says

1446
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,640
even if there is no match

1447
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,080
for the table, which is towards the right,

1448
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,360
I will still bring the information.

1449
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:39,600
But from the left table,
because there is no match,

1450
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,400
there are no salaries
associated with these in place.

1451
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:48,520
So I will simply show null values,
but I will make sure that all

1452
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:52,000
the information is coming from the table,
which is towards right

1453
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,160
you guys see there
this time, as will fetch all 22 rows.

1454
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:59,160
There were 22 rows in the person table

1455
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,960
and because I am using right join in here
so skewed

1456
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:09,640
is fetching all those 22 results
and for which there is no match.

1457
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:13,680
It is bringing the null
but it is bringing all the values you see.

1458
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:17,640
For Sara we see NULL for all that implies
we see null.

1459
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,320
But all 22 and 22 rows have been included

1460
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:24,800
in this check
because we are using the right to join.

1461
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:29,720
Does it make sense, guys?

1462
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:34,120
So inner
join says only bring the back data

1463
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:39,000
which has values in both the tables.

1464
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:40,400
Right.

1465
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:44,360
You and says
bring all the data from the right table

1466
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:48,360
the table
which is towards the right but from left

1467
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,400
only bring the matching data

1468
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:54,840
and you guys can now guess

1469
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,080
the left to join as well.

1470
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:01,320
So left to join

1471
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,680
then you guys guess the output.

1472
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:17,840
If I do the left to join what output
I will get.

1473
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,400
So which table is towards the left?

1474
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:26,840
The guys? Yes.

1475
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:32,640
Same as this one.

1476
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,280
Yes, same as this one.

1477
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:37,400
Why? Because if we observe closely,

1478
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:41,280
this simpler table was towards the right.

1479
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:41,760
Right.

1480
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,960
Which means
bring all the data from employee.

1481
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:48,640
And now because I have switched
the B right down

1482
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:54,240
to left to join and again
this employed is coming towards the left.

1483
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,280
So same results as this one.

1484
01:48:56,280 --> 01:49:02,080
I just have switched to the position
of tables and of B join as well.

1485
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:07,200
So left and right and they are actually
something very, very similar.

1486
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:10,840
It just depends on which table you are.

1487
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:13,560
You are writing towards the left,
all to our strike.

1488
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,640
Although they did, they work the same.

1489
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:22,680
Okay, So again, I see all the information
from the left side,

1490
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:25,280
the employer table,

1491
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:30,000
but only the matching information
from this first name.

1492
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,720
Okay.

1493
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,440
And if there is no matching information,
we get the null

1494
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:38,000
values.

1495
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,040
Does it make sense, guys?

1496
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:40,120
Did I join the left?

1497
01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:45,120
Join the inner, join?

1498
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,040
They are.

1499
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:48,520
They are very famous
interview questions, by the way.

1500
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:51,840
So if you guys don't understand,
make sure you watch

1501
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,720
this section of the video
again, it very important for interviews

1502
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:59,720
and can you guys
guess the full output of join

1503
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,120
Yes on both sides

1504
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:16,400
bring the matching data
bring the non matching data,

1505
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:20,040
bring everything
or actually bring everything. Yes.

1506
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,280
From both the tables.

1507
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:24,600
Even if there is a match,
even if there is no match,

1508
01:50:25,400 --> 01:50:30,320
but the full output of joins
are not supported in my sequel databases.

1509
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:33,880
So you guys can see
we are already getting the error.

1510
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,360
How will they
phrase the question on the interval?

1511
01:50:36,360 --> 01:50:40,120
They will say what is the difference
between intertwine and right? Join

1512
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,120
full out join is not supported in

1513
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,080
in my school

1514
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,920
but it is supported in Oracle database.

1515
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:58,520
So let me show you the working in Oracle
one. It's

1516
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:04,800
also not in line

1517
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,960
with real life practice.

1518
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:11,280
So for the real life practice,
I will be sharing

1519
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:14,760
a very big assignment today with you guys.

1520
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:16,640
It contains almost around,

1521
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:20,280
I guess, 50 questions, 50 queries
that you guys have to write.

1522
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:24,920
So that will that will be more than enough

1523
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:28,680
for your practice to understand the basics

1524
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:32,640
of good work.

1525
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:37,560
And you guys will also

1526
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:41,760
we have family that's got

1527
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:45,160
a deadline is next Sunday

1528
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,440
and if you

1529
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:55,320
if you want to tell me about the be

1530
01:51:56,240 --> 01:52:01,440
important piece of family I mean,
if you want me to understand the pain of

1531
01:52:03,480 --> 01:52:04,880
not talking or not

1532
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,880
giving the proper time to your family,
then you should pray.

1533
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:09,880
I should also get a family soon.

1534
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:15,800
Will you give us the rest of the week?

1535
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:20,560
I mean, the interior minister right?

1536
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,000
I'm just kidding.

1537
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,680
Okay. You guys can take more.

1538
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:33,960
Maybe more than Sunday.

1539
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:38,160
Ministers are very important in
you have a beautiful family

1540
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:43,440
with five kids, learn
a different coding language.

1541
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:47,200
And I understand this once. Once

1542
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:52,680
someone has skills that they don't
live their life from that day.

1543
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:53,320
Right.

1544
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:56,440
The only for their kids

1545
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:59,400
on you five is not true.

1546
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,680
Silva

1547
01:53:01,480 --> 01:53:03,320
I seen most of the people.

1548
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:05,400
I mean, they don't enjoy it. They don't.

1549
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,040
The first priority is their children's

1550
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:10,440
months.

1551
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,440
They have the children,
or the first priority is children.

1552
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:17,960
They are above everything.

1553
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:22,640
If they are sick, you cannot
you cannot trust, you cannot sleep,

1554
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:27,240
you cannot work properly.

1555
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:33,360
My poor mom.

1556
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:38,880
Yeah.

1557
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,560
Oh, okay.

1558
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:45,840
So let's find out two tables

1559
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:49,560
on which we can write

1560
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:53,560
the full hour doing

1561
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:58,120
is life.

1562
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:05,880
Looking at my mom,
I said to you a good number of years.

1563
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:07,800
Some kids there they are very naughty.

1564
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,400
So I have a friend.

1565
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:13,080
He is a single son.

1566
01:54:13,080 --> 01:54:16,720
And so they are his parents.

1567
01:54:16,720 --> 01:54:19,920
They take a lot of care of them

1568
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,120
wherever he goes.

1569
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:25,320
They are always like him and asking him
if everything is okay

1570
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:28,600
and they don't allow him to go on trips
and all that.

1571
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:32,280
One day he got frustrated and then

1572
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:35,600
his dad was saying that he is

1573
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:39,080
the name of us guy who likes you
if you are the only thing that we had.

1574
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:40,800
And he was so frustrated.

1575
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:45,520
He said to his father, Hey, dad,
I didn't ask you to stop after me.

1576
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:48,320
You you can please have their kids.

1577
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,800
Their brothers lives completely

1578
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:55,680
flat.

1579
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:58,040
But like

1580
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:05,400
he is

1581
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,880
of us are to be here.

1582
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:42,240
So, like.

1583
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:43,680
So let's use the job.

1584
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:48,560
I do not mean
something is pleasant inside the job

1585
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:56,520
Street table.

1586
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,760
Yes. And the job? It is also pleasure.

1587
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:03,360
By the way, the best practice is to have
the same column names in multiple tables.

1588
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:06,400
So job history

1589
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:15,840
nurse The nurse use the start date

1590
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,640
and let me have it.

1591
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:52,720
This is E for the employees

1592
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:59,000
and for this

1593
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:04,080
so e dot

1594
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,880
job D

1595
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:14,160
is equal to two dot.

1596
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,120
I have

1597
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:19,280
six siblings
and you have kids and parents.

1598
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,640
You feel you have a reason to be happy.

1599
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,880
Are we going to learn more about title?

1600
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,320
Yes. That assignment that I will share

1601
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:31,520
it contains I think 50% of the queries

1602
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:38,080
you guys will be writing on on Oracle 100.

1603
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,720
So my dad didn't have

1604
01:57:40,760 --> 01:57:42,880
a job or something like that.

1605
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:44,960
That's why we are so sick.

1606
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:48,120
We have total seven siblings,

1607
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:50,520
so they have to do something right.

1608
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:51,760
They had to do something.

1609
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:59,320
So they thought, Let's have more kids.

1610
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:06,120
I am on number three.

1611
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:09,160
Let me sing Keyword select first.

1612
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:14,120
Oh, so first name is coming
from Employers.

1613
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:19,200
So E Dot First name
Starboard is coming from

1614
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:23,720
the street table. Oh,

1615
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:28,120
I hope the syntax is same

1616
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:05,640
on or properly under.

1617
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:08,000
Let me check this syntax for

1618
01:59:22,920 --> 01:59:25,720
we have four girls Go.

1619
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:28,840
God told us that the angels, the animals

1620
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:32,160
and the mountains refuse because then.

1621
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:34,560
Yes, five girls and five boys.

1622
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:39,080
We are ten or actually all of my uncles
and aunts.

1623
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:42,360
They have at least been a It is only my

1624
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:46,760
my family that has seven

1625
02:00:00,680 --> 02:00:04,320
all select the select list from the one

1626
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:10,400
who loved to join due to on conditions.

1627
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:15,320
Select first name started from employees.

1628
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,840
Pull out the join history

1629
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:25,200
e on.

1630
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:27,000
There is no on keyword.

1631
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,040
No there is.

1632
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,560
And then the condition

1633
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:33,720
number

1634
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,120
and come on the not property

1635
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:47,160
and the validity.

1636
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:54,400
So why do the reward is giving
then someone please

1637
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:57,400
check this index for full
and if you missing

1638
02:00:57,400 --> 02:01:28,920
something you.

1639
02:01:28,920 --> 02:02:32,400
I think there is something wrong
with the table.

1640
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:35,200
This table is not exist.

1641
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:40,000
Job underscore history, job

1642
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:51,080
and or school history.

1643
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:53,200
Maybe uppercase is it is sensitive.

1644
02:02:53,200 --> 02:02:54,840
Here are no it is not.

1645
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,920
Just give sensitive
inside to single course.

1646
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:00,480
Oh I was missing

1647
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:03,640
this edge or before the table name

1648
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:06,360
I'm on

1649
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:14,600
so seeing mistakes. Yes.

1650
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:15,680
Now this works.

1651
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:17,760
And now this also work

1652
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,600
did not in because again

1653
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:29,480
at our dot.

1654
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:33,600
Yes it also works and you should also.

1655
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:38,440
Oh but I was using a child in here

1656
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:40,560
at me

1657
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:43,800
is instead of this

1658
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:46,120
a child or

1659
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:48,600
the job is student or not job by any

1660
02:03:49,240 --> 02:03:52,960
a child or

1661
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,400
employee's dot job.

1662
02:03:57,400 --> 02:04:05,240
I be.

1663
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:09,720
And now you should work.

1664
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:15,240
Hopefully. Yes.

1665
02:04:16,440 --> 02:04:21,040
So that this and this is
how we write a full output to join.

1666
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:25,520
So in the outer join you guys will see for
you will see

1667
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:28,600
null values in the start table

1668
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,080
and you might also see null values.

1669
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:35,440
It is only bringing the $50 if you guys

1670
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:38,840
might also see null values inside the left
column.

1671
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:42,040
Yes, let me share it.

1672
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:45,080
But it will make sure that each and every

1673
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:48,840
row from both the tables is

1674
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:51,960
is included in

1675
02:04:51,960 --> 02:04:59,880
the results set.

1676
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:03,280
So inner join only brings the information

1677
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:05,760
which is presently in both the tables.

1678
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:07,240
Right.

1679
02:05:07,240 --> 02:05:10,400
Join bring all the information
from right table

1680
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:13,520
and only the matching information
from left table

1681
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:17,520
Left to join Bring all the information
from left to table

1682
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,360
only the matching information
from divide table,

1683
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:24,760
while the full output of join
and bring everything from both the tables.

1684
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:29,280
And by the way, this full hour to join
it is not that widely used.

1685
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:34,280
That's why some of the databases,
they don't even support it.

1686
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:37,160
But this inner one
and this right and left one,

1687
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:40,120
you guys might be using these
on your jobs.

1688
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:45,280
Is it clear, guys, the how joins work

1689
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:49,320
and what are the differences
between inner right and left join

1690
02:05:53,840 --> 02:05:55,440
so this is the syntax but

1691
02:05:55,440 --> 02:06:00,400
again I would not recommend that
you guys use this syntax

1692
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:05,520
because again you might face
problems on different databases.

1693
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:11,000
So always try to use that rare condition
whenever you have variety in join.

1694
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:13,160
But for the left and right join us.

1695
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:17,120
You guys can use this syntax

1696
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:22,200
and this is again the same syntax.

1697
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:27,160
Okay, some tasks for you.

1698
02:06:27,160 --> 02:06:29,320
Left, right. Join syntax,

1699
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:34,640
syntax, syntax.

1700
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:37,760
All again, a very,

1701
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,200
very,
very famous interview question itself.

1702
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:43,680
How do we choose
which table we put on left?

1703
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:46,800
Right now you can fill up any table
on the left, the right.

1704
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:51,120
Yes, it is up to you.

1705
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:54,120
If you are putting a table towards right,

1706
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:58,400
then you can maybe use the left to join
or the right to join.

1707
02:06:58,680 --> 02:07:00,720
So it totally depends on you.

1708
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:04,200
If you are planning to use left to join
or right to join.

1709
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:08,080
And then broadly the parents which table
you are planning to put on

1710
02:07:08,080 --> 02:07:12,480
to work, to diet and towards the left,
definitely this part of the requirement

1711
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:16,400
it will be coming from your business
requirements.

1712
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:20,760
Like for example, if the business says
that business needs all the rows

1713
02:07:20,760 --> 02:07:25,440
from the employed table
and if you are planning to use the right

1714
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:29,400
join, then you will be placing the
employed table day.

1715
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:29,840
Right.

1716
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:33,720
Which question is popular interview?

1717
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:38,000
Question So we have written all the
questions in, in the form of the document

1718
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:42,080
and we have also written
all of the answers.

1719
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,400
And if you guys understand the concepts
which are important.

1720
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:50,160
So with respect to your job interview,
it will be very, very easy

1721
02:07:50,160 --> 02:07:55,720
for you to understand, to
remember those answers for a longer time.

1722
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:59,120
So that's why I emphasize more on
some of the possible

1723
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:01,880
if honestly, it's not clear enough.

1724
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:05,560
But I need to review this record
if honestly,

1725
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:08,760
it's not clear enough,

1726
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:11,400
but I need to reveal the record.

1727
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:19,600
The left and right joins us for one.

1728
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:24,000
So what is not clear,
So let me bring it to back.

1729
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:30,920
So say, for example,
tell me what is not here.

1730
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:37,400
Let's let's make sure that it is clear.

1731
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:39,280
Is it clear the inner join

1732
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:41,280
the inner join?

1733
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:47,360
Is it clear of the inner part?

1734
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:51,640
And the last starts from the inner.

1735
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:56,120
So in the it is not clear

1736
02:08:56,120 --> 02:09:08,880
how in the joint is working.

1737
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:32,640
How many of you don't understand
how the inner dwelling works?

1738
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:37,640
Uh, yes, it is fine if let's say
two or 4 hours don't understand it,

1739
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:43,040
but if let's say 50% of you
don't understand it,

1740
02:09:43,080 --> 02:09:47,360
then maybe we
I need to give different examples

1741
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:52,480
or need to repeat this will
bring only all those from both tables.

1742
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:54,640
Yes, you'll get that. You are right.

1743
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:57,800
If it is inner, join

1744
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:02,640
and everything is clear.

1745
02:10:02,640 --> 02:10:07,880
So what time it is for you?

1746
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:11,040
I'm sorry.

1747
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:13,600
Is it like two or 3 a.m.

1748
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:16,600
in the morning for you?

1749
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,200
The sunrise.

1750
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:23,520
And what did you eat last for 30 PM or.

1751
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:24,400
It's fine then.

1752
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:30,480
It's fine If you don't understand.

1753
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:35,040
Yes, you will watch this video
when you get some good sleep

1754
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:40,880
in the morning.

1755
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:42,120
I'm just kidding.

1756
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:45,040
If there are other students
I can repeat reproduce,

1757
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:49,080
I'm just kidding.

1758
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:54,600
Now the fun part will start after this.

1759
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:59,000
In general, as school looks simple
but needs a greater tension

1760
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,880
not to make mistakes because it does
not give us the way we used.

1761
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:06,800
See from daylight.
Yes, you guys are right.

1762
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:09,960
So this is

1763
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:15,760
self to join.

1764
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:17,920
Let me

1765
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:21,640
let me give you a requirement and let's

1766
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:26,800
see if you guys write actually for that.

1767
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:29,280
So now you guys have

1768
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:34,560
understood that.

1769
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:38,400
So I have only showed you
if a general question

1770
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:42,240
do database engineer
to rely on any guideline criteria

1771
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:46,440
upon selecting a primary key
for individual databases with schema. Yes.

1772
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:50,440
And B, actually
sometimes it takes a lot of meetings

1773
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:53,000
and debates to choose the primary key.

1774
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:57,600
Yes. DB is architects, senior persons.

1775
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:00,720
They all sit together to decide
what should be

1776
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:02,880
the primary key off the table.

1777
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:07,800
It is something very, very important
because based on things,

1778
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:11,040
you guys will be creating the relationship
between different

1779
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:15,360
tables.

1780
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:16,960
Yes, it is not an easy task.

1781
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,160
Yes, you are right.

1782
02:12:20,160 --> 02:12:24,480
Yes, you are nice.

1783
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:28,200
So if I had secured this
at a starting price table

1784
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:30,440
and if you guys

1785
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:36,880
pay attention,

1786
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:40,520
this manager I d so up

1787
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:45,440
till now I have told you that
if a primary key exist

1788
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:49,400
in a different table,
it is called a foreign key.

1789
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:50,080
Right.

1790
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:51,280
This is your understanding.

1791
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:53,120
A primary key from one table.

1792
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:57,240
If it is exist in another table,
it is called differently.

1793
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:02,040
But what if a primary key is present
inside

1794
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:05,600
same table as a foreign key?

1795
02:13:06,440 --> 02:13:08,520
If you have something like this,

1796
02:13:09,520 --> 02:13:11,440
then it is

1797
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:14,920
used to create a self adjoins.

1798
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:19,040
So for example, this employer already
that you see in here,

1799
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:23,200
the same employer already is also present

1800
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:29,400
as manager already
inside the exact same table.

1801
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:31,600
And why it is present in here.

1802
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:35,640
It is present
because by looking at the idea in here.

1803
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:38,360
So let's say for example,
if I want to find out

1804
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:41,040
who is the manager of Nina,

1805
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:44,160
I can check the I.D.

1806
02:13:44,480 --> 02:13:45,320
from here.

1807
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:50,200
So now the manager of Nina is a person
whose ID is 100.

1808
02:13:50,200 --> 02:13:52,920
So I can look back to this column.

1809
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:57,280
And I know that Steven
is the manager of Nina.

1810
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:01,320
If I want to find out
the manager of David,

1811
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,520
I need to go in here.

1812
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:09,080
It says the manager is a person
with an ID 103.

1813
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:13,160
So I will come back in here and I now know

1814
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:16,560
Alexander is the manager of David.

1815
02:14:16,880 --> 02:14:19,960
So this time what is happening? Roster.

1816
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:23,400
There is no roster then here.

1817
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:26,320
So what is happening in here? First, the

1818
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:30,280
primary guy is present as

1819
02:14:30,280 --> 02:14:32,960
a foreign key inside the same table

1820
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:41,640
and now we need to find out a way.

1821
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:46,360
So say if I ask you to write a query
guys, let's say

1822
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:50,000
I want all the first names

1823
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:54,480
of the employees and dear managers.

1824
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:55,840
Can you guys do that?

1825
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:58,120
Can you guys tell me
who is the manager of Let's

1826
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:08,680
Steven, what about rules

1827
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:16,880
is Alexander

1828
02:15:17,120 --> 02:15:19,560
but so manually we can

1829
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:22,720
we can find out the managers very easily.

1830
02:15:22,720 --> 02:15:28,880
But what if I ask you to write a query
to find out to be managers?

1831
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:31,680
Of all the employees
that are present in this table?

1832
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:34,120
By the way, who is the manager of Steven?

1833
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,680
Is he reporting to anyone or he is the CEO

1834
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:42,800
of this company?

1835
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:43,800
Self-managed yet

1836
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:46,920
he is not reporting to anyone.

1837
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:48,400
Right. Okay.

1838
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:52,200
So can you guys drive the duty in which I

1839
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:55,240
you bring the first name of the employee's

1840
02:15:55,840 --> 02:16:05,640
and the first names of their managers?

1841
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:08,720
Can you guys think of a duty

1842
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:21,120
just so let me show you the

1843
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:29,480
what if, guys, What if I tell you that?

1844
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:37,240
Can you copy this and bring it in here?

1845
02:16:37,240 --> 02:16:41,760
What if I tell you
that it is possible in school

1846
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:45,400
to create multiple copies
of the same table?

1847
02:16:45,640 --> 02:16:47,880
What if I tell you I can do this?

1848
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:51,000
I can create a copy,
I can call it anything.

1849
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:52,200
I can call it.

1850
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,360
Let's say

1851
02:16:55,440 --> 02:16:56,680
table one.

1852
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,160
I can call it. Let's see.

1853
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:01,960
I can create a copy
I can call acceptable to the if I

1854
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:06,120
if I tell you
how to create a copy of the same table.

1855
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:09,680
Can you guys now write a theory
to bring the first name

1856
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:12,480
of the employees and the first name

1857
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:23,200
my of their managers?

1858
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:24,520
So now it is simple, right?

1859
02:17:24,520 --> 02:17:27,280
Because you guys have been doing
the same thing in here.

1860
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:28,840
So you will simply say

1861
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:32,280
table two dot name,

1862
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:36,880
table one dot first name and you will join

1863
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:41,520
B these two tables
based on this idea from table

1864
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:44,800
and this manager already from table

1865
02:17:44,800 --> 02:17:54,440
two, right?

1866
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:56,720
So let me tell you how to create copies.

1867
02:17:56,720 --> 02:18:01,040
And once you have two tables,
you guys already know how to link

1868
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:04,720
to tables to bring the information
from both the tables.

1869
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:20,880
Right?

1870
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:24,680
So let me if I

1871
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:47,080
it's very simple.

1872
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:50,920
You just copy
and paste the same table twice

1873
02:18:54,360 --> 02:18:58,640
and you will give different aliases
to those statements.

1874
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,760
Now, I will create two copies
of this table.

1875
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:05,720
It will create a copy
and it will call it as empty

1876
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:09,480
and it will create another copy
and it will call it as amend.

1877
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:14,080
Okay, So now

1878
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:17,240
I want to

1879
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:19,640
link these two

1880
02:19:19,640 --> 02:19:23,400
tables using the joint.

1881
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:24,120
Right.

1882
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:28,160
So I will say we're e MP.

1883
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:32,280
So from MP,
should I bring the employer I.D.

1884
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:37,320
or should I bring the manager ID?

1885
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:39,760
I want to get the first name
of the employee.

1886
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:43,000
Should I use the employer ID Oxford,

1887
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:48,320
I use the manager ID, employer I.D..

1888
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:48,600
Right.

1889
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:52,120
So I will say MP dog.

1890
02:19:52,120 --> 02:19:54,520
Employer I.D.

1891
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:56,200
is equal to.

1892
02:19:56,200 --> 02:20:00,760
And the second copy that I have created,
which I have called as M

1893
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:06,000
Benji from M
and I will bring this manager ID, right?

1894
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,880
So I will say

1895
02:20:08,440 --> 02:20:10,280
M and G

1896
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:15,520
not many of I.D.

1897
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:21,360
And I am also bringing
two first names, right?

1898
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:27,360
The first first name
I want to bring from the MP table.

1899
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:30,760
And the second
first name I want to bring from the

1900
02:20:32,280 --> 02:20:35,160
manager David

1901
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:53,000
Select MP First name Mendy First name

1902
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:56,800
Mendy underscore underscore first name

1903
02:20:59,560 --> 02:21:00,360
from.

1904
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:05,400
I don't employ that MP or employed
as amended

1905
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:09,280
where I think as given is also not

1906
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:12,360
supported in order. Yes,

1907
02:21:12,360 --> 02:21:13,960
let me try to

1908
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:38,040
that duplication is confusing

1909
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:45,520
needs attention.

1910
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:47,440
So let me actually copy this.

1911
02:21:47,440 --> 02:21:50,200
Let me explain it from here.

1912
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:54,600
So I have created two copies.

1913
02:21:54,600 --> 02:22:00,400
One I have called as MP,
the other one I have called as M.

1914
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:04,600
And so focusing here today,
it will be played on on the.

1915
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:06,680
And what I have done, I am saying

1916
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:14,880
select MP

1917
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:19,080
not first name, right

1918
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:22,640
first under school name.

1919
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:25,720
So it will bring the Stevan Nino legs.

1920
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:27,640
Alexandra from here.

1921
02:22:27,640 --> 02:22:30,880
And then I am saying

1922
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:33,000
join these two tables

1923
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,960
based on the idea and I am saying MP

1924
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:44,200
not IED.

1925
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:51,080
But what is what is it called?

1926
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:52,920
Let me copy this query.

1927
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:54,080
Actually

1928
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:05,040
Silva,

1929
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:08,320
how can we display this
without the mistral?

1930
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:11,120
This is,

1931
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:14,280
you know,

1932
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:18,120
this is not what I want in a in a single
or is it possible

1933
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:30,200
I have to margin these columns right.

1934
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:34,000
How can I merge the columns in a

1935

02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:32,280
middle area that Oh margin center

1946
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:40,200
of the operation
will cause some models to enlarge.

1947
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:42,000
Do you wish to

1948
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:46,600
grab.

1949
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:48,680
I need to select this one as well

1950
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:58,000
or like this or here

1951
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:14,600
we will finally.

1952
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:24,840
Okay.

1953
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:28,280
So what I am saying in here
I am saying MP dot

1954
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:31,280
first name,
which means bringing the first names.

1955
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:32,520
These first names

1956
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:37,840
from this employed table

1957
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:42,000
and bringing the first names
from the menu table.

1958
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:44,040
Right. These first names.

1959
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:47,840
But how we should link these to

1960
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:52,720
we should link to these two
based on this information

1961
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:55,320
big the employ ideas

1962
02:25:55,920 --> 02:25:57,960
these these employ ideas from here

1963
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:02,880
and check if that imply I.D.

1964
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:06,920
is also present inside the manager

1965
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:10,760
ID column.

1966
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:12,560
Okay.

1967
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:15,280
So for this

1968
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:20,360
Steven school will check this ID right
and then it will check

1969
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:24,200
if all we have written
if we have written in reverse.

1970
02:26:25,240 --> 02:26:26,040
Right.

1971
02:26:26,400 --> 02:26:29,120
It should not be like this.

1972
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:29,920
It should.

1973
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:31,200
It should be.

1974
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:34,240
You guys
didn't tell me all that means you guys

1975
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:38,760
do not understand it at all.

1976
02:26:38,760 --> 02:26:40,200
We should say MP.

1977
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:43,280
I need the manager

1978
02:26:44,760 --> 02:26:48,360
and M and I'd like

1979
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:51,200
you guys.

1980
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:53,480
See you guys didn't pay attention

1981
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:56,880
because you see,

1982
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:00,480
for Steven we are getting this manager
Get out in here.

1983
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:05,760
We should not be getting any manager
for Steven right? No.

1984
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:09,240
Or the order matter
the way we join for Steven,

1985
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:18,720
we should not be getting any manager
right.

1986
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:22,040
But Steven should be as a manager
for others.

1987
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:24,400
Now Disconnect. Correct.

1988
02:27:24,400 --> 02:27:26,720
Steven is the manager of Nina.

1989
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:29,040
Not now. The results are correct.

1990
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:31,280
Okay,
so first let me explain how this looks.

1991
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:34,640

I am half asleep.

1995
02:27:45,840 --> 02:27:50,200
If I can sleep.

1996
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:52,200
Okay. This is the last thing promised.

1997
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:55,920
We will learn the next things
in in the next classes.

1998
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:56,520
Okay.

1999
02:27:56,520 --> 02:27:59,760
I will also repeat this for me.

2000
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:08,280

2009
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:54,360

it's very hard to.

2114
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:39,960
So you have to select the
nearest location.

2115
02:36:39,960 --> 02:36:40,440
Mohammad

2116
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:43,800
Are you near to North America?

2117
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:48,680
West, North America, East Europe,
Asia, South America.

2118
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:50,280
What should select

2119
02:36:52,560 --> 02:36:53,640
East?

2120
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:56,880
Okay, select the nearest location
and click on same location

2121
02:36:59,320 --> 02:37:00,880
and then click on this button

2122
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:09,640
that says Start a new database.

2123
02:37:09,640 --> 02:37:14,360
So now they have created
a database for you.

2124
02:37:14,360 --> 02:37:17,400
So this is the IP of your database.

2125
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:21,400
This is the database name,
this is the database user,

2126
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:26,440
and the password will be created in full
seconds and it will be sent on your email.

2127
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:30,000
So let's go back to my skill workbench

2128
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:33,880
and click on this home button and.

2129
02:37:33,880 --> 02:37:39,080
Let's configure this new database
that we have just created

2130
02:37:39,080 --> 02:37:43,920
so that we can write
and execute queries on this step base.

2131
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:45,960
So click on the
splash button in here guys,

2132
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:50,920
and for the IP copy, this

2133
02:37:51,240 --> 02:37:55,600
will find out my espeon.

2134
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:58,160
So enter this information in here

2135
02:37:59,360 --> 02:38:08,880
and it will.

2136
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:12,880
And then the username is this

2137
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:15,960
Well, I'm
not going to be able to see the password.

2138
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:22,440
So instead root to enter this.

2139
02:38:22,440 --> 02:38:25,560
And it will also take some time to

2140
02:38:27,520 --> 02:38:29,520
to this website

2141
02:38:29,520 --> 02:38:40,920
to be online now.

2142
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:45,960
But you can also log in right now to see

2143
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:49,920
again please.

2144
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:52,520
Now, unfortunately, we cannot do it again

2145
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:57,160
for now.

2146
02:38:57,160 --> 02:38:59,520
Just in just two pieces of information,

2147
02:38:59,800 --> 02:39:02,520
the database,
the password will take some time.

2148
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:08,760
And once you get password, you just need
to enter the password in here

2149
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:11,840
and you will be a you will be connected

2150
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:14,720
to this database that have just created.

2151
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:16,920
Let me try a bit of fresh.

2152
02:39:18,480 --> 02:39:21,240
Yes. Now check your email moment.

2153
02:39:21,240 --> 02:39:25,960
Now check your email.

2154
02:39:25,960 --> 02:39:28,160
Yes, you guys can name it.

2155
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:30,440
Let's say maybe

2156
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:43,560
free school.

2157
02:39:43,560 --> 02:39:44,440
Check your email.

2158
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:57,360
The guy is for the passwords.

2159
02:39:57,360 --> 02:40:00,000
But if you have received the password,
send it to me.

2160
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:12,320
Please see me.

2161
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:17,840
You guys have also destroyed
the server of my super database.

2162
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:20,880
There's a lot of people
trying to sign off.

2163
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:23,240
At the same time,

2164
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:25,440
you have to have someone

2165
02:40:25,440 --> 02:40:31,240
to save the password.

2166
02:40:31,240 --> 02:40:34,640
Oh, great, great, great moment.

2167
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:42,520
Maybe we should wait for a few minutes.

2168
02:40:42,520 --> 02:40:44,840
We need to do DDoS attacks than you.

2169
02:40:45,400 --> 02:40:50,560
Yes. Now you guys are good, and the next
things I will teach you in the next class.

2170
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:56,600
Those who have created the connections,
you guys can leave.

2171
02:40:56,600 --> 02:41:01,080
So once you receive the password, you
just need to enter that password in here

2172
02:41:01,800 --> 02:41:02,760
and that's it.

2173
02:41:02,760 --> 02:41:17,640
You guys are going to go,

2174
02:41:17,640 --> 02:41:21,040
okay, so I have received the password
I click on.

2175
02:41:21,040 --> 02:41:33,080
Okay, click on connection.

2176
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:35,960
No moment.
This is not the correct password.

2177
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:37,520
You have sent me the account number.

2178
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:44,360
So suddenly the password,
if you have received it

2179
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:07,520
incompatible nonstandard server word

2180
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:11,040
and blah blah blah can be established
by some of my.

2181
02:42:11,440 --> 02:42:12,360
Okay, it's fine.

2182
02:42:12,360 --> 02:42:14,640
You can ignore this and click on.

2183
02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:15,320
Okay.

2184
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:18,520
Now if you guys click on free school

2185
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:22,760
and now you guys have access to a database

2186
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:27,160
on which guys can do anything.

2187
02:42:27,160 --> 02:42:32,400
Creating new tables, create
deleting the data, creating new functions,

2188
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:37,320
procedures, creating primary gives foreign
keys, everything.

2189
02:42:37,320 --> 02:42:41,320
I will teach you how to do everything
at least once in the next class,

2190
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:45,440
how to delete tables, rename papers,

2191
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:48,680
how to delete that, modify
the data and all that.

2192
02:42:48,840 --> 02:42:55,960
Yes, you are the admins
and all for this database,

2193
02:42:55,960 --> 02:42:58,160
but please don't do this on your jobs.

2194
02:42:59,200 --> 02:43:05,280
The user name is database name.

2195
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:08,320
This is the user name. I share this one.

2196
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:10,680
Yes, I think it is

2197
02:43:10,680 --> 02:43:13,680
same as your database. No.

2198
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:20,400
All right, guys, take some rest
and I will see you on Saturday.

2199
02:43:20,960 --> 02:43:21,920
What is the host name?

2200
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:30,920
This is the host name.

2201
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:31,800
All right, guys.

2202
02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:34,920
Bye bye. Take care.
