1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,120
All right,

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,720
let's get started.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,840
How is everybody doing, guys?

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,560
I hope everyone is doing good.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,440
Having fun with selenium, right in Java.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,120
Hope you guys now covered collections.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,200
I ran this list

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
all right.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,840
Okay, good, good.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,520
Because we're going to be using them
today.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,840
A lot.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,680
I'm good. Thank you.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,640
I hope you guys completed the homework
for Selenium as well.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,120
I hope it was fun.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,840
And it won't confuse with homework.

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,240
Okay, Got it.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,000
The first round.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,240
Okay.

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,280
All right.

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,840
Any questions from the homework, guys?

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,160
My questions should be good.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,360
All right, good.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,320
All right, so let's do a quick recap right
as we usually do.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,520
What did we cover last class, guys?

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
Just selectors.

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,200
Okay.

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,320
What do we know about Season selector?

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,480
What is it? CSA selector. You guys.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,640
What do we need it for?

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,360
Okay, we can't use text.

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
Okay.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,960
In comparison to what?

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,400
What?

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,600
Where can we use text? What?

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,640
What does it mean?

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,040
Select CSA selector

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,800
is another locator
that helps us locate the element.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,520
Okay, good.

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,600
Another way of locating elements
on the web page.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,560
Absolutely right.

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,560
And what does it look like?

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,000
It is similar to which other locator

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,120
like X path, but it's faster
and it is a little cleaner.

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,960
Right? So it's more readable than x path.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,280
Okay, So

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,160
what did we learn about CSA?

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,800
So what can't we do?

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,240
We set
we cannot locate an element by text.

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,040
If you want to use CSA selector.

50
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,200
Right.

51
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,560
No text.

52
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,680
What else? There. Okay.
So it has shortcuts.

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,920
It has shortcuts in identifying
that idea in class.

54
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,200
Right.

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,840
What is the shortcut for it in class?

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:01,040
Guys?

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,640
Okay. It's Dot, right?

58
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,840
That for class

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,440
and the
pound or hash tag, whatever for it.

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,680
And we also said that you cannot go back
and forth right

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,480
in the inside the notes, inside the mail
if you're using CSA selector.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,360
Right. Okay.

63
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,920
What about the methods, guys?

64
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,120
What about the methods
that we covered for CSA selector?

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,880
What?

66
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,680
How can you manipulate the values

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,520
of attributes?

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,920
Okay, We talked about

69
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,000
contains.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Starts with and ends with.

71
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,760
Right.

72
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,040
Do we have and switch and CSA scars?

73
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,760
Yes. Right.

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,600
And we don't have the next path.

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,560
We have the SAS.

76
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,920
And what's the symbol for ends
with in CSA selector.

77
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,120
You guys.

78
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,000
It's our favorite sign, right?

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,880
It's a dollar sign. There you go. Nice.

80
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,480
What about starts with

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,600
starts with the carrot sign.

82
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,320
Right.

83
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:30,160
And what about contains?

84
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,240
It is a

85
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,440
asterisk.

86
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,680
Or it is a

87
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
star. Right.

88
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,760
Okay.

89
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,360
Sounds good. Okay. What else did we cover?

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,440
Last class, guys.

91
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,040
There we go.

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,520
So we covered some web element commands.

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,240
Last class as well.

94
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,120
What kind of element commands
did we cover?

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,040
Last class, guys.

96
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,440
Is enabled.

97
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,000
Is displayed.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160
What else?

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,800
Get is

100
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,440
get and web element commanders.

101
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,960
No. Right.

102
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,320
It's not a web element command
because we were using get

103
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,680
whenever
we want to navigate to a website right.

104
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,840
So we also have is selected
well we covered get text

105
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,160
right
and we covered the get attribute value.

106
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,000
Right.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,840
Okay, good.

108
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,160
And we also we also also submit, right?

109
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
Correct.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,800
And we also did one task
where we got all the links

111
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,680
from the eBay website right.

112
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,160
And we used what locator did we use
in that example?

113
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:05,080
Guys?

114
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,360
What locator guys?

115
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:23,160
How did we find all the links
inside the eBay guys?

116
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,640
We use tag name. Right.

117
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,920
So we identified all the links inside

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,520
that eBay website by the tag name.

119
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,520
Right.

120
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,960
So the tag name is a it's
going to get us all the links

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,800
and then we started inside the red list.

122
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,880
And what we did, we looked through each
and every web element.

123
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,560
We got the text
and we're printed everything out.

124
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,080
Right. Okay, good.

125
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,280
Any questions from the last fast guys?

126
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:12,120
Any confusions from the last class?

127
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,720
All right, good.

128
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,960
So today, what we're going to be doing,
guys, we will be handling

129
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,640
checkboxes and drop checkboxes,
radio buttons and the dropdowns.

130
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,560
Okay.

131
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,360
So I hope you guys
did some research on this class.

132
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,480
So what do we know about checkboxes, guys?

133
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,800
What is checkbox or what is the radio
button on the website? Guys

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,280
Collection

135
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,520
of forever
that have us or the elements by its index.

136
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,920
Okay, good.

137
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
What about checkboxes and radio buttons?

138
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,520
CheckBox typically lets us
choose multiple elements.

139
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,040
Radio boxes. Only one choice.

140
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,000
Absolutely right.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,360
So we have checkboxes, right?

142
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,160
Which
which are the elements on the website.

143
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,360
They give us some options to check. Right.

144
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,880
And in checkboxes, what we can do,
we can select one

145
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,160
or more options
if we want to do that in radio buttons.

146
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,760
What we

147
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,120
it is

148
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,600
almost
the same, but it is options as well.

149
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,400
But we need to choose only one option
from there.

150
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,680
Right.

151
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,000
And Button is something you click
you put the check on.

152
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,120
Okay.

153
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,520
Difference
between radio button and check box.

154
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,480
You can select radio buttons, mouth

155
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,080
one radio and multiple for checkbox.

156
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,760
Exactly. Okay.

157
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,120
All right.

158
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,320
So this is what
we're going to be doing today.

159
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,360
And then we will be covering the dropdowns
as well.

160
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,280
So handling

161
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,720
checkboxes and

162
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,400
radio buttons.

163
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,800
Okay. So

164
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,720
check boxes of Philip Ball

165
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,080
and radio buttons are clickable.

166
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,120
Okay, probably.

167
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,440
But. Well, they both
they're both clickable and they're both.

168
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,160
Philip Well,
I think in terms of selenium technicality.

169
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,160
Okay, So in order

170
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,640
for us to check anything on the check box

171
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,000
or to check anything on the radio buttons,
there is two ways of doing it.

172
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,440
Okay.

173
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,280
So if you have only one
checkbox on the page

174
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,720
or if you have only one
radio button on the page, what you can do

175
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,720
is you can identify that element
and what you can do.

176
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
You could just simply
go ahead and click on it.

177
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,360
Okay, So that's one way of doing it.

178
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,120
But if you have multiple choices, right,
if you have like four or five checkboxes

179
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,720
or four or five radio buttons,
you need to choose between those.

180
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,760
What do we need to do in that case, guys?

181
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,840
How do we handle multiple elements?

182
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,520
Last class.

183
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,680
Okay, you do find elements, right?

184
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:36,480
What are you getting in return?

185
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,080
You get that list of web elements, right?

186
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,640
So once you have that container in hand,
what are you doing next?

187
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,920
Guys?

188
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,360
So you have that container

189
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,320
you need to go through each
and every element inside that container.

190
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,040
And then you need to
you need to perform some actions.

191
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,120
Right.

192
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,800
Last time, what we did,
we got all the links.

193
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,480
We saw them in that container, right?

194
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,840
We saw them in the list.

195
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,080
And what we did,
we looked through each and every link.

196
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,400
We had some conditions.

197
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,320
We got the text,
we got the attributes right,

198
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,480
and what we did
were printed them out inside our console.

199
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,600
All right. So let me put it here.

200
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,880
If you have only one

201
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,280
checkbox or

202
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,840
radio button, you can just

203
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,200
click on it.

204
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,600
Right? And

205
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,920
if you have multiple choices,

206
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,800
then what you can do,
you can store them in a list, right?

207
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,600
Store them and list and well,

208
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,240
okay.

209
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,480
And then perform any actions
you need to perform.

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,600
Right?

211
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,160
Store them first
and then loop them through conditions.

212
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,080
Exactly.

213
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,000
So this is what we're going to be doing
in our next

214
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,280
example.

215
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:15,760
Okay.

216
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:25,160
So let me create a new package in here,

217
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,720
and I'm going to create a new class

218
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,520
and I'll name it as

219
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:44,320
demo.

220
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,240
Okay?

221
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:53,400
See, there should be checkbox.

222
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,520
Okay, There we go.

223
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,560
All right.

224
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,920
So what we're going to do, guys,
right now, so

225
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,280
we will be navigating to this website

226
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,200
and what we're going to do,
we will be interacting

227
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,560
with these four options
that we have in here.

228
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,200
Okay. All right.

229
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:24,120
Any questions
before we move forward, guys?

230
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,240
Okay, good.

231
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,440
So what I'm going to do, let me just

232
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,880
copy this

233
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,760
and what's the password

234
00:13:48,760 --> 00:14:01,920
and log in for what?

235
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,920
We don't need any log in passwords

236
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,200
and any any credentials
to go to this website.

237
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,760
Right.

238
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
It's probably
you're talking about this one.

239
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,000
This is different
and this one is just selenium.

240
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,920
Practice website for syntax. Okay.

241
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,880
All right.

242
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,680
So, okay, before we get started, guys,
so every time

243
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:30,200
what we have in here,
we put our zero inside this get right.

244
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,880
Is there any other options that we can

245
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,120
we can have this URL in a different place,

246
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,000
guys.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,680
No, no, I'm saying,

248
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,600
is there any way we have this URL

249
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,360
in a different place?

250
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,080
Okay, a variable. Okay.

251
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,280
Where can we store that variable

252
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,360
class in array?

253
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,440
We can store it in a string, right?

254
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,280
In a simple string.

255
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,360
So do we want to store it in here?

256
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,560
Like, say, string?

257
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,040
Your role is equal to this one, right?

258
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,160
And then just get this in here

259
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,240
and paste it in here, all right?

260
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,920
And then we can do this.

261
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,480
So if I do this,
what kind of variable would this be?

262
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,800
On line 11 guys?

263
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,040
What kind of variable am I having

264
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,760
exactly?

265
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,480
We have a local variable, right?

266
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,320
Absolutely right.

267
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,480
What if I want to take it
to another level, one level up, guys.

268
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,280
What kind of

269
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,360
what kind of variable
would I have in that case?

270
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,120
I would have an instance variable, right?

271
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,480
So that means if I,

272
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,280
if I want to create an instance variable,
where do I where

273
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:27,320
do I start? It?

274
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,080
Inside the class and outside the method.

275
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,440
Right.

276
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,400
So we have this method right now,

277
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:36,640
right?

278
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,800
This is our main method.

279
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,240
So what I need to do, I need to store this

280
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,560
inside the class, but outside the method.

281
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,440
But here when I start,
this seems like this is not reachable.

282
00:16:51,440 --> 00:17:01,120
What's going on, guys?

283
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,360
This static?

284
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,240
Why do I need to?

285
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,080
Why do I need to make it static?

286
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,040
Because I have a static method.

287
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,880
Right? Exactly.

288
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,160
So my main method is a static,

289
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
so you can only use static

290
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,160
static variables inside this static
method.

291
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,800
Right. Is that clear?

292
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,640
You guys

293
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,800
do static or.

294
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Let's do it public static string.

295
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,640
Okay.

296
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,240
There we go.

297
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,280
Any questions on this?

298
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,200
All clear. Right.

299
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,440
So we're storing it outside.

300
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,040
Now we have a static variable euro

301
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,360
and just calling it inside the line 13.

302
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,120
Okay, so now we have a URL.

303
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
All right, So we navigate there.

304
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,520
We navigate it here.

305
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,280
So I want to interact
with those four options that I have.

306
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,080
So let me inspect this page.

307
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:09,960
Okay.

308
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,080
So now I need to identify these elements

309
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,120
and then I need to

310
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,480
I want to check some of them.

311
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,600
We don't know which ones yet,
but let's identify them first

312
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,280
and then we're going to figure out
which ones we're going to check.

313
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,200
Okay. So here,

314
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,680
this is my option, right?

315
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,720
So this is my option one.

316
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,000
And I have different options in here.

317
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,400
So how do I locate these four elements?

318
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,080
What am I using?

319
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,240
What attribute
am I using in order to get these

320
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,520
for this

321
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,560
class?

322
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,400
We don't have class checkbox, right?

323
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,440
We have class of this value
and type of the checkbox

324
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,080
or this class.

325
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,400
Okay. Okay.

326
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,400
So let's try this. Okay,
so let me do this.

327
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,840
I may open up this selector.

328
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,440
Right.

329
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,560
So let's do div.

330
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,520
We have class in here is equal to

331
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,960
checkbox.

332
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,160
Right.

333
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,080
If I do this,
how many elements do I have right now?

334
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,440
I have six. Right.

335
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,160
So how many elements do
I need to locate Guys

336
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,000
I need to look at four.

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,080
Exactly.

338
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,440
So if you look,
if I go through each and every element

339
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,160
that I found right now,
you can see option one, two, three, four.

340
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,200
And then here I have this checkbox

341
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,600
and I also have the checkbox
at the very top.

342
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,080
But I don't need these two extra
checkboxes, right?

343
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,800
So we need to narrow down our search guys,
how would I, how would we do this?

344
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:23,520
We need to change something in here.

345
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
What can we also use?

346
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
Can we use the value attribute? Does

347
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,880
input

348
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,320
okay, we need one of four, right?

349
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,800
So if we have a class in here,

350
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,160
so we have.

351
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,960
Okay guys, take a look at this.

352
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,360
We have this

353
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,880
type of checkbox,
we have class of this KB element

354
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,600
and we have value option one, which one
can we use so that we can only find

355
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,840
four elements. Guys

356
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,160
value.

357
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Okay, so let's try the value and see.

358
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,000
Okay, so we have an input in

359
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,400
here, have value and we have

360
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,080
option one.

361
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:31,480
What happened in here guys?

362
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,520
What could do contains.

363
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,840
Yes, but

364
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,000
here I only found one.

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,840
Okay.

366
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,240
So without using contained
without extending my x,

367
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,840
is there any other way

368
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,760
surge. Okay.

369
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,800
Said to use the class. Right.

370
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,560
So yes, let's do class
and I'm going to copy this

371
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,120
pasted in here.

372
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,720
All right.

373
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:16,920
So what do we have now, guys?

374
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,720
Have the right elements right now.

375
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,960
Guys. No.

376
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,120
Still. No.

377
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,400
Why not?

378
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,200
Yeah,
let me go through the elements right now.

379
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,840
So one, two, three, four.

380
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,280
And it goes only

381
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,960
through the elements.

382
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
It is one of four.

383
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,240
This is what we need, right, guys?

384
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,320
We need only these four elements, guys.

385
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,360
Okay?

386
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,720
So we are trying to interact only

387
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,640
with these four options.

388
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,720
Is that clear, guys?

389
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,000
Why this x path?

390
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,640
Why this X path is going to work for us?

391
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,600
Because we want only to work
with these four elements, okay?

392
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,240
We want only these four options

393
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,120
and we need to interact with these four.

394
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,480
Okay, So I'm going to copy this x pack

395
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,920
and go back to our code.

396
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,520
Okay.

397
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,960
So now it's time for us
to identify the elements

398
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,920
and then we need to store them
inside the container.

399
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:32,800
Right?

400
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,440
So driver, start

401
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,440
this time we're doing
find elements, right?

402
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,800
Because we're trying to interact
with multiple elements at the same time

403
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,680
and we're trying to store them
enough in the list.

404
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,760
All right, find elements.

405
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,000
What are we finding it by?

406
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,480
We finding it by X path

407
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,720
and just going to pasted in here,

408
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,800
finish my statement
and then what I will do,

409
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,240
I will store them inside the list

410
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,920
of what elements of this option

411
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,040
checkboxes.

412
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,920
All right,

413
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,520
so import this element in here

414
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,120
and import the list.

415
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,800
Okay. All right.
So we have this right now.

416
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,000
So line 18,
we have a container of web elements.

417
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,640
So what is my next step?

418
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,680
How do I see how many

419
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,320
how many elements do I have

420
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,800
inside my container right now

421
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,320
we can simply do

422
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,880
list size, right?

423
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,120
What is it going to return to us?

424
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,480
What am I going to have in return?

425
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,240
Guys?

426
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,040
I'm going to have an integer. Right?

427
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,280
So integer to do size is equal to

428
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,080
option checkboxes, dot size.

429
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,680
And let's print it out real quick

430
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:18,120
and here and let me run this.

431
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,240
Okay, so let's run this.

432
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:29,840
What am I going to get in console guys?

433
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,400
Okay.

434
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,480
We should be getting four elements, right?

435
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,560
So let me go back in here.

436
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,240
There we go.

437
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,280
So inside my console, I had four.

438
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,720
That means in my container
I have four different elements.

439
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,840
Right? Okay.

440
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:45,960
All right.

441
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,440
So now what I want to do,
I want to go through each

442
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,000
and every web element,
and then I want to click it

443
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,760
one by one.

444
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,640
This is the X path right here. Right.

445
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,360
So now what I want to do,
I want to go and create a loop in here.

446
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,040
Okay, So for loop, right?

447
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,120
So I am

448
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,800
looping through

449
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,280
these through this container, right?

450
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,440
And what am I looping through, guys?

451
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,000
What are the,
the things that I have in my container?

452
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,280
What are those?

453
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,800
They are web elements. Right. Okay.

454
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,000
So I'm looking through each
and every web element in here.

455
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,560
And I could do option.

456
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,880
And what I can do is

457
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,760
my next step is going to be what guys?

458
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,720
So I'm looping through each
and every web element.

459
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,080
So now what I need to do,

460
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,560
I just simply need to go ahead and click

461
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,040
on that element.

462
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,400
Right?

463
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,360
So what I'm going to do in here, guys, I'm
going to pause this

464
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,480
for one second so that we can see
the difference how this goes.

465
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,160
Okay?

466
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,000
Because if I don't do this, it's going
to go really fast and it's just going to

467
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,800
check all the checkboxes right away.

468
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,960
This way we're going to be seeing
how everything is running.

469
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,800
Okay,
So I'm going to run this and let's see

470
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,480
how this is going to go.

471
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,160
There we go.

472
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,560
So we are we checked all the checkboxes

473
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,680
by using one for loop and we just collect
each and every element.

474
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,120
All right. Pretty cool, right, guys?

475
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,680
Any questions on these

476
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,000
or of these?

477
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,040
All clear.

478
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,960
Okay, so let's go back in here.

479
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,560
So now what I want to do,
I want to click on option two guys

480
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,480
out of all these for what I want to do.

481
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,640
I want to click
only on that option for option two.

482
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:29,880
How can I do that?

483
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,640
Any guesses

484
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,840
in loop

485
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,120
will get the text.

486
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,960
And then what we can do is if condition

487
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,280
get value

488
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,720
web element two one okay,

489
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,240
so we can do that, but
that's going to be a hard coding, right?

490
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,640
So what if what
if this option two goes somewhere else?

491
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,400
What if this option two goes under the
option three or it's going to get messed?

492
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,920
Then our web element
one is not going to work, right?

493
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,840
So if you if you want to interact

494
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,360
with these four elements
by using indexing, then

495
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,160
no matter when it's going to change,
your code is not going to work.

496
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,840
Okay?

497
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,480
So that's going to be considered
as hard coding and in the future

498
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,200
it won't really be a dynamic, right?

499
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,240
So you have to keep changing your code
once anything changes on the on the

500
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
user interface. All

501
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,080
right.

502
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,200
So now let's go ahead and get the text,
guys, okay?

503
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,640
And see how this is going to work.

504
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:42,720
Okay.

505
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,040
So when I get the text
from the web element, what am I getting in

506
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:55,160
return?

507
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,240
I'm getting a string value, right?

508
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,320
The string, as do this text, is equal to

509
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
option,

510
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,080
get text right.

511
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,640
And now we need to have a condition here
so that we can click

512
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,120
on one of the checkboxes. Right.

513
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,120
So I have in this condition and here
if my text

514
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,040
right equals to ignore case, that's fine

515
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,280
equals option to

516
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,080
right only then what I will do,

517
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,520
I'll go ahead and click right.

518
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,520
So once I click, what do I need to do?

519
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:44,400
Guys?

520
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,000
Do I have to do anything else in here?

521
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,280
It goes.

522
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,960
We need to break the loop right?

523
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,680
Or we go

524
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,600
to break the loop in here.

525
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:13,400
So let's run
this and see what's going to happen.

526
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,040
Okay.

527
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,040
Seems like it didn't

528
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,400
seem like it didn't click.

529
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,720
It didn't work, right? Why?

530
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,840
Any guesses, guys?

531
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:37,240
Why this didn't work?

532
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,080
No, we're getting the text right, guys.

533
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,000
So if you look at that, if you
look at the text, I need option two.

534
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,320
Right?

535
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,000
There's no dashes in in the text.

536
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,600
All right.

537
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,400
So if you look at the text in here,
there's no dash.

538
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,040
There's no dash in here
and there's no dash in here as well.

539
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,080
Any other thoughts, guys?

540
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,880
Look at the element
which I am locating right

541
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:23,640
now, guys.

542
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:32,480
This finding option one, it's
one out of four.

543
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,840
Yes, exactly.

544
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,320
It is a checkbox only. Guys,

545
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,680
look at this.

546
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,440
If I go if I navigate to the label tag,

547
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:57,800
what am I locating now?

548
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,200
Now I am locating the whole option one.

549
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,040
Right?

550
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:08,120
So if I move to input,
I am only locating the small box

551
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,120
that is in saw on the website.

552
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,400
Guys where only locating the small square

553
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,440
it doesn't have text or anything.

554
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,560
That's
why whenever we starting to get text guys,

555
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,120
it's not working for us.

556
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,040
Is that clear guys?

557
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,360
So right now if I want to get the text,

558
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,680
it's only getting the square, small square

559
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,000
that I can only insert
the check inside it.

560
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,200
Okay.

561
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,320
Is that clear, guys?

562
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:52,960
Any questions on this?

563
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,720
Okay,
so now, since I am only getting those

564
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,040
those small squares.

565
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,840
Right, but I need to have a condition
anyways, Right.

566
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,360
So instead of a
instead of getting to get to X right.

567
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,840
Instead of having a text, what can I have
that I have a condition for

568
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,600
get attribute.

569
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,040
Okay.

570
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,240
So if I get attribute,
what what attribute would I get

571
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:37,320
in here?

572
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,000
Value.

573
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,320
Right. Okay. There we go.

574
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,640
So now let me go ahead.

575
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,640
Instead of getting the text in,
let me get the attributes of value.

576
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,000
Okay.

577
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,640
So what I will do, get attributes

578
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,240
of a value right?

579
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,760
So this is what you say.

580
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,280
Yes. CheckBox

581
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,600
value, right?

582
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,440
So in here we place it in here.

583
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,360
So now what is my value attribute value?

584
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,960
In here it's option dash one,

585
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,720
right?

586
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,920
So now I need to fix it in here.

587
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,040
I need to put X and now let's run

588
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:38,640
this and see if this is going to work.

589
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,280
There we go.

590
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,320
So we navigate it.

591
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,320
So now you can see that only option two

592
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,800
is clicked
and it's checked right now, right?

593
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,200
None other options is checked.

594
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,120
So we wanted to check on the option to
so now we can check option two in here.

595
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,840
Okay.

596
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:13,560
Any questions, guys?

597
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,080
I'll clear. No questions.

598
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,320
You sure, guys?

599
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:22,600
Is everything clear?

600
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,520
Only one clear.

601
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,880
You guys passive today?

602
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,840
What's going on? Guys?

603
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,200
What happened?

604
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:43,080
Seems like you guys are not having fun
with Selenium anymore.

605
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:51,600
Okay, Okay.

606
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Okay, Focus.

607
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,440
All right, so this is how.

608
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,320
This is how we handle the checkboxes
and radio buttons, guys.

609
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,120
Okay?

610
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:08,240
So and even if you go to work guys,
you will be seeing the same implementation

611
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,040
where you store everything in the list
and you try to loop through it.

612
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,280
You have the condition
and you click on any

613
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,040
text or value you want to click.

614
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,000
Okay.

615
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,720
So this is pretty generic implementation
and usage of how to handle the checkboxes.

616
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,640
And the same way it's going to be

617
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,640
with the radio buttons as well.

618
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,960
Okay.

619
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,080
You could just what you could do, guys,

620
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,400
you could just pay attention
to what I'm doing right now here,

621
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,720
and then I'll give you a time to type
in, right?

622
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,760
So I'll give you a couple of minutes
so that you can

623
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,040
you can type
that's going to be better for you.

624
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,600
Okay.

625
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,520
All right.

626
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,080
Okay, guys.

627
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,800
So if there is no questions,
let's go ahead and start

628
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,120
talking about the dropdowns, guys.

629
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,840
Let me see.

630
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,040
Actually

631
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,520
see this

632
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,920
here.

633
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,800
Okay.

634
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,000
All right.

635
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,760
Guess what?

636
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,040
Let's talk about the dropdowns. Okay.

637
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,080
So what do we know about the dropdowns?

638
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,640
Did anyone do any research?

639
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:55,560
Is what's dropdown
how to handle the dropdowns?

640
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:15,800
Anyone, guys, any guesses on dropdowns?

641
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,680
Oh, assuming everyone left

642
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,360
or everyone fell asleep.

643
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,840
Okay, guys,
I need you to be a little more active.

644
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,320
Okay, guys,
so that I know what is going on.

645
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,800
Otherwise I'm just going to be explaining
to no one whatever it is.

646
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,000
Right?

647
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,440
And we're going to just go without

648
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,320
no questions
and we're going to finish the class.

649
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:44,800
And I'm not going to even know
what's going on.

650
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,400
What uses a HTML tag?

651
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:58,760
Okay, What is the dropdown guys?

652
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:06,200
Do we know what the dropdown is?

653
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,840
List of web elements.

654
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,960
Dropdown is like a selector based on

655
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,040
predestined options.

656
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,000
Okay, so it's a list of options.

657
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,720
Like it's like a menu.

658
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,000
All right, so you open it
up, you see multiple options in there

659
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,080
and then you can select any of these

660
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,880
right?

661
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,320
Okay.

662
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,720
Predetermined.

663
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,080
Okay.

664
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:40,520
There we go.

665
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,960
All right, so a dropdown is just a menu,

666
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,480
right?

667
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,720
Or again, it's a container which

668
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,320
contains some options
where we can go there

669
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,680
and click or choose
any options that would like.

670
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,080
Okay, so let's go ahead

671
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,240
into our notes in here

672
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,600
and for the up downs.

673
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,760
Right?

674
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,520
So the dropdown is

675
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,640
a menu,

676
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,240
right.

677
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,320
Which

678
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,240
gives us

679
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,720
simply

680
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,360
to select

681
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,280
options.

682
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,880
Okay.

683
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,120
So you can select either one
or multiple options

684
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,120
for checkboxes.

685
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,640
Yeah. That that's this should be enough.

686
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,600
This as I said,
checkboxes and radio buttons are

687
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,520
they have a generic way to handle, right.

688
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,800
So if you have only one checkbox or radio
button, you could just click on it.

689
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,760
And we do know how to click on the web
element, right?

690
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,680
But if you have multiple, then you need to
store them in a list loop through.

691
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,320
You will have some conditions in there and
you need to perform actions accordingly.

692
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,920
Right?

693
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,360
All right, cool.

694
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,640
All right.

695
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,360
So for the dropdown is it's a menu, right?

696
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,080
Or a method
which allows a user to select one or

697
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,680
multiple options, right?

698
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,360
So gives us opportunities.

699
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,120
Select, let's say one or

700
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,320
multiple options.

701
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,080
Okay.

702
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,800
So you could say select.

703
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,800
Okay.

704
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,120
Because in checkbox

705
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,440
you check in in radial buttons,
you are checking that small thing as well.

706
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,520
But in dropdowns
you need to select an option.

707
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:06,120
Okay.

708
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,600
All right.

709
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,360
So now, guys, how many types,

710
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,040
how many types of dropdowns do we have?

711
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,720
Does anybody know

712
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:30,720
if three types?

713
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:38,880
Okay, What are those?

714
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,280
Now, this is the way of selecting, right?

715
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,720
So these are the way
of selecting the options.

716
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,520
But I'm saying the
how many types of dropdowns.

717
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,360
So let me put types of

718
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,000
dropdowns.

719
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Yeah, I thought it would be one,
but it's not right.

720
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,360
Okay, so we got two types of dropdowns.

721
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,880
Okay, guys, One of them is single select.

722
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,840
One of them is multiple select.

723
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:20,080
Okay, so single select

724
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,680
and multiple

725
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,440
select.

726
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:34,920
All right.

727
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,120
So single select, pretty obvious, right?

728
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,800
You can only select one value
from that dropdown in multiple selects.

729
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,800
You can select multiple values,
one or more values from that dropdown.

730
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,640
Okay.

731
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,680
So now let's talk
about how to handle the dropdown.

732
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,520
Okay.

733
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,080
So and handling

734
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,000
dropdowns

735
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,000
in here.

736
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,080
Okay.

737
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,120
So first option is easy, right?

738
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:15,720
As we have done in checkboxes and radio
buttons guys, what you can do in here

739
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,440
simply right, you can click on

740
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,280
dropdown

741
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,520
and click on the option right
as you're doing it manually

742
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,000
clicking the dropdown, you expanding it
and clicking on any other option.

743
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,240
You are selecting that option, right?

744
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,680
So you can click it twice
or the second way of doing it.

745
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,000
What we can do is

746
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,680
we can handle the

747
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,840
dropdown by using a select class
from Selenium.

748
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,640
Okay, so using

749
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,520
select class.

750
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,360
Okay.

751
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,160
So we'll be going over
how to use a select class.

752
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,200
But first of all, guys,
what we need to make sure is

753
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,840
we need to take a look at the HTML
before we do this.

754
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,840
Okay?

755
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,640
So if we encounter
any dropdowns on the web page

756
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,960
and we want to go and use the select
class, first and foremost,

757
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,840
what we need to do
is we need to inspect that page.

758
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,840
We need to try to locate this dropdown

759
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,880
and we need to make sure
that this has a select tag.

760
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:30,960
Okay.

761
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,480
So if you don't have a select tag
whenever you're trying to interact

762
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,760
with the dropdown, you won't be able
to use this select class from the selling.

763
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:40,720
Okay.

764
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:50,440
Is that clear, guys?

765
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,840
Okay, cool.

766
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,800
So if we look in here, we can see that

767
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,800
this specific dropdown,
it has a select class.

768
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,960
I mean select tag in here.

769
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,840
So that means we can go ahead and use this
select class which comes from the

770
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,440
Selenium Library.

771
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,080
Okay.

772
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,680
Before we do that, let me put it in here.

773
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,920
Right.

774
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,400
In order

775
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,000
to use

776
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,480
select class,

777
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,800
we need to make sure

778
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,480
our dropdown as

779
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,280
select tag.

780
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:35,800
Okay.

781
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,080
Once we made sure that our top down
has a select tag only,

782
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,520
then what we can do is
we can go ahead and use this select

783
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,360
class from the Selenium label.

784
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,720
So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to create a new class in here

785
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,200
and say

786
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,720
top down

787
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,200
and links.

788
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,040
Okay, our

789
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,720
main method is here.

790
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,560
Actually, let me copy this

791
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,800
and paste it in here,

792
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,160
but we're going to need change
the URL, right?

793
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,440
Does everybody have the URL guys?

794
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,760
Okay, good.

795
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:31,480
All right.

796
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,400
So we're navigating to that page, right?

797
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,680
We're navigating to that page.

798
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,360
So now it's time for us to

799
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,640
locate that element first.

800
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:48,400
Okay, So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to go back to the page, okay?

801
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:55,200
What I will do, I will try to locate
the dropdown with a magic arrow in here.

802
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,720
And you can see when I expand this,
when I expand this select,

803
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,120
you can see that we have all the options

804
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,840
under that select tag.

805
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,840
Okay, So what I can do

806
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,720
is I need to
I need to locate this element first.

807
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,400
Okay, So in here
we have this ID for this dropdown.

808
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,160
So I'm going to be using this ID,
which is really reliable right now.

809
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,280
So I'm going to copy this

810
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,360
and I'm going to go back

811
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,680
to my class in here
and I'll start finding that element.

812
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,880
Okay? Driver

813
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,160
find element

814
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:49,320
ID and paste this in here, right?

815
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,800
So when I find the element
I'm getting in return

816
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,120
a web element here.

817
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,360
And what we can do is

818
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,320
a dropdown equal to this.

819
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,160
Okay, what is going on guys?

820
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:16,000
Why, why is this throwing me in there?

821
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,120
Exactly why? I need one more

822
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,880
of the parentheses. Right.

823
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,640
Okay.

824
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:22,560
All right.

825
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,240
So now, guys,
before you use the select class,

826
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,200
you need to first
make sure that you have a select tag.

827
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,960
And then what you need to do is
you need to lock that

828
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,800
dropdown by ID,
by any locator you're comfortable with,

829
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,640
and you need to store it
inside the variable off of that element.

830
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,640
Okay, so now what I am going to do,

831
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,520
I need to create an object
of the select class in here.

832
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,440
Okay.

833
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,800
So what I will do simply
the select select is equal to new

834
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,000
select.

835
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,440
Okay, so

836
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,360
close this.

837
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,840
So now guys, you see it's not fully

838
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,880
compiling in here
and is complaining that we need

839
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,120
we need to add something
inside the parentheses.

840
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:13,840
Right.

841
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,320
So whenever you're using a select class
inside the constructor guys of a select,

842
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:23,960
you need to provide that dropdown
you're going to be interacting with.

843
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,320
Okay,
So in this case I have this web element.

844
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,880
I have this dropdown
that I need to perform some actions on.

845
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,840
I'm going to copy that variable
and I will paste it inside of parentheses.

846
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,120
Okay. Is that clear? Guys?

847
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:53,160
Any questions?

848
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,080
All right, let's see

849
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,680
why we created an object

850
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,320
because we want to perform
some actions on a dropdown.

851
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,280
Okay.

852
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,320
So in order to interact with the dropdowns
guys, we need to use a select

853
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,000
class from Selenium
in order to use the selenium class.

854
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,280
What we need to do,
we need to create an object of that class

855
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,480
only then just for the dropdown.

856
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:31,880
Correct.

857
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:42,120
Any other questions, guys?

858
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,400
Select is just the object.

859
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,280
Yes, select is just the class guys.

860
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,480
Okay, so let me actually see
if I can navigate there.

861
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,640
There you go.

862
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,760
So this is the class that we will be

863
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,280
getting the methods from.

864
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,800
Okay,
so we created an object of this class.

865
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,120
This class is located inside our

866
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,520
what's called Selenium library.

867
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,440
Okay,

868
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,200
select one item.

869
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,440
Select the first one.

870
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,160
Okay.

871
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,280
You need to
you need to imported from selenium.

872
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:26,120
Okay. Yes.

873
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,120
It requires a web element as well.

874
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,840
That's why we paste it in here.

875
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,440
That's why
it will locate that dropdown first

876
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,760
so that we can paste that
variable in here.

877
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,640
Okay.

878
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,040
So once we have that

879
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,880
object on hand guys, now we will be

880
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,640
interacting with the dropdown

881
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,480
and we will be selecting some options
from there.

882
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,760
Okay, So now let's

883
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,760
go ahead and talk about
how many ways we can do

884
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,840
and we can select the options

885
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,760
from the dropdown guys.

886
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,800
Any guesses?

887
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,800
So some people said there was three ways,
right

888
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,880
when I asked for two types of
drop downs guys.

889
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,880
So there is three ways

890
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,000
of selecting an option

891
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,600
inside the dropdown.

892
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,200
So one of them is selecting by index,

893
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,280
selecting by visible text

894
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,000
and selecting by value.

895
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,040
Okay, so three ways.

896
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,160
So selecting

897
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,080
an option from dropdown

898
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,760
will be done

899
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,240
three ways.

900
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:51,800
Okay.

901
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:58,880
So one of them is by index,
the other one is by

902
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,880
visible text, then by value.

903
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,240
Okay, so three ways guys.

904
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,640
First is by index,

905
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,560
by visible text, whatever
we see on the dropdown options, Right.

906
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,120
And by the value attribute in here. Okay.

907
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,440
So you see these value attributes.

908
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,360
So these are
which we are going to be using

909
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,680
for the values.

910
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,480
Okay. So let's go back

911
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,480
inside our code and go through

912
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,360
those ways one by one.

913
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,360
Okay.

914
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:43,840
So since I have an object right now, what
I can do, I can use this object, right?

915
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,080
I can use this object and start selecting
any options in there.

916
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,120
Okay.

917
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,160
So what I can do, do select
when I click a dot in here,

918
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,240
you can see that select
by visible text, select

919
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:01,240
by value and select by index.

920
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,360
Okay,
So we'll start by selecting by index.

921
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,160
Okay.

922
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,000
And what we need to pass in here,
we just need to pass an integer in here,

923
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:11,760
right?

924
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,800
So we, we have days dropdown, right?

925
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,200
So we don't have a lot much options
in here.

926
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,360
So what we can do is

927
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:24,760
let's

928
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,880
go ahead and select any of those in here.

929
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,160
So let's see three. Right.

930
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,200
So if I put a three in here okay guys,

931
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,080
if I put three in here,
which day am I going to get selected

932
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:52,920
in here?

933
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,680
Tuesday. Okay. Some people Monday.

934
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,720
Oh, Thursday.

935
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,800
Okay.

936
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:14,880
So I'm having a third index in here.

937
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,920
I said the elements
that they don't start here

938
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,960
from zero.

939
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:30,640
You don't service.

940
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,200
Oh that was okay.

941
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,720
So. Okay, okay. Okay.
You talking about the X path?

942
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,800
Okay, so an x path is a little different.

943
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,840
Guys in here, it's a little bit different.

944
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,680
Okay, So let me run this and I will
explain to you what is going on in here.

945
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,560
Okay.

946
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,240
So let me run this.

947
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,640
So there is a lot of different answers
in here.

948
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,200
Wednesdays, Tuesdays, Monday, Sundays.

949
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:54,720
Right.

950
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:59,080
So let's run
this and see what's going to happen.

951
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,240
All right, So I run this.

952
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,960
So now. So now

953
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,840
it's selected Tuesday.

954
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,360
Okay, So now, guys,
what I was talking about

955
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,400
when I was talking about X path.

956
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,560
Okay, okay.

957
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,040
Let's say

958
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,760
when when you are trying

959
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:24,920
to locate the element by x path
and by its index.

960
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,960
Okay, So just think about it logically.

961
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,800
When you do.

962
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,840
Let me see.

963
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,520
So let me open it up in here.
This selector.

964
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,840
Okay, so whatever x path it is, right?

965
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,000
You have this tag in here,

966
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,280
you have everything in here, right?

967
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,200
So now what you need to do,
you need to pass something in here, right?

968
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,360
In order to identify this by index.

969
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,680
Okay, So logically, you guys,
if you think you can't

970
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,680
really identify the element

971
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,280
that zero, right.

972
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,120
So logically, if you think you cannot
really identify that element zero

973
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,520
because your element you starting,

974
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,840
you start to count the elements from one,

975
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:16,560
Right.

976
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,880
But it's still cold as indexing in here
and it's different

977
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,360
if you go to the technical
and you go to the coding part,

978
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,800
the indexing starts from zero.

979
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,080
Okay. Is that clear, guys?

980
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,120
That is a little bit weird. Yes.

981
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:35,960
But when you go when you try to talk
about the scripting itself,

982
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,720
your indexing is going to start from zero.

983
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:40,640
Okay.

984
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,440
This is not the Java language.

985
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,320
This is not it.

986
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:49,240
This is just an express
and this is how it works.

987
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:49,760
Okay.

988
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,600
And it's just a query language, right?

989
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:54,960
Okay.

990
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,520
So don't get confused, guys.

991
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,000
It's just indexing.

992
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,520
Whenever you're doing, whenever you do
an export, you start from one.

993
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,240
Whenever you go to your code,
you start from zero.

994
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,760
Okay. All right.

995
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,520
So now, guys,
I selected the third element in here,

996
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,880
and now it's selected the Tuesday.

997
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,760
Okay, So let me go ahead and open this up.

998
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:21,960
Okay.

999
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,160
Why did it selected?

1000
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,400
Choose it If if my day start from zero

1001
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,200
guys, take a look at the HTML

1002
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:40,920
that we have right now.

1003
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,920
Please select in here guys

1004
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,600
is an option as well.

1005
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,920
So you look at the tags in here

1006
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,040
inside the select, I have options, right?

1007
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,840
So whenever you try to select something
by using a select plus,

1008
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,440
it will look for options in there.

1009
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,200
Okay.

1010
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,520
So if you look at the very first option

1011
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,520
that we have, it is it says please select.

1012
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,200
But it also says disabled guys.

1013
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:20,560
Okay, So please select is also considered
as an option, but it is disabled

1014
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,400
because you won't be able to select a

1015
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,400
okay, is that clear guys?

1016
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,800
So is

1017
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,440
what's called

1018
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,120
Please select will be your zero
and then after that

1019
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,200
you will start from 1 to 3

1020
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:44,720
and go, okay,

1021
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:52,320
that's clear.

1022
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,160
Okay, good.

1023
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,200
All right, so now let's go back in here.

1024
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,720
So we selected that select
a Tuesday, right?

1025
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,480
So now let me actually put a

1026
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,480
some import in here so that we can
visually see what is going on.

1027
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:08,240
All right.

1028
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,760
I'll just put it for one second.

1029
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,800
So now let's select
an option by the visible text.

1030
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,000
Okay.

1031
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,760
So what I can do simple, select that.

1032
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,400
Select by visible text.

1033
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,200
Okay, so what do we want to select guys

1034
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,600
one day, Wednesday.

1035
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,640
So Friday, right?

1036
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:41,160
Friday is a good day, guys,
because the next day is Saturday,

1037
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,920
so we don't have to go to work,
but you guys have to come to class.

1038
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,160
So sorry guys.

1039
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,280
Which they wish that.

1040
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,440
Yeah, that's what I,
that's what I just thought about guys.

1041
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,160
Okay.

1042
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,080
Thursday is a small Friday.

1043
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,360
Okay, let's do Thursday.

1044
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:02,640
Guess.

1045
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:10,440
Okay, so let's do Thursday.

1046
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:10,720
All right.

1047
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,840
So when you do select by visible text,
you obviously need to pass

1048
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,840
a string value selecting by index.

1049
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:23,880
You need to pass the integer in here,
selecting by visible text

1050
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,480
you are passing the string in here.

1051
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,960
Okay, so let me run this

1052
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,800
and see what's going to happen

1053
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,440
nowadays.

1054
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,000
Good day.

1055
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,120
Until graduation.

1056
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,400
I thought you guys were enjoying this.

1057
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,120
Yeah. Okay.

1058
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,920
There we go, guys.

1059
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,920
So it's selected Tuesday now?

1060
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,720
It's selected Thursday. Okay.

1061
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,480
I hope you guys saw the difference.

1062
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,600
What was going on inside,

1063
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,960
what's called inside the dropdown

1064
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,560
Java on Saturday. Sunday.

1065
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,720
Not fun. Okay.

1066
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,200
Okay. To complain to Oscar.

1067
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:14,640
Okay.

1068
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,840
All right.

1069
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,240
Okay, guys.

1070
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,640
So we selected the Tuesday by index.

1071
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,240
Now we selected Thursday by it's text.

1072
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,920
So let me give it

1073
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,320
another second

1074
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,720
and let's do select.

1075
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,800
So now let's ahead and do the last

1076
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,160
way of selecting the web element.

1077
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:52,320
I mean the option in here,
selecting by the value.

1078
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,160
Okay.

1079
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,400
So when I select an option
from the dropdown by the value guys,

1080
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:05,400
you need to go ahead
and get the value of the value attribute.

1081
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,400
Okay, guys, is that clear?

1082
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,880
So you don't get this text.

1083
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,440
You need to get the actual value
of the attribute.

1084
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:25,920
Okay, guys, is that clear?

1085
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,480
You want to type the code? You mean

1086
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,320
of the value?

1087
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:37,920
Yeah, you can.

1088
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,000
You can type it in. Yeah.

1089
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,040
So if you want, let's do a Sunday now.

1090
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:45,720
So what you can do, you can put here

1091
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:52,280
as the value of the Sunday.

1092
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:56,040
So let me run this
and see what's going to happen.

1093
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,440
So there should be one Tuesday, Thursday
and Sunday.

1094
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,440
Right.

1095
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,160
So because we're selecting
three different values Tuesday, Thursday

1096
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,800
and now it is Sunday.

1097
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,600
Okay.

1098
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,960
Pretty cool, right, guys?

1099
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,360
So there's three ways of selecting

1100
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,600
and we know all of them right now.

1101
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,840
Any questions, guys? Any questions?

1102
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:25,200
How to select any values from the dropdown

1103
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:38,280
guys?

1104
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,760
Is there a preferred way for dropdowns?

1105
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,320
Yeah.

1106
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:50,480
You mean the selecting.

1107
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,000
So the preferred way is always go

1108
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,720
probably by the visible text. Okay guys.

1109
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,440
So that's going to be the most safe way,

1110
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:14,640
the safest way for you to go and select
some values.

1111
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,600
Okay. Yes.

1112
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,360
So what's the difference between by

1113
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,120
selecting by value and visible text?

1114
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,400
So I will show you here, guys.

1115
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,080
The text is the same
and the value is the same.

1116
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,200
But we will be go into a different
example, guys,

1117
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,200
and I will show you
what is the difference between these two.

1118
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:42,960
Okay.

1119
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:55,800
All right, guys, any other questions?

1120
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,160
All right.

1121
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,640
If there's no questions,
let's take a quick break.

1122
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,800
Okay, guys, and then we will continue

1123
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,520
handling different, different dropdowns.

1124
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,280
Okay.

1125
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,680
So 15, let's get at 830, guys.

1126
01:08:14,280 --> 01:25:11,760
Okay.

1127
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,800
All right, guys, let's get back.

1128
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:15,640
All right.

1129
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,600
And continue

1130
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,200
on our dropdowns.

1131
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:34,880
Let's see, back home, the people we got.

1132
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:41,000
Okay, cool.

1133
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,360
Okay, guys. So in the first half, we said

1134
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,320
we'll learn

1135
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,400
how to interact with the elements

1136
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,280
in the dropdown.

1137
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:52,800
All right?

1138
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:56,400
And we know there's three ways
to select any

1139
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,400
to select any

1140
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,960
options from the dropdown

1141
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,480
by index, by visible text,
and by the value.

1142
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:06,040
All right.

1143
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:13,400
So now, guys,
what if I want to get all the options

1144
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:19,080
that are available
inside, this dropdown space,

1145
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,240
How would I do this

1146
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:27,480
is multiple.

1147
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:31,240
We'll show you if if you can select one

1148
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:34,720
or if you can select multiple values
on that dropdown.

1149
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:35,960
Okay.

1150
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,080
So that's
a little different method in here.

1151
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,280
So I want to have all the options

1152
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,280
available inside the dropdown.

1153
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:49,440
So what we can do is there is a method

1154
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:53,960
with which we can use,
it is called get options.

1155
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,600
Okay, so what I can do is select

1156
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,880
the right get options in here.

1157
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,560
Okay, so what is this going to return me
guys?

1158
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:16,240
Let's see
what what am I getting in return?

1159
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:18,480
Is it going to return me?
Only one web element.

1160
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:20,480
I'm getting the list.

1161
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,040
I'm getting options. Right?

1162
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:26,720
So it's going to return a list of web
elements in here.

1163
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,760
So what I will do,
go ahead and create a list of web

1164
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,920
elements in here.

1165
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:36,520
A list of Web element.

1166
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,280
I'll say all options.

1167
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:41,320
All right.

1168
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,400
And import the list.

1169
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:43,680
Okay.

1170
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,600
So what I am going to do?

1171
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,200
Let me

1172
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,760
comment this part out.

1173
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:52,560
Okay.

1174
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:57,720
So now I have the container
with all the options in here.

1175
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,080
All right?

1176
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:03,880
So I want to know how many options
I have inside my container.

1177
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:13,040
Now, what am I going to do in here, guys?

1178
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:16,600
I simply need to get the size right.

1179
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,720
So integer

1180
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,400
size is equal to all options

1181
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:26,160
size.

1182
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:30,360
And what I can do,
I can just point this out.

1183
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:34,120
Okay, So let's let's run this and see

1184
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:43,760
what's going to happen.

1185
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,960
There was no one here.

1186
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:51,600
So how many options do we have here, guys?

1187
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,480
We have eight options, right?

1188
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,800
Why do we have eight options?

1189
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:03,280
But we have seven days, guys,

1190
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,240
because the first disabled option

1191
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:10,760
is also considered as an option,
even though it is disabled.

1192
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,840
Right. Okay, good.

1193
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,240
All right. So now, guys,

1194
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:20,720
what I can do, what I want to do,

1195
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:23,040
I want to get the

1196
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:27,000
the text from each option,

1197
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,480
print it out, and then select one by one.

1198
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,280
How would I do this?

1199
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:39,600
Guys?

1200
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,000
Okay, I'm getting the text, but what am I

1201
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:46,760
what do I need to do first, guys?

1202
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,560
How am I going to reiterate
the same step guys?

1203
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:52,000
We a four guys, right?

1204
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,280
So what I will do, let's create

1205
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,200
a regular for loop this time, guys.

1206
01:29:58,440 --> 01:29:59,360
Okay.

1207
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,560
So integer four

1208
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,600
is equal to where do I start from? Guys

1209
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,760
start from zero, right?

1210
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:13,000
Zero one Which one

1211
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,800
does?

1212
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:18,760
Okay,

1213
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,280
okay, okay. Okay. All right, guys.

1214
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:21,960
There we go.

1215
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,600
Java zero. Right.

1216
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,040
So we just talked about it, right, guys?

1217
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:30,560
So. So let's go.

1218
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,560
Okay, so let's start with zero.

1219
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:37,080
Okay, Let's start with zero
and see what we can do in here.

1220
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,240
Okay, So

1221
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:42,040
zero and then

1222
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,640
is less than the size we have, right?

1223
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,400
And then I

1224
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,360
plus plus because we need to be

1225
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,760
incremented by one.

1226
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,960
Right. Okay.

1227
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,480
So what I need to do, I want to print each

1228
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:02,880
and every option text
that I have inside my dropdown.

1229
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,040
So how would I do this?

1230
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:10,760
Guys?

1231
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:13,960
How do I get the visible text from

1232
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,600
from these elements? Guys

1233
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,280
get text.

1234
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,960
Okay, so let's do string

1235
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,280
option text, right?

1236
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,360
Is equal to

1237
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,280
all options.

1238
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,320
Seems like I don't have get text guys.

1239
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:49,440
Why not?

1240
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,320
Exactly.

1241
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,960
Sorry, we have to get

1242
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,760
high. Right.

1243
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,960
So we iterating by using a regular
for loop right now.

1244
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:06,200
So we need to in
we need to insert here and index.

1245
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:06,520
Right.

1246
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:10,280
So we get the AI and then we get the text.

1247
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:11,520
Okay.

1248
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,480
So now we have an option text in here.

1249
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:18,000
What I can
do. Let's print this out in here

1250
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,240
and option text.

1251
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:25,320
So let me run this
and see what kind of options.

1252
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:31,120
We get.

1253
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:35,280
All right.

1254
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:39,360
I mean, this.

1255
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:40,320
Okay, guys.

1256
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:44,040
So if we look at this here,
so we got all the options.

1257
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,240
We we even got the option,

1258
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:51,480
which is disabled, which is select, right?

1259
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:58,240
So we got all the days in here
and we've got the disabled as well.

1260
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:02,280
So now what I need to do, I want to select

1261
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:06,720
each and every option in that dropdown

1262
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,800
in the interval of one

1263
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:13,480
second guys,

1264
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:19,440
how would I select any, any option
from that dropdown in this loop?

1265
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:24,400
Guys, which

1266
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:35,200
which way would we use in here?

1267
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:36,120
Select by index.

1268
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:46,040
Why are we selecting by index?

1269
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:46,800
We don't.

1270
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,800
We don't really need to use regular
click right.

1271
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:54,240
Since we already have an object
of the select class, we can use those.

1272
01:33:54,240 --> 01:33:59,160
One of the three
that we just talked about right?

1273
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,280
We using the regular loop. Right.

1274
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:04,200
That's why we can use an index, right?

1275
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:08,400
So what I can do is select

1276
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:13,400
select by index and we can simply pass

1277
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:19,480
the integer I in here
and I will give it a second

1278
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:23,280
so that we can see

1279
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:27,800
visually what is going on
when everything is getting selected.

1280
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:28,200
Right.

1281
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,600
So let's run this and see

1282
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:41,880
what we're going to have.

1283
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:45,360
Okay, There we go. Sunday

1284
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:48,560
and Monday and all the days one by one.

1285
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,120
And here.

1286
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,160
All right, there we go.

1287
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:56,520
So we selected everything one by one, by

1288
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:01,080
giving one second of intervals
so that we can see everything.

1289
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,800
What is going on? Facial. Right.

1290
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,280
Pretty cool, right, guys?

1291
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,760
So we could do it by regular full loop.

1292
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,240
We can do it by

1293
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:13,280
the advanced for loop
and we're going to have an exercise

1294
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,880
where we can do it with iterator
as well. Did you guys

1295
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,800
go over the iterator as well?

1296
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:21,960
I hope you guys did. Okay. Good.

1297
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:25,560
Okay. Nice.

1298
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,640
All right.

1299
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:32,680
So, okay, guys, any questions?

1300
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:38,800
Any questions on how to get the options,
how to loop through the dropdown

1301
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,880
or how to

1302
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:45,080
select any option from the dropdown.

1303
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:46,800
Pretty easy, right?

1304
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:51,600
So you create an object
you use whichever way you want to use.

1305
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,480
Three ways that we discussed.

1306
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:54,960
You want to get options.

1307
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,920
You can store that in there

1308
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:00,360
in the list of web elements
and then you loop accordingly.

1309
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,040
You select according.

1310
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:02,880
Okay.

1311
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:08,120
All right. So

1312
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,560
let's see.

1313
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,920
Okay, So now let me create

1314
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,520
one more class and let's do one test here.

1315
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:36,760
So the method

1316
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:59,720
is part.

1317
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:09,200
Okay, Let's go to Amazon now.

1318
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:09,600
All right, guys.

1319
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,000
So we are on Amazon Web page.

1320
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,640
So there's a lot of different elements.

1321
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,400
So there is one dropdown
that we have in here,

1322
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:23,520
and what I want to do will be
I want to interact with this dropdown.

1323
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:29,280
So now this dropdown has a lot
of different options in here.

1324
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:31,800
Okay.

1325
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:34,440
So what I do,

1326
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:37,200
let me inspect this page.

1327
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,400
Okay, So what I want to do guys,

1328
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,160
I want to

1329
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,960
get all the options

1330
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:50,280
from the job from this dropdown
that I just showed you guys

1331
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:54,840
and I want all the options
printed in my console.

1332
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,720
Okay. Is that clear?

1333
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:57,480
You guys

1334
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:11,960
clean

1335
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,800
and prime dropdown.

1336
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,560
Oh, this one.

1337
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:23,160
Okay, let's see.

1338
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,680
Okay, guys.
So that's a good question actually.

1339
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:32,520
So in here, guys,
let me make this one small.

1340
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,480
Okay, so we got this one right?

1341
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:42,040
So this is considered as dropdown because
it has a lot of different options, right?

1342
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:46,040
But if I go to the Prime,
do I have a lot of options in here?

1343
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:49,200
Guys?

1344
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,320
No. Right.

1345
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:54,040
So this is not a job done. This

1346
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:57,040
this is just an element.

1347
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:57,720
Okay.

1348
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:04,040
So and if you pay attention to this guys,
so if I go to this job down in here,

1349
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:07,120
in order for me to see

1350
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:09,840
the guys, I need to click on this.

1351
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:11,400
Okay?

1352
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:14,960
If I don't click on this all dropdown,

1353
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:17,760
I'm not going to be able
to see any options.

1354
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:19,640
Okay?

1355
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:22,920
But if I go to the prime,
I don't even have to click on it.

1356
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:26,280
I just hover over my mouse and you see

1357
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,600
the additional pop up comes up.

1358
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:33,440
Okay, So if you're dealing with dropdowns

1359
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:37,680
guys, dropdowns will have different
different options for you.

1360
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:44,120
Okay, so this is considered
as just a regular element.

1361
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:47,400
And I will I will come to this point later

1362
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,840
during the course, guys,
how to handle these kind of elements.

1363
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,520
Okay. Yes.

1364
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,800
It doesn't also have the select tag.

1365
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,520
Yes, that is correct.

1366
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,000
Okay.

1367
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,640
So we will be dealing with
this kind of elements later in the course

1368
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,760
where you don't have to click.

1369
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,640
You could just hover over your mouse

1370
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:08,040
and you will see different,
different elements.

1371
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:10,600
Okay, what's here for the dropdown?

1372
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,560
You have to click in order.

1373
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,280
You see the options.

1374
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,680
Okay. All right.

1375
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:21,440
So you click
on the dropdown next to America Slack.

1376
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:30,600
Okay.

1377
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,080
Yes, we okay,
so I don't have to click on this, right?

1378
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:38,000
I don't, I didn't click,
so I just hover over my mouse and it up

1379
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:41,000
and it comes up in here.

1380
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:45,960
And if you want to see this one, okay,

1381
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:50,600
so this one, let's open it up.

1382
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:54,400
So this is this doesn't, is not considered

1383
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:59,160
as dropdown as well.

1384
01:40:59,160 --> 01:40:59,880
Okay.

1385
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:03,800
So it has,
it has like languages in here. Yes.

1386
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:08,880
But it also have it also has different
lengths in here as well.

1387
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:09,760
Okay.

1388
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,400
So if you if you working with dropdowns
you will have only

1389
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:16,520
one type of the options.

1390
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,400
Okay.

1391
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:21,680
So if you see in here
you only have like departments.

1392
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:26,280
Okay, so these are the departments
you need to work on.

1393
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,920
These are the options of your departments.

1394
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:29,640
Okay.

1395
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:33,480
But here you also but here you have your

1396
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:37,360
what's called the language.

1397
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:41,920
You have some other links and
you also have changing the country region.

1398
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,920
So this is different, right?

1399
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,800
So this is
this is considered as just an element.

1400
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:48,440
Okay.

1401
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:56,040
This wouldn't consider as a dropdown.

1402
01:41:56,040 --> 01:42:02,440
Okay, good.

1403
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:05,120
Any other questions, guys?

1404
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:09,400
So if you look at this element as well,
you will see that here

1405
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,200
we have different different things
and I don't have to click on that.

1406
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,960
Yeah, it can be a menu yet.

1407
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:18,360
Yeah, this is just a

1408
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,640
I'm not sure if it's language menu
or whatever menu

1409
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:25,200
it is, but here you see it
account and list menu,

1410
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:28,840
right in here.

1411
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:30,120
I don't have to click on this.

1412
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:34,920
I just hover over my mouse in here
and you can see that you list your account

1413
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:37,240
and you need to sign in
and all that stuff.

1414
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:40,320
Okay. All right.

1415
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,480
So what I want to do, guys, I want to

1416
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,200
I want to get all the options

1417
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,720
from this dropdown and
I want to print it out inside my console.

1418
01:42:50,240 --> 01:42:53,960
Okay, So we are navigating to Amazon.

1419
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:55,520
So what is my next step in here?

1420
01:42:55,520 --> 01:43:05,280
Help me out and here goes.

1421
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,960
Now anyone?

1422
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,920
What is my next step? Guys

1423
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:20,920
list?

1424
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:28,800
Okay, what am I storing inside the list?

1425
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,720
Sorry. Okay, find the web element.

1426
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,800
Okay, so find the web element.

1427
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:43,920
So if I find this web element,
what do we know about this? Now?

1428
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,000
We're going to use the select
class guys in here.

1429
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:57,960
Or what are we going to do?

1430
01:43:57,960 --> 01:43:59,520
It's not select.

1431
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:04,840
Why not?

1432
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,640
It has a select tag, right?

1433
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,280
So that means we should be able
to use this select class

1434
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,680
right before we store everything in the

1435
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,720
in the Web element.

1436
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:22,000
I mean, list of web elements, right.

1437
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,920
So we need to what we need to do.

1438
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,440
We need to identify the dropdown
itself, guys.

1439
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,840
Okay. Like we did in the previous example.

1440
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,920
So in here I have my ID,

1441
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:36,960
right?

1442
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:40,800
So what I'm going to do
is get a copy of this idea and I need to

1443
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:45,600
check if we have a select tag, right,
So we have a select tag.

1444
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,160
So that means we already know that.

1445
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,800
Okay, so we have an idea.

1446
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,200
We have a select tag.

1447
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:54,680
What we can do, We can use select class,

1448
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:56,400
right?

1449
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,520
This is what you need to think right away.

1450
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:01,600
Whenever you are dealing with dropdown.

1451
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,320
Okay, so I copied the ID.

1452
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:07,920
We have a select tag,
so I'm going to go back in here

1453
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:11,840
and I'm going to create a web element

1454
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,680
web element

1455
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:17,680
categories, dropdown

1456
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:22,480
or departments dropdown,
whichever you want to name it.

1457
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:25,520
Find element by ID.

1458
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,800
All right, paste this here.

1459
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:29,280
There we go.

1460
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:31,800
So we have our element

1461
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,360
stored inside the variable right now.

1462
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:42,360
So now what I need to do,
I need to create a select object, right?

1463
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:46,320
Since we have a select select tag now,

1464
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:50,360
we can create a select

1465
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:56,040
object in here.

1466
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:58,880
And what we do, we paste that

1467
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,760
variable inside the constructor here.

1468
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,960
Okay. Is that clear? Guys?

1469
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,720
Any questions on lines

1470
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:18,320
18 and 19?

1471
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,000
Okay, good.

1472
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,560
So now what is my next step, guys?

1473
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:25,920
So what I want to do,
I want to get all the options.

1474
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:41,560
I want to print them out
inside my console.

1475
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:44,400
Okay? So we could get the size. Yeah,
we could get the size.

1476
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:47,160
But would it be
necessary for this task? Does

1477
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:50,280
no. Right.

1478
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:56,160
So we could just start storing everything
inside the list.

1479
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,240
Right.

1480
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:59,360
So let's of

1481
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,840
web element.

1482
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:03,360
Right.

1483
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:08,960
What we can do options is equal to select

1484
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,120
that get options.

1485
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:12,360
Right.

1486
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:15,360
And don't forget to import the list.

1487
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:16,640
Okay.

1488
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:19,440
So we have all the options
inside the container.

1489
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:22,880
Now, what we need to do,
we need to iterate

1490
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,640
through each and every of those elements.

1491
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:26,400
All right.

1492
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,880
So now this time, let's use
this advanced for looping here.

1493
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:31,800
Okay.

1494
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:36,520
So I am iterating through all the options,

1495
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:39,680
but I am also iterating through each

1496
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:45,880
and every web element.

1497
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:46,800
Right. Okay.

1498
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,400
So we have a for loop in here.

1499
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:59,400
And so now what I need to do in here,
guys, now I'm not clicking right,

1500
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:02,080
I just need to print it out
inside my console.

1501
01:48:02,080 --> 01:48:09,680
Guys.

1502
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:13,920
Okay, So we need to get the text.

1503
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,800
The string

1504
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,440
option

1505
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,480
text is equal to

1506
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:24,240
option, get text.

1507
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:29,040
And what I will do,

1508
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,960
I will print out the option text.

1509
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:33,480
Right. Okay.

1510
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:36,240
So let's run this and see

1511
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:48,600
what we're going to have.

1512
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:53,360
Okay.

1513
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:55,760
Here. There we go.

1514
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:00,440
So let's
go back and expand this a little bit

1515
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:07,080
so you can see each and every option
inside our console.

1516
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:09,640
Right? Pretty cool. All right, guys.

1517
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:13,600
So now we've used regular for loop
to get all the options.

1518
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:20,040
Now we can use the advance for loop
to get all the options as well.

1519
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:20,800
Okay,

1520
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:28,120
Nice.

1521
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:30,360
At 40 miles an hour.

1522
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,960
It's easy, right, guys?

1523
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,600
Or Probably

1524
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:40,000
or probably you guys are typing
and listening to me at the same time.

1525
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:46,760
That's why
it seems like I'm going to fast.

1526
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:47,200
Okay.

1527
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:51,680
I'm going to push the code anyways
at the end of the class guys.

1528
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:55,600
So if you don't if you missed something,
I could just go back.

1529
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:59,240
You can really type in
or just wait until the end of the class.

1530
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:00,600
I'm just going to push all the code.

1531
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:01,840
Okay, guys,

1532
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:04,280
typing, answering, listening.

1533
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,360
That's good, guys. Multitasking tasking.

1534
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:08,080
That's very good.

1535
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:19,840
Okay, guys, any questions in here?

1536
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,840
Okay, so now let me show you

1537
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:27,600
the difference
between selecting by visible text

1538
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:31,720
and selecting by value.

1539
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:33,680
Okay.

1540
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:38,000
So, okay, guys, in the previous example,
we saw that

1541
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:44,280
the text, the visible text and the values
the same.

1542
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:48,960
Right, like Monday, Tuesday, Sunday,
whatever it is here

1543
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:52,600
we have audible books and originals.

1544
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,840
But you see that the value is different.

1545
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:57,280
Okay?

1546
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:01,240
The attribute value
is completely different in here.

1547
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,600
Okay.

1548
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:06,000
So if I want to select let's say
let's let's say

1549
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,160
I want to select Alexa skills in here

1550
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:12,120
and I want a selected by value.

1551
01:51:12,120 --> 01:51:18,320
Okay, So what I am going to do,
I am going to copy this value, okay?

1552
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:20,640
I'm not going to touch the text in here.

1553
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:25,800
I'm going to get and copy
this value of the attribute

1554
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:29,200
and go back to my script after.

1555
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:30,240
The for loop.

1556
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:32,440
What I will do, I'm going to select,

1557
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,360
select by value and what I will do.

1558
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:39,960
I'm going to paste this value
inside the parentheses.

1559
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:44,000
Okay, So now let's go ahead and run this

1560
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:46,400
and let's see

1561
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:53,960
if we can select value.

1562
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:54,600
Okay?

1563
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:01,080
Running Amazon.

1564
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:05,760
So we go, it's
probably going to print everything first.

1565
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:10,320
And now you can see that
dropdown has changed guys.

1566
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:13,640
You can see now it is Alexa skills.

1567
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,080
Okay, I hope everyone saw the difference
what was going on.

1568
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:23,240
So for the for the visible text

1569
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:26,080
you are selecting the text

1570
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:30,360
that is actually you see for the values

1571
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:35,160
you need to get the attribute
value of the value attribute.

1572
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:35,680
Okay.

1573
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:36,360
Is that clear?

1574
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:42,560
Guys, any questions?

1575
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,160
I hope now you see the difference
between the select by visible text

1576
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:51,320
and selecting by value.

1577
01:52:51,320 --> 01:53:03,520
Okay, good.

1578
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,520
Okay.

1579
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:14,520
There's the codex.

1580
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:14,880
Okay.

1581
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,800
10 minutes for you guys to type it in
and then we'll continue.

1582
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:27,600
Okay?

1583
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:30,480
Exactly. Also,
the text will be in a black color.

1584
01:53:30,480 --> 01:54:16,440
Exactly. Yes.

1585
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:20,360
I mentioned that it's better
for you to select by visible text.

1586
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:35,840
Correct?

1587
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:36,760
Sure. Okay.

1588
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:39,600
So selecting by value.

1589
01:54:39,960 --> 01:54:40,800
Right.

1590
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:44,360
So what you need to do in here,
if you're selecting by values,

1591
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:48,800
you need to get the value
of the attribute in here.

1592
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:52,360
Okay. Whenever you selecting by

1593
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:56,400
whenever you're selecting by visible text,

1594
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,680
this is the text that you need to get.

1595
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:01,520
Okay.

1596
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,480
The value,

1597
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:07,200
the attribute value of value attributes.

1598
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:12,160
Okay, it's a little confusing, but

1599
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:15,840
you can see here
you need to get this value

1600
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:19,680
and whenever you selecting by visible
text,

1601
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:39,760
you need to get this text in here.

1602
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:52,720
All right, guys, any other questions
before we move forward?

1603
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:53,520
Okay.

1604
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,640
I hope you guys are done typing

1605
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:01,800
and we can move to the next example

1606
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:19,680
that I want to show you.

1607
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:22,680
Okay. All right. Let's move forward, guys.

1608
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:26,080
So let's talk about now

1609
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:28,920
multiple select dropdown.

1610
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:30,280
Okay.

1611
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:34,720
So I'm going to open up
a new Java class in here

1612
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,680
and say

1613
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:45,960
multiple down

1614
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,680
have main method in here.

1615
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:54,480
So let's go back

1616
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:56,720
to this.

1617
01:56:56,720 --> 01:57:00,000
Let's say, okay, so here

1618
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,240
guys, if you look

1619
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:09,560
at this multi select

1620
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:13,240
list, Okay,

1621
01:57:13,640 --> 01:57:16,600
So if you look, I can if you see in here,

1622
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:22,640
I can select more than one value
inside this

1623
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:25,720
multi select list. Okay.

1624
01:57:25,720 --> 01:57:29,920
So this is it's not really a

1625
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:33,600
like an actual dropdown.

1626
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:34,320
As you can see.

1627
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:38,680
It doesn't drop down in here,
but this is a list where you can see

1628
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:43,840
where you can select one or more values.

1629
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:49,200
Okay, so this is considered
as multiple select dropdown.

1630
01:57:49,680 --> 01:57:50,920
Okay guys.

1631
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:55,720
So whenever you are able to select
multiple values inside the list

1632
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:58,720
or inside the dropdown that is considered

1633
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:01,520
as multiple select dropdown.

1634
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:04,200
Okay.

1635
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:10,000
Oh, we're working with this now and,
and what we will do is the same way

1636
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:16,240
as where we were doing with the single,
but we will be having some different

1637
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:20,400
or what's
called different methods in here.

1638
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:23,880
Okay, so

1639
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:27,040
let's go ahead and get started.

1640
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:31,120
So let's go back actually here and

1641
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:43,120
copy this, paste this in here.

1642
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:44,320
Okay.

1643
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:48,800
So in order for me guys to start

1644
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:52,920
interacting with a dropdown guys,
what do I need to do first?

1645
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:55,280
So I navigated to that page, right?

1646
01:58:55,280 --> 01:59:11,040
What is my next step here?

1647
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:11,840
Get the elements.

1648
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,520
So we need to find the element
first, okay?

1649
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:20,640
And then we need to check
whether it has the select tag or no.

1650
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:21,960
All right. Okay.

1651
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:24,600
So a magic arrow in here.

1652
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:27,320
There we go. So this is my element.

1653
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:32,400
We have a select tag in here.

1654
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:33,240
Yes. Right.

1655
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:37,800
So that means we should be able
to use select class in here.

1656
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:40,480
Right. So I'm going to expand this.

1657
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:44,440
You will see all the options
inside this dropdown.

1658
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:45,360
Okay.

1659
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:48,320
And we can use it as well in here.

1660
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:50,960
So I'm going to copy the value of ID

1661
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:54,320
and I'm going to go back here

1662
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:59,080
and I will create a not this one

1663
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,360
RGB element

1664
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:08,880
variable, these states, Right?

1665
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,760
Yeah. Okay.

1666
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,960
States dropdown because the drive

1667
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:16,960
or mind element

1668
02:00:18,200 --> 02:00:21,600
I and what I'm going to do

1669
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:24,160
is this is

1670
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:26,240
okay.

1671
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:29,520
So we figured out what was the idea.

1672
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:32,400
We have a web element variable in here.

1673
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:35,160
What is my next step now

1674
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,520
we need a select object, right?

1675
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:48,120
So select

1676
02:00:48,120 --> 02:00:51,680
select is equal to new

1677
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:57,720
select and inside the constructor.

1678
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:02,840
What I am going to do this
this self down variable.

1679
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:08,320
Okay, so now guys, so I have an object,
I have my variable.

1680
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,760
What I want to do is I want to know

1681
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:15,400
if my job down is multiple select or no.

1682
02:01:16,680 --> 02:01:17,520
Any guesses?

1683
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:23,040
How would I do this?

1684
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:23,600
There we go.

1685
02:01:23,600 --> 02:01:26,880
So we have a is

1686
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:31,400
multiple method
which comes from select class.

1687
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:34,200
Right? So what I can do in here

1688
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:40,200
select that is multiple.

1689
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:41,080
Right.

1690
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:44,200
Which will return us
a boolean value in here.

1691
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:49,320
So boolean

1692
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:50,920
is multiple

1693
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:56,240
is equal to this.

1694
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:56,520
Right?

1695
02:01:56,520 --> 02:02:01,800
And what I want to do,
I just want to print this out.

1696
02:02:02,160 --> 02:02:05,280
Okay, so I print this out right now.

1697
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:09,000
What am I getting in return? Dice

1698
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:14,240
If it's if it's a multiple select
that I'm getting a true value.

1699
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:18,120
If not, then we're getting a false value.

1700
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:18,400
Right?

1701
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:23,440
But in this case, since we were able to
select multiple values already manually,

1702
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:28,920
so we should be getting a true value right
as we did in our console.

1703
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:29,920
We have a true value.

1704
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:32,400
So that means our

1705
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:35,840
our dropdown is multiple select.

1706
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:37,000
All right.

1707
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:40,320
So now what I want to do, I want to get

1708
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:43,480
all the options

1709
02:02:43,480 --> 02:02:47,960
from, from that dropdown
and what I want to do.

1710
02:02:47,960 --> 02:02:51,320
I want to select each and every

1711
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,640
what's each and every option

1712
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,680
from that multiple select dropdown.

1713
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:01,200
Okay.

1714
02:03:01,200 --> 02:03:04,080
So now again
we're going to be looping through

1715
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,400
some of the options.

1716
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:10,560
But first, how am I going to,
how am I going to get those options? Dice

1717
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:17,480
when I need a list?

1718
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:18,200
Right?

1719
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:22,720
And what I can do is select that

1720
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:26,480
that option, which will return me

1721
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:30,600
a list of all the web elements

1722
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:33,480
inside that dropdown

1723
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:39,280
element

1724
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:43,200
options is equal.

1725
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:46,920
This.

1726
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,680
Okay, so what if guys I want to more

1727
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:55,360
if I want to get those options
only if my dropdown

1728
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,200
multiple select us.

1729
02:03:58,200 --> 02:04:00,120
How would I do this

1730
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:04,920
if condition right.

1731
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:06,640
So where do I put this?

1732
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:07,560
If condition go?

1733
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:13,840
So which line? 27.

1734
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:21,600
Okay, so if,

1735
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:25,840
if my dropdown is multiple right.

1736
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,280
What am I going to do then.

1737
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:32,440
I want to get the options only if there is

1738
02:04:32,680 --> 02:04:35,480
only if that dropdown is multiple.

1739
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:41,120
Select does.

1740
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:48,200
Then I have to get everything in here,
cut it

1741
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:53,640
and we need to paste it inside my
if condition.

1742
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:54,840
Right.

1743
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,720
So if it's not multiple

1744
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:02,440
then I'm not going inside this condition
and I'm not getting any options.

1745
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,080
Okay.

1746
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:10,000
So now what I want to do in here,
I want to create a for loop, right?

1747
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,040
And I iterate with each

1748
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:17,480
and every web element in here.

1749
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:18,440
Is that clear, guys?

1750
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:26,880
Any questions?

1751
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:29,400
Okay, No questions. Good.

1752
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:34,000
All right, so for loop in here,
so I am iterating through options

1753
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:36,000
container, right?

1754
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:42,120
And each and every option
that I have is a web element,

1755
02:05:43,880 --> 02:05:44,480
right?

1756
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:47,280
So now here

1757
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:50,280
what I will be doing,
guys, I need to get the text

1758
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:53,680
and I need to select

1759
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:55,000
what's called.

1760
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,280
I need to select each and every value
from that

1761
02:05:58,280 --> 02:06:03,400
dropdown.

1762
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:06,600
Exactly.

1763
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:09,480
So the next step for me

1764
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:14,440
would be getting the actual text from the

1765
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:23,120
SO string

1766
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:26,280
option text right is equal to

1767
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:28,640
select.

1768
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:30,560
No, not select

1769
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:33,880
option, but that's the text.

1770
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,760
And so which way in here

1771
02:06:37,880 --> 02:06:43,760
am I selecting that?

1772
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:54,240
How am I supposed to select all the values
guys in here get?

1773
02:06:54,240 --> 02:06:57,120
I But
why would I go with indexing in here?

1774
02:06:57,120 --> 02:07:12,680
Guys?

1775
02:07:12,680 --> 02:07:14,360
Okay, we don't need indexing here.

1776
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:25,480
What do we need in here?

1777
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:27,800
We can select by visible text,

1778
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:33,240
and from each iteration
we make, we're getting the next

1779
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:36,720
the next available text so we

1780
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:41,160
can paste that inside that method, Right?

1781
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:46,480
So select the select
by visible text in here.

1782
02:07:47,240 --> 02:07:49,560
And my visible text

1783
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:53,760
is the option text variable.

1784
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:57,000
And let's just give it

1785
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:03,720
that kind of a pause

1786
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:07,920
so that we can see
how it's going to select right.

1787
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:22,360
So let's run this go.

1788
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,480
So you can see that

1789
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:29,200
we're selecting each and every value

1790
02:08:29,560 --> 02:08:34,680
inside that dropdown one by one.

1791
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:37,200
Okay, Is that clear, guys?

1792
02:08:37,200 --> 02:08:44,560
Any questions?

1793
02:08:44,560 --> 02:09:04,320
Pretty cool, right?

1794
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:07,200
Okay. So selecting a few from the.

1795
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:08,280
Okay guys.

1796
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:09,960
So what are we doing here?

1797
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:13,280
We're getting all the options, right?

1798
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:17,400
So on line 27,
so we have all the options in hand.

1799
02:09:17,600 --> 02:09:20,040
We have it in a list of web elements.

1800
02:09:20,440 --> 02:09:24,320
So now all we're trying to do
is we're trying to go through

1801
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:28,240
each and every option that we have, right?

1802
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,720
So once we're doing this.

1803
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:33,840
So on the first iteration,
what I am doing,

1804
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:37,120
I am getting the text of the first

1805
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:42,000
option,
okay, once I get the text in there,

1806
02:09:42,280 --> 02:09:46,080
what I do is selected by the visible text.

1807
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:50,040
So on my first iteration is my text guys,

1808
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,400
if I get the text on my first iteration,

1809
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,120
what is my text?

1810
02:09:56,120 --> 02:09:58,920
My text should be California, right?

1811
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:04,680
So when it's California, what I am doing
is here I'm selecting by visible text.

1812
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:09,320
So I already got that text
and I pasted in here.

1813
02:10:09,720 --> 02:10:12,920
So every time I iterate through my
for loop,

1814
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:15,840
I'm getting a new text in here guys.

1815
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:19,640
Okay,
so that's how I am selecting by visible

1816
02:10:19,640 --> 02:10:22,960
text of the text of the text
that I got right now.

1817
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:27,840
Okay.

1818
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:29,240
Immediate

1819
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:33,640
the idea on line 21. Yes.

1820
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:38,280
So all we needed
is the idea of our job done.

1821
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:43,360
So if you look in here,
this is I am selecting my drop down.

1822
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:44,480
Okay?

1823
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:49,320
And since it has a select tag,
we can perform these actions

1824
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:51,640
by using select class.

1825
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:58,560
Okay.

1826
02:10:58,560 --> 02:10:58,880
Okay.

1827
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:01,600
So if you want to stop or New York. Right.

1828
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,280
So you're getting the text.

1829
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:05,520
You're getting the text.

1830
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:08,280
So what do you need
to do in here? Guys? Just

1831
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:11,320
just give me some ideas.

1832
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:17,520
So if I want this,
I want to stop in New York, okay?

1833
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:19,880
If condition and then you break your loop.

1834
02:11:20,160 --> 02:11:21,240
There we go.

1835
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:22,600
Easy, right, guys?

1836
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:24,720
So you're getting the text every time.

1837
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:29,520
So once you get the text
in, that text is equal to you to New York.

1838
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:33,840
Then what you need to do,
you need to write that loop

1839
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:37,080
and that you're out of your iteration.

1840
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:42,080
Okay.

1841
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:51,400
Any questions, guys?

1842
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:54,880
Okay. So there is one more thing.

1843
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:58,120
That one thing that we can do with

1844
02:11:58,120 --> 02:12:00,760
multiple select

1845
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:02,440
dropdowns,

1846
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:04,960
which we cannot do with single select.

1847
02:12:05,920 --> 02:12:10,720
Okay, So since we can do

1848
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:15,000
what's called,
we can select multiple values

1849
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:17,680
inside the

1850
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:21,040
inside the multiple select dropdown.

1851
02:12:21,240 --> 02:12:26,160
What we can also do,
we can select these values as well

1852
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:30,280
okay,
so what I'm going to be doing in here.

1853
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:31,720
So since

1854
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:34,520
if we go through this

1855
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:38,080
iteration, we're going
be selecting all the values, right?

1856
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:40,080
All the options in that dropdown.

1857
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:44,240
So what I want to do, I want to d

1858
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:46,440
select one of the values

1859
02:12:47,560 --> 02:12:49,440
and this selecting is happening

1860
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,560
the same way we selected.

1861
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:54,800
We select our options.

1862
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:57,720
So three ways guys by index,

1863
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:01,000
by value and by visible text.

1864
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:05,160
But what we can also do is d select

1865
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:07,320
all the options right away.

1866
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:12,600
Okay, so let's go actually

1867
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:18,640
to the class notes first.

1868
02:13:18,640 --> 02:13:24,200
And so in order to select

1869
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:30,000
to B select

1870
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,240
any option and drop down.

1871
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:36,600
Okay, so you need to first

1872
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:41,480
make sure that your dropdown
is multiple select.

1873
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,240
Okay, so

1874
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:47,760
now option in dropdown,

1875
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,320
make sure your top down is

1876
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:55,840
multiple select

1877
02:13:55,960 --> 02:13:58,760
okay and the methods you can use are

1878
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:04,480
I think it was the select

1879
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:07,560
value

1880
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:12,120
you can

1881
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:16,080
select

1882
02:14:23,560 --> 02:14:26,400
visible text

1883
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:36,360
and select index

1884
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:38,240
and you

1885
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:42,680
select by.

1886
02:14:42,680 --> 02:14:45,040
I mean we select all.

1887
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:48,160
Okay. Okay.

1888
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:52,720
So first of all guys,
if you want to d select any values,

1889
02:14:52,960 --> 02:14:57,360
you need to make sure your dropdown
is multiple select and.

1890
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:00,720
These are four methods
that you can implement

1891
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:04,520
to d select values from the dropdown.

1892
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:08,760
Okay, so.

1893
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:12,120
So what I am going to do,
since we already have the select

1894
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:15,920
object in here, will you select

1895
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:19,920
and will do this select by index

1896
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:22,680
and let's do index five.

1897
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:26,640
So if I do index five,
guess what's going to happen in here?

1898
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:29,880
Which one is going to get these selected

1899
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:44,000
with Texas, Ohio.

1900
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,280
Okay, what else?

1901
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:48,840
Okay. Texas or Ohio?

1902
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:53,280
Okay.

1903
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,480
Okay. All right. Texas or Ohio.

1904
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:58,400
Okay, so let's run this

1905
02:16:07,960 --> 02:16:08,440
where we go.

1906
02:16:08,440 --> 02:16:15,920
So we selecting everything in here.

1907
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:16,800
There we go.

1908
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:21,960
So we we selected it by index of five.

1909
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:27,120
So here it's going to be the Texas value,
which is the selected here.

1910
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:32,280
And what we also can do let me

1911
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:35,440
comment this out

1912
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:39,120
and lets you select everything right away,

1913
02:16:40,200 --> 02:16:42,480
okay, So let me run this.

1914
02:16:43,640 --> 02:16:56,840
We'll see how this is going to look.

1915
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:57,120
Okay.

1916
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:00,040
Selecting everything again

1917
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:06,720
variable and then these selected

1918
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:14,000
everything one by one, right?

1919
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,400
It starts from zero guys.

1920
02:17:16,400 --> 02:17:16,920
No, no, no.

1921
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:20,320
It's not going to start from one. Okay.

1922
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:22,360
We talked about this, right, guys?

1923
02:17:22,360 --> 02:17:25,800
X plus you start identifying

1924
02:17:25,800 --> 02:17:29,840
the elements with X path from one
because you cannot say,

1925
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:35,280
hey, this is the you can say that
this is the first second element, right?

1926
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:36,840
So think about it this way.

1927
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:38,040
This is the first element.

1928
02:17:38,040 --> 02:17:40,200
This is second element.

1929
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:41,840
But if you go

1930
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:45,360
in Java or if you go with Selenium,

1931
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:48,840
you will need to start
your indexing from zero.

1932
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:49,720
Okay,

1933
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:54,520
sure.

1934
02:17:54,520 --> 02:17:57,520
Let's put that down in notes

1935
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:07,600
indexing and Express

1936
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:14,160
starts from one.

1937
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:19,360
So indexing starts from zero.

1938
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:26,960
Okay.

1939
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:27,800
All right.

1940
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:43,320
Any questions, guys?

1941
02:18:43,320 --> 02:19:00,680
Any questions on dropdowns?

1942
02:19:00,680 --> 02:19:03,840
Okay, so let's do one more example, guys,

1943
02:19:04,080 --> 02:19:07,000
with the iterator.

1944
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:07,680
Okay?

1945
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:09,000
Since you guys already know

1946
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:12,800
what the narrator is,
you guys know what collections are, right?

1947
02:19:12,800 --> 02:19:15,200
So let's do one example with iterator.

1948
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:21,040
Okay?

1949
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:22,320
Iterator

1950
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:27,200
here.

1951
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:30,920
So let me see.

1952
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:35,320
Okay, So let's
actually go ahead and get for instance.

1953
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:37,560
Okay, So let's go ahead and

1954
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:40,200
copy this

1955
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:49,800
code sitting here.

1956
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:52,520
Okay. So we are navigating to Amazon.

1957
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:56,400
We know the ID of that dropdown, right?

1958
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:01,640
So what I want to do
guys, I want to check if this

1959
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:03,840
if this

1960
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:06,760
dropdown is multiple select
or not first guys

1961
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:11,120
and if it's not multiple select
only then I need to go

1962
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:15,160
and start iterating
through each and every option that it has.

1963
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:51,480
Okay,
so what do I need to do in here guys?

1964
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:55,480
Okay,
so let's get the boolean value right.

1965
02:20:57,040 --> 02:21:01,280
So still boolean is

1966
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:05,120
multiple is equal to select.

1967
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:08,640
That is multiple.

1968
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:11,080
Right? And

1969
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:13,400
my F condition only if

1970
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:18,560
only if my value is false guys.

1971
02:21:18,600 --> 02:21:19,320
Right.

1972
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:23,680
Only if it's not multiple select
only then what I want to do,

1973
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:27,080
I need go ahead and start iterating.

1974
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:31,360
So if I do this

1975
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:34,840
in here so I need it opposite, right?

1976
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:37,520
So I don't need it is multiple

1977
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:41,920
and I just need a exclamation
mark in here.

1978
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:46,480
Okay.

1979
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:47,600
What is better?

1980
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:50,240
It's always better to have.

1981
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:51,720
It's always better to have

1982
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:53,760
variables, guys.

1983
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:54,520
Okay.

1984
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:57,480
Like if you remember with

1985
02:21:57,720 --> 02:22:01,200
we were doing web element
combined with is selected, right?

1986
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:04,600
So we had to we had to check.

1987
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:09,240
So you already had one variable
so you don't have to check it again.

1988
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:10,120
Okay.

1989
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:15,680
So it's going to it's going to increase
your we use ability in the future.

1990
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:18,720
Okay.

1991
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:23,440
So what is my next step, guys?

1992
02:22:23,440 --> 02:22:27,120
So now we're trying to verify
if it's not multiple select.

1993
02:22:27,440 --> 02:22:41,840
So I want to get all the options now.

1994
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:42,120
Okay.

1995
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:45,760
So we need to list we need a list of web

1996
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:49,360
elements again, right.

1997
02:22:49,360 --> 02:22:51,400
Web element

1998
02:22:51,440 --> 02:22:55,720
in here, options is equal to select.

1999
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,920
Get. Right.

2000
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:00,920
So we have

2001
02:23:03,120 --> 02:23:04,120
options in here.

2002
02:23:04,120 --> 02:23:06,320
So what is my next step now, guys?

2003
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:08,600
So we're not using any for loop in here.

2004
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:11,840
We're going to be using
an integrated right.

2005
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,320
So what is the nightmare right here?

2006
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:23,840
First of all, guys,

2007
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:31,520
what is it going to help us to do?

2008
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:33,800
Okay, loop for collections. Okay.

2009
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:36,240
So what is an item?

2010
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:38,400
Is a class Is it an interface?

2011
02:23:38,400 --> 02:23:44,600
What is it, guys?

2012
02:23:44,600 --> 02:23:45,920
It's an interface, right?

2013
02:23:45,920 --> 02:24:07,080
So how do you create
an object of that interface?

2014
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:10,400
Can I do
iterator is equal to new either later goes

2015
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:16,760
can I

2016
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:28,760
read really?

2017
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:33,120
So if
I want to create an object of the iterator

2018
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:38,680
or any other interface,
how would I do this guys?

2019
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:41,360
So cannot directly.

2020
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:54,400
People say yes, come on guys,

2021
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:57,480
you guys should know this already

2022
02:24:58,760 --> 02:25:01,160
should implement

2023
02:25:10,600 --> 02:25:12,000
user interface.

2024
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:15,360
Okay.

2025
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:17,600
I was in last topic.

2026
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:18,240
No you should.

2027
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:20,280
You should know I interfaces already.

2028
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:26,080
Right guys?

2029
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:29,760
So my question is how do you create
an object of that interface?

2030
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:30,480
Guess

2031
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,640
new item later.

2032
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:56,160
Okay.

2033
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:56,960
Okay guys.

2034
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:01,400
So you can't create an object
of the interface right.

2035
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:05,280
If you want to create
an object of the interface, it should.

2036
02:26:05,320 --> 02:26:08,520
It cannot be directly right.

2037
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:13,040
So it's either
you're referring to a different class so

2038
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:18,680
that you can get an object or you cannot
create an object of that interface.

2039
02:26:19,480 --> 02:26:25,360
So. So right now
what I am going to do in here,

2040
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:27,840
so I need to

2041
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:31,400
iterate
through through the options, right?

2042
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:35,320
So what I'm going to do options dot

2043
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:38,480
iterator in here

2044
02:26:38,480 --> 02:26:41,160
and what I am getting in return,

2045
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:45,240
I'm getting an iterator in return, right?

2046
02:26:45,240 --> 02:26:47,320
So I iterator

2047
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:54,840
the web elements do

2048
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:58,560
it is equal to options that I the writer.

2049
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,760
And then now
what am I going to do in here guys?

2050
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:06,600
So I have my iterator,
I have my list of options.

2051
02:27:06,840 --> 02:27:10,720
So what are we doing?

2052
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:14,160
So now we need a wild loop, right?

2053
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:18,520
So while what am I having in my condition?

2054
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:29,960
Guys, while
there should be something going on, right?

2055
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:32,960
While I'm stuck in ahead

2056
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:37,520
and there is something,
I'm going to go inside this loop.

2057
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:38,200
Right.

2058
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:42,520
So while it has something on my next step,

2059
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:46,320
only then what I'm going to do
I'm going to go inside.

2060
02:27:47,200 --> 02:27:47,720
Right?

2061
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:50,080
So if I go inside this loop,

2062
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:53,160
what do I need to do, guys,

2063
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:57,000
I want to print each and
every option again from that,

2064
02:27:57,960 --> 02:27:58,400
from that

2065
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:03,840
dropdown guys.

2066
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:04,200
Okay?

2067
02:28:04,200 --> 02:28:09,200
So any time I step inside this loop,

2068
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:12,960
I need to find web element first, right?

2069
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:14,600
So what?

2070
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:16,880
This is going to be

2071
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:21,120
my dropdown option, right?

2072
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:25,560
Is going to be equal my next step.

2073
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:28,680
Any time I step in that,

2074
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:33,000
I step inside this wild loop,
I need to get the next element

2075
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:36,080
and once I have that element,

2076
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:39,480
I can get the text of it right.

2077
02:28:39,800 --> 02:28:43,560
So option text is equal to

2078
02:28:44,760 --> 02:28:50,600
drop down option that that text, right?

2079
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:53,240
And then we simply

2080
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:56,720
print those options out.

2081
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:59,720
Okay, So let's run this and see.

2082
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:15,720
We can see all the options in our console.

2083
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:16,560
Okay.

2084
02:29:16,840 --> 02:29:19,560
Step back and see here. There we go.

2085
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:22,720
So we see all the departments

2086
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:25,560
inside our console, right?

2087
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:26,600
So pretty cool.

2088
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:29,280
So we did all the ways, right?

2089
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:33,360
So we did for regular for loop
advanced for loop guys.

2090
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:38,400
Now we did it with iterator
or interacted with different different

2091
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:42,600
elements and options

2092
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:47,560
in the dropdown.

2093
02:29:47,560 --> 02:29:51,480
Okay guys,
one more time going over this, right?

2094
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:56,640
So okay, line 24,
everyone knows it's not multiple select

2095
02:29:56,640 --> 02:30:00,800
only then we're going inside the line
25th, right?

2096
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:03,920
So in line 25, what I'm doing, I'm

2097
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:07,200
getting two options,
storing them inside the list container.

2098
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,120
And then

2099
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:14,160
from there guys, what I need to do,
I need to iterate

2100
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:18,840
right through each and every element
that I have inside that container.

2101
02:30:19,080 --> 02:30:22,000
But this time
I'm not going to use for loop.

2102
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,520
I'm using the iterator. Okay?

2103
02:30:24,880 --> 02:30:28,320
So when I use this method of iterator,

2104
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:32,440
it will return me the iterator of the web
elements.

2105
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:33,960
Okay.

2106
02:30:33,960 --> 02:30:37,240
It's like doing this list of web elements,

2107
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:40,920
but this time it's an iterator of web
elements.

2108
02:30:41,080 --> 02:30:44,320
Okay?
And we have a variable for it. So now

2109
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,120
here, I'm not using it for loop,

2110
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:51,080
I'm using a while loop
where it requires us

2111
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:54,320
to have a condition inside.

2112
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:54,960
Right.

2113
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:57,240
So here,

2114
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:02,160
when I'm iterating,
whenever I'm stepping forward,

2115
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:05,880
if I have anything, if it's not empty

2116
02:31:05,880 --> 02:31:11,280
or if it's not null
or I have any values when I step forward,

2117
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:15,720
only then what I'm doing I'm
going inside the line 28.

2118
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:16,840
Okay?

2119
02:31:16,840 --> 02:31:24,280
And when I go to the line 28, my next step
is going to return web element.

2120
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:26,800
Okay, Why web element?

2121
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:29,960
Because I have an iterator of web
elements.

2122
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:31,400
Okay.

2123
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:35,440
And once get my single web element in here

2124
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:40,720
on line 29, I can simply get the text
from that Web element

2125
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:44,920
and I can print that option
out inside my console.

2126
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:46,000
Okay.

2127
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:49,400
Is that clear, guys?

2128
02:31:49,400 --> 02:32:00,600
Any questions?

2129
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:02,080
Okay. But

2130
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:03,520
all right,

2131
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:07,520
guys, any questions at all from dropdowns,
from whatever

2132
02:32:07,520 --> 02:32:21,800
we've done so far in selenium, guys? Yep.

2133
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:25,320
You just need practice. That's good.

2134
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:28,240
And I'm going to give you
a couple of tasks.

2135
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:31,160
Okay.

2136
02:32:31,160 --> 02:32:34,400
So a couple of homeworks for you guys.

2137
02:32:34,400 --> 02:32:36,920
So this is going to be really good tests
in here.

2138
02:32:37,480 --> 02:32:38,320
Okay.

2139
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:41,240
So let me check

2140
02:32:41,240 --> 02:32:55,560
what I have for you.

2141
02:32:55,560 --> 02:33:08,520
Okay?

Okay, Go.

2189
02:35:41,480 --> 02:35:43,920
Okay, let's go to eBay in here.

2190
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:47,120
So from all categories in here,

2191
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:51,240
what I want you to select
was that in here,

2192
02:35:51,480 --> 02:35:54,040
computer tables and network in

2193
02:35:55,880 --> 02:35:58,400
tablets, tables,

2194
02:35:58,400 --> 02:36:01,560
computer tablets,
networking selected from here.

2195
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:04,920
Okay, click

2196
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:07,680
on search and verified the header.

2197
02:36:07,920 --> 02:36:10,680
So I click the wrong thing.

2198
02:36:11,720 --> 02:36:13,800
Okay, Let's go back

2199
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:17,280
all categories, computers, tablets.

2200
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:20,160
Right. And now click on select.

2201
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:23,480
And actually I'm in search.

2202
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:27,120
Okay, So when you search,
what I want you to do, guys,

2203
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:32,240
I want you to verify
this header appear in here.

2204
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:32,680
Okay?

2205
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:38,600
Is that clear, guys?

2206
02:36:38,600 --> 02:36:40,080
Okay, good.

2207
02:36:40,160 --> 02:36:40,640
All right.

2208
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:44,160
Three pretty good tasks

2209
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:47,920
which will allow you guys
to do a lot of different

2210
02:36:48,240 --> 02:36:52,360
manipulations
and interactions with the elements.

2211
02:36:53,560 --> 02:36:59,880
Okay.

2212
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:02,240
Yes, I can post this in the

2213
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:08,960
course announcements.

2214
02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:20,240
See that?

2215
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:26,320
Okay, guys.

2216
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:27,480
Yes, I'll push the card.

2217
02:37:27,480 --> 02:37:28,880
But before we wrap up.

2218
02:37:28,880 --> 02:37:31,560
Okay, guys, so I have a question for you.

2219
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:36,120
So in the element, Web element commands
guys that we have covered

2220
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:39,000
last class, right.

2221
02:37:39,320 --> 02:37:42,480
So there was three different
methods is is displayed

2222
02:37:42,480 --> 02:37:45,200
is enabled and is selected.

2223
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:46,160
Right.

2224
02:37:46,160 --> 02:37:49,960
So if I want to see that the element is
enabled,

2225
02:37:50,400 --> 02:37:53,760
I'm going to do is enabled, right?

2226
02:37:54,040 --> 02:37:58,640
What if I want to verify
that the element is not enabled?

2227
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:00,240
How can I do this?

2228
02:38:00,240 --> 02:38:17,760
Guys,

2229
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:20,800
we have is disabled guys

2230
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:32,880
wouldn't be easier to use.

2231
02:38:32,880 --> 02:38:39,280
Yeah, right.

2232
02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:45,400
Is disabled
would be really convenient if it existed.

2233
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:46,080
Right.

2234
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:48,520
So it doesn't exist guys.

2235
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:49,800
So the first

2236
02:38:52,200 --> 02:38:53,040
the first option

2237
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:55,480
that you guys had, the solution
that you put.

2238
02:38:56,040 --> 02:38:56,840
Yeah.

2239
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:01,680
The solution that you put first
with the exclamation

2240
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:05,600
guys that is the correct way
of identifying that.

2241
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:08,640
The element is this if it's disabled,

2242
02:39:09,080 --> 02:39:11,640
okay there's no option is

2243
02:39:12,680 --> 02:39:13,480
in selenium.

2244
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:18,120
So that's why you have to report
that with an exclamation mark.

2245
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:19,480
Okay guys.

2246
02:39:19,480 --> 02:39:22,560
So be careful of these kind of questions
this is

2247
02:39:24,360 --> 02:39:27,320
this might be one of the interview
questions that you may get.

2248
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:36,840
Okay.

2249
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:39,240
And we will be going over more

2250
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:42,240
more interview questions,

2251
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:50,360
guys.

2252
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:54,360
The question was, if you want to identify
if you want to verify the

2253
02:39:55,920 --> 02:39:58,880
element is disabled, what you want to use,

2254
02:39:59,880 --> 02:40:05,040
what you can use, well,
that would interact with.

2255
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:09,760
And so then what would be the most part
of Java that would interact with Selenium?

2256
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:13,320
All of it. Okay.

2257
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:16,800
So the Java that you're learning right
now, it's going

2258
02:40:17,360 --> 02:40:19,800
you're going to have all of it in,

2259
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:24,040
in building the framework.

2260
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:27,640
It's not only finding elements
and performing actions, okay?

2261
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:32,760
It's maintaining your framework,
it's reusing this.

2262
02:40:32,760 --> 02:40:34,880
It's not hard coding. Okay.

2263
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:39,640
So all all the Java that you're learning
right now, it's going to be very,

2264
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:43,520
very useful in building the frameworks.

2265
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,400
Okay.

2266
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:48,360
All right, guys.

2267
02:40:49,240 --> 02:40:52,000
If no other questions, then what we can do

2268
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:55,600
can wrap it up for today. Okay.

2269
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:57,520
And I will see you tomorrow.

2270
02:40:57,520 --> 02:41:03,240
And please for tomorrow, guys,
take a look at the pop

2271
02:41:03,240 --> 02:41:15,120
ups and iframes.

2272
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:16,600
All right, guys, have a good night.

2273
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:17,680
Everyone.

2274
02:41:18,360 --> 02:41:21,360
Please make sure you practice
and I will you tomorrow.

2275
02:41:23,160 --> 02:41:27,720
Thanks, everybody. Bye.
